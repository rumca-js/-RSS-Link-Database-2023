  <p id="jImDY5">Apple is heavily rumored to reveal its long-awaited mixed reality headset in just a couple of months, but that reveal seems to be arriving at a time when demand for high-end VR is actually quite low. </p>
<p id="Y5nEdc">According to a new blog post from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, some of the biggest recent bets in VR <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/some-critical-updates-on-the-sales-shipments-of-ar-vr-headset-devices-%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%9B%E9%97%9C%E6%96%BCar-vr%E9%A0%AD%E6%88%B4%E8%A3%9D%E7%BD%AE%E7%9A%84%E9%8A%B7%E5%94%AE-%E5%87%BA%E8%B2%A8%E9%97%9C%E9%8D%B5%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0-64ca8c2b44b">have largely flopped</a>. Kuo reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="hX0vdT">Sony has cut its 2023 production plan for the PS VR2 by about 20 percent.</p>
<p id="vknYKO">The product lifecycle shipment for Meta’s Quest Pro is only around 300,000 units.</p>
<p id="v70LVX">Pico (China’s largest AR/VR headset brand) shipments in 2022 were more than 40 percent lower than expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sy72xU">In other words, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality">impressive PSVR 2</a> hasn’t been as popular as Sony may have hoped, Meta Quest Pro sales barely scratch the surface of the Quest...</p>

  <p id="nWC4Wy">Several law enforcement agencies have teamed up to take down Genesis Market, a website selling access to “over 80 million account access credentials,” which included the standard usernames and passwords, as well as much more dangerous data like session tokens. According to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-marketplace-disrupted-international-cyber-operation">press release from the US Department of Justice</a>, the site was seized on Tuesday. The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (or Europol) <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/takedown-of-notorious-hacker-marketplace-selling-your-identity-to-criminals">says</a> that 119 of the site's users have been arrested. </p>
<p id="uymdDA">Genesis Marketplace has been around since 2018, according to the Department of Justice, and was “one of the most prolific initial access brokers (IABs) in the cybercrime world.” It let hackers search for certain types of credentials, such as ones for social media...</p>

More than just a restart of the story campaign, the update adds new sets of armor that can be equipped to modify your combat experience to make the game more challenging.</p>
<p id="xzk3ip">New Game Plus starts you off with all your weapons, armors, and enchantments but with a slight catch: you can’t access areas with the Hex or Sonic arrows or the Draupnir spear before reaching the part in the story where those weapons would be unlocked. It’s a bit of a bummer because there was no way in Helheim I could be bothered to go back to any of those areas once I got the necessary equipment. It, therefore, would have been really nice to be able to unlock those areas as I progressed...</p>

  <p id="m3tqLg">The <em>Street Fighter</em> franchise is getting a new movie. Capcom announced on Wednesday that it’s working on the film in partnership with Legendary Entertainment, with “more news to come in the future” <a href="https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1643660498150227977">about the project</a>.</p>
<p id="MfPpKb">The new film isn’t a total surprise. On April 3rd, <em>The Hollywood Reporter </em>reported that Legendary <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-tv-rights-legendary-1235365168/">acquired the film and TV rights to the series</a>. But now we officially know there’s a new movie to look forward to at some point down the line. And while you wait, you might want to catch up on the other <em>Street Fighter</em> movies that have come out: the famous <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">“but for me, it was Tuesday” meme</a> was spoken by Raúl Juliá’s M. Bison <a href="https://youtu.be/sjZ5I8l32CI">in the 1994 <em>Street Fighter</em> film</a>, for example, and there was a Chun-Li-focused movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter:_The_Legend_of_Chun-Li">released in 2009</a>.</p>

  <p id="yZPi13">Google is introducing a new Play Store rule that will require apps to have a “readily discoverable option” for deleting your account, both in the app itself and on the web. In <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/04/giving-people-more-control-over-their-data.html">a blog post on Wednesday</a>, the company says the change is meant to give users “greater clarity and control over their in-app data.” </p>
<p id="mmidHW">The rule will apply to apps that let you create an account, and Google is trying to make sure that users won’t have to redownload an app because they deleted it before requesting that their account also be deleted. The company plans to add a field to the Google Play Store that will link users to the web address for account deletion.</p>

  <p id="jGVth1">Substack is getting a new tweet-like feature called “Notes,” the company announced on Wednesday. The feature will let users publish small posts about things like “posts, quotes, comments, images, and links,” according to <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/on/p/introducing-notes?r=1ie15&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">a blog post</a> from Substack co-founders Chris Best, Hamish McKenzie, and Jairaj Sethi.</p>
<p id="PbkzmV">Notes<strong> </strong>appear in their own dedicated tab, and the feed looks pretty similar to what you might see on Twitter or other social media platforms. On individual posts, for example, you can see familiar icons for likes, replies, and reshares (which Substack will be calling “restacks”). We asked if there is a character limit for Notes, but Substack spokesperson Helen Tobin declined to share details about that.</p>
<p id="4aZxCY">The Notes tab also has two feeds...</p>

There was something about its cartoonish take on warfare that made it feel like you were playing a tabletop game, moving little pieces around a board, and its small scale was a perfect fit for playing on the go. <em>Advance Wars</em> is also one of those Nintendo franchises that’s been largely dormant for a long time — and it turns out, I really missed it.</p>

  <p id="WOBiph">A new report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-handheld/">Tom Henderson at <em>Insider Gaming</em></a><em> </em>claims Sony is developing a new PlayStation gaming handheld.

The more restrictive block option is currently being rolled out. “We have started making the feature available to some of our Canary users and will continue to make it available to more customers over the coming weeks,” says...</p>

  <p id="R0G93y">Kobo is bringing its Kobo Plus service, which lets you read unlimited ebooks and audiobooks for a flat monthly fee, to the US. There are three different plans available; for $7.99 a month, you can get access to ebooks <em>or</em> audiobooks with the “Read” and “Listen” plans, or you can get both for $9.99 a month. </p>
<p id="ES6Amu">You can access the books through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23542918/kobo-clara-2e-ereader-review-amazon-kindle">Kobo’s e-readers</a> (though do note that not all of them support audiobooks) or the company’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/kobo-books/id301259483">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kobobooks.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fapps&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F4%2F5%2F23669736%2Fkobo-plus-unlimited-ebook-audiobook-us-launch-kindle-unlimited" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">desktop apps</a>.
