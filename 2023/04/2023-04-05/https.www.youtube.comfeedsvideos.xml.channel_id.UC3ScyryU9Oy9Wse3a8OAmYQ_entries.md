Drawing on 20 years of on-the-ground reporting and revealing new interviews with both U.S. and Taliban officials, award-winning producers Marcela Gaviria and Martin Smith chronicle how what began in the wake of the 9/11 attacks as an effort to eliminate Al Qaeda and oust its ruling ally, the Taliban, became America’s longest war with nearly 50,000 Afghan civilians dead, approximately 2,400 American service members killed — and how it ended in defeat in August 2021 with U.S. troops withdrawing, the Western-backed Afghan government collapsing, and the Taliban once again in control.

“For all the lives and money spent, over two trillion dollars, Afghanistan has regressed to what it was before America invaded, a country where women are denied an education, music is banned, beards for men are mandatory and homosexuality is punishable by death,” says Smith, who has been covering Afghanistan and the Middle East for FRONTLINE for two decades. “Our new series traces the mistakes, miscalculations and hubris that allowed this to happen.”

Watch Part One now. Parts Two and Three premiere April 11 and 25.
