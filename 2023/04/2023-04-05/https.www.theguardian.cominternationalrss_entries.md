<p>England and Scotland are experiencing a tick-borne virus outbreak. We don’t know the causes, but we know rising temperatures will mean more of them</p><p>Where I’m from, you can’t be considered a responsible outdoor person unless you’re willing to inspect your father’s naked body for ticks. Nova Scotia, on the east coast of Canada, has the dubious honour of being among the tick-iest place in the world. Surely these things are hard to measure, but reputable scientists claim it has the <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8841547/nova-scotia-highest-tick-to-human-ratio/">highest tick-to-person ratio</a> in the country, and, at about <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease-surveillance-report-2019.html">one case of Lyme disease for every 1,000 residents </a>per year, the highest incidence of Lyme disease as well. Walking outside on anything besides cut grass or concrete is likely to yield multiple tiny, near-indestructible arachnids that immediately make an upward dash for a warm crevice at the knee, armpit or often, groin, to burrow into. Finding and removing them can require a mirror and some contortions, or a helpful and unsqueamish friend or family member.</p><p>Things are – thankfully – not quite so bad in the UK.

The first suspected incidence of the disease in the UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/29/tick-borne-encephalitis-found-uk-first-time">was in 2019</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/31/uk-lyme-disease-cases-may-be-three-times-higher-than-estimated">cases of Lyme disease</a> also appear to be increasing over the past few years.</p><p>Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/05/canada-ticks-uk-climate-change">Continue reading...</a>

## Shy by Max Porter review – lyrical study of troubled youth

<p>The author’s fourth book is a loving portrait of a teenage boy at a young offenders’ institution</p><p>The year is 1995 and Shy is a 16-year-old boy toting an impressive CV of delinquencies. “He’s sprayed, snorted, smoked, sworn, stolen, cut, punched, run, jumped, crashed an Escort, smashed up a shop, trashed a house, broken a nose, stabbed his stepdad’s finger.” He’s been “expelled from two schools. First caution in 1992 aged thirteen.” He has alienated his mother. He loves only drum’n’bass and jungle. He is now a pupil at the Last Chance boarding school, described in a well-meaning documentary film as an “unconventional” institution for the rehabilitation of “some of the most disturbed and violent young offenders in the country”, and described by Shy as “a shite old mansion converted into a school for badly behaved boys in the middle of bumblefuck nowhere”.</p><p>When the novel opens, Shy is sneaking out of school at 3am with a rucksack full of rocks on his back. He is heading for the school duck pond. The rucksack will weigh him down. Last Chance indeed. Shy’s trip to the pond is also the story of his life. His inner monologue ducks and dives, summoning memories, smashing together disparate linguistic registers: family arguments, therapeutic exercises, the virtuoso improvs of drum’n’bass MCs, the macho nonsense of teenage boys. “The night,” for Shy, “is a shattered flicker-drag of these sensejumbled memories.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/05/shy-by-max-porter-review-lyrical-study-of-troubled-youth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Outstanding new composers and genre-hopping experiments are not the sole reasons the Iceland Symphony Orchestra’s UK tour is so anticipated – the country itself is a seed bed for musical talent</p><p>On 31 May 1926, a ship carrying the entire Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra docked in Reykjavík. The musicians stayed in Iceland for 17 days, giving 14 concerts of music by Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert at venues including a tuberculosis sanatorium. Local critic Árni Thorsteinson described the visit as “the greatest event in the history of the arts in this country.” While the rest of Europe was falling for cinema, Icelanders were getting their first taste of a full-size live symphony orchestra.</p><p>Organised instrumental music making came late to Iceland, hardly surprising in a country that still has to import everything except electricity and fish. Today, the nation’s musical life has to be seen – and preferably heard – to be believed. Increasingly, Iceland’s genre-blind musicians channel the challenges of living on a forbidding chunk of volcanic rock into the creation of progressive music that gives the impression of having resounded for ever. Icelanders cleave to homegrown acts, with a quarter of Top 10-charting music on Spotify made domestically, but the rest of the world appears to love those acts too. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/bjork">Björk</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sigur-ros">Sigur Rós</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/09/olafur-arnalds-producer-drummer-interview">Ólafur Arnalds</a> are some of the best-known names to have found global success with highly distinctive music; every month, more than 19 times Iceland’s entire population streams a track by the Reykjavík band <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/12/of-monsters-men-mossman-interview">Of Monsters and Men</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/05/iceland-classical-music-symphony-orchestra-uk-tour">Continue reading...</a>
