Big Bang Theory was a force to be reckoned with when it was at it's peak on CBS.   Though not all of Big Bang's characters got the same treatment when it comes to meaningful story telling.  Raj Koothrappali was the one main character on Big Bang Theory that seemed to be more caricature than real person.  Even when finally given a meaningful story line, the writers were quick to course correct and undo everything they had built.
