<p>Late last week, Western Digital reported a hack of its systems, prompting the company to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681254/western-digitals-my-cloud-goes-down-after-hack.html">pull its services offline</a>&mdash;including its My Cloud backup and file access service. First disclosed on April 3, the outage began on April 2, as reported on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://status.mycloud.com/os4&amp;xcust=2-1-1684372-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">WD My Cloud status page</a>. As of April 5, customers have still not received further clarification on when to expect restored access to their data.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve been hit by this service disruption, you&rsquo;re likely riding it out in one of two ways: frustratingly cut off from your files, or temporarily inconvenienced because your data isn&rsquo;t readily available in the cloud. The difference? In the first scenario, My Cloud&rsquo;s your only location for your data. In the second, you were following the rule of three.</p>



<p>Your data needs backups&mdash;and when you make them, more than one copy should exist. Enter the rule of three: Your data isn&rsquo;t safe unless there are three copies. The PCWorld staff talks about this rule a lot in our articles about backups, and for good reason. Disaster can hit at unexpected and inopportune times, be it natural (e.g., hurricane) or man-made (hard drive death, cloud service outage).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Woman using a computer with a backup drive attached" class="wp-image-1684383" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/andrew-neel-ute2XAFQU2I-unsplash-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>That lone hard drive isn&rsquo;t enough on its own as a backup solution. She&rsquo;ll need a second backup, too&mdash;and preferably off-site.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Andrew Neel / Unsplash</p></div>



<p>The full version of this guideline is &ldquo;3-2-1&rdquo;: You have three copies of the data, with two available on-site (and on two different devices) and one available off-site (a spare hard drive saved at a trusted person&rsquo;s home, or the cloud). It&rsquo;s why our staff publishes lists of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">recommended external drives</a> for backups, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">automated backup software</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html">cloud backup services</a>. The unfortunate reality is that your data can become unavailable at any moment, and as this situation with WD My Cloud shows, through no fault of your own. At minimum, you should follow this rule for your mission critical data. It&rsquo;s important protect yourself, even when you&rsquo;re short on time or money.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, this situation is rough. I feel for everyone who&rsquo;s stuck wondering when they&rsquo;ll get access to their data again. I&rsquo;m positive too that the teams at Western Digital are working hard to get back online as fast as they can. But it can be a slow process, and while you wait, you should prepare (if you haven&rsquo;t already) and be ready for the next time this happens. That&rsquo;s no slur on WD&mdash;hacks are all too common these days. The question is not if another data breach will happen, but when. You need to be ready.</p>

## Google Drive reverses course on its sudden, secret file cap

<p>Turns out Google imposes a hard limit on the number of files you can upload to Google Drive, its cloud storage service&mdash;despite a lack of clear documentation that outlines the restrictions. That magic number? Five million.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Update, 4/5/23:</strong> Google is removing the file count limit for Drive accounts. In a tweet on the Google Drive Twitter account, the company says that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/googledrive/status/1643049029251776515?s=20&amp;xcust=2-3-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">it has reversed its policy</a> while seeking other ways to improve performance for the service. The Google Drive team has also promised <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/googledrive/status/1643049396207009792?s=20&amp;xcust=2-3-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">to inform users in advance</a> about changes to accounts. Our original story follows below.</p></blockquote>



<p>This hidden count only became apparent when users started running into it. As <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/123fjx8/google_has_applied_a_5_million_items_limit_for/&amp;xcust=2-3-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">reported on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/google-drive-has-a-5-million-item-cap-even-if-you-have-storage-space-left/&amp;xcust=2-3-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">shared by CNET</a>, users discovered this cap the hard way in February. In a post on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/268606830?pli=1&amp;xcust=2-3-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google&rsquo;s IssueTracker</a>, both individuals and businesses noted that uploads had stopped working on their accounts, but without a clear explanation for the failures, leaving users confused while scrambling to deal with broken automated integrations and backup systems. Upgrading the account to a higher amount of storage also did not fix the problem.</p>



<p>In early March, Google&rsquo;s customer service agents revealed the hard ceiling in individual replies to account holders, stating they could not exceed 5 million documents&mdash;even when the total storage used was under the plan&rsquo;s limits. A Google Workspace spokesperson confirmed this policy in a statement to CNET, saying individual users were limited to 5 million total created items to &ldquo;maintain strong performance and reliability.&rdquo; However, the rollout of this limitation appears to be inconsistent, with others on the IssueTracker thread hitting the restriction at the 1 million mark. If you&rsquo;ve encountered Error 403 (&ldquo;The limit for the number of items, whether trashed or not, created by this account has been exceeded&rdquo;), you may have tripped into this issue.</p>



<p>Mention of this restriction on file count remains missing from Google&rsquo;s documentation, too. At the time of this article, only a help page covering <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/37603?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-3-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">individual file limitations</a> (with surprisingly fine detail) exists. Meanwhile, shared drive accounts have their file limits <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/7338880?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-3-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">clearly listed as a maximum of 400,000</a>, and competitor Dropbox has <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.dropbox.com/storage-space/file-storage-limit&amp;xcust=2-3-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">no limitations on the number of files uploaded</a>; same for Box, which the company confirmed to CNET.</p>



<p>Affected users now face a hard decision: Switch accounts (either to a rival service or within Google), or begin deleting files. Neither task will be simple for those part of wide organizations (one person described this limitation affecting &ldquo;tens of thousands&rdquo; affiliated with their org) and folks who had used their accounts for cloud backups. Backup software can create multiple small files as part of incremental backups, which can add up over time&mdash;as was the case for the Redditor who alerted <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/google/&amp;xcust=2-3-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">r/Google</a> to this issue.</p>



<p>In response, other Redditors pointed out a temporary workaround&mdash;adding all documents to a few zip files. (Never change, Reddit.)</p>

## Glasses-free 3D screens might finally be ready for prime time

<p>Remember years ago when they tried really hard to make 3D TVs a thing? Remember when everyone hated it because you had to wear cumbersome glasses? Remember when they tried to make 3D screens without the glasses, and that flopped harder than a <em>Sound of Music</em> remake starring Steven Seagal? Well forget all that, if you can even remember what I was talking about: Acer&rsquo;s latest Predator laptop with a glasses-free 3D screen might just nail it. Gordon goes hands-on (and eyes-on) on the PCWorld YouTube channel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>At GDC 2023, Gordon Mah Ung got a chance to try out the latest in screen tech built into <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1731530-REG/acer_ph315_55s_90k9_15_6_predator_helios_300.html?BI=21883&amp;KBID=28249" rel="nofollow">Acer&rsquo;s Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition gaming laptop</a>. Acer&rsquo;s system has a couple of advantages over &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo; glasses-free 3D, achieved with a lenticular screen showing two images at once. The laptop&rsquo;s integrated cameras track your eyes and adjust the picture accordingly, and the high-quality 4K screen (essentially 2K for each eye) blows previous attempts out of the water. </p>



<p>But whither developer support? Acer&rsquo;s got that covered, too. Acer is adding support for the system itself, and has already gotten 70 of the top PC games onboard, and they&rsquo;re working on more. Getting to see this tech yourself might cost a bit, though &mdash; the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1731530-REG/acer_ph315_55s_90k9_15_6_predator_helios_300.html?BI=21883&amp;KBID=28249" rel="nofollow">laptop is $3500</a>, and the 15.6-inch screen alone (repackaged into a standard monitor with eye tracking) is $1100. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll get a lot more accessible in a newer generation.

<p>NovaBackup efficiently combines file backup, drive imaging, and online storage into one convenient package. It even offers continual data protection as granular as every minute. However, once you go beyond the &ldquo;free&rdquo; 5GB limit, online storage gets expensive in a hurry.  </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>See our roundups of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">best Windows backup</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html">best cloud backup services</a> to learn about competing products.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="novabackup-features-and-interface">NovaBackup features and interface</h2>



<p>The NovaBackup interface is efficient and well laid out, if a bit old-school in appearance. I do wish that imaging didn&rsquo;t require launching a separate module, but that&rsquo;s being picky. On the other hand, I love that NovaBackup supports creating Microsoft VHD and VHDX images. These formats can be opened and browsed using only Windows itself should you ever not have NovaBackup handy. </p>



<p>On the other hand, they lack some features available if you use NovaBackup&rsquo;s own proprietary image format, such as incremental (all changes since the last backup) and differential (all changes since the original backup), and compressed images to save space. In general, I tend to use imaging for complete (full) backups and file/folder backup for incremental changes&mdash;but people&rsquo;s tastes will vary.</p>



<p>As mentioned, NovaBackup supports both file/folder-level backup to container files as well as imaging of drives and partitions. It also has a handy plain-file (no container file is created) Copy function if all you want to do is quickly duplicate some data to another location.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1673152" height="819" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/novabackup-4.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>NovaBackup&rsquo;s separate imaging module.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you utilize NovaBackup&rsquo;s online storage, you can select that as a destination, though you can&rsquo;t select both local and online targets for the same job. In that case, as with many programs, you simply duplicate the job and choose a different destination.</p>



<p>NovaBackup has far more options than the average user needs, showing its current IT bent. The short list includes: extremely precise filtering of files (wild cards, attributes, date, etc.), log printing and email notifications, blowfish and various levels of AES encryption, network credentials, as well as before and after run commands.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s also scheduling with the ability to run the backup as any user. You may also set a maximum run time for a job so it won&rsquo;t compete with other tasks, though that&rsquo;s not likely an option the average user will need.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>I love that NovaBackup supports creating Microsoft VHD and VHDX images. These formats can be opened and browsed using only Windows itself should you ever not have NovaBackup handy. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>NovaBackup will also create a boot disc for disaster recovery, should that dire circumstance bite you. This is a much more straightforward process than it was last year when I first tested NovaBackup PC and you were required to visit Microsoft to download additional files. Now no such visit is required.</p>



<p>Note that NovaBackup doesn&rsquo;t give you the option of where to save the boot disc if you choose to create an ISO, instead burying it in its section of the ProgramData folder. Tip: Copy the location shown in the text field after creation, paste it into Windows Explorer, and copy the ISO image to a more common location. </p>



<h2 id="how-much-does-novabackup-cost">How much does NovaBackup cost?</h2>



<p>The pricing you see in the first image below seems fairly reasonable. However, 5GB is what you get for free from services such as Dropbox, Google, and Sync.com. Above 5GB, things get pricey in a hurry.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1532982" height="786" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/novabackup-10.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This screen capture makes NovaBackup  seem reasonably priced. The one below does not. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>That is indeed our main issue with NovaBackup from a home-user/consumer perspective: 50GB of space is $99.95, 100GB is $169.95, 250GB is $349.95, 500GB is $649.95, and 1TB is a whopping $1,249.95 yearly. By way of comparison, Microsoft&rsquo;s OneDrive costs me $70 for 1TB per year and I get a full version of Microsoft Office to boot.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1532984" height="664" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/novabackup.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Where NovaBackup quickly gets expensive is  in additional cloud storage.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="novabackup-performance">NovaBackup performance</h2>



<p>I have had some issues with NovaBackup in the past. When I first looked at it a few months ago, image backups continually failed about 95 percent into the process. NovaStor sent me a beta that apparently corrected that issue.  </p>



<p>Note also that I was informed there are several other backup programs that NovaBackup doesn&rsquo;t coexist with politely&mdash;Paragon Backup &amp; Recovery being one, and as I later found out, Arcsoft&rsquo;s ShadowProtect SPX. Not many users will have multiple backup programs with background threads or schedulers running, but if you&rsquo;re in this minority, skip NovaBackup.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this latest iteration of NovaBackup PC was fast and largely reliable. I did get one file-system read error during a backup, but hitting <em>Continue</em> allowed the operation to complete. Both local and online file backups were fast and smooth, as was the plain-file copy function. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read my other backup software reviews, you know I&rsquo;m a big believer in glitch-free interfaces and performance. Such impenatribility gives you that peace of mind, that yes, the programmers are on the ball and your backup will actually restore properly if and when that&rsquo;s required. I can&rsquo;t say that NovaBackup PC currently gives me that 100 percent bulletproof feeling. It may well be, but&hellip;</p>



<p>On the other hand, NovaBackup PC&rsquo;s improvement from last year give me the feeling that programmers are diligently working to soon provide that super-secure feeling.</p>

<p>AMD&rsquo;s naming scheme for Ryzen mobile processors used to be a little confusing, with Ryzen X000 indicating design generations and Ryzen 3/5/7/9 indicating tiers of performance within a generation. But that&rsquo;s at least analogous to Intel&rsquo;s setup Core iX-XX00 naming scheme. With the Ryzen 7000 series, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445760/amds-mobile-ryzen-naming-scheme-is-stupidly-complex.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">things are getting &ldquo;ridiculously complex&rdquo;</a> and a bit misleading, as AMD has slipped low-end chips into the Ryzen 7000 family that are running on older Zen 2, Zen 3, and Zen 3+ APU architecture, rather than the newer and much more powerful Zen 4. </p>



<p>We were already aware of some of these naming issues for the new laptop chips. Today AMD has shown off how these differences will look in its livery &mdash; which is a fancy way of saying the little AMD stickers on laptops will be different. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-says-look-for-the-orange-sticker-if-you-want-zen4-mobile-cpu&amp;xcust=2-3-1683951-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VideoCardz reports</a>, based on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://library.amd.com/media/?mediaId=0560916D-BD05-4F18-B74C724D6EDCF9C9&amp;viewType=grid&amp;xcust=2-3-1683951-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">official AMD partner materials</a>, that Ryzen 7000-based laptops with Zen 4 APUs will get a newer sticker with logos on an orange background, while APUs based on older processor generations will be sticking with the same mostly grey Ryzen stickers we&rsquo;ve been seeing for the last few years. They&rsquo;ll come in Ryzen 5/7/9 logos, as applicable. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">The best laptops</a></p></blockquote>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 7000 orange and grey stickers " class="wp-image-1684054" height="648" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/amd-ryzen-7000-orange-sticker-grey-sticker.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>To make it as straightforward as possible, here&rsquo;s the sort of thing you&rsquo;ll be seeing. Note that the third digit in the model number indicates the Zen generation: </p>



<ul><li><strong>Ryzen 7 7045 </strong>&mdash; Zen 4, 16 cores, Orange sticker</li><li><strong>Ryzen 7 7040</strong> &mdash; Zen 4, 8 cores, Orange sticker</li><li><strong>Ryzen 7 7035</strong> &mdash; Zen 3+, 8 cores, Grey sticker</li><li><strong>Ryzen 7 7030</strong> &mdash; Zen 3, 8 cores, Grey sticker </li><li><strong>Ryzen 7 7020 </strong>&mdash; Zen 2, 4 cores Grey sticker </li></ul>



<p>&hellip;And that doesn&rsquo;t even get into further distinctions between the processor&rsquo;s size and power draw: U for low-end or ultra-portable (15-28 watts), HS for mid-range (35-54 watts), and HX for high-end (55 watts or more). It is, to use a somewhat mild term, a headache. </p>



<p>Considering that the differences above can stretch from brand-new Zen 4 APUs that can run even some of the latest high-end PC games, to Zen 2 APU architecture using graphics tech that&rsquo;s now six years old, it&rsquo;s a crucial distinction who wants power and longevity out of their laptop purchase. We don&rsquo;t know exactly what that performance gap looks like before these laptops hit retail shelves, but it&rsquo;s bound to be fairly significant. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing better than a sleek, well-designed laptop with powerful inside components. If you&rsquo;re in the market for such a machine, then you&rsquo;re in luck. The Dell XPS 15 promises strong multimedia and application performance for a reasonable price. <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8200811-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-15-laptop/spd/xps-15-9520-laptop/xn9520ftdeh&amp;sid=2-1-1683869-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Dell&rsquo;s currently selling the XPS 15 for $1,249</a>, which is a massive $650 off of the original $1,899 price. It&rsquo;s premium machine, that&rsquo;s for sure, but the deal really sweetens the honeypot. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s going on inside.</p>



<p>The Dell XPS 15 sports an Intel Core i7-12700H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. It&rsquo;s powerful enough for day-to-day tasks like surfing the web and slinging spreadsheets as well as decent gaming, thanks to the discrete Nvidia GPU. The 15.6-inch display has a resolution of 1920&times;1200, a refresh rate of 60Hz, and a maximum brightness of 500 nits. If 500 nits is indeed accurate, then the display should be super vibrant. It also comes with a backlit keyboard and a fingerprint reader. We&rsquo;ve been humongous fans of the XPS series&rsquo; sleek aesthetic and overall design for generations now, as well&mdash;it&rsquo;s truly cream of the crop.</p>



<p>This a fantastic laptop for, well, anyone. You better scoop it up now, though, as we don&rsquo;t expect a deal this good to last very long.</p>

<p>Among image editors, Adobe Photoshop dominates. Despite the many competitors that have sprung up, it remains popular with professionals and central in the public eye. (We all refer to altered images as &ldquo;photoshopped.&rdquo;)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, this juggernaut comes with a sizable price tag, too&mdash;subscriptions start at $21 USD per month (or a little over $250 per year) for access to the Photoshop apps for desktop and iPad. Over time, the cost adds up.</p>



<p>And yet, few rivals match both the breadth and depth of Photoshop. You may find yourself wondering if you actually need that feature set at your fingertips, or if your needs could be met by a cheaper solution. Let&rsquo;s run through the pros and cons, as well as the alternatives.</p>

<h3 id="tons-of-editing-tools">Tons of editing tools</h3>



<p>Photoshop reigns supreme for a reason&mdash;you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find a single app that packs in the same number of tools. Whether you want to make light touch-ups, radical tweaks, or even video clips, the program handles all that and far more.</p>



<h3 id="wide-file-support">Wide file support</h3>



<p>Opening JPEG, PNG, GIF, and Photoshop Documents is just the tip of the iceberg. You can open and save in many other formats that span audio, video, and graphic files. MP3, MPEG-4, HEIF/HEIC, TIFF, and PDF just a part of the lineup, though some formats are import only and others export only.</p>



<h3 id="so-much-educational-material">So much educational material</h3>

<p>With how popular Photoshop is&mdash;and how deep it goes&mdash;plenty of educational courses and material exists for those seeking to master its features. You can go the old-school route and take actual classes at community colleges, rely on long-established sites like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/photoshop&amp;xcust=2-3-1680257-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn Learning</a>, or learn from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.adobepress.com/store/adobe-photoshop-classroom-in-a-book-2023-release-9780137965892&amp;xcust=2-3-1680257-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">detailed books</a>.

While it&rsquo;s no replacement for Premiere Pro, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to use it to create motion graphics, animation renders, picture in picture effects, and other elements that can stand on their own or be imported into a more full-fledged editor later on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of the Adobe Creative Suite, Photoshop integrates seamlessly with Adobe&rsquo;s other production apps like Lightroom, InDesign, Premiere Pro, and Illustrator. You can easily jump between them to make edits and tweaks to files, thereby applying the right tools for the job at hand. For example, while Photoshop can do light video editing, its tie-in with Premiere Pro lets you switch to a more robust video editor when needed and leave Photoshop for manipulating stills.</p>



<h2 id="cons-of-using-adobe-photoshop">Cons of using Adobe Photoshop</h2>



<h3 id="so-many-editing-tools">So many editing tools</h3>



<p>Adobe&rsquo;s greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. With so many tools available and an interface that requires a moderate learning curve, getting started can be hard. The app also doesn&rsquo;t offer fast, easy fixes for simpler edits&mdash;everything is geared toward doing things manually. A one-button adjustment in another program could require the application of several layers, masks, and opacity tweaks in Photoshop.</p>



<h3 id="system-requirements">System requirements</h3>



<p>Adobe Photoshop&rsquo;s <a href="https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:2-3-1680257-1-0-0/destination:https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/system-requirements.html" rel="nofollow">hardware requirements</a> ask for a faster, more powerful PC compared to some rivals. People running older hardware with slower graphics cards and smaller storage drives will definitely feel the pinch of setting aside 20 to 50GB for working in the program, especially if you have a much older or cheaper laptop with a 256GB or even 512GB SSD.</p>



<h3 id="that-price-and-that-subscription-model">That price (and that subscription model)</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1681439" height="837" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Those who need Photoshop just for photography should consider the Photography plan, rather than just Photoshop&mdash;using Lightroom and Photoshop in combination is much more powerful.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Photoshop isn&rsquo;t cheap. You&rsquo;ll pay $250 per year for just Photoshop, and if you need any other Adobe apps, the costs rise quickly. Should you need more than two apps, the all-inclusive Creative Cloud subscription becomes most cost effective and that plan runs $55 per month or $600 per year. Unless you have access to educational discounts, you may be far better off by paying a one-time fee for an alternative or going with a free option.</p>



<h3 id="installation-limitation">Installation limitation</h3>



<p>Rather than owning copies of the software, you&rsquo;re merely renting access from Adobe and its licenses are fairly strict. You can only install the software on up to two machines, with only one active system at a time. If you bounce between PCs frequently (say, a home computer, a laptop, and a work machine), this can add a layer of logistical juggling that slows your workflow.</p>



<h3 id="software-bugs">Software bugs</h3>



<p>Adobe pushes out releases to Photoshop on a more frequent basis than many other rivals. While these updates often include new features, they can also introduce new bugs and other performance hits. Sometimes the experience can feel akin to two steps forward and three steps back.</p>



<h2 id="alternatives-to-adobe-photoshop">Alternatives to Adobe Photoshop</h2>



<h3 id="adobe-photoshop-elements">Adobe Photoshop Elements</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1681442" height="615" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>This one may sound like cheating, but <a href="https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:2-3-1680257-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-elements.html" rel="nofollow">Photoshop Elements</a> is a separate product from Photoshop. Sold as a one time purchase, this pared-down image editor offers much more hand-holding for basic edits&mdash;e.g., removing elements from the background, portrait touch-ups, and one-click selection of items in an image. Elements is also often on sale for $60 or $70, making it just a quarter of the cost of a one-year Photoshop subscription.</p>



<h3 id="photopea">Photopea</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1681443" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>Are you a returning Photoshop user, but can&rsquo;t stomach the subscription model? <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.photopea.com/&amp;xcust=2-3-1680257-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Photopea</a> is a web-based image editor that&rsquo;s surprisingly robust and, more importantly, it&rsquo;s free, fully accessible without a login, and uses the same keyboard shortcuts as Photoshop. You can pay to kill ads and get an longer history for your edits, but you don&rsquo;t need to.</p>



<h3 id="gimp">Gimp</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1681444" height="680" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-4.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>One of the OG alternatives to Adobe Photoshop, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gimp.org/&amp;xcust=2-3-1680257-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">this free, open-source software</a> can handle quite a bit, despite not asking much of your system resources. If you have the patience to dig in and learn its ins and outs, you can do a lot with this program&mdash;and there are plenty of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gimp&amp;xcust=2-3-1680257-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">YouTube tutorials about Gimp</a> dedicated to helping others get up to speed.</p>



<h3 id="paint-net">Paint.net</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1681452" height="685" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-7.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>For those who find Photoshop and Gimp too intimidating, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://getpaint.net/&amp;xcust=2-3-1680257-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Paint.net</a> offers a middle ground between Windows&rsquo; charmingly elementary Paint app (please never kill it, Microsoft) and something more full-fledged like Photoshop and even Gimp. It&rsquo;s a good way to become familiar with layers and other more powerful tools while not being overwhelmed by endless menu options. The layout is more user friendly than Gimp, too. Oh, and it also costs $0.</p>



<h3 id="affinity-photo">Affinity Photo</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1681455" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-8.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>Photoshop isn&rsquo;t the only full-featured image editor that slots into an overall lineup of content-creation apps. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/&amp;xcust=2-3-1680257-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Affinity Photo</a> is a capable image editor that pairs with Serif Ltd&rsquo;s Affinity Designer (vector graphics software, akin to Adobe Illustrator) and Affinity Publisher (page layout software, akin to Adobe InDesign). And, unlike Adobe, Serif charges just a relatively low one-time fee for its software and sometimes even offers discounts, like during Black Friday.</p>

<p>Small form-factor motherboards have taken on an entirely new life over the last few years. The extraordinary power of modern hardware no longer needs a huge monolithic structure to house it. You also no longer need the treasure reserves of a medieval king to afford one!</p>



<p>Thanks to Mini-ITX motherboards such as the Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, small builds are more widely accessible. Supporting a gamut of powerful Intel CPUs, both 12th- and 13th-gen, you&rsquo;ll have good choices across the board. (<em>Pun intended</em>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the reduced cost is due to the B760 chipset, a scaled-back version of the Intel 13th-gen Z790. While you&rsquo;re getting better pricing, there are some compromises, too. We&rsquo;ll go over the features, design, and performance of this small form-factor motherboard. Does this board strike a satisfying balance of cost savings and access to powerful hardware?

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming Wifi" class="wp-image-1670019" height="693" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-17-at-1.52.08-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi comes in with an MSRP of $219. In the past, Mini-ITX components have often been expensive&mdash;diminutive hardware often <em>adds</em> to the cost. Here we have a nicely featured small form-factor motherboard that still appeals to gamers, with some nice savings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First thing to be aware of is that Mini-ITX motherboards automatically have fewer features and I/O compared to larger Micro-ATX and ATX motherboards. You&rsquo;ll typically have only a single PCIe 16x slot, and fewer NVMe slots, SATA ports, and USB ports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does the Intel B760 chipset do with those restrictions? Feature-wise, it certainly keeps up for most users. Just note that CPU overclocking and overkill VRMs will be for the Z790 realm. Most other users should be more than covered. Again, you&rsquo;ll typically get fewer PCIe lanes and things like SATA ports, but these won&rsquo;t matter as much as on larger motherboards.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The overall attention to detail on the Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi adds to a feeling of quality and enthusiast-grade design.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming Wifi" class="wp-image-1670020" height="771" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-13-at-4.16.16-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Everything included with the Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The unboxing experience is pleasant and simple. You&rsquo;ll get a couple of important items such as the Wi-Fi antenna, SATA cables, and some ROG swag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="cpu-choice">CPU choice</h3>



<p>You&rsquo;ll have support for any of the Intel 12th- and 13th-generation CPUs, ranging from the meekest to the mightiest options. Given that overclocking is not a focus of this motherboard and its price class, you&rsquo;ll get better bang for buck with some of the more midrange CPUs such as the Intel i5-13600 or i7-13700. Those seeking overclocked beasts such as the i9-13900K will be better served by a Z790 motherboard such as the ROG Strix Z790-i.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming Wifi" class="wp-image-1670023" height="776" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-13-at-4.18.04-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming Wifi&rsquo;s B760 chipset limitations are a little disappointing.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<h3 id="ddr5-ram-and-pcie-gen-5">DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5</h3>



<p>DDR5 support is here and allows for 64GB of fast RAM. You&rsquo;ll notice Mini-ITX motherboards will only have two available DIMM slots, which is the norm for this size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will also get a single 16x PCIe Gen 5 slot, for your GPU. The NVMe slots will be limited to PCIe Gen 4. GPUs also only take advantage of PCIe Gen 4, so you&rsquo;re more than covered here.&nbsp;Gen 5 NVMe drives are just starting to be released, and Gen 4 offers more than enough performance still.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>



<p>Two included NVMe slots are more than acceptable on a small form-factor motherboard such as this. Given that they&rsquo;re also PCIE Gen 4, you&rsquo;ll have more than enough storage and performance on hand for most gaming builds. You also get four SATA ports for hard drives, which should also be more than enough for small builds.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="usb-ports">USB ports</h3>



<p>With eight rear USB ports, and 1x USB C at 20Gb/s, you&rsquo;ll have fantastic options for almost any scenario here. This is almost on par with many ATX motherboards, so very little in the way of compromises here. If you&rsquo;re after even faster USB4 or Thunderbolt, you&rsquo;ll have to spend at least twice as much to find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DisplayPort and HDMI 2.1 are also here if your CPU supports integrated graphics, making it easy to diagnose without a discrete GPU.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>



<p>You&rsquo;ll get the same connectivity options as most ATX motherboards. Wi-Fi 6E and Intel 2.5GbE LAN are both available, as well as Bluetooth 5.3. Certainly, very few would need more for this class of motherboard, so it&rsquo;s great to see how well-rounded these options have become.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>



<p>Audio is good, with a ROG SupremeFX 7.1 codec. It also has a variety of audio inputs in the back, allowing headphone and speaker connections.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="other-features-of-note">Other features of note</h3>



<p>We always love the integrated I/O shield, as it makes the entire build process much more enjoyable. M.2 Q-latch for easy access to the M.2 slots is standard, too. You&rsquo;ll also have the same CPU cooler compatibility as LGA1700 Z690, so it&rsquo;s easy to transfer over your hardware. It&rsquo;s fantastic to see a smaller, more affordable motherboard having the same options as the bigger enthusiast motherboards do!&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-strix-b760-i-gaming-wifi-design">Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi: Design&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming Wifi" class="wp-image-1670024" height="869" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-13-at-4.19.12-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi has a colorful gaming inspired design.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi wastes no time in letting you know that it means business. Or better yet, it means gaming! With a super-colorful PCIe and I/O shield area, it&rsquo;s a very attractive design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second impression you&rsquo;ll get is one of quality. The fully adorned design is not only on the surface, but in the choice of materials used, and the tactile feel is also top-notch. The board feels hefty and substantial, in spite of its miniscule size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every area is laden with either colorful and interesting design elements, or functional VRM and heatshield armor. The M.2 slots are nicely protected and cooled&mdash;no exposed areas here! This overall attention to detail adds to a feeling of quality and enthusiast-grade design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll also have an Aura Sync RGB header onboard, for adding a dizzying array of lights if you want to. The motherboard itself, while colorful, is not adorned with much in the way of RGB or special screens. That&rsquo;s a given with this price class, you&rsquo;d need a more expensive and larger motherboard for more pizazz. That&rsquo;s okay&mdash;the colorful design more than fulfills its duty for eye-candy goodness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other smart design elements are the integrated I/O shield, M.2 Q-latch, and well-labeled inputs. These small touches further showcase the attention to detail, and the fact that you don&rsquo;t need a super-expensive motherboard to be an enthusiast.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming Wifi" class="wp-image-1670025" height="652" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-17-at-1.51.58-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The <p>Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi backside.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<h2 id="asus-rog-strix-b760-i-gaming-wifi-performance-software-and-bios">Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi: Performance, software, and BIOS&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi features an 8+1 VRM Power Stage with 80A. While this seems small compared to some beastly motherboards with 20+ Power Stages, it&rsquo;s more than enough for the types of CPUs you&rsquo;ll likely pair with this board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Performance is expectedly less than with Z790 motherboards, even small form-factor ones such as the Asus ROG Strix Z790-I, which is a cousin to this board. We wouldn&rsquo;t go slapping an Intel i9-13900KS on here since you&rsquo;ll waste a lot of that performance. You&rsquo;ll do fine with a regular i9-13900, i7-13700, or even i5-13600, however. Those will still perform well and give you cooler and more controllable performance, which could be a big benefit in smaller ITX builds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DDR5 is here, so you&rsquo;ll be experiencing more or less the same performance as with more expensive motherboards. You&rsquo;re limited to two slots and 64GB, but that is more than enough for gaming builds of this caliber.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PCIe Gen 5 is here for the GPU 16x slot, but only PCIe Gen 4 on the NVMe slots. This is far from an issue, and basically exactly what you&rsquo;d want for a full-fledged small gaming build. Sure, you&rsquo;re not topping out all of the specs that are present in Intel&rsquo;s 13th-generation CPUs, but you&rsquo;re also saving money. (Both in price, and heat output!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if you won&rsquo;t be overclocking on B760, it still has a pleasant BIOS to spend some time in. Of course, it won&rsquo;t be as fully featured as some of the bigger Asus ROG motherboards, but you&rsquo;ll have user-friendly options here for many other items.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With B760 being a fairly new chipset, it&rsquo;s always good to update your BIOS to catch updates with fixes quickly. It should mostly be a more mature platform compared to when B660 was new, however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exiting the BIOS, you&rsquo;ll also find that Asus has done a fine job with its Armoury Crate software. Gone are the days when you&rsquo;d absolutely avoid any type of included motherboard software. This one is useful and functionally stable, with myriad options. You can set Aura Sync RGB profiles, fan curves, and even update drivers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-asus-rog-strix-b760-i-gaming-wifi">Should you buy the Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming Wifi" class="wp-image-1670026" height="859" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-13-at-4.18.11-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Can you have almost the same enthusiast-level Mini-ITX experience on the cheaper $219 Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi as on pricier options?&nbsp;</p>



<p>For many users, you can. You&rsquo;ll still get the same features such as DDR5, some PCIe Gen 5, and CPU choices. A $219 price is not particularly cheap, especially given the limits you&rsquo;ll have on CPU tinkering compared to Z790.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For enthusiast users who want to pair a powerful, overclockable CPU such as the i9-13900K with a cheaper motherboard, B760 may not be the best option. We&rsquo;d recommend sticking to the less powerful and non-overclockable CPUs with this motherboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those limitations aside, the ROG Strix design will make enthusiasts happy, with great attention to detail and many included features that rival even some ATX motherboards. If you never plan to overclock, there&rsquo;s not much compromise here for users who just want to game and have the appropriate supporting features. No need to pay more for features you won&rsquo;t need; and you&rsquo;ll still get respectable performance.</p>
