The device comes in either white or black color options, and both choices are eligible for the 40% off deal.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-a-wireless-razer-headset-for-xbox-for-only-60/1100-6513010/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Mandalorian Season 3, Episode 6 Easter Eggs: 7 Things You Missed In Chapter 22: Guns For Hire

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4122309-themandalorianchapter22eastereggsbokatan.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">This week on The Mandalorian, Din Djarin and Bo-Katan visit a new planet we've never seen nor heard of before: Plazir-15, a beautiful and verdant planet with a sick-looking domed city at its heart. And the place is run by celebrities.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: This article contains major spoilers for Chapter 22 of The Mandalorian, Guns For Hire.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Our heroes have come to Plazir-15 because it's the new home of Bo-Katan's old Mandalorian army. These guys now follow Axe Woves, a character who appeared back in Season 2 when we first met Bo-Katan.</p><p dir="ltr">But before they have their little parlay with the Axe Man, they have to deal with the local leaders, a former Imperial middle manager who's married to the local royalty. Plazir's power couple has a problem: Their droids are going crazy and wrecking stuff and even harming organic beings. But since they have a former Imperial in charge, they aren't able to do much about it--they cannot have their own weapons in their city.</p><p dir="ltr">This is an issue because with the droid help, Plazir is an automated society where the organic beings live lives of luxury and don't have to go to work. It's a planet that's just nobility--if you don't count those droids, anyway. But we'll come back to that.</p><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of Easter eggs this week, both big and small. Which is good, because we can't have them slacking on the Easter eggs when actual Easter is coming up this weekend. Read on for some fun facts!</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Quarren and Mon Calamari forbidden romance</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4122315-themandalorianchapter22eastereggsmoncalquarren.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This episode opens with a little bit of a Romeo and Juliet scene--the Mandalorians who used to work for Bo-Katan are now mercenaries hired to retrieve a Mon Calamari nobleman from a starship full of Quarrens. But it turns out the Mon Cal is in love with the Quarren captain.</p><p dir="ltr">In Star Wars lore, the Mon Calamari and the Quarrens are from the same planet, and the two species have an ancient and permanent rivalry with one another. So, yes, they really are pretty much the space fish Montegues and Capulets. Fortunately, nobody ended up dead in this version of the story, though.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Tom Holland's brother is the Mon Calamari</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4122314-themandalorianchapter22eastereggs.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The voice of the Mon Calamari noble isn't a random voice actor or anything like that. No, it's Harry Holland, the brother of Spider-Man himself, Tom Holland. Harry doesn't act much--mostly he's appeared as an extra in some of his brother's movies.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Battle droids and super battle droids</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4122316-battledroidsandsuperbattledroids.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Since The Mandalorian is mostly connected to the rest of Star Wars through the Clone Wars and Rebels shows rather than the movies, these battle droids and super battle droids (B1s and B2s, if you wanna be a nerd about it) are more of a Clone Wars reference than a prequel trilogy reference. But what's particularly interesting about this scene is the way it lets one of these droids talk without making it a complete idiot--in contrast to the prequel films, where they were always just stupid. The Clone Wars show had some decent scenes where they talked, but this is the first time they managed to not be completely a joke in a live-action thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Bonus fun fact: the battle droids have been voiced by sound designer/editor Matthew Wood since the start of the Clone Wars series, and before that he was General Grievous in Attack of the Clones and worked as a sound editor on all three prequel movies. And this week on The Mandalorian, Wood provided the voice for the battle droid that Din Djarin and Bo-Katan meet during their investigation.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Jack Black and Lizzo</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4122319-themandalorianchapter22eastereggsjackblackandlizzo.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Someday, Star Wars might cool it with the cameos, but that day is not today. Because today we got Jack Black and Lizzo playing the leaders of the decadent planet Plazir-15. They aren't extremely serious characters--they're rich and out-of-touch goobers who are here to be mildly amusing and to keep the tone light. And, well, it's Jack Black and Lizzo, so they accomplish that.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Christopher Lloyd</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4122320-christopherlloydisthemandalorianchapter22eastereggs.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The head of security on Plazir-15 and the perpetrator behind the droid attacks is a man named Commissioner Helgait (yes, like "hellgate"), who is played by Christopher Lloyd. It's a shame he only had a couple minutes of screentime, because this character still holding loyalty to the Separatists from the Clone Wars is a nice little piece of world-building. These glimpses at people just being people in this universe--which happens so rarely--are always welcome.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Nano bots from the Techno Union</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4122321-themandalorianchatper22nanobotsfromthetechnounion.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Our two Mando detectives eventually manage to track down the cause of the rogue droids: nano bots from the Techno Union that were hidden in a droid beverage. A large conglomerate of tech companies, the Techno Union had a seat on the Separatist Council--its representative, Wat Tambor, has frequently been referenced in memes over the past two decades since his original brief appearance in Attack of the Clones.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Droids as people</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4122322-themandalorianchapter22droidsarepeopletobaby.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>All the droids in the Star Wars franchise are pretty much intelligent beings. And while this isn't a franchise that likes to ponder meaningful questions of morality, this week's visit to a droid-only cantina is the latest in a long thread of franchise moments that at least pay lip service to the idea that all these droids are actually people with the same free will as organic beings. But in the past, this topic hasn't often been dealt with with any kind of meaningful seriousness. See, for example, L3-37 in Solo: A Star Wars Story, who is treated as the butt of the joke.</p><p dir="ltr">This episode of The Mandalorian does it better. The bartender there tells Din Djarin and Bo-Katan they want the malfunctions to stop because they're worried it will turn the people of Plazir-15 racist against droids, and so these ones decide to help the investigation. For once, the droids are just other characters. That said, the droid bartender also has a line that attempts to justify their enslavement and forced servitude--like I said, Star Wars really can't ponder this too hard.</p></h3></p><br />

## "There Is No Cow Level" Might Be True In Diablo 4, At Least At Launch

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> won't feature a cow level, at least at launch. Blizzard confirmed in an interview that there won't be a cow level in Diablo 4, as it wouldn't match with the tone and world of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/diablo-iv-group-interview-unveils-new-information-future-of-diablo-iii-332278">Wowhead</a>, a developer seemingly confirmed that there will not be a cow level, or an equivalent type of area, in Diablo 4 at launch. Blizzard cited the gritty and grounded world of Diablo 4 as the reason why things like a cow level, pets, or wings won't appear in the game. However, as the game exists and gets post-launch updates, Blizzard might loosen those restrictions.</p><p dir="ltr">The cow level refers to the hidden level in Diablo 2 called The Secret Cow Level, which features a ton of Hell Bovine enemies. Blizzard has regularly denied the existence of the cow level in the past, even putting a "There is no cow level" message in Diablo 2, but it seems to be true for Diablo 4. This level was popular for farming XP, since the cow enemies were relatively weak and there were a ton of them in the level. Diablo 3 had its own version of the cow level called Whimsyshire, which features colorful teddy bears in a rainbow-filled level, the complete opposite of the rest of Diablo 3.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-no-cow-level-might-be-true-in-diablo-4-at-least-at-launch/1100-6513009/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Payday 3 Dev Knows Pressure Is On To Deliver With Sequel

<p>Just because the first two Payday games have been successful, that doesn't mean Starbreeze is resting on its laurels with the upcoming Payday 3. Far from it, according to Starbreeze boss Tobias Sjogren. He told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/finally-starbreeze-eyes-up-its-payday">GI.biz</a> that fans, and the industry at large, will expect Payday 3 to live up.</p><p>Sjogren said when he worked at DICE years ago, he remembers a meeting with EA about Battlefield 2. The developers at DICE felt confident given how much of a success Battlefield was, but a higher-up at EA reminded Sjogren and others that past success does not necessarily guarantee future success.</p><p>"'You are never better than your next game,'" Sjogren recalls this person saying. "That's something I've carried with me since because it is so true. In this industry, you can rely on your past to some degree, but it can never change what's coming next. Everything you do next is important and that's very much the case for Payday 3."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-dev-knows-pressure-is-on-to-deliver-with-sequel/1100-6513008/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2's Commendations Are Being Improved In A Few Ways
 - [https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-commendations-are-being-improved-in-a-few-new-ways/1100-6513004/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-commendations-are-being-improved-in-a-few-new-ways/1100-6513004/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

<p dir="ltr">Commendations were set to be a potentially exciting new element of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Lightfall era, as they were meant to be a way to acknowledge other players who may have been helpful or otherwise contributed to a positive experience. The reality of how the system works, however, has been a system where players mindlessly spam commendations without regard, in part due to the way they are tied into progression systems. Bungie has already made some tweaks to how commendations factor into Guardian Ranks, but more changes are also on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of a lengthy <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/reflecting-on-lightfall">blog post</a> detailing future plans for Destiny 2 and its response to feedback since Lightfall's launch, Bungie first outlined the purpose of commendations. "Commendations are meant to create cycles of gratitude so that players are thankful for one another," it explained. "They should reinforce that the most celebrated Guardians are those who have earned the respect of their peers by helping them out."</p><p dir="ltr">The number of commendations you receive will reset each season, whereas only a percentage of your commendation score will be lost from season to season. Your commendation breakdown (meaning the split between the different categories of commendations you receive) is tracked from season to season along with your score.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-commendations-are-being-improved-in-a-few-new-ways/1100-6513004/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>We're just weeks away from the release of Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp for Nintendo Switch--no, for real this time. The remade collection of the first two games in the beloved turn-based tactics series launches on April 21, as confirmed during a Nintendo Direct earlier this year.

<p>Actor Jeremy Renner was seriously injured on New Year's Day in a terrible snowplow accident, and he now says he would have died were it not for the help of his nephew. Renner also said he wrote his "last words" to his family with the expectation that he would not survive his injuries.</p><p>ABC News interviewed Renner about the accident that left him with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jeremy-renner-reveals-he-broke-30-bones-in-snowplow-accident-shares-new-photo/1100-6510755/">30 broken bones</a>. The full discussion is coming on April 6, but in a teaser, an emotional Renner shared new details on the accident. "If i was there on my own, that would have been a horrible way to die, and surely I would have. Surely. But, I wasn't alone--it was my nephew, sweet Alex. And the rest of the calvary came."</p><p>Renner was run over by his own Snowcat in Tahoe after using it to help a stranded family member. The ABC News clip also contains a previously unheard 911 call in which the caller pleads to have ambulances come quickly due to Renner being in "rough shape."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jeremy-renner-was-certain-he-would-be-dead-from-snowplow-accident-wrote-last-words-to-family/1100-6512996/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Last of Us TV show actress Melanie Lynskey would love to return to the post-apocalyptic world of the HBO series through an origin story about her character.

But Lynskey thinks there is more story to be told.</p><p>"If they wanted to go back and do an origin story, I would be there for it," Lynskey told <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/columns/melanie-lynskey-the-last-of-us-1235572669/">Variety</a>.

<p>Guardian Ranks are one of the more engaging additions made to Destiny 2 since its Lightfall era began, as this new system serves as a guide to give fellow players an idea of just how experienced you are in various activities. Now that it has been live for a month--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-super-high-commendations-score-requirement-for-guardian-ranks-has-been-lowered/1100-6512338/">and has undergone several tweaks</a>--Bungie is looking at how it'll evolve Guardian Ranks over the short and long term.</p><p>"With a solid amount of data now under our belts, it's clear we missed the mark on some of our goals and needed to make updates based on constructive feedback," <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/reflecting-on-lightfall">Bungie explained in an update</a>. "While the first batch of Guardian Ranks has proven to be an invaluable guide for New Lights, we want to improve the system for <em>all</em> players."</p><p>Guardian Ranks reset every season, but Bungie is aiming to make renewing them a quicker experience. On a cosmetic level, a new season will display your highest rank earned in the previous season to all players, and if you achieve a higher rank than you did last season, it will be your new displayed number.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-next-season-will-make-more-guardian-rank-changes/1100-6513001/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Savvy Games, a division of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, has acquired game studio Scopely in one of the biggest acquisitions by purchase price in the history of video games.</p><p>Savvy Games is paying $4.9 billion to acquire Scopely. There are only five gaming buyouts that are bigger, including Activision buying King for $5.9 billion, Microsoft buying ZeniMax for $8.1 billion, Tencent buying Supercell for $8.6 billion, and Take-Two buying Zynga for $12.7 billion. Microsoft is in the process of buying Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, which would be far and away the biggest acquisition in the history of video games.</p><p>In a <a href="https://savvygames.com/savvy-games-group-to-acquire-leading-games-company-scopely/">press release</a>, Savvy said the deal--which is pending regulatory approval--strengthens the company's "ability to deliver new and exciting products for the global gaming community."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-gamings-biggest-acquisitions-ever-just-happened/1100-6513000/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Way You Get Destiny 2 Exotic Armor Is Changing For The Better

<p dir="ltr">Recent years have seen Bungie provide <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> players with an increasing number of ways to influence what type of rewards they obtain in-game. Now, Exotic armor drops are the next area to get this treatment, as Bungie is introducing Exotic armor focusing.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in a new <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/reflecting-on-lightfall">blog post</a>, beginning in Season 21, Rahool at the Tower will allow you to dictate what you get from an Exotic engram. You can still decrypt an engram for free as you currently can, but you'll also have two options to influence what you get. The first, Advanced Decryption, allows you to focus an engram into an Exotic from a particular expansion (and its corresponding seasons). Seemingly due to the sheer number of them, there will be four slot-specific options--helmets, gauntlets, chest armor, and leg armor--for Exotics from the original Red War campaign. Subsequent expansions, up through Lightfall, will have only a single focusing option. Regardless of which you choose, the cost will be 30,000 Glimmer and one Ascendant Shard, in addition to the required Exotic engram.</p><p dir="ltr">Precision Decryption is the other option, and while it's more costly, it will allow you to specifically focus a piece of Exotic armor of your choice, though you'll need to have obtained the Exotic you want previously. As this is a particularly appealing option for ensuring you have a quality stat roll on a specific piece of gear, the cost is increased to 60,000 Glimmer, three Ascendant Shards, and one Exotic Cipher. The current cap on Exotic Ciphers will also be increased from one to five to ensure you can amass a small collection of those to fund this type of decryption.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-way-you-get-destiny-2-exotic-armor-is-changing-for-the-better/1100-6512999/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>One of the big changes introduced in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Lightfall expansion was Buildcrafting 2.0, a new system for customizing your Guardians with armor mods, perks, and abilities. In Destiny 2's upcoming Season of the Deep, the armor mod system will undergo an overhaul that's primarily focused on the Armor Charge mechanic and enhancing how you activate it.</p><p>Currently, Armor Charges can be triggered by picking up Orbs of Power, and once activated, a number of beneficial buffs and abilities will be temporarily available depending on how you've built your loadout. These are consumed by other mods or they'll expire after a set amount of time. Some mods focus on restoration, others on resilience, and energy generation, and as long as you're picking up Orbs of Power, you'll always have stacks of Armor Charges available.</p><p>The challenge here is that to pick up an Orb of Power, you'll need to push forward into enemy territory most of the time, a dangerous move depending on which difficulty you're playing an activity on. For Season 21, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/reflecting-on-lightfall">Bungie says</a> that it wants to provide a "more generous" collection method through buildcrafting and two new armor mods.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-buildcrafting-changes-will-make-activating-armor-charges-easier-in-season-21/1100-6512995/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV's</a> endgame involves completing bounties for a creepy tree, battling against Helltides, and conquering challenging Nightmare dungeons in order for players to continue progressing their characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has finally thrown back the curtain on Diablo IV's endgame, revealing in greater detail what players will be doing after having completed the game's main story campaign. In a new video titled "Into the Endgame," members of the Diablo IV team elaborate on what players can expect from endgame, and it's a combination of different activities.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who are looking for a challenge similar to that of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/">Diablo III's</a> Rift system, Nightmare Dungeons will be a great way to become more powerful. Diablo IV sports more than 120 dungeons, and any of them can be converted into a Nightmare dungeon using a Nightmare Sigil. Doing so will essentially create a hard mode of that dungeon, one with more difficult monsters, different objectives, and various affixes that will change up the experience. One affix mentioned by associate game director Joseph Piepiora is the Hellgate affix, which will randomly spawn portals throughout the dungeon from which monsters not typically found in the dungeon will swarm through.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-endgame-grind-is-a-combination-of-challenging-dungeons-and-open-world-activities/1100-6512997/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Storyteller Review - Tale As Old As Time
 - [https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/storyteller-review-tale-as-old-as-time/1900-6418052/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/storyteller-review-tale-as-old-as-time/1900-6418052/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

<p>For many of us, the fantastic tales of knights and dragons, love and loss, and brave heroes overcoming all obstacles are the ones that made us fall in love with storytelling. However, as we get older and life grows more complex, so do the types of stories we yearn for. Although the hero's journey may serve as a foundation for countless tales, these stories ultimately evolve into retellings, reimaginings, subversions, and entirely new creations--ones that alter our notions as to what a story can be. It is this feeling of surprise and delight that Storyteller aims to capture. However, the imaginative puzzle game ultimately fails to bottle that magic, failing to meaningfully evolve and instead delivering a repetitive and underwhelming experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The premise of Storyteller is simple yet tantalizing: You create stories that yield a certain outcome by altering the order in which key events occur. You do this by filling in boxes that resemble comic strip panels, using an established list of characters and settings to do so. As you structure your story, adjusting variables where needed in order to create the ending needed to pass the level, the panels interact with each other, resulting in a sort of interactive butterfly effect.</p><figure style="width: 940px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4122173-scbu7m.jpg"><img alt="A man slays a vampire to protect his bride." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4122173-scbu7m.jpg" /></a><figcaption>A man slays a vampire to protect his bride.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">The challenges start off simple enough--make the prince and princess fall in love, help the knight slay the monster, etc.--then quickly become a bit more complex, requiring you to understand a certain character's temperament and how that may flavor their interactions with others. For example, the noble knight is wary of murdering another character. The bloodthirsty baron, on the other hand, will leap at the opportunity. Similarly, the knight will always vie for the queen's affection, though it remains up to you to get her to feel the same towards him.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/storyteller-review-tale-as-old-as-time/1900-6418052/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Seth Rogen On Why He Didn't Give DK A "Weird" Voice In Mario Movie And Just Used His Own

<p>In The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which is in theaters now, Donkey Kong voice actor Seth Rogen uses his own voice to portray the gorilla instead of creating a voice. He simply does his best Seth Rogen.</p><p>Rogen spoke to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/super-mario-bros-movie-seth-rogen-donkey-kong-1235366432/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> about this. He said he didn't really think about giving DK any kind of special or "weird" voice and just went with his own because that made more sense.</p><p>"This didn't seem like one of those roles. So, here and there sometimes, but it was more about the dynamic. It's the dynamic of this guy who hates Mario and is kind of stuck with him, and to me, that was funny. So it didn't need some weird voice in order to be effective," Rogen said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/seth-rogen-on-why-he-didnt-give-dk-a-weird-voice-in-mario-movie-and-just-used-his-own/1100-6512984/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

When word spread of the DK Rap being included in the film, the song's composer Grant Kirkhope knew the words, so he was excited to join in too.

## Sony Is Reportedly Working On A PlayStation Cloud Streaming Handheld

<p dir="ltr">More than a decade after the release of the last PlayStation handheld, the Vita, several reliable leakers have reported that Sony is working on some sort of handheld device built around cloud streaming.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-handheld/">Insider Gaming</a>, the device is codenamed the Q Lite, and it will require the PS5. It's set to use Sony's existing Remote Play functionality to adaptively stream gameplay to the Q Lite, up to 1080p/60fps. The report further suggests that the Q Lite will resemble a PS5 controller with a massive 8-inch LCD touchscreen in the center. It will feature adaptive triggers, volume buttons, speakers, and an audio input jack. It's currently set to release before the PS5 Pro and after the rumored <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-ps5-slim-with-detachable-disc-drive-is-not-more-powerful-report/1100-6510604/">detachable disc drive</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The report says that the Q Lite and the detachable disc drive are part of the previously reported "second phase" of the PS5's lifespan, which will include other hardware drops, including wireless earphones and a wireless headset. Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb seemingly corroborated some of the details of this report, stating that he's heard details of a cloud-streaming handheld.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-reportedly-working-on-a-playstation-cloud-streaming-handheld/1100-6512981/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Cyberpunk 2077's New Overdrive Mode Makes The Game Really, Really Ridiculously Good-Looking

<p>Two years of constant fine-tuning and patches helped transform Cyberpunk 2077 on PC, but for the game's new Overdrive mode that goes live on April 11, those visuals are about to get an almost photorealistic upgrade in the lighting department. That is if you have the latest Nvidia GPUs and high-end PC hardware to handle the demands of those maxed-out graphics. But why Overdrive mode?</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red and Nvidia explained that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-receives-path-tracing-in-april/1100-6512644/">Overdrive mode</a> enhances the game with full ray tracing, which when compared to regular ray tracing, more accurately simulates light throughout an entire scene. This technology has been used on film and TV sets, and with the new Nvidia 40-series of graphics cards on the market, it's now possible to apply those techniques to games. But why Overdrive mode?</p><p>This is also made possible with Nvidia DLSS 3, which gives a massive boost to frame rates when the mode is applied. Without DLSS 3, Cyberpunk 2077 will run at around 17 frames per second with Overdrive mode on, but with DLSS 3 active, that number increases to around 128fps.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-new-overdrive-mode-makes-the-game-really-really-ridiculously-good-looking/1100-6512978/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

But doing so will be no easy task, as players will need to explore corrupted planets ridden with robot guardians. These worlds are full of secret gear and other interesting things to see, including crashed interceptors.</p><p>These deadly new worlds will throw players against Corrupted Sentinels, which are formidable semi-arachnid machines. Corrupted Sentinels wield flamethrowers and can attack players with long-range explosives, posing a threat to anyone who crosses their paths.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-skys-interceptor-update-adds-a-new-starship-and-corrupted-worlds/1100-6512979/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 Director James Gunn Talks "Superhero Fatigue"

<p>The box office has been ruled by superhero movies for over a decade now, with several franchises raking in billions of dollars in ticket sales. Not every film is guaranteed to be a smash hit, and with Marvel's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and DC's Shazam: Fury of the Gods struggling at theaters, it looks like superhero fatigue may be setting in. But it's not that simple, says Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 director James Gunn, as he believes that some films focus more on spectacle instead of story.</p><p>"I think there<em> is</em> such a thing as superhero fatigue," Gunn explained in an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-preview-soundtrack-track-listing-1234707361/">Rolling Stone</a>. "I think it doesn’t have anything to do with superheroes. It has to do with the kind of stories that get to be told, and if you lose your eye on the ball, which is character. We love Superman. We love Batman. We love Iron Man. Because they’re these incredible characters that we have in our hearts. And if it becomes just a bunch of nonsense onscreen, it gets really boring. But I get fatigued by most spectacle films, by the grind of not having an emotionally grounded story.</p><p>Gunn added that when a film is basically "just watching things bash each other" at the expense of the story, that's when audiences will grow tired of what they're seeing on the big screen. "No matter how clever those bashing moments are, no matter how clever the designs and the VFX are, it just gets fatiguing, and I think that's very, very real."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-director-james-gunn-talks-superhero-fatigue/1100-6512975/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The enhanced Creative Mode launched earlier this year and offers a robust set of tools for building maps, but Epic Games has seemingly cracked down on what players can and cannot publish using the creative mode.</p><p>A popular map creator known as Mist Jawa became famous for recreating Call of Duty maps--such as Rust and other stages from Zombies modes--within Fortnite, but all of them have been removed from the game.</p><p>"I will no longer be recreating any [copyrighted] maps," the creator announced on Twitter. Mist Jawa did confirm they will continue to create maps for shooter and Zombie fans.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-removes-user-created-call-of-duty-maps-from-creative-2-0/1100-6512976/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Last Of Us Part I PS5 And PC Review - Desolation Row

<p dir="ltr"><em>The Last of Us Part I's PS5 version was reviewed by Jake Dekker, while its PC port was reviewed by Alessandro Barbosa.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Joel looks different in The Last of Us Part I. It took me a while to notice, but once I did, it was hard to unsee. There's a pain in his eyes. His clothes and features are the same, but there's a quiet, unmistakable torment imprinted on his face. I've played The Last of Us nearly a dozen times across PS3 and PS4, and I had never seen it worn so plainly. I know Joel has a troubled past because The Last of Us Part I goes out of its way to show you a traumatic death in the opening scene, but that pain was never etched into his facial features this clearly.</p><p dir="ltr">There's an argument to be made that The Last of Us Part I is <em>too </em>similar to the PS3 and PS4 versions to be considered a remake, and part of me agrees with that sentiment. The story is identical, the level design is exactly the same, and the gameplay--apart from some quality-of-life improvements--is unchanged. On paper, if you've played The Last of Us and remember it well, there's little reason to return to it on PS5.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-i-ps5-and-pc-review-desolation-row/1900-6417949/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">It took a few decades, but we finally have our second big-screen adaptation of the Super Mario Bros franchise. And it was worth the wait--the new animated film starring Chris Pratt and Charlie Day as the titular brothers manages to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-actually-awesome/1900-6418051/">be both <em>quite</em> charming and a feast for the eyes</a> from the very start, and it doesn't let up until the very end of the credits.</p><p dir="ltr">And it's also, potentially, the start of a new movie franchise. That shouldn't come as any kind of surprise to anyone, of course, since there aren't many brands with more entertainment cultural cachet than Nintendo and Mario. But it means that The Super Mario Bros Movie isn't just telling its own story--it's also setting up potential future ones.</p><p dir="ltr">And in the age of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that usually involves bonus scenes after or during the end credits. Does The Super Mario Bros Movie follow that trend, or is it safe to exit the theater and never look back once the credits begin?</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-movie-yoshi-ending-and-post-credits-scenes-explained/1100-6512890/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
