Read its synopsis and you\u2019ll struggle to pick it apart from numerous other shooters already playable. Will you amass a small arsenal of guns and weaponry? \n\nYep. Build your own playstyle? Certainly. Fight alongside teammates in rapid-fire rounds of gun-toting action? You bet. So far, there\u2019s nothing singular, nothing standing out, no promise of a long future for THE FINALS. Except\u2026 there is an ace in the hole. Something largely unprecedented. Observe the ultra-destructiveness of the game\u2019s virtual arenas; in THE FINALS, players move beyond gun wielders to become human wrecking balls, reaping all manner of destructive behavior on their way to victory.\n\nThumbnail credit: Gamestar", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOx_ViVPJ1o", "date_published": "2023-04-05 15:30:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "What The HELL Is Going On With PlayStation's PC Ports?", "description": "If you've played The Last of Us Part 1 on PC recently, you've probably noticed it's pretty bad. Not the game, mind you, which is a good remake of one of the greatest titles ever made. It's the quality of the PC port, which drew a \u201cMostly Negative\u201d review score on Steam at launch. Though it's since changed to \u201cMixed\u201d, only 45 percent of user reviews are positive.\n\nWhere do you even begin with the issues? Crashes, shader compilation that could take 40 minutes to more than an hour, terrible hair, characters suddenly being drenched in cutscenes, Tess floating in the air \u2013 the list goes on.
