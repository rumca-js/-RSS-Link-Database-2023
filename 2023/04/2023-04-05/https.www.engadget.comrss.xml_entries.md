<p>AI normally needs to be trained on existing material to detect objects, but Meta has a way for the technology to spot items without help. The social media giant has <a href="https://research.facebook.com/publications/segment-anything/">published</a> a &quot;Segment Anything&quot; AI model that can detect objects in pictures and videos even if they weren't part of the training set. You can select items by clicking them or using free-form text prompts. As <em>Reuters</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-releases-ai-model-that-can-identify-items-within-images-2023-04-05/">explains</a>, you can type the word &quot;cat&quot; and watch the AI highlight all the felines in a given photo.</p><p>The model can also work in tandem with other models. It can help reconstruct an object in 3D using a single image, or draw from views from a mixed reality headset. Effectively, Segment Anything can limit the need for additional AI training.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both the AI model and a dataset will be downloadable with a non-commercial license. That is, creators can't use it for products. This is primarily for research and expanding access to the technology. Right now, Meta uses somewhat similar tech to moderate banned content, recommend posts and tag photos.</p><p>The developers acknowledge that the existing model is flawed. It might miss finer details, and isn't as accurate at detecting the boundaries as some models. And while Segment Anything can handle prompts in real-time, it bogs down when demanding image processing is involved. Some more specialized AI tools are likely to outperform this model in their respective fields, Meta says.</p><p>You aren't about to see this AI in robots or other devices where fast, accurate object detection is (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-bipedal-robot-has-learned-to-tackle-stairs-blind-102647481.html">usually</a>) vital. However, models like this may still help in situations where it's impractical to rely exclusively on training data. A social network could use the tech to keep up with a rapidly growing volume of content.  If nothing else, this shows that Meta wants to generalize computer vision.</p><p>Meta is no stranger to sharing AI breakthroughs, such a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-ai-translator-can-interpret-unwritten-languages-150001511.html">translator for unwritten languages</a>. With that said, there's pressure on the company to show that it's as much of a powerhouse in the category as tech heavyweights like Google and Microsoft. It's already planning <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-working-on-ai-personas-for-instagram-messenger-and-whatsapp-223316961.html">generative AI &quot;personas&quot;</a> for its social apps, and inventions like Segment Anything show that it has a few advantages of its own.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-shares-ai-model-that-can-detect-objects-it-hasnt-seen-before-210002471.html?src=rss

Its 10.9-inch display is also significantly larger than its predecessor, and it includes a faster A14 Bionic chip that’s plenty powerful for most iPad-related tasks.

## Why lawmakers are pushing age verification requirements for social media platforms

<p>Utah recently passed two <a href="https://www.engadget.com/utah-passes-laws-requiring-parental-permission-for-teens-to-use-social-media-223302739.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK8jOG6ZjW9Df42BRFk1UksqV40HVE8Q0wTbOH5IZuP59ZiagOZy1iL3UxuJIEu2MfuOi8q-jZs_dNIKmHAs4qdPGtWziwt_PzQMluCqRQfu_ogi2IkikiavMMFYoH6ITEl6V-WNJ7QEcT1zAs49Sv0IJakYQTh3G8DM-5A36fuc"><ins>laws</ins></a> that would drastically change how teens in the state are able to use social media. The new laws will impose strict rules for how companies handle teenagers’ accounts, including provisions requiring parental consent, and mandates for in-app parental controls and curfew features.</p><p>But among the most controversial aspects of the law is age verification. It requires companies like Snap, Meta and TikTok to confirm the ages of their youngest users in order to enforce the other age-based restrictions. Under <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/SB0152.html"><ins>the rules</ins></a>, which are set to take effect next March, large platforms will no longer be able to simply allow teens to enter their own birthday at sign-up. Instead, they would need to go through some other process, like providing a copy of an I.D, before they could access their accounts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Utah is the first state to enact such a law, it’s unlikely to be the last. Arkansas, Ohio, Connecticut and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/house-panel-bill-prohibiting-social-media-algorithms-targeting-teens/"><ins>Minnesota</ins></a> are all considering social media laws with either explicit age verification requirements or other age-based restrictions. At the federal level, Senator Josh Hawley has <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/new-hawley-introduces-two-bills-protect-kids-online-fight-back-against-big-tech"><ins>proposed</ins></a> a bill that would prohibit teenagers under 16 from using social media entirely, and require social media companies to independently verify the ages of their users. Even the US Surgeon General has suggested that 13 may be “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/29/health/surgeon-general-social-media/index.html"><ins>too young</ins></a>” for teens to use social media.</p><p>The proposed laws are part of broader <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-hearing-tiktok-snapchat-youtube-204825470.html"><ins>reckoning</ins></a> around how social media is impacting its youngest users. For years, lawmakers, armed with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-hearing-instagram-adam-mosseri-001751448.html"><ins>teenage finstas</ins></a> and incriminating <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-safety-research-212546087.html"><ins>research</ins></a>, have made youth safety a central part of their effort to regulate Big Tech. Along the way, they’ve also proposed laws that would rein in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-bill-justice-against-malicious-algorithms-act-162915185.html"><ins>algorithms</ins></a>, make it more difficult <a href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media-nudge-act-algorithm-sharing-harmful-content-misinformation-192521645.html"><ins>to post</ins></a> and limit apps’ more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-kids-online-safety-act-bill-141708555.html"><ins>“addictive”</ins></a> features.</p><p>But the latest crop of laws have instead zeroed in on parental consent and age-based restrictions, rather than addressing structural issues like data privacy. Irene Ly, policy counsel for Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that advocates for child safety online, says the shift is happening in part because lawmakers have been unable to pass comprehensive privacy bills.</p><p>“Privacy legislation seems to have a lot more sticking points,” she tells Engadget. “It's hard to find a compromise on all the facets of regulating tech.” But lawmakers have been able to find more broad support — at least at the state level — for age-based restrictions and parental consent requirements, particularly in states that have passed other laws emphasizing “giving rights to the parents.”</p><p>But experts warn that focusing on age-based restrictions won’t address the core safety issues lawmakers say they want to solve. And age verification measures, like those in Utah, pose a significant threat to the privacy of all social media users, not just teens.</p><p>Privacy advocates, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), say that there’s no way to enforce age verification requirements without requiring that <em>all </em>users submit to the checks. “It's not just the privacy of young people that's at stake, it's everyone,” Jason Kelley, associate director of digital strategy for the EFF, tells Engadget, noting that a previous attempt to require age verification was <a href="http://mediashift.org/2009/01/u-s-supreme-court-finally-kills-online-age-verification-law029/">struck down</a> by the Supreme Court more than a decade ago. ”Confirming that everyone is the age they say they are is not possible without confirming every single person's age.”</p><p>For example, Utah’s <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/SB0152.html"><ins>law</ins></a> states “the social media company shall deny access to the account” for any “Utah account holder fails to meet the verification requirements.” That means even adult social media users could face being locked out of their accounts if they fail to provide a copy of an ID or submit to another kind of age check.</p><p>Figuring out how to apply these laws only in specific states would also be problematic, according to industry groups. “Although the proposed legislation purports to apply only to Utah residents, platforms cannot know which users are Utah residents without first verifying their identity,” Ari Cohn, free speech counsel for TechFreedom, a think tank that’s received funding from Meta and Google, said in a <a href="https://techfreedom.org/utah-age-verification-mandate-violates-first-amendment/"><ins>statement</ins></a>. “This legislation would be a nationwide mandate that Utah is not permitted to impose.”</p><p>Even figuring out <em>how</em> to verify users’ ages could prove tricky. Many minors don’t have a driver’s license or government-issued ID. Instagram <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-testing-ai-face-scanning-tool-to-verify-your-age-114052186.html"><ins>has tested</ins></a> an AI face-scanning tool that claims to be able to accurately estimate users’ ages based on their facial features (experts have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/tech/instagram-ai-age-estimation-face-scan/index.html"><ins>raised doubts</ins></a> about the accuracy and <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/social-media/2022/07/problem-instagram-new-child-age-recognition-software"><ins>ethical</ins></a> implications of using these tools at scale). But Kelley, of the EFF, says that any form of age verification exposes users to additional data privacy risks.</p><p>“It's so easy to find examples of these companies taking advantage of data that they explained was going to be collected for one purpose and using it for another,” Kelley says. For example, it wasn't that long ago <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-28-facebook-two-factor-phone-numbers-ads.html"><ins>that Meta</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-08-twitter-phone-numbers-possibly-used-for-ad-targeting.html"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> both admitted to using phone numbers originally collected for two-factor authentication for targeted advertising. Kelley says there could be an even greater risk of something similar happening with any age verification system. “We have no way of knowing whether they're doing that with identity verification information. Whether that's a selfie, a shared driver's license, a call through an API to a credit company —  we just don't know.”</p><p>Common Sense Media has <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/press-releases/statement-on-the-signing-of-utahs-social-media-regulation-act"><ins>raised</ins></a> similar concerns. Ly says that laws addressing more fundamental aspects of social media platforms would be more effective than attempting to lock out teens of a certain age.</p><p>“If you can implement some key changes to these companies, like limiting how much data they're collecting and what they're using it for, and then making changes to how their platform is designed, that will create a healthier experience,” she said. “It wouldn't necessitate prohibiting teens from being on the platform altogether.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/why-lawmakers-are-pushing-age-verification-requirements-for-social-media-platforms-190037563.html?src=rss

## 'God of War Ragnarök' New Game+ update adds armor, level caps and enchantments

<p>Sony’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-fastest-selling-sony-exclusive-191147076.html"><ins>massively successful</ins></a><em>God of War Ragnarök</em> just got a pretty significant upgrade with a New Game+ that is much more than a simple rehash with tougher enemies. This NG+ is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/04/05/god-of-war-ragnarok-new-game-plus-is-available-now/?sf176518235=1"><ins>packed with features</ins></a> to squeeze more life out of last year’s PS4 and PS5 title. For the uninitiated, a New Game+ is a new adventure that unlocks when you beat the game. In this case, all of your equipment, weapons and skills carry over from your previous save.&nbsp;</p><p>The changes start with several new armor sets that bring unique gameplay mechanics to the table. The Zeus armor increases your magic and spell damage but places you at greater risk for incoming damage. The Spartan Armor, as the name suggests, eliminates all perks and stat boosts, increasing the challenge and leaving no room for error.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both the Armor of the Black Bear and Ares Armor take the opposite approach, giving players unique perks, like increased defense and an increase in rare item drops. There are also plenty of new customization options for pre-existing armor types if you want to change up your look.</p><div id="09db96f4af684f0c9b2db65ab1da2ec0"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">New Game Plus is available in God of War Ragnarök now.<br /><br />Don new armor, wield the Draupnir Spear from the start, expanded level cap, and much more: <a href="https://t.co/gOhnmqs2Ve">https://t.co/gOhnmqs2Ve</a><a href="https://t.co/NHS7LUMcdj">pic.twitter.com/NHS7LUMcdj</a></p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1643644755102793731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>The level cap is increased for both enemies and the player, which is fairly common in an NG+. Any level nine equipment, including weapons and shields, can convert into “Plus” versions with more progression options. Converting equipment also gives you special coins that are used to purchase new Enchantments.</p><p>Speaking of new Enchantments, the Engravings and Badge powers let you apply perks and stats typically reserved to a specific armor set to an amulet, so you get all of the benefits without having to actually wear the armor. The system is designed for experimentation to find the best combo for your unique playstyle. Certain enemies like Berserker Souls will also now drop new stat boost enchantments. Finally, there are Burdens, enchantments that apply a negative perk to amp up the challenge.</p><p>Endgame bosses have been redesigned, the sparring arena has been expanded with new enemies and there’s even a new black-and-white mode for those looking for a more cinematic experience. The free NG+-focused update is available now, making this a good time to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-162534113.html">return to ancient Scandinavia</a> and cause some brutal mayhem.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-new-game-update-adds-armor-level-caps-and-enchantments-184944024.html?src=rss

The automaker officially <a href="https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2023/april/all-new-all-electric-2025-ram-1500-rev-unveiled-at-new-york-international-auto-show-with-targeted-range-of-up-to-an-unsurpassed-500-miles">announced</a> the electric truck at the New York International Auto Show today after teasing an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stellantis-first-look-ram-1500-revolution-bev-concept-ces-2023-223035895.html">ultra-sleek concept</a> in January (which the version you can buy looks nothing like) and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stellantis-reveals-production-ready-ram-1500-ev-truck-202957196.html">production reveal</a> in February.</p><p>The standard version of the Ram 1500 EV will include a 168 kWh battery that lasts 350 miles; you’ll need to opt for the premium 229 kWh battery option to reach the 500-mile estimate. By comparison, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-starts-f150-lightning-ev-deliveries-173001513.html">Ford F-150 Lightning</a> maxes out at a 320-mile range, while the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html">Chevy Silverado EV</a> can last an estimated 400 miles. Meanwhile, Tesla claims its long-delayed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-tesla-unveils-its-cybertruck.html">Cybertruck</a> will match the new Ram with a 500-mile range.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Ram 1500 EV also supports quick charging. Stellantis says it can add up to 110 miles of range with only 10 minutes of charging.</p><p>As far as performance, the truck can go from 0 to 60 mph in as little as 4.4 seconds and has 654 horsepower and 630 lb-ft of torque. Its other specs include a towing capacity of up to 14,000 lbs and a maximum payload of up to 2,700 lbs. In addition, it has a frunk with 15 cubic feet of storage and bidirectional charging (including powering another vehicle, charging a home during power outages and sending power back to the grid). Finally, it can handle up to two ft of water fording.</p><p>Stellantis hasn’t yet announced pricing, and deliveries aren't scheduled to start until the fourth quarter of 2024.

## Two alcohol recovery startups just got caught sharing private user data

<p>Online alcohol recovery startups Monument and Tempest got caught sharing confidential user data with advertisers without their consent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/04/monument-tempest-alcohol-data-breach/"><ins>as originally reported by </ins><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>. Everything came to light after an internal review revealed a data breach impacting 100,000 users, forcing the companies to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23741051-monument-breach-notification"><ins>issue a formal disclosure</ins></a> to the user base. The violations started in 2017 and were ongoing until last month's review.</p><p>Monument and Tempest started as two entirely different platforms, but the <a href="https://twitter.com/JoinMonument/status/1524491066732335106">former acquired the latter</a> several months back. Parent company Monument confirmed not only the data breach but that the companies shared private information with advertisers via a notification filed with California’s attorney general. Data shared with advertisers, without user consent, includes patient names, dates of birth, email addresses, postal addresses, phone numbers, insurance information and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unfortunately, that is just the beginning. In a cruel insult to those seeking recovery, the companies also shared data related to appointment information, assessment information and survey responses, which includes alcohol consumption data. Monument continues to tout its <a href="https://support.joinmonument.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040785754-How-is-my-information-protected-">commitment to privacy on its website</a>, saying that <a href="https://joinmonument.com/resources/stop-drinking-without-rehab/">survey responses are “protected&quot;</a> despite the recent disclosure</p><p>The companies blame third-party tracking systems for the issue, stating that they have removed the offending tracking codes from their websites. The companies do not admit to sharing this information on purpose to increase profits, indicating that the tracking pixels provided by third parties did the deed all on their own.</p><p>Though this is an especially egregious example, it is important to remember that most companies have a less-than-pristine record regarding data privacy, even in the case of medical records. There is a near-endless list of similar violations, like the time a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mental-health-startup-cerebral-shared-private-patient-data-with-google-meta-and-tiktok-223806251.html"><ins>mental health startup shared patient information</ins></a> without consent and when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-hospitals-lawsuit-patient-privacy-data-tracking-162954779.html"><ins>Meta was caught</ins></a> with its own hand in the digital cookie jar.

## Google will require that Android apps let you delete your account and data

<p>Google wants to make it as easy to scrub an app account as it is to create one. The company has <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/04/giving-people-more-control-over-their-data.html">announced</a> that Android apps on the Play Store will soon have to let you delete an account and its data both inside the app and on the web. Developers will also have to wipe data for an account when users ask to delete the account entirely.</p><p>The move is meant to &quot;better educate&quot; users on the control they have over their data, and to foster trust in both apps and the Play Store at large. It also provides more flexibility. You can delete certain data (such as your uploaded content) without having to completely erase your account, Google says. The web requirement also ensures that you won't have to reinstall an app just to purge your info.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The policy is taking effect in stages. Creators have until December 7th to answer questions about data deletion in their app's safety form. Store listings will start showing the changes in early 2024. Developers can file for an extension until May 31st of next year.</p><p>The changes come several months after Apple instituted a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1v">similar rule</a> for App Store software. In both cases, the companies are concerned about privacy violations and the ensuing fallout — they don't want users to fall prey to data breaches because they couldn't easily delete accounts or sensitive info when they stop using an app.</p><p>This also follows growing efforts by regulators to demand more control over services. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently proposed rule changes requiring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-you-to-cancel-subscriptions-142649542.html">easy ways to cancel subscriptions</a> and memberships. While the FTC is focused more on unwanted charges than privacy, the message to app makers is clear: provide more control of accounts or face repercussions.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-will-require-that-android-apps-let-you-delete-your-account-and-data-170618841.html?src=rss

## Ransomware hackers leak second batch of city data from Oakland attack

<p>The perpetrators of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oakland-declares-state-of-emergency-ransomware-attack-092310131.html">ransomware attack against Oakland</a> have leaked more of the data from the  hack. The city has <a href="https://www.oaklandca.gov/news/2023/city-of-oakland-targeted-by-ransomware-attack-core-services-not-affected">confirmed</a> that Play, the hacker group claiming responsibility for the ransomware, has shared a second batch of info on the dark web. While officials aren't sharing more details, <em>The Oaklandside</em><a href="https://oaklandside.org/2023/04/05/ransomware-attack-hackers-oakland-second-data-leak-confidential-city-files/">sources</a> say the dump was 600GB and included confidential Oakland Police Department files (including disciplinary records), council members' communications and city staff's medical records.</p><p>The first release from early March was a comparatively modest 10GB, but included city employee rosters and police records. The incident was serious enough that the Oakland police union is now <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/eastbay/article/oakland-police-union-files-claim-city-data-release-17876120.php">demanding</a> $25,000 per officer for the damage done through the leak. The union also wants to pressure the city into tightening its security.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The February attack prompted the city to declare a state of emergency and take its network offline in a bid to limit the damage. That left many non-emergency services unavailable, including the systems to issue licenses and permits. Oakland closed some buildings and warned of delayed responses to non-urgent complaints. Access to some systems came back in late February.</p><p>Play group has been linked to numerous attacks, including Rackspace and the Belgian city of Antwerp. The gang first emerged in June of last year, when <em>BleepingComputer</em> forum users <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/773651/play-ransomware-play-findom-support-topic/">reported</a> attacks attributed to the outfit.</p><p>The city still hasn't outlined Play's demands. However, the second wave of leaks suggests Oakland isn't bowing to pressure to pay the ransom. That's not a surprising decision. While the exposed data increases the risk of fraud, the city risks encouraging more ransomware attacks if it gives in.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ransomware-hackers-leak-second-batch-of-city-data-from-oakland-attack-163350688.html?src=rss

<p>Air fryers don't really fry — they're much more versatile and handle an impressive range of recipes.

That's the lowest price we've seen this year and essentially makes the 10-quart size the same price as the 6-quart version. The larger size is ideal for people who entertain or have bigger families.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>A dual-zone fryer, like the DZ401, has two chambers that can cook two different foods at the same time, using completely different modes. It can also cook the same thing on both sides or just use one side at a time, leaving the other side empty for smaller batches. We like that it heats up quickly, with virtually no heat-up time and runs quietly. It even includes a Smart Finish feature that will adjust the cooking temps of each side so that your two different recipes finish at the same time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The DZ401 has a wide temperature range, from 105 to 450 degrees and six available cooking modes including air fry, broil, roast, bake, reheat and dehydrate. The 10-quart size is large, however.  While that's great for cooking up big batches of food, it's not a small unit.

<p>Law enforcement just took down an important hacker haven. <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/05/fbi-genesis-market-seized-stolen-logins/?guccounter=2">reports</a> the FBI has seized Genesis Market, a major marketplace for stolen logins, as part of an international campaign dubbed &quot;Operation Cookie Monster.&quot;  The UK's National Crime Agency <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/notorious-criminal-marketplace-selling-victim-identities-taken-down-in-international-operation">adds</a> that authorities arrested roughly 120 people worldwide as part of the bust, including 19 site users in that country.</p><p>We've asked the FBI and Justice Department for comment. In a release, the Justice Department says the seizure took down a &quot;key enabler&quot; of ransomware. Beyond the US and UK, the campaign included agencies from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Sweden and European countries like Germany and Poland. Europol and the EU's Eurojust were also involved.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Genesis Market was founded in March 2018 and sold logins, cookies and browser fingerprints taken from breached systems. Hackers could not only sign into accounts, but impersonate web browsers to access those accounts without needing a password or two-factor authentication token. So long as Genesis could still reach a victim's devices, it could offer up-to-the-minute data from that victim — a valuable resource for hackers that sometimes have to settle for old and sometimes useless data.</p><p>The black market shop has sometimes been linked to high-profile cybercrime incidents. <em>Motherboard</em><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7b3jm/genesis-market-buy-cookies-slack">noted</a> that the intruders behind the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/electronic-arts-hacked-164608934.html">2021 EA hack</a> said they bought a $10 bot from Genesis to hijack a Slack account at the game publisher.</p><p>The seizure and arrests won't stop sites from peddling bootleg logins. It won't be surprising if many of Genesis Market's customers turn to smaller marketplaces. All the same, this is a significant action that could make it harder for attackers to simply buy the login data they need. It also comes as law enforcement is stepping up efforts to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hive-ransomware-doj-fbi-disruption-193249866.html">disrupt the ransomware networks</a> themselves. In theory, digital extortion is a more difficult proposition than it was even a few months ago.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fbi-seizes-a-giant-online-marketplace-for-stolen-logins-151112975.html?src=rss

The 10-week program provides credits for AWS use, access to mentors and other experts and networking events. At the end, startups pitch their work to potential investors and customers.</p><p>While the accelerator is open to all generative AI startups, AWS recommends that candidates have at least a basic product ready with some interest from customers.

## Adobe Podcast's text-based editing turns limitation into liberation

<p>Ever found yourself with a killer podcast idea, only for it to fizzle out once you realize all the hoops you have to jump through just to make it? Learning an audio editing tool is a skill of its own and, while getting your audio masterpiece online has never been easier, today’s listeners are savvy and won’t tolerate subpar sound and editing for long. These are all problems that Adobe’s browser-based new Podcast tool aims to solve.</p><p>Adobe Podcast, formerly known as Project Shasta, is a cloud-based audio production tool. As the name suggests, it’s aimed primarily at podcast production, though it might interest anyone that works with narrative audio. The main thing to know is there’s no audio timeline here and no mixer view with channels. The first thing you’ll notice is how it doesn’t look like an audio editor at all. In fact, it almost never was.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The goal was to come up with a broader voice strategy for Adobe,” Mark Webster, Director of Product told Engadget. “That could have been creating a creative cloud voice assistant or speaking to Photoshop. But we kind of took a step back [...]  it was really about just building services and a platform to make it really easy to create spoken audio.’“</p><p>The result is Adobe Podcast which is still in beta. Anyone can apply for access, but currently you’ll need to be based in the US.</p><div id="683f6d0403584456b90ee48d7dc3d7a8"><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; font-family: Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-weight: 100;"><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9957be96-25f6-431d-9e37-e15ffa9fc598&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=soundcloud&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5OTU3YmU5Ni0yNWY2LTQzMWQtOWUzNy1lMTVmZmE5ZmM1OTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS9lbmdhZGdldC1wb2RjYXN0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZjc2MTc2YS02ZDFhLTQ1Y2EtODAzNi0zNDE4ZjBlMzVhMTAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVcJWuvM1fO4dhG_u_RA8WD0AoMSn0frYEH_T2EM9dLc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Engadget">Engadget</a> · <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9957be96-25f6-431d-9e37-e15ffa9fc598&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=soundcloud&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5OTU3YmU5Ni0yNWY2LTQzMWQtOWUzNy1lMTVmZmE5ZmM1OTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS9lbmdhZGdldC1wb2RjYXN0L3RoZS1nZW5lcmljLXBvZGNhc3QiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjJmNzYxNzZhLTZkMWEtNDVjYS04MDM2LTM0MThmMGUzNWExMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQ2xHuDtVO5gWm-5rLxCItlg4cs9MK0SvOtJtxOJ9qJH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fengadget-podcast%2Fthe-generic-podcast" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="The Generic Podcast">The Generic Podcast</a></div></div><p>Unlike traditional audio editors, including Adobe’s own Audition, you won’t work left to right or even really work with audio files at all. Instead you’ll work on your podcasts like you would a text document. And not just because you work top down, but for the most part, you really <em>are</em> just editing a text document. Anything you record through Adobe Podcast will be automatically transcribed and you simply edit the text to make changes (which are then magically reflected in the audio). There are even some extra tools for creating artwork (as seen above).</p><p>“We don't think of Adobe Podcast as another audio tool. It really is a storytelling tool. When you think about it as a storytelling tool, suddenly all the things that are in traditional audio tools, like looking at the audio waveforms and decibel levels, they're actually not relevant.” Sam Anderson, Adobe Podcast’s Lead Designer told Engadget.</p><p>Apps like Descript have been doing it this way for a while. And it makes some sense. Podcasts are about what is being said, so it’s logical to work on the text first rather than the raw audio.</p><p>Not to mention, being able to see what’s being said without endlessly playing it back to find the right spot is also much easier on the ears, eyes and soul. But it’s not without some trade offs.</p><p>For one, there’s a certain amount of control you have to learn to relinquish. In an audio editor, you can choose exactly where you want to trim a segment of audio to. In Adobe Podcast, you can only highlight text and the finer details of the edit are taken care of by the backend. For the most part that’s fine, but if you wanted to add or trim some silence, for example, you can’t do that here, you’ll have to get creative.</p><figure><img alt="Generic podcast artwork created with Adobe Podcast." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/0b254ac0-d393-11ed-b6bf-f56ceec3f26b" style="height: 640px; width: 640px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>For example, removing a sentence is as easy as highlighting it in the transcription and smacking the delete key. Similarly, you can cut/paste to move things around as you see fit. But you might not quite get the smooth edit you would if you did this manually in an audio editing app. So, for now at least, you might still have to make some minor edits after you export from Podcast. In the future, the system might leverage AI to make these sorts of edits for you.</p><p>“I think we could use some really interesting technology to look at the space between words and when you make deletions and just find a way to just do it automatically.” Anderson said.</p><p>One of the major benefits for online tools like Podcast or similar services such as Riverside Fm and Zencastr is how easy it is to invite guests. In the past you might have had to have a pre-brief with a guest to figure out their audio setup, maybe guide them into recording it locally with Audacity and then deal with transferring large audio files around after the fact.</p><p>With Podcast, your guests simply accept an invite, much like they would for a Zoom meeting, and then you converse in real time while the local audio is uploaded in the background. The result is an incredibly frictionless way to get local audio, transcribed and ready to be edited in one fell swoop.</p><p>Perhaps Adobe’s secret weapon here is two-fold. First, unlike the rival products mentioned above, Podcast has a singular focus on audio, so there are no video editing, presentation or livestreaming tools you might not need. Second would be some proprietary tools - notably “Enhance Speech.” With one click, this magic button basically transforms garbage audio recorded in the worst of rooms into something that sounds more professional.</p><p>In testing this, I recorded a conversation between my colleague Mat Smith and myself. I was using a dedicated XLR podcasting mic (Focusrite’s DM14v) into an audio interface. Mat, on the other hand, was just speaking into his Macbook’s built-in microphone. Once we finished our recording, I tapped the “Enhance” toggle and suddenly it sounded like we were in the same room with the same equipment.

Again, this is something you can find on rival products, but right now there’s not even a way to edit them out as the transcription doesn’t show them so this is something you’d have to do in post.</p><p>Handily, Adobe Podcast includes lots of free music for you to use for intros/outros and transitions. Editing them to work with your speech isn’t as intuitive as it could be, but this is an example of why the service is still in beta. You <em>can </em>be creative. For example, if you want to talk over a bit of music and then have it fade up to full volume, you can splice it in two and set one to “background” and achieve the effect that way. Webster explained that they’re figuring out the best way for adding such tools that will guide novices without alienating more advanced users (and vice versa).</p><p>If you’re wondering if Adobe will add in an AI voice tool so you can not only the audio you have with text, but actually <em>add</em> words by typing them in (something you can do in Descript), don’t hold your breath. Webster pointed out that to make an effective voice model it needs to be trained on enough material so it only makes sense for your own voice. Given that AI voices can be clunky, they decided to just make it really really easy to re-record the line you wanted. After all, this isn't a video where patching over a misspeak is a lot more complicated.</p><p>Perhaps the best feature of all is the lack of friction between ideas and getting something down on the page. If you can use Google Docs, you can make something with Adobe Podcast. And with the bundled music and mic-enhancement tools there’s a solid chance it’ll sound pretty good, too.</p><p>For now, Podcast will remain in beta for the foreseeable future, and Webster confirmed that there will always be a free tier. And if you don’t even want to make a podcast, but you like the sound of the speech enhancing feature, you don’t even need to sign up for the beta, it’s available <a href="https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance">right here</a>, right now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/adobe-podcasts-text-based-editing-turns-limitation-into-liberation-133001520.html?src=rss

## Amazon Halo Rise review: An unobtrusive bedside sleep tracker that’s surprisingly helpful

<p>I love to sleep. Then, after I wake up, I love to find out how <em>well</em> I slept. It might be because I’m highly competitive or that I like the validation of an app confirming whether I’ve had a good or bad night’s rest. Despite this, I’ve avoided most sleep trackers because they’re generally too intrusive or uncomfortable. So when Amazon unveiled the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlNR0JLOVZWP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXJnLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZDcyNzJkNS03MDkwLTQ3ZmQtODRjMC02ZThmZWJiMmJmMmIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQapaDtP_5LhMQmDeZWdTEtiAb5n8d5grN2WI43OQAin&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09MGBK9VV">Halo Rise</a>, I was excited by its premise. For $140 (on sale now for $100), the Rise promises to use motion sensing to track your breathing rate and use that information to calculate how long you’ve slept. It’s also a bedside lamp, clock and smart alarm, and looks pretty, to boot.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>It fits nicely into my life in many ways. First, physically. The Halo Rise is a gray CD-sized disc (remember those? And yes I know the D already stands for Disc) that’s flat on one side and convex on the other and rest on top of a metal stand. The even surface houses LEDs that show the time, as well as an arc of lights that can be set to simulate the gradual glow of sunrise and wake you up more gently.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I like the Rise’s clean, modern aesthetic that should blend in with most furnishings. Setup was also surprisingly painless. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">Google’s Nest Hub</a>, which similarly uses motion detection to track your sleep, the Halo Rise needs to be next to your bed within arm’s reach. I was worried that my nightstand wasn’t tall enough for the device, but it was able to work even though it was set a few inches lower than Amazon recommended.</p><div id="ef021a7e877b40e293d9de41bc272380"></div><p>Placing the Rise close to your bed is also important because, unlike the Nest Hub, it doesn’t have an onboard mic, which means you’ll <em>have</em> to reach over and hit the snooze button when it goes off. This brings me to one of my small complaints: There are two buttons on the top of the Rise. A small, pinky-sized one for dismissing the alarm and a larger one on its left for snoozing. I know this is how most alarm clocks are designed and it makes sense – if you’re awake enough to accurately press the tinier button then you likely won’t need a follow up. But since there’s no way to vocally stop the Halo Rise, the fact that the buttons are so small and close to each other is pretty frustrating. I accidentally hit snooze so many times and had to run back to my bedroom while brushing my teeth when the device rang again ten minutes later.</p><p>That’s my main gripe with the Halo Rise’s hardware, and it honestly isn’t much. I also wish it were a bit bigger so the buttons could be easier to hit and the clock font easier to read. But those are the only times you have to physically interact with it, everything else happens in the app.</p><h2>Sleep-tracking</h2><p>Every morning, Amazon will show you a summary of the last night, including a score of and amount of time you’ve been asleep. Alongside that is a message either congratulating you on doing well or cautioning you to go easy that day if you hadn’t caught enough shut eye. I’ve definitely used the feedback from the Rise as an excuse to get out of working or working out in the last few weeks, when it told me to take it easy after getting just two hours of sleep.</p><figure><img alt="A top-down view of the Amazon Halo Rise, showing its snooze and dismiss buttons. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/2e0e5be0-d26b-11ed-bbdb-3340e5fdb245" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by: Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>In general, I’ve found the Halo Rise pretty accurate at detecting when I’ve dozed off and woken up. It actually performed better than Google’s smart display, which would often mistake when I awoke. I don’t like how, unlike most other sleep trackers, Amazon also includes my “time taken to fall asleep” as part of my so-called performance each night. Typically, after I get in bed, I spend some time scrolling Reddit or playing games and I don’t consider that time spent trying to fall asleep. I wish the Rise were smart enough to use its onboard light sensor to determine when I put my phone away and turn off the light. That is when I’m actually trying to drift into la la land, but I guess not everyone sleeps in the dark so this might not be suitable for all.</p><p>Still, I found the app surprisingly informative. Tapping into details brings up a chart of the sleep stages I was in the night before, as well as a timeline below it showing at which points during the night there were “Light Disruptions.” For me, the results were unsurprising – since I don’t use blackout curtains, my room got bright at sunrise every day. Otherwise, unless I had gotten up and turned on my lamp, there were no disruptions. This page also tells me the average brightness, humidity and temperature in my room overnight.</p><p>What was most helpful was understanding that my sleep environment was warmer than I thought. I was struggling to fall and stay asleep until the app suggested I adjust it to the recommended range of 60 to 70 degrees (Fahrenheit). As someone who avoids using the air conditioner out of guilt, having this information validated my desire and I started to turn it on more often right before bedtime. I slept much better after that, and the app congratulated me on keeping my room’s temperature within the ideal range.</p><p></p><p>To be clear, the Halo Rise isn’t the only sleep tracker that can do this. The Nest Hub also tracks your room’s temperature and light. But instead of humidity, Google uses its onboard mics to listen for sounds of snoring or coughing. As someone who doesn’t snore, but coughs a lot due to dry air, I found it more helpful to get insight on how humid my environment was. Depending on your concerns, your preferences here might differ.</p><p>Another key difference between the Halo Rise and the Nest Hub is that Google will track daytime naps while Amazon does not. If you go back to bed in the middle of the day, the Rise will not track your sleep. However, on one particular Saturday when I was recovering from a long, hard week, I stayed in bed for hours after waking up and passed out at 1:48pm. I finally got out of bed at about 4:43pm, and the Amazon app actually updated afterwards to add those three-ish hours to my record.</p><h3>Wrap-up</h3><p>Every morning in the past, I’d reach for my phone, check my notifications and the weather, as well as my horoscope. I know, it’s not scientific and I don’t put a lot of stock in it, but I think of it as a way to start my day off better prepared. Since setting up the Halo Rise, my first check-in has been replaced by looking at the Halo app. It’ll tell me whether I should take my daily workout easy, and how early I might need to get to bed that night.</p><p>The Halo Rise is also a small but significant piece of Amazon’s ongoing foray into the business of health and wellness. The device sits in the most intimate of our spaces and offers help on a specific area of wellbeing. Together with products like the Halo Band and app features like body composition scanning, mobility and posture assessment, as well as the controversial tone monitoring that monitors how you speak, the company is clearly investing in health management tools. Considering Amazon also recently finished acquiring One Medical and launched its pharmacy in 2020, its ambitions are obvious. The question is whether we’re willing to trade our personal data for the potential convenience that an all-Amazon healthcare infrastructure might bring.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-rise-review-an-unobtrusive-bedside-sleep-tracker-thats-surprisingly-helpful-130037788.html?src=rss

<p>Back in February, Hello Games rolled out an update for <em>No Man's Sky</em> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/no-mans-sky-fractal-update-overhauls-vr-gameplay-in-time-for-its-ps-vr2-release-173009994.html">overhauled</a> the game’s virtual reality experience on all platforms. Now the developer has released another update that doesn't only bring new VR features, but also expands the game's lore and introduces new experiences. In the latest free update called <em>Interceptor</em>, a new corruption has spread throughout the universe, infecting planets until they turn into purple-hazed worlds growing purple crystals, twisting sentinel machines into new forms and giving rise to new enemies.&nbsp;</p><p>Players may find themselves facing off against big spider-like and small crab-like machines, as well as corrupted drones, on these worlds. Hello Games says they're its most lethal antagonists yet and come armed with stealth tech, flamethrower and explosives. Players might also come across huge Sentinel capital ships that can provide them a challenging bout of space combat. In addition, the update gives players access to a variety of new Starship they can collect, powered by new tech and equipped with new features, such as an ability called the Anti-Gravity Well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the technical side of things, <em>Interceptor</em> brings improved visuals and new features for virtual reality that include wrist interface controls. Finally, this update comes with Xbox-focused improvements and was designed to enable smooth and consistent frame rate for visually complex scenes while playing on the console.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Interceptor</em> will be available for download today on PC, the PS4 and the PS5, the Xbox One and Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and virtual reality.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/no-mans-sky-interceptor-update-adds-new-ships-corrupt-worlds-and-vr-improvements-130016183.html?src=rss

<p>On the eve of the launch of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-final-trailer-for-the-super-mario-bros-movie-looks-more-like-a-game-than-ever-231926362.html"><em>The Super Mario Bros.

In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/shigeru-miyamoto-new-mario-games-mobile-apps-nintendo-1235562472/"><em>Variety</em></a>, celebrated Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto said that &quot;mobile apps will not be the primary path of future Mario games.&quot; Instead, he said, the company's strategy going forward is a &quot;hardware and software integrated gaming experience.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Miyamoto's remarks aren't too surprising, considering that the last Mario game on mobile, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-08-dr-mario-world-hands-on-ios-android.html"><em>Dr. Mario World</em></a>, was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-dr-mario-world-is-shutting-down-on-november-1st-050347975.html">pulled</a> from the market just two years after its release. 2016's Super Mario Run grossed $60 million in its first year, while <em>Mario Kart Tour</em> has taken in $300 million so far. That compares with Nintendo's $3 billion gross to date on <em>Mario Kart 8</em> for Wii U and Switch.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The designer said that since control intuitiveness is a key part of the gaming experience, smartphone development is problematic. &quot;When we explored the opportunity of making Mario games for the mobile phone — which is a more common, generic device — it was challenging to determine what that game should be,&quot; he said. &quot;That is why I played the role of director for <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/shigeru-miyamoto-new-mario-games-mobile-apps-nintendo-1235562472/"><em>Super Mario Run</em></a>, to be able to translate that Nintendo hardware experience into the smart devices.&quot;</p><p>Miyamoto didn't address other mobile Nintendo mobile properties, including <em>Animal Crossing Pocket Camp</em> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-03-nintendo-mobile-subscription-fire-emblem-heroes-feh-pass.html"><em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em></a>.

## The Morning After: Microsoft’s new Xbox controller is partially made of ground-up CDs

<p>&nbsp;Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/04/04/new-xbox-wireless-controller-remix-special-edition/"><ins>announced</ins></a> a new, slightly more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-ground-up-old-cds-to-make-its-new-xbox-controller-182523771.html">sustainable Xbox controller</a>. Arriving as an Earth Day promotion, the Xbox Remix Special Edition wireless controller uses recycled materials from old gamepads, auto headlight covers and reclaimed CDs (among other sources) to give each accessory a unique look – but no special functionality. I’m totally OK with that.</p><p>Microsoft describes the combination of recycled resins with regrind as creating “custom, earth-tone colors with subtle variations, swirling, markings, and texturing – giving each Remix Special Edition controller its own look and feel.” While it’s hard to see that on the press images, it should result in a satisfying textured pattern on the bumpers and side grip. The company also bundles an Xbox Rechargeable Battery Pack with each gamepad, ensuring fewer AA batteries head to landfills.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

<p>Activision's <em>Call of Duty</em> Ricochet anti-cheat team has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=da117b2e-853d-490d-9d4c-d529d2fa776c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=callofduty&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkYTExN2IyZS04NTNkLTQ5MGQtOWQ0Yy1kNTI5ZDJmYTc3NmMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FsbG9mZHV0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIzLzA0L2NhbGwtb2YtZHV0eS1tb2Rlcm4td2FyZmFyZS1JSS1hbmQtd2Fyem9uZS0yLTAtcmljb2NoZXQtYW50aS1jaGVhdC1zZWFzb24tMy11cGRhdGUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY3OTQ5MjAwLWY5ODUtNDU5OS1iYjY5LTUwOTFmNDI3ZjdjNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZyvRk-WIPCq3kecRnBW9rXqwuwAC6ZYwYyL35wN5iVG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.callofduty.com%2Fblog%2F2023%2F04%2Fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-II-and-warzone-2-0-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-3-update">introduced</a> a number of new measures designed to reduce unfair play. Those include a replay investigation tool along with detection of third-party XIM-type devices. Some cheaters will be permanently banned, but CoD has revealed that others will be subject to some new (and rather hilarious) in-game mitigations.&nbsp;</p><p>To start with, it has deployed a system designed to detect third-party hardware cheat devices like <a href="https://store.xim.tech/XIM-APEX_p_18.html">XIM</a>, Cronus Zen and ReaSnow S1. "These devices act as a passthrough for controllers on PC and console and, when used improperly or maliciously, can provide a player with the ability to gain an unfair gameplay advantage, such as reducing or eliminating recoil," the team noted in a blog post.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At first, Ricochet will give players an "unsupported device warning" as shown above, but continued use could result in measures ranging from mitigations up to permabans across all <em>Call of Duty</em> titles.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also using a new replay investigation tool. "Using captured and stored match gameplay data, our teams can load up and watch any completed match as part of our investigation process," the team wrote. It'll focus on ranked play in both <em>Modern Warefare II</em> and Warzone 2.0, capturing and storing all match data for signs of suspicious activity. The system has already aided in investigations that resulted in permanent bans.</p><div id="b3ce61cb441645cdac29c1f3443753ad"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Activision revealed more about mitigations, as well. It has already talked about Damage Shield, which allows innocent players to take fire without being injured, and has now detailed the Disarm and Cloak measures. As shown in the Disarm demo above, after trying to switch weapons, a player ends up facing their opponent with no weapon at all. Cloak, as you'd imagine, turns enemies invisible.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft recently launched its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-mousetrap-system-lengthens-lag-punish-rainbow-six-siege-cheaters-020008802.html">own crackdown</a> that allows players to continue, albeit with significant handicaps, until they unplug cheat devices. Epic Games also recently pulled out the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/whats-new-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-3-season-4-paradise">perma-banhammer</a> for cheaters.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, Activision said its anti-cheat measures implemented in 2021 had led to a "<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=da117b2e-853d-490d-9d4c-d529d2fa776c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=callofduty&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkYTExN2IyZS04NTNkLTQ5MGQtOWQ0Yy1kNTI5ZDJmYTc3NmMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FsbG9mZHV0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIyLzA2L2NhbGwtb2YtZHV0eS1yaWNvY2hldC1hbnRpLWNoZWF0LXVwZGF0ZS1jb21tdW5pdHktcXVlc3Rpb25zLWFuc3dlcnMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY3OTQ5MjAwLWY5ODUtNDU5OS1iYjY5LTUwOTFmNDI3ZjdjNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAe4YtPPQQclBTyCxfSxFV8V9g7rOExzZwUKYP6hia9GS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.callofduty.com%2Fblog%2F2022%2F06%2Fcall-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-update-community-questions-answers">significant</a>" drop in cheaters.

## Best Buy’s new recycling program will let you mail in your old electronics

<p>Best Buy announced today that it’s extending its gadget recycling program to include a new mail-in option. The retailer will now sell you a box for your used electronics that you can ship back for recycling, saving a trip to the store. Best Buy says it’s recycled 2.7 billion pounds of electronics and appliances through its existing programs, describing itself as the US’ “largest retail collector of e-waste.”</p><p>The program lets you order a box in one of two sizes: a $23 small (9 x 5 x 3 inches) one for e-waste weighing up to six lbs and a $30 medium (18 x 14 x 4 inches) one supporting up to 15 lbs. After receiving it, you can pack in as many (approved) devices as you can fit, as long as they stay under the weight limits. Then, you can either take them to a UPS drop-off point or schedule a UPS pickup.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The program is an extension of Best Buy’s free in-store recycling program, launched in 2009. The retailer also provides a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-200-best-buy-will-haul-away-your-two-biggest-hunks-of-junk-191103369.html">home-pickup option</a>, but it costs $200 and is ideal for unusually cumbersome items like home theater and heavy appliances. All of its recycling initiatives accept computers, tablets, TVs, smartphones, radios, appliances, cameras and other common gadgets. (You can read the complete list and exclusions <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5e0bed65-d2f8-4b34-9b8f-955218c0e37a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Best+Buy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZTBiZWQ2NS1kMmY4LTRiMzQtOWI4Zi05NTUyMThjMGUzN2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVzdGJ1eS5jb20vc2l0ZS9yZWN5Y2xpbmcvbWFpbC1pbi1zZXJ2aWNlL3BjbWNhdDE2Nzc3OTQzNDMzMTIuYz9pZD1wY21jYXQxNjc3Nzk0MzQzMzEyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0NzYzNmJhOS1lYmNmLTRhNTQtOTNkMC1mMzlmNDBmNDBjMmEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZIZ0h-FTEuZrEeCshFAv25CNEIDdgY1MDlZpiZ46J1t&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Frecycling%2Fmail-in-service%2Fpcmcat1677794343312.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1677794343312">here</a>.)</p><p>The free in-store recycling program would be more practical unless you live far from a Best Buy location. Still, I can see some people willing to pay to avoid making the trip — especially during the holiday shopping season or if you have disposable income and live in a congested area. If nothing else, Earth Day (April 22nd) is an appropriate time to raise awareness of e-waste recycling to nudge people away from throwing these items in the trash, where they’ll get hauled off to landfills.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-buys-new-recycling-program-will-let-you-mail-in-your-old-electronics-100030769.html?src=rss

<p>Nintendo has been repairing Switch players' Joy-Con "drift" issues for free, even if they're no longer under warranty, in North America since 2019. Over the past years, it has launched the same program in France and Latin America. Now, the gaming giant has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/nintendo-promises-unlimited-repairs-for-drifting-joy-cons-throughout-europe/">expanded</a> its free unlimited repair service for drifting Joy-Cons to the European Economic Area (EEA), UK and Switzerland "until further notice."

Further, it will fix the known problem for users even if it's "caused by wear and tear."</p><p>Switch players in Europe are already pretty well-protected with a warranty that lasts for 24 months instead of merely 12. When the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-european-union-151738223.html">urged an investigation</a> into the Joy-Con drift issue back in 2021, it said 88 percent of the 25,000 complaints it received were from people whose controllers showed symptoms of the problem within the first two years. That means the standard warranty in Europe would be able to cover most people's repairs.

<p>Artificial intelligence has reached a new level of interest ever since ChatGPT burst into the scene. The AI chatbot with its eerily human-like responses has lit a fire under many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-is-switching-to-a-more-capable-language-model-ceo-confirms-133028933.html">tech giants</a> and smaller tech companies that are now rushing to release their rival offerings. US President Joe Biden, however, wants them to be careful and make sure that their products are safe before opening them up to the public. According to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-artificial-intelligence-science-technology-chatgpt-6948df344041ef1e794d199595bf69e9"><em>AP</em></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-discuss-risks-ai-tuesday-meeting-with-science-advisers-2023-04-04/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the president has met up with his science and technology advisors, which include academics and executives from Google and Microsoft, to discuss the &quot;risks and opportunities&quot; of artificial intelligence.</p><p>While the meeting likely won't culminate in a banning of ChatGPT like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/italy-to-block-chatgpt-over-data-protection-issues-134922771.html">what happened in Italy</a>, the president doesn't seem to be convinced that AI is perfectly safe at this point in time. When asked if AI is dangerous, he responded: &quot;It remains to be seen. Could be.&quot; He told the group:&quot; &quot;Tech companies have a responsibility, in my view, to make sure their products are safe before making them public...AI can help deal with some very difficult challenges like disease and climate change, but it also has to address the potential risks to our society, to our economy, to our national security.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The White House told the news organizations that the president also used the opportunity to discuss &quot;the importance of protecting rights and safety to ensure responsible innovation and appropriate safeguards.&quot; Further, he talked about his <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/protecting-kids-online-to-be-cornerstone-of-biden-state-of-union">previous calls on Congress</a> to pass legislation that would protect kids' privacy online.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn't sound like policies were made and big changes were planned during the meeting. But Russell Wald from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence told <em>AP</em> that the president has set &quot;the stage for a national dialogue on the topic by elevating attention to AI.&quot; Last year, the Biden administration also released its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/white-house-unveils-its-blueprint-for-an-ai-bill-of-rights-175912494.html">Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a>. It's meant to guide the design and deployment of AI and other automated systems in a way that protects &quot;the American public in the age of artificial intelligence.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/biden-says-it-remains-to-be-seen-if-ai-is-dangerous-042300227.html?src=rss

Additionally, it adds ComfortLight Pro, which adjusts the front light’s color temperature and brightness to reduce eye strain. Kobo says its battery lasts longer, especially when using the stylus, although its description is only as specific as “weeks of battery life.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Kobo says the new e-reader has a faster (dual-core 2GHz) processor, leading to lower latency and speedier zooming / page-turning. It also includes the Kobo Stylus 2, an improved (rechargeable and 25 percent lighter) digital pen for jotting notes. The stylus has an “eraser” on its back end and a separate highlighter button. In addition, the optional SleepCover includes a magnetic attachment for stashing away the stylus when you aren’t using it. Finally, the device has an improved design using recycled plastic and metals.</p><figure><img alt="A man sitting on the couch, writing notes (with a stylus) on the Kobo Elipsa 2E e-reader." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/12a7caa0-c8dc-11ed-b9ff-d3452a1acdbc" style="height: 1500; width: 2500;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kobo</div></figure><p>The Rakuten-owned company announced the launch of Kobo Plus, its answer to Kindle Unlimited and Audible.
