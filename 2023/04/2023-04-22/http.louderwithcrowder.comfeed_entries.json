It wasn't easy. I trained hard, harder than anyone else I know. But I was made for this, an unstoppable force. A life dedicated to perfection.\" </p><p>The camera then pans to a clearly male athlete lining up against this young girl as the voiceover says, \"But even perfection wouldn't be enough.\"</p><p>The ad then goes through clips and headlines of biological males dominating women's sports - like <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/male-track-star-steals-national-championship-from-a-woman-because-transgender\" target=\"_blank\">CeCe Telfer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-espn-womens-history\" target=\"_blank\">Lia Thomas</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fallon-fox-brags-terf\" target=\"_blank\">Fallon Fox</a>. Telfer won an NCAA title in track for the women after competing as a man for years. Thomas of course won an NCAA title and broke several women's swimming records. And Fox fractured a woman's orbital bone during an MMA fight. </p><p>I still don't understand why ads have absolutely nothing to do with the products they're selling anymore. But this one I agree with, so I'm okay with it. Yes, I am aware that makes me a hypocrite. No, I do not care. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.
