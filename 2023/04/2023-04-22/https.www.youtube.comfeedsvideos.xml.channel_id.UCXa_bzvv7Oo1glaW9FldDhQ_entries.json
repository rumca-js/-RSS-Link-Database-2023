So as we count down the days to its release, here, we're going to go over some key things that you should know about\u00a0The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B03hfdHi3AA", "date_published": "2023-04-22 15:30:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "The Fall and Rise of Dead Island 2", "description": "Sadly, there have been and continue to be plenty of examples in the games industry of projects being in development hell, and until not that long ago, Dead Island 2\u00a0fell in that group. First announced nearly a decade ago, the game has gone through its fair share of behind the scenes issues (to say the very least), from multiple delays to changing developers and more. \n\nAt long last, the game is now finally out, but even so, its history continues to intrigue us. As such, now that\u00a0Dead Island 2\u00a0has finally managed to release, here, we're going to take a look back at its long and troubled development cycle.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNpqe_5rwjs", "date_published": "2023-04-22 13:30:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "In the end,\u00a0Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores\u00a0is incredibly easy to recommend. If\u00a0you enjoyed Forbidden West\u00a0or if you're invested in the\u00a0Horizon\u00a0series' larger story and where it's headed, the expansion feels unmissable almost to a surprising degree thanks to its strong story and how well it sets up the future. \n\nAll of that is backed up by more exciting combat, engaging open world exploration and traversal, and stellar graphics. The end result? An excellent package that almost feels like it's too good to be DLC.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VC_gI9AaEI", "date_published": "2023-04-22 11:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
