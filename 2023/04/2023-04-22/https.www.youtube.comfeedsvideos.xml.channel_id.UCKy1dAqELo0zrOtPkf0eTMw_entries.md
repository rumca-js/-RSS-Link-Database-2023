The Unrecord gameplay came out earlier this week and everyone is talking about how realistic it looks. It turns out there's actually an old build of the game floating around the internet from 2022 that shows off the concept version of the game. So we downloaded it to see if this game is legit or just an elaborate hoax. It turns out it is indeed real and one of the most realistic-looking games we've seen. The game Unrecord does not currently have a release date. But if you want to know when the Unrecord release is going to happen, you can wishlist it on Steam right now. Of course, we'll let you know when the Steam Unrecord release date is revealed, but in the meantime here's what we know about it so far. In addition, we've captured some Unrecord gameplay from the 2022 build to share with you. The Unrecord FPS title just came out and the Unrecord trailer shows off some major updates over the 2022 version. Now there are on-screen prompts and dialogue changes to name a few. This Unreal engine game is sporting  Unreal 5 technology and uses it in a way that has impressed everyone. Stay tuned for more details as they come in!

From the developers: "There's nothing a grenade or two can't fix. And if that doesn't work, a dozen more will do the trick! No matter how messed up the world is, for Bing the adventure-loving escapist, it's just one big playground! Bing is both a child and a warrior. He has the innocence and mischief, as well as the warrior's fearlessness and resilience. No one can say which quality is more valuable in a world full of catastrophes. Perhaps one needs to have a bit of both to survive. Hunters can add Bing to their roster with the global launch of Torchlight: Infinite and the new season from May 9th, 5PM PDT!"
