Things appeared ominous when they trailed to Wolves inside 13 minutes but Kelechi Iheanacho levelled from the penalty spot before Timothy Castagne sidefooted in the winner to record their first triumph in 11 matches. Dean Smith, a picture of calm as Castagne converted Victor Kristiansen\u2019s low cross with 15 minutes to play, would be the first to say Leicester still have much to do.</p><p>Suddenly this stadium was rocking, the Leicester crowd bopping and singing Smith\u2019s name. Until an unfortunate slip by Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 saw the Wolves goalkeeper catch Jamie Vardy\u2019s right ankle inside the box in the 34th minute, Leicester were deep in trouble. Vardy hobbled to the sidelines and Iheanacho, after a staggered run-up, sent S\u00e1 the wrong way. Matheus Cunha gave Wolves the lead, powering a shot into the corner after an alert Mario Lemina pickpocketed Youri Tielemans on the edge of the Leicester box. Cunha and Craig Dawson had efforts blocked as Wolves went in search of a second goal but they never seemed to truly recover from conceding.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/22/leicester-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/22/leicester-wolves-premier-league-match-report", "date_published": "2023-04-22 16:04:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Everton hold on for point at Crystal Palace after Holgate red card", "description": "<p>As Premier League spectacles go, Gareth Southgate will know he could easily have picked a more entertaining way to spend his Saturday afternoon.
