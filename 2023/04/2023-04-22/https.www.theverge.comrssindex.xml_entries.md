  <p id="mkslAC">Out of all the streaming services I use — Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, and Funimation — Discovery Plus is the one that I use the most. And I don’t even get it for free through some kind of promotion — I actually <em>pay</em> for it.</p>
<p id="SQ6jui">At just $4.99 per month (or $6.99 without ads), it’s one of the cheapest streaming options out there, and for me, those five bucks go a long way. Discovery Plus is a melting pot of all the unscripted reality shows from Discovery itself, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigate Discovery, The History Channel, and a handful of other networks that I haven’t even heard of before, like “Quest.” </p>
<p id="wT4ExQ">That means it has some of the most bizarre, disturbing, cringe-worthy, and downright disgusting TV shows that I’ve ever...</p>

  <p id="omp2WZ">As I installed the original <em>Final Fantasy</em>, a game that first came out when I was three years old, on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">Sony’s most advanced console to date</a>, I came to a realization: almost everything I’ve played this year has been old. Between the remakes, rereleases, and retro collections, it’s been a deluge of nostalgia. And I, for one, have welcomed it.</p>
<p id="Ba7w6Y">These kinds of releases are nothing new, of course. What’s been different through the early months is the sheer quantity of classic releases. Two of the biggest blockbusters so far this year — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23567481/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-ps5-xbox-pc-review"><em>Dead Space</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Resident Evil 4</em></a> — are remakes of titles from well over a decade ago. They’re both slick and gorgeous updates that don’t look out of place amongst modern big-budget releases, but part of what makes...</p>

  		 <p>A trip to Big Bear in Rivian’s electric SUV showcases why it’s one of the most compelling vehicles on sale. As a first effort from a new automaker, it’s even more impressive.</p>

<p id="GlL7lI">It’s true, there’s not a lot to distinguish this as <em>the Google foldable</em> in this video alone — no logos, no distinctive design touches like a big camera bar, just a selfie camera up front, internal bezels, and a folding screen with rounded edges. It looks like it could be a Samsung prototype as easily as a Google device. </p>
