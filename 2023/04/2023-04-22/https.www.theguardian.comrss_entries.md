One of the biggest is that I am a romantic, a feeler of big feels, a declarer of every possible emotion. My husband, in contrast, is the strong silent type. Mostly silent. It has led to more than a few fights, me accusing him of not caring; him replying that love isn’t – doesn’t have to be – a song and dance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/23/the-moment-i-knew-his-accident-in-a-weird-way-was-a-renewal-of-our-vows">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘My remaining 13 million minutes’: productivity, ambition and being realistic in older age

<p>The three-stage life – learn, earn, retire – seems outdated, but what model should we replace it with?</p><p>When my mother died and my own “mortality alarm” went off, I found myself thinking deeply about ageing and the best approach to engage with it. My mum was nearly 100 when she died and my dad is alive and well in his 90s. With a bit of luck and if I stay fit and look after my health, I have a good chance of surviving into my 90s too. But is long life, as increasing numbers of us are experiencing, a blessing or a curse? I’d happily accept just 25 more years which would take me to 85. But I don’t just want a long life, I want to be productive to society. In fact, I’m committing to using my remaining 13 million minutes to age as productively as possible.</p><p>But in 2023 and following the disruption of the pandemic, what does productivity mean? Is retirement, in the traditional sense of taking a step back, still an aspiration? As a self-described Juvenile Geriatric – someone who’s begun their ageing journey but isn’t officially “old” (in Australia an ‘older adult’ is 65+) – I was brought up in the culture of a three-stage life: learn, earn and retire. But for many of us, that model feels like an outdated version. So what does the new model look like?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/22/my-remaining-13-million-minutes-productivity-ambition-and-being-realistic-in-older-age">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Pop Group’s lead singer, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/21/mark-stewart-pop-group-frontman-dies-aged-62">has died at 62</a>, whipped political confrontation into a thrilling mix of avant-funk and crashing soundscapes</p><p>In September 1978, the NME put a band made up of teenagers who had yet to release a record on its cover. It was the kind of dramatic, impulsive move to which the music press was occasionally prone, the sort of thing that invariably led to accusations of overheated hype or reckless desperation. By the autumn of 1978, punk was clearly winding down, or at least being co-opted by less artful practitioners than those in its first wave – the big new noise in that area was the terrace-chant choruses and political populism of Sham 69 – so the hunt was clearly on among journalists for something different, a situation that often led them to make rash choices. But The Pop Group, whose frontman Mark Stewart glowered on the NME’s cover, were anything but a desperate hype or a rash choice. Barely out of school, they were in the process of helping to define what became known as post-punk: jagged guitars, funk-inspired rhythms, a bold spirit of experimentation, dub-influenced soundscapes, anything but traditional rock. It’s tempting to say you could tell they were barely out of school. For all the apparent anguish in Stewart’s vocals, their music seemed powered by a youthful enthusiasm that was wild to the point of seeming deranged: it sounded like it was throwing everything they were interested in at you at once. Some people found it overwhelming, an off-putting, chaotic racket. Others were completely entranced. The Pop Group, Nick Cave later claimed, “changed everything” for him: “it was so direct, so musically inventive, so improvised”.</p><p>What The Pop Group threw at you was largely the result of Mark Stewart’s eclectic, autodidactic musical education, an education that seemed founded on an insatiable curiosity, but which he always claimed was mostly facilitated by his towering height. Already 6ft 6ins by the time he was 12, Stewart not only absorbed what he saw on the TV or heard on the radio (he was a huge fan of glam rock) but also was able to get into places usually off-limits for anyone his age, including reggae-fuelled blues parties in Bristol’s St Paul’s district, and soul clubs where he encountered tough dancefloor funk and jazz and the curious moment in 1975 when some soul fans began dressing in a style that presaged punk – mohair jumpers, spiked hair and the pegged trousers and 1950s suits that became The Pop Group’s initial onstage uniform. There was also a local underground bookshop, where he took in radical political tracts, situationist texts and cultural theory, all of which coursed through The Pop Group’s lyrics and notoriously argumentative interviews: the writer Simon Reynolds subsequently compared reading a feature about The Pop Group to having “your brain set on fire”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/22/how-mark-stewart-set-the-tone-for-post-punk-protest-music">Continue reading...</a>

Something similar applies to western thinking about the People’s Republic of China. When that country’s rulers embarked on their astonishing programme of industrialisation, we said that if they wanted capitalism (and they clearly did) then they would have to have democracy. Their response: we’ll have the capitalism but we’ll give the democracy stuff a miss.</p><p>Then, in the 1990s, when they decided that they wanted the internet, Bill Clinton and co opined that if they wanted the net then they would also have to have openness (and, therefore, ultimately, democracy).

And then they went on to build the only technological sector that rivals that of the US and could, conceivably, surpass it in due course.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/22/can-china-keep-generative-ai-under-its-control-well-it-contained-the-internet">Continue reading...</a>

In the myriad fascinating storylines – a potential women’s world record, Mo Farah’s last dance over 26.2 miles and four of the five fastest men in history slugging it out – there is an intriguing multimillion-dollar subplot that pits brand against brand, and super shoe against super shoe.</p><p>Since the creation of these shoes in 2016, Nike athletes have dominated the marathon – and the company has reaped the financial rewards. Having world record-holder Eliud Kipchoge in the famous swoosh helped, of course. But it wasn’t just him. In 2019, Nike athletes took 31 of the 36 podium places in the six marathon majors. It sent a subliminal message to ordinary runners. Want to smash your personal bests? Buy Nike’s Vaporfly or AlphaFly shoes.

<p>The Lego Professor of Play explains how to explore, interact and enjoy time with your young children as they learn about the world around them</p><p>Play is a fundamental part of childhood – it is one of the key ways in which children explore the world and engage with people and objects. It occurs throughout childhood, changing as children grow – through moving and shaking objects as babies, then building blocks up and knocking them down, then playing imaginary games with parents and then siblings and friends, to more organised games with rules and playing outside. Play changes again as children get older, and though teenagers and adults don’t often talk about going to play, for many people it remains part of their lives as they age, whether that’s through sports and other games with friends, online gaming, or the more<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/17/mystery-board-games-christmas-sales-boom" title=""> recent resurgence of board games</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/30/physical-play-with-fathers-may-help-children-control-emotions-study-finds" title="">Parents are often a child’s first playmate</a> and there is a lot that parents can give in playing with their young children, even very young babies. Through playing with a parent, children can learn about themselves and the world around them, and acquire important skills like taking turns and managing emotions. Playful interactions and having fun together also help strengthen the important relationship between you and your child. This doesn’t just mean sitting on a mat with your baby and their toys. A lot of play in early life happens during day-to-day activities, like a game of peekaboo when getting dressed and blowing bubbles or splashing in the bath.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/22/get-stuck-in-but-let-them-lead-an-experts-guide-to-playing-with-your-children">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Terrible people do awful things, deliciously, in this satire of a competitive relationship between artists</p><p>There’s something deliciously bracing about films that deal with terrible people behaving appallingly. And the mean-spirited and spitefully enjoyable Norwegian-language satire <em>Sick </em><em>of Myself</em> certainly doesn’t disappoint on that count. Signe (Kristine Kujath Thorp, fully committed to the deranged narcissism of the character) is disgruntled that the artistic success of her sculptor boyfriend, Thomas (Eirik Sæther), means that she is no longer the centre of attention. To bring the focus back on to herself, Signe covertly consumes a banned Russian medication (bought for her on the dark web by a lovesick computer nerd), a drug that had been recalled from the market after it caused horrific, disfiguring skin rashes. The unexplained welts and sores on Signe’s face baffle the medical establishment and, for a while at least, earn her the celebrity she craves.</p><p>Tonally, it’s like a cross between the malicious wit of Ruben Östlund’s recent pictures and the lurid excesses of John Waters’ early film <em>Female Trouble</em> (it’s no surprise to learn that Waters put it in his top 10 list for last year).

The TV presenter, 66, talks about teenage car crashes, packing in smoking, how he became a journalist and why taking yourself seriously is daft<p><strong>Mum was a gifted </strong>child-raiser. My happy childhood was down to her. Tiptoeing around Dad’s explosive outbursts was normal. He was loving, but short-tempered. When I wrote about our relationship, people jumped on the stories of him chasing me round the house and hitting me with a bamboo stick. I never laid a hand on my kids, and would never defend it. But in the 1960s, it wasn’t seen as abuse like today.</p><p><strong>I had every intention</strong> of going to university. Then during my post-O-level summer I wrote to a local paper asking for work experience. In a hostile reply, the editor told me to fuck off. Then an apology came. I was invited into the office: 20 minutes after arriving, I was offered a full-time job. I dropped out of school and never looked back.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/22/richard-madeley-this-much-i-know-i-dont-care-about-the-alan-partridge-comparisons">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>O2 Arena, London</strong><br />Smith trades unrequited love for lustful liberation in a maximalist show with an Elton-meets-Lizzo energy – and the occasional sorrowful pause</p><p>A giant golden statue of the goddess Aphrodite lies recumbent on the stage. The action of Sam Smith’s gig plays out atop, along and in front of her body; musicians nestle in her nooks, dancers dry hump her curves. The suggestion seems to be that we are all her creatures – inspired by beauty, buffeted by desire, perpetually seeking love.</p><p>Although a Greek deity is the show’s organising principle – its three chapters are labelled Love, Beauty and Sex – you wouldn’t necessarily call all the antics that unfold over the next couple of hours classic, exactly. So much about this Gloria tour, in support of Smith’s recent <a href="https://theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/28/sam-smith-gloria-review-the-lovelorn-balladeer-turns-to-the-dancefloor-ed-sheeran">album of the same name</a>, is gaudy, over the top and maximalist – as you would expect from an arena-level undertaking – not to mention playful, knowing and redolent of Spinal Tap’s taste for set design. For Gloria, Smith has sloughed off their middle-of-the-road image in favour of something more liberated – and sexualised.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/22/sam-smith-review-o2-arena-london-gloria">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Opera House; Barbican; Kings Place, London</strong><br />A big week for Finnish music and musicians led by Kaija Saariaho’s powerful opera about a school shooting, and a thrilling Bartok performance</p><p>As if immobilised by an alien force, the audience scarcely stirred for the 105-minute duration of <strong><a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/innocence-by-simon-stone-details">Innocence</a></strong> by the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho (1952-). This international joint commission was given its UK premiere at the Royal Opera House last Monday. Since the subject matter is gun violence, specifically a school shooting in Finland and its aftermath, we knew what lay ahead. The impact, however, is primarily meditative, the suspense psychological rather than theatrical or dogmatic. First seen in Aix-en-Provence in 2021, with mostly the same cast and artistic team, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDA4Hh6npc">Innocence</a></em> was – as then – conducted by Susanna Mälkki and directed by Simon Stone (<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/19/phaedra-simon-stone-national-theatre-janet-mcteer-review-sylvia-musica-old-vic-kate-prince-beverley-knight-standing-at-the-skys-edge-national-chris-bush-richard-hawley">Phaedra</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/19/phaedra-simon-stone-national-theatre-janet-mcteer-review-sylvia-musica-old-vic-kate-prince-beverley-knight-standing-at-the-skys-edge-national-chris-bush-richard-hawley">, National Theatre</a>), both making welcome house debuts.</p><p>To a crisp libretto by the Finnish writer Sofi Oksanen, with translation and dramaturgy by Aleksi Barrière, the action shifts across two timelines. A wedding is taking place, 10 years after the attack in which 10 students and a teacher were killed. The groom is the gunman’s brother. The bride knows nothing of the tragedy but the secret cannot be kept. Threads are drawn together until, in a final twist, we understand the story’s awful resonance.

<p>Despite a legacy tainted by PC-baiting provocation, many will remember Humphries with affection as the carnivalesque Dame Edna and foul-mouthed Sir Les Patterson</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/22/barry-humphries-dies-australian-comedian-death-dead-dame-edna-everage-sir-les-patterson">Barry Humphries, Australian comedian and creator of Dame Edna Everage, dies aged 89</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/live/2023/apr/22/barry-humphries-dead-tributes-dame-edna-everage-latest-news">Tributes pour in for Barry Humphries – latest updates</a></li></ul><p>When any well-loved entertainer dies, it’s sad. Now Barry Humphries has died, and maybe it’s more so – because we’re losing not only Humphries, but his alter egos too, characters more fleshed-out and better known to the public than Humphries himself. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/nov/17/barry-humphries-farewell-tour-london-review">Dame Edna</a> was among the most enduring personas comedy has ever seen, and undoubtedly one of the greatest. With her, and Sir Les Patterson, and with his contributions to Britain’s 60s satire boom, Humphries added to the gaiety of cultures (and subtracted from their dignity) across half a century and the span of the globe.</p><p>You don’t need to be Sigmund Freud to trace the source of Humphries’s outre comedy back to his repressive upbringing in 1930s Melbourne, and specifically his mother, who divided the world into things that were “nice” and things that were “uncalled for”. No one in mid-century Australia was calling for a mocking comedy that ridiculed suburban mores – and by association, narrow-minded, unsophisticated Australia itself. But that’s what Humphries gave them, first with “Mrs Norm Everage”, the surprisingly demure first incarnation of his greatest creation, then with his Barry McKenzie comic strip (and later, films) about a dimwit Aussie expat, which led to the book of the comic strip being banned in his home country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/22/barry-humphries-alter-egos-dame-edna-everage-sir-les-patterson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A fold-over filo pie stuffed with mushrooms, spuds, onions and creamy ‘cheese’. Plus Marmite butter, if you’re of that persuasion</p><p><em>Bougatsa</em> for breakfast is one of my favourite Greek traditions –<strong> </strong> hot from the oven, dusted in cinnamon-laced icing sugar and chopped up by an efficient, serious-looking chef (I don’t know why they are always so stern, but it seems to be a common character trait). And while that is how bougatsa is most commonly found, you can get savoury, mincemeat-filled versions, too. Today’s recipe is how I make mine, but feel free to play around with it – if you have a particular vegan cheese you like, say, crumble or grate some into the filling. And if you are a Marmite-hater, please don’t be put off by the Marmite butter finish: it isn’t a yeasty smack in the face, but more a salty, seasoned glaze that adds a pleasing depth to the whole thing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/22/vegan-bougatsa-recipe-mushroom-caramelised-onion-georgina-hayden">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘The film industry is gone’: Jim Jarmusch on the his debut album, the death of filmmaking and the joy of mistakes

<p>At 70, the outsider movie hero is releasing his first album. He muses on music, the demise of film and finding joy in mistakes</p><p>There are few film-makers quite as particular about music as Jim Jarmusch. Over the years, he’s enlisted Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA to score his hitman-meets-samurai flick Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, had Tom Waits and Iggy Pop jacked up on caffeine and locking horns in a thick swirl of smoke in 2003’s Coffee and Cigarettes, and got Neil Young to let rip some improvised guitar for the soundtrack to Dead Man. Not to mention that his films feature acting turns by everyone from Joe Strummer to Screamin’ Jay Hawkins and he directed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/17/gimme-danger-review-jim-jarmusch-iggy-pop-documentary" title="">documentary on the Stooges</a> along the way.</p><p>“Music’s always been there,” he says, in his unmistakable deep baritone register, speaking from New York. “Since being a teenager, music has been something that shaped my life and the decisions I’ve made throughout it.” But for the last decade, Jarmusch has evolved from avid admirer and astute curator to making music for his own movies with producer and musician Carter Logan in their band <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/25/jim-jarmusch-film-director-rock-star-squrl" title="">Sqürl</a>.

The various permutations of a starting XI that Javi Gracia could turn to, suggest a lack of clarity. In short, the sun is not currently shining on the Lilywhites of west Yorkshire.</p><p>For the Lilywhites of west London things are far rosier. While a slump in form has all-but ended hopes of European football next season, a win last week means that they will be in the Premier League at the very least – an achievement that should not be overlooked given the preseason predictions of doom. Now, even with the talismanic Aleksandar Mitrović serving a long suspension, Marco Silva appears to have found new ways to win. In the victory at Everton, Daniel James – who I am still convinced actually plays for Leeds – was the attacking focal point. The battle for Fulham now is the motivation to keep playing with so little on the line. Leeds will be hoping to find their hosts on the preverbial beach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/apr/22/fulham-v-leeds-united-premier-league-live-score-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I had always wanted to be a mother, but after three unsuccessful rounds of IVF, I decided to stop trying. What could I learn from the people who have chosen not to be parents?</p><p>It was my hen do in the Lake District and my friends had organised a game of Mr and Mrs. The idea, for the uninitiated, is to test how well you know your future spouse. Beforehand, they quizzed Ian, my intended, and then repeated the exercise with me, with extra fizzy wine. It began with the usual stuff (Where was your first kiss? Who is the better dresser?) but then they asked a question that suddenly sobered me up: “What is your greatest fear?”</p><p>I wondered whether to answer honestly. I instinctively knew the truth but was aware it might kill the vibe. I went for it anyway. “Not being able to have children,” I said. There was a momentary hush before one of the hens played a video of Ian guessing the rather more sweeping “Failure”, and someone filled my glass to the brim. I was 36.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/22/not-being-able-to-have-a-baby-was-devastating-then-i-found-people-who-embraced-a-childfree-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Quantum computers will remake our world, curing cancer and fixing the climate crisis, says the scientist and sci-fi fan – but can they be made to work?</p><p>Have you been feeling anxious about technology lately? If so, you’re in good company. The United Nations has <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/artificial-intelligence-unesco-calls-all-governments-implement-global-ethical-framework-without" title="">urged</a> all governments to implement a set of rules designed to rein in artificial intelligence. An <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/" title="">open letter</a>, signed by such luminaries as Yuval Noah Harari and Elon Musk, called for research into the most advanced AI to be paused and measures taken to ensure it remains “safe … trustworthy, and loyal”. These pangs followed the launch last year of ChatGPT, a chatbot that can write you an essay on Milton as easily as it can generate a recipe for everything you happen to have in your cupboard that evening.</p><p>But what if the computers used to develop AI were replaced by ones able to make calculations not millions, but trillions of times faster? What if tasks that might take thousands of years to perform on today’s devices could be completed in a matter of seconds? Well, that’s precisely the future that physicist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/03/string-theory-michio-kaku-aliens-god-equation-large-hadron-collider" title="">Michio Kaku</a> is predicting. He believes we are about to leave the digital age behind for a quantum era that will bring unimaginable scientific and societal change. Computers will no longer use transistors, but subatomic particles, to make calculations, unleashing incredible processing power. Another physicist has likened it to putting “a rocket engine in your car”.

<p>Netflix’s featherweight A Tourist’s Guide to Love follows a familiar arc, but there’s more to fall for in classics from Summertime to The Green Ray</p><p>There’s nothing new under the sun in <strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81424906">A Tourist’s Guide to Love</a></strong> – though there’s an awful lot of that sun, brightening every postcard shot in this featherweight Netflix romcom, and for viewers starved of warmth after a long, dreary winter, that’s enough of a lure. It follows a familiar arc: reeling from a breakup, a perky travel executive (Rachael Leigh Cook) takes a trip to Vietnam for notional work reasons, only to be swept off her feet by her charming local tour guide (Scott Lý). The film hits every holiday-romance beat you expect, but it hardly needs to shake things up: cinema has a proud and comforting tradition of stories in which a trip somewhere sunny and far away proves just the ticket for a character whose life has hit the skids.</p><p>My favourite example of the form – the fine wine to the budget lambrini of <em>A Tourist’s Guide to Love</em> – remains David Lean’s<a href="https://pluto.tv/en/search/details/movies/summertime-1955-1-1"> </a><strong><a href="https://pluto.tv/en/search/details/movies/summertime-1955-1-1">Summertime</a></strong> (oddly available to stream only on the free, ad-supported service Pluto). Its story of a buttoned-up, middle-aged American secretary splurging her savings on a long-desired trip to Venice and finding, with a suave Italian antique dealer, the kind of spontaneous romance she’s never known, is the platonic ideal of the genre: bathed in sunshine and Technicolor, the character blooms before our eyes, but the happy ending is compromised and complex, and richer for it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/22/streaming-the-best-holiday-romance-films">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Just Stop Oil protest not the only bad news for the sport – but entertainment at the Crucible is perhaps the best it’s ever been</p><p>When a Just Stop Oil activist disrupted the world championship snooker match between Joe Perry and Robert Milkins in its early stages on Monday night, the players looked suitably bemused. Simply going about their cue-swinging business before the table was rendered unplayable, they could have been forgiven for wondering why a pair of mild-mannered, middle-aged snooker players were being targeted by the protest group in their drive to “stop all new UK fossil fuel projects”, and their calls for “UK sporting institutions to step into civil resistance against the government’s genocidal policies”.</p><p>Of course it was nothing personal and it might have been any two players inconvenienced, as the unsuccessful attempt of another activist to simultaneously vandalise the adjacent table at the Crucible showed. The protesters simply wished to raise awareness of their cause, an ambition they can argue was achieved successfully, given it was the subject of widespread international media coverage and I’m writing about it several days later.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/22/empty-pockets-how-snooker-can-reduce-the-temptation-of-match-fixing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the week of the Wolf Hall author’s memorial, her husband and agent talk about the Jane Austen satire she was working on when she died in 2022. Read an exclusive extract from it here, along with her earliest published work</p><p>“What might she have written next?” asked Margaret Atwood in her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/23/hilary-mantel-remembered-she-was-the-queen-of-literature" title="">tribute to Hilary Mantel</a>, after the Booker prize-winning novelist’s sudden death in September last year. “I don’t know, but I will miss it.” In this, she spoke for readers around the world, eagerly awaiting a new book from the author of the Wolf Hall trilogy. Aside from her Cromwell novels, Mantel had a habit of confounding expectations, with each new work so different from its predecessor.</p><p>We now know the answer to Atwood’s question: Mantel was working on a rewriting of Pride and Prejudice, told from the perspective of the overlooked middle sister Mary Bennet, to be titled Provocation. Even more intriguingly, it was planned as a mischievous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/janeausten">Austen</a> mashup, with characters from all her novels making an appearance in unfamiliar guises. From 2,000 pages of bloody Tudor pageantry to Austen’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview2#:~:text=Not%20long%20before%20her%20death,two%20imagined%20inches%20of%20ivory." title="">two-inches of ivory</a>, it is a dizzying shift in scale. “I think she thought, ‘I can just have a whole load of fun,’” says her long-term agent, Bill Hamilton. “She felt that it was time to get away from the really serious research and the big historical novels, to do something lighter.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/22/my-last-words-to-her-were-i-wont-be-long-hilary-mantel-husband-on-her-last-days-and-the-novel-she-left-behind">Continue reading...</a>

## Time Come: Selected Prose by Linton Kwesi Johnson review – voice of a generation

<p>A collection of the radical poet’s writing charts a groundbreaking career chronicling the black British experience</p><p>One Saturday afternoon in 1972, Linton Kwesi Johnson was walking through Brixton market when he noticed three plainclothes police officers arresting a young man. Seeing their excessive use of force, his training kicked in. He had been in the youth section of the British Black Panthers and knew to write down the name and address of someone in a situation like this, because “the police would often arrest black youths and lock them up in remand centres without informing their next of kin”. But in retaliation the officers arrested Johnson too, throwing him into the back of a police van where they beat him up and racially abused him. It would take more than six months before he was acquitted of the charges of assault levelled against him.</p><p>This anecdote, buried in this new collection of Johnson’s prose, braids together the themes of the book and even his life: a practised solidarity with his fellow man, the workings of a racist state, and the vitality of the black radical tradition. It also reminds us of the brutal contingencies of a life like his. LKJ, as he is known, is now recognised as one of the great living poets of the counterculture. Penguin has anthologised his verse. He has honorary degrees and awards to his name. But he was once a young militant trying to survive a hostile environment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/22/time-come-selected-prose-by-linton-kwesi-johnson-review-voice-of-a-generation">Continue reading...</a>

My phone was on like 11% battery when I got bundled into the car, and even though I can sense a very tense atmosphere I really do have to charge it before it turns itself off, but all the guards have iPhones when I need an Android charger and it’s a whole other thing.

## Share a bath, play the three-minute game and don’t catastrophise! How to have better sex

<p>From the first to time through to the menopause, expert advice on how to improve your sex life – no matter your age, experience or desire</p><p>There’s an irony – or maybe not – in the fact that since we’ve become more “open” about sex as a society, we’ve been having less of it. So sex is everywhere, but not so much in the nation’s bedrooms (or sitting room floors, or on the kitchen worktops or wherever else you might care to get down to it). The generation that had most sex was born in the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/psymon-says/202303/how-often-do-people-have-sex" title="">1930s</a> – the so-called silent generation; the generations that have it least are millennials, born between 1981 and 1996 and Gen Z who are born between 1997 and 2012.</p><p>In Britain, across all age groups, around <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/articles-reports/2020/02/24/how-much-sex-are-britons-having" title="">one in four</a> of us has sex at least once in an average week with almost one in 10 of us managing three times – but the older we are, the less common sex is. The average age someone <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/articles-reports/2023/03/01/what-age-did-britons-lose-their-virginity" title="">loses their virginity is 17</a>, with late twentysomethings having the most sex. But by our late 30s, four in 10 report having not had sex in the past week, and around a fifth of 40 to 44-year-olds aren’t having sex at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/22/how-to-have-better-sex">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Men my age aren’t good on their own. They’re needy’: Lesley Manville on being happily single and her big problem with Hollywood

<p>The Mike Leigh favourite has become an Oscar-nominated A-lister. She talks about her glamorous mother, her on-stage stamina and being left holding the baby by Gary Oldman</p><p>Before meeting Lesley Manville, I watch a preview of Citadel, the new Amazon spy thriller in which she stars alongside <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/richard-madden" title="">Richard Madden</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/29/bollywood-fair-skin-obsession-drove-me-away-priyanka-chopra-jonas" title="">Priyanka Chopra</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/stanley-tucci" title="">Stanley Tucci</a>. It’s glossy, supercharged, high-body-count, fights-to-the-death-in-speeding-train-lavatories TV. Punches have squelch sound effects. Hitmen are covered in blood splatter. Chopra is tossed about like a rag doll. Manville’s scenes are sedate by comparison. She plays an “incredibly bad” UK ambassador to the US – bowing to the boilerplate that the UK government is upper class, sadistic, speaking only in clipped Anglo-Saxon. All well and good. Until I ask Manville her view of the violence. She frowns. “Oh,” she says. “I can’t watch violence. I don’t watch any.”</p><p>“It’s a big topic, really,” she says. Possibly “too big” to cover here. She hesitates, perhaps sensing a conflict between principles and practice. She offers a disclaimer – she hasn’t seen the final edit of Citadel, isn’t certain of the full extent of the violence. Then: “I hate it, basically. I get offended by it. I really think it’s bad news. People talk about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/game-of-thrones-episode-by-episode" title="">Game of Thrones</a>. I’ve never been able to watch it. Also, it’s pretty violent towards women. I really don’t want to see that.” She shudders when I mention Quentin Tarantino’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantino-dazzling-dicaprio-pitt" title="">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a>. She watched it in Los Angeles with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/paul-thomas-anderson" title="">Paul Thomas Anderson</a>, director of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/07/phantom-thread-review-daniel-day-lewis-paul-thomas-anderson" title="">Phantom Thread</a>, for which she was nominated for an Oscar in 2018. Upsetting? “Yes. <em>Yes</em>.” Her position is not merely squeamish, it’s political. “I’m a woman, for a start. Being a woman is a political position,” she argues. “You need to understand what’s going on, the risks, what you’re up against.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/22/lesley-manville-hollywood-gary-oldman-citadel-amazon-prime">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a speedy alternative that doesn’t involve all that stirring, and there’s no stock required, either, which saves even more time. Boost the flavours by stirring a glass of dry vermouth or white wine into the soffritto and add aquafaba to give the beans the required texture while also saving waste.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/22/radish-tops-beanotto-zero-waste-cooking-risotto-recipe-tom-hunt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nato chief ‘confident’ Ukraine is ready to retake more territory; suspect in Pentagon leaks posted information earlier than previously thought – report</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he is “confident” that Ukraine is prepared to retake more territory as Kyiv readies for a new offensive against invading Russian forces.</strong> Stoltenberg told journalists in Germany when asked if Ukraine has what it needs to successfully execute the offensive: “I’m confident that they will now be in a position to be able to liberate even more land.” He also invited the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to the Nato summit in July and emphasised the need to support Ukraine’s battlefield logistics.</p><p><strong>Jack Teixeira, the US air national guardsman accused of leaking classified defence documents to a small group of gamers, posted sensitive information months earlier than previously known and to a much larger chat group</strong>, the New York Times has reported. In February 2022, soon after the invasion of Ukraine, a user profile matching that of Teixeira began posting secret intelligence on the Russian war effort on a previously undisclosed chat group of about 600 members on the social platform Discord. The Pentagon has declined to comment on the new report.</p><p><strong>A Moscow court has ordered the arrest in absentia of Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev, adding him to its</strong> <strong>list of “foreign agents”,</strong> <strong>state-owned news agency RIA has reported</strong>. Grozev is the lead Russia journalist for the Bellingcat news outlet, and played a key role in its investigation into the poisoning of the opposition politician Alexei Navalny.</p><p><strong>Germany, Poland and Ukraine signed an agreement on Friday for a hub to repair Leopard tanks used in Ukraine to fight Russian forces, Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said at a meeting of allies at the Ramstein airbase.</strong> He sounded a note of caution about any early invitation for Ukraine to join Nato. All parties agreed on how to finance such a hub, which will cost €150m-€200m a year and could begin operations at the end of May.</p><p><strong>International backing for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> holds “strong and true”, said the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, as he opened a meeting in Germany with allies to discuss further support for Kyiv.</strong> Austin confirmed the US is helping to train nine Ukrainian “storm” brigades for the counteroffensive and stressed the need to make Ukraine’s air defence system “robust” and “rigorous”. Austin said: “Our support for the forces of freedom in Ukraine holds strong and true. At today’s contact group meeting, we’ll focus on three key issues: air defence, ammunition and enablers.”</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has tweeted about the meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group in Ramstein</strong>, Germany, saying that Ukraine is “de facto already a part of the alliance’s security space” having reached “unprecedented levels of interoperability”.</p><p><strong>A Moscow court has issued a warrant for the arrest of the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, accusing the spy chief of organising “terrorist attacks” inside Russia, state-owned news agency RIA reported.</strong> RIA cited the court as saying that Budanov was accused of offences related to terrorism and arms smuggling. The move against him was announced “in absentia”, in an apparent acknowledgment that Budanov cannot be immediately detained.</p><p><strong>The Canadian government announced C$39m (£23.26m) in new military assistance for Ukraine including 40 sniper rifles, 16 radio sets and a donation to a Nato fund to help in the war.</strong> The latest round of Canadian aid, which also includes ammunition for the rifles, was announced by Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand, at the Ramstein airbase in Germany where Nato defence officials met to discuss further military supplies for Ukraine.</p><p><strong>The UK has imposed sanctions on five people linked to the arrest of the Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was jailed this week for 25 years.</strong> Elena Lenskaya, a judge who approved Kara-Murza’s arrest, along with Denis Kolesnikov and Andrei Zadachin, investigators involved in the arrest of Kara-Murza, will all be hit with sanctions. FSB agents Alexander Samofal and Konstantin Kudryavtsev, who followed Kara-Murza on multiple trips before he was poisoned in 2015, will be sanctioned as well.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-423-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
