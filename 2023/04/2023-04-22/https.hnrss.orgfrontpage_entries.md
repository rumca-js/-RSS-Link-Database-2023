## Tell HN: 2^4 == 4^2, extended to rationals
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35669101](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35669101)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage

<p>Last week there was a discussion about 2^4 == 4^2 (my search-fu is letting me down - I can't find it again, or I'd link it).  It proved that that is the <i>only</i> pair of integers with that relationship.<p>But what about rationals?<p>First, remember that (a^b)^c) == a^(bc).<p>Let a = (3/2)^2 and b = (3/2)^3.  Then a^b == b^a.  (a and b are rational, but a^b is not.)<p>More generally, for any natural number n, let a = ((n+1)/n)^n and b = ((n+1)/n)^(n+1).  Then a^b == b^a.<p>Note that the first element of this series has a = 2 and b = 4.  Also note that as n increases, the series converges to both a and b equal to e.<p>But when I said "for any natural number n", that was actually an unnecessary restriction.  The math works for <i>any</i> n - it doesn't have to be an integer.  We could, for instance, use n = 1/2.  Then a = ((3/2)/(1/2))^(1/2) and b = ((3/2)/(1/2))^(3/2).  a and b are no longer rational, but a^b still equals b^a.</p>

## Meticulous (YC S21) Is Hiring Founding Engineer to Build AI for Testing

<p>Hey HN!<p>I'm Gabriel, founder of Meticulous.<p>Our mission is to radically accelerate the pace of software development for every company in the world. We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href="http://meticulous.ai/">http://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href="https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d" rel="nofollow">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>

## Ask HN: Why isn't BTRFS the default FS in home-oriented Linux distributions?

<p>I have been looking how BTRFS has been progressing. It supports CoW, snapshots, data deduplication, compression, data integrity, (...), a list of features that are unavailable in EXT4 (the current default FS in most home-oriented Linux distributions).<p>For granted, EXT4 keeps being faster than BTRFS in most synthetic benchmarks, which makes it a better choice for servers, but this difference in speed isn't noticeable in domestic workloads; domestic users would greatly benefit from the features offered by BTRFS. For example, Linux Mint has Timeshift, a backup solution that uses BTRFS volumes to make system snapshots.<p>This leads me to my question: Why haven't we switched to BTRFS as the default FS for home-oriented distributions? What features / reasons are holding us to keep using EXT4 as the default FS?</p>

## Ask HN: Is prompt engineering just snake oil?

<p>Is prompt engineering a snake oil? The engineering, as the word stands so far in history is about observing clear limitations and capabilities of something and then "engineering" things around it such as "engineering a compiler" is all about knowing the underlying processor, memory and other characteristics and then engineering a solution that converts a text notation to a stream of instructions that try to strike a balanced tradeoff.<p>But with LLMs, no one knows their workings once they are trained. The other day, Bark model[0] for text to speech, the team itself has following to say on details:<p>> Below is a list of some known non-speech sounds, but we are finding more every day. Please let us know if you find patterns that work particularly well on Discord! [laughter], [laughs], [sighs]....<p>So that's the team themselves not knowing what their model is capable of then how come prompt engineering is any engineering at all?<p>[0] https://github.com/suno-ai/bark</p>

<p>They depend on ASML lithography machines, right? Intel, Samsung and other foundries could/do also buy ASML's machines, so what gives TSMC their advantage?</p>
