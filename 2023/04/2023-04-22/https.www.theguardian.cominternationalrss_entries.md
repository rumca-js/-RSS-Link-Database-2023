<p>If Leicester go on to wriggle clear of the relegation zone and retain their Premier League status, they will probably look back on this comeback victory as a defining moment. Things appeared ominous when they trailed to Wolves inside 13 minutes but Kelechi Iheanacho levelled from the penalty spot before Timothy Castagne sidefooted in the winner to record their first triumph in 11 matches. Dean Smith, a picture of calm as Castagne converted Victor Kristiansen’s low cross with 15 minutes to play, would be the first to say Leicester still have much to do.</p><p>Suddenly this stadium was rocking, the Leicester crowd bopping and singing Smith’s name. Until an unfortunate slip by José Sá saw the Wolves goalkeeper catch Jamie Vardy’s right ankle inside the box in the 34th minute, Leicester were deep in trouble. Vardy hobbled to the sidelines and Iheanacho, after a staggered run-up, sent Sá the wrong way. Matheus Cunha gave Wolves the lead, powering a shot into the corner after an alert Mario Lemina pickpocketed Youri Tielemans on the edge of the Leicester box. Cunha and Craig Dawson had efforts blocked as Wolves went in search of a second goal but they never seemed to truly recover from conceding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/22/leicester-wolves-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Everton hold on for point at Crystal Palace after Holgate red card

<p>As Premier League spectacles go, Gareth Southgate will know he could easily have picked a more entertaining way to spend his Saturday afternoon. With the England manager back on his old stamping ground to watch his former club attempt to record a fourth successive victory since his predecessor’s return to replace Patrick Vieira, a stubborn defensive performance from 10-man Everton was enough to earn Sean Dyche’s side a point that could prove to be extremely valuable.</p><p>While it was not enough to stop them from dropping into the bottom three after Leicester’s win over Wolves, even more heartening for Dyche after his side survived Mason Holgate’s red card 10 minutes from time will have been the sight of Dominic Calvert-Lewin lasting until the 90th minute before being substituted. The England striker could not take a golden opportunity to secure Everton’s second away win of the campaign but at least provided a fulcrum in attack that has been sorely missing all season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/22/crystal-palace-everton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A savoury way to enjoy rhubarb: a curry pickle stuffed into a wrap with lentil dumplings</p><p>I love rhubarb in all its myriad pudding forms: tarts, crumbles, roasted and served with lashings of vanilla custard. But there is only so much dessert a person can handle, so this year I decided to try using it in a savoury recipe. The natural tartness of rhubarb is a natural fit for an Indian-style pickle, but the flavour takes on an almost meaty deliciousness. Paired with lentil dumplings, or <em>bora</em>, and cool yoghurt, this makes a perfect midweek dinner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/22/lentil-dumpling-wraps-rhubarb-pickle-recipe-tamal-ray">Continue reading...</a>
