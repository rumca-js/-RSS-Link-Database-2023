It was the kind of dramatic, impulsive move to which the music press was occasionally prone, the sort of thing that invariably led to accusations of overheated hype or reckless desperation. By the autumn of 1978, punk was clearly winding down, or at least being co-opted by less artful practitioners than those in its first wave \u2013 the big new noise in that area was the terrace-chant choruses and political populism of Sham 69 \u2013 so the hunt was clearly on among journalists for something different, a situation that often led them to make rash choices. But The Pop Group, whose frontman Mark Stewart glowered on the NME\u2019s cover, were anything but a desperate hype or a rash choice. Barely out of school, they were in the process of helping to define what became known as post-punk: jagged guitars, funk-inspired rhythms, a bold spirit of experimentation, dub-influenced soundscapes, anything but traditional rock. It\u2019s tempting to say you could tell they were barely out of school. For all the apparent anguish in Stewart\u2019s vocals, their music seemed powered by a youthful enthusiasm that was wild to the point of seeming deranged: it sounded like it was throwing everything they were interested in at you at once. Some people found it overwhelming, an off-putting, chaotic racket. Others were completely entranced. The Pop Group, Nick Cave later claimed, \u201cchanged everything\u201d for him: \u201cit was so direct, so musically inventive, so improvised\u201d.</p><p>What The Pop Group threw at you was largely the result of Mark Stewart\u2019s eclectic, autodidactic musical education, an education that seemed founded on an insatiable curiosity, but which he always claimed was mostly facilitated by his towering height. Already 6ft 6ins by the time he was 12, Stewart not only absorbed what he saw on the TV or heard on the radio (he was a huge fan of glam rock) but also was able to get into places usually off-limits for anyone his age, including reggae-fuelled blues parties in Bristol\u2019s St Paul\u2019s district, and soul clubs where he encountered tough dancefloor funk and jazz and the curious moment in 1975 when some soul fans began dressing in a style that presaged punk \u2013 mohair jumpers, spiked hair and the pegged trousers and 1950s suits that became The Pop Group\u2019s initial onstage uniform. There was also a local underground bookshop, where he took in radical political tracts, situationist texts and cultural theory, all of which coursed through The Pop Group\u2019s lyrics and notoriously argumentative interviews: the writer Simon Reynolds subsequently compared reading a feature about The Pop Group to having \u201cyour brain set on fire\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/22/how-mark-stewart-set-the-tone-for-post-punk-protest-music\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/22/how-mark-stewart-set-the-tone-for-post-punk-protest-music", "date_published": "2023-04-22 16:44:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Championship roundup: QPR stun Burnley while Wigan earn lifeline", "description": "<ul><li>QPR make leaders wait for title with dramatic victory</li><li>Thelo Aasgaard\u2019s winner lifts Wigan\u2019s survival hopes</li></ul><p><strong>Burnley</strong> must wait to be crowned champions after a stunning late goal from <strong>QPR</strong> substitute Chris Martin inflicted a first home defeat of the season on the Championship leaders.</p><p>The veteran forward had only been on the field for three minutes when Ilias Chair forced a corner with a shot that was well saved by Arijanet Muric.

Having world record-holder Eliud Kipchoge in the famous swoosh helped, of course. But it wasn\u2019t just him. In 2019, Nike athletes took 31 of the 36 podium places in the six marathon majors. It sent a subliminal message to ordinary runners. Want to smash your personal bests? Buy Nike\u2019s Vaporfly or AlphaFly shoes.

The various permutations of a starting XI that Javi Gracia could turn to, suggest a lack of clarity. In short, the sun is not currently shining on the Lilywhites of west Yorkshire.</p><p>For the Lilywhites of west London things are far rosier. While a slump in form has all-but ended hopes of European football next season, a win last week means that they will be in the Premier League at the very least \u2013 an achievement that should not be overlooked given the preseason predictions of doom.

An <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\" title=\"\">open letter</a>, signed by such luminaries as Yuval Noah Harari and Elon Musk, called for research into the most advanced AI to be paused and measures taken to ensure it remains \u201csafe \u2026 trustworthy, and loyal\u201d. These pangs followed the launch last year of ChatGPT, a chatbot that can write you an essay on Milton as easily as it can generate a recipe for everything you happen to have in your cupboard that evening.</p><p>But what if the computers used to develop AI were replaced by ones able to make calculations not millions, but trillions of times faster? What if tasks that might take thousands of years to perform on today\u2019s devices could be completed in a matter of seconds? Well, that\u2019s precisely the future that physicist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/03/string-theory-michio-kaku-aliens-god-equation-large-hadron-collider\" title=\"\">Michio Kaku</a> is predicting. He believes we are about to leave the digital age behind for a quantum era that will bring unimaginable scientific and societal change. Computers will no longer use transistors, but subatomic particles, to make calculations, unleashing incredible processing power. Another physicist has likened it to putting \u201ca rocket engine in your car\u201d.

Seeing their excessive use of force, his training kicked in. He had been in the youth section of the British Black Panthers and knew to write down the name and address of someone in a situation like this, because \u201cthe police would often arrest black youths and lock them up in remand centres without informing their next of kin\u201d. But in retaliation the officers arrested Johnson too, throwing him into the back of a police van where they beat him up and racially abused him. It would take more than six months before he was acquitted of the charges of assault levelled against him.</p><p>This anecdote, buried in this new collection of Johnson\u2019s prose, braids together the themes of the book and even his life: a practised solidarity with his fellow man, the workings of a racist state, and the vitality of the black radical tradition. It also reminds us of the brutal contingencies of a life like his. LKJ, as he is known, is now recognised as one of the great living poets of the counterculture. Penguin has anthologised his verse. He has honorary degrees and awards to his name.
