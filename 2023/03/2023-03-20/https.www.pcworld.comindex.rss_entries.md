<p>Runway has shouldered aside Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, introducing the first clips of text-to-video AI art that the company says is completely generated by a text prompt.</p>



<p>The company said that it&rsquo;s offering a waitlist to join what it calls &ldquo;Gen 2&rdquo; of text-to-video AI, after offering a similar waitlist for its first, simpler text-to-video tools that use a real-world scene as a model.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/788422/how-to-get-started-with-ai-art-dall-e-mini-ai-dungeon-and-more.html">AI art emerged last year</a>, it used a text-to-image model. A user would input a text prompt describing the scene, and the tool would attempt to create an image using what it knew of real-world &ldquo;seeds,&rdquo; artistic styles and so forth. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/820518/midjourneys-ai-art-goes-live-for-everyone.html">Services like Midjourney</a> perform these tasks on a cloud server, while <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/916785/creating-ai-art-local-pc-stable-diffusion.html">Stable Diffusion</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431633/meet-stable-horde-the-setihome-of-ai-art.html">Stable Horde</a> take advantage of similar AI models running on home PCs. </p>



<p>Text-to-video, however, is the next step. There are various ways of accomplishing this: Pollinations.ai has accumulated a few models which you can try out, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pollinations.ai/create/stablediffusion&amp;xcust=2-3-1665235-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">one of which</a> simply takes a few related scenes and constructs an animation stringing them together. Another <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pollinations.ai/create/adampi&amp;xcust=2-3-1665235-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">simply creates a 3D model of an image</a> and allows you to zoom around. </p>



<p>Runway takes a different approach. The company already offers <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://app.runwayml.com/video-tools/projects&amp;xcust=2-3-1665235-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">AI-powered video tools</a>: inpainting to remove objects from a video (as opposed to an image), AI-powered bokeh, transcripts and subtitles, and more. The first generation of its text-to-video tools allowed you to construct a real-world scene, then use it as a model to overlay a text-generated video on top of it. This is normally done as an image, where you could take a photo of a Golden Retriever and use AI to transform the photo into a photo of a Doberman, for example.</p>



<p>That was Gen 1. Runway&rsquo;s Gen 2, as the company tweeted, can use existing images or videos as a base. But the technology can also completely auto-generate a short video clip from a text prompt and nothing more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Generate videos with nothing but words. If you can say it, now you can see it.<br /><br />Introducing, Text to Video. With Gen-2.<br /><br />Learn more at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/PsJh664G0Q&amp;xcust=2-3-1665235-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/PsJh664G0Q</a> <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/6qEgcZ9QV4&amp;xcust=2-3-1665235-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/6qEgcZ9QV4</a></p>&mdash; Runway (@runwayml) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/runwayml/status/1637800500459458562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-3-1665235-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">March 20, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As Runway&rsquo;s tweet indicates, the clips are both short (just a few seconds at most), awfully grainy, and suffers from a low frame rate. It&rsquo;s not clear when Runway will release the model for early access or general access, either. But the examples on the Runway Gen 2 page do show a wide variety of video prompts: pure text-to-video AI, text+image to video, and so on. It appears that the more input you give the model, the better your luck. Applying a video &ldquo;overlay&rdquo; over an existing object or scene seemed to offer the smoothest video and highest resolution.</p>



<p>Runway already offers a $12/mo &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; plan that allows for unlimited video projects. But certain tools, such as actually training your own portrait or animal generator, require an additional $10 fee. It&rsquo;s unclear what Runway will charge for its new model.</p>



<p>What Runway <em>does </em>demonstrate, however, is that in a few short months, we&rsquo;ve moved from text-to-image AI art into text-to-video AI art&hellip; and all we can do is shake our heads in amazement. </p>

## Needy Windows 11 apps will beg you to pin them to your taskbar

<p>If you don&rsquo;t like insecure people who demand attention, you&rsquo;re going to hate the changes Microsoft has planned for Windows 11.</p>



<p>During the coming months, Microsoft plans to add two changes to Windows. First, it will give developers new API access to the default apps settings. Second, another API change will pop up notifications asking you to add the app to the taskbar.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what it all means. In Windows, the <em>Settings</em> menu has a list of default apps<em> (Apps &gt; Default apps)</em>. As the name suggests, this controls which app will open a PDF, for example, or an HTML web page. Chances are you never bother adjusting these after you&rsquo;ve selected your web browser and so on. But your choice also cuts out any of the competing third-party apps that reside on your machine, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407176/best-web-browsers.html">multiple free web browsers</a> that are available. </p>



<p>What the change would mean is that the new browser would have access to the <em>Default apps</em> page, implicitly asking you to change your preference to the new browser. (Microsoft calls this a &ldquo;deep link&rdquo; URI [Uniform Resource Identifier], simply meaning that a file type is associated with an app.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 default app settings" class="wp-image-1665198" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Windows-11-default-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Windows 11&rsquo;s Default apps page.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>It gets worse. Most apps don&rsquo;t really ask you to pin them to the Windows taskbar, letting you decide if you want to add a quick shortcut to the apps down below. But that&rsquo;s potentially changing, too. Now, you&rsquo;ll see popups asking you to pin the app to the taskbar in addition to making the app the default. </p>



<p>In both the case of the deep link URI as well as the pinning popup, you&rsquo;ll have the option of approving or denying the request. The issue, of course, is that the request is being made in the first place, and there&rsquo;s no indication of how frequently an app can beg you for preferred treatment.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 pinned app notification" class="wp-image-1665197" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pinned-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You could see a lot more of this.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Microsoft detailed the potential changes as part of a &ldquo;principled approach to app pinning,&rdquo; which it <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2023/03/17/a-principled-approach-to-app-pinning-and-app-defaults-in-windows/&amp;xcust=2-3-1665135-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">published</a> on Friday. If there&rsquo;s any saving grace, it&rsquo;s that the changes will be pushed to the Windows 11 Insider Dev Channel in the coming months. Thankfully, the Dev Channel is for experimental code that may or may not be pushed to Windows. (The Beta and Release Preview Channels are for features that will arrive in Windows in the future.) On the other hand, Microsoft isn&rsquo;t pushing the new feature in the newly-minted <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1532952/windows-11s-new-canary-channel-could-be-a-test-bed-for-windows-12.html">Canary Channel, likely oriented toward Windows 12</a>. </p>



<p>Microsoft also said that it remains committed to putting you in charge of your own preferences. &ldquo;We have taken and will continue to take steps to mitigate unrequested modifications to a user&rsquo;s choices and expect to do more later this year after application developers have had time to incorporate these new best practices,&rdquo; Microsoft said. </p>



<p>On the other hand, Microsoft <em>also</em> said that it will be adding a version of Edge that incorporates both the new &ldquo;deep link&rdquo; URI setting as well as the public pinning APIs, just to prove it all works. Hurray.</p>

## Avoid bad YouTube recommendations with one tiny habit

<p>Everyone has that one YouTube link you wish you&rsquo;d never clicked on. Not because of the content, but because it changed the suggested videos YouTube served to you after.</p>



<p>But there&rsquo;s an easy way to prevent this annoyance. Just open the link in an incognito browsing window.</p>



<p>You won&rsquo;t be logged into your account within a private window&mdash;it&rsquo;s a blank slate. What you do in the incognito window won&rsquo;t affect your normal browser windows and tabs, either, so when you close the window, it&rsquo;ll be as if you never accessed those sites. (From the perspective of your browser, anyway. Your internet provider can still see what you&rsquo;ve visited unless <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">you use a VPN</a>.)</p>



<p>For Chrome, the fastest way to open a link in an incognito window is by right-clicking on the link, then hitting <code>g</code> on your keyboard or selecting &ldquo;Open link in incognito window.&rdquo; For Edge, Firefox, and Brave, right-click and hit <code>p</code> on your keyboard. If your browser doesn&rsquo;t offer keyboard shortcuts in the right-click context menu, select and click on &ldquo;Open link in private window.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1663559" height="583" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5.png" width="1173" /><figcaption>In Chrome, you can open a link in an incognito by right-clicking the link, then hitting &ldquo;g&rdquo; on your keyboard. Or just select &ldquo;Open link in incognito window.&rdquo;</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As for general browsing (e.g., you&rsquo;re not clicking on someone else&rsquo;s link but you&rsquo;re hunting for content on your own), you can use <code>Ctrl + Shift + N</code> (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, and other Chromium browsers) or <code>Ctrl + Shift + P</code> (Firefox) to quickly open a new incognito or private window. Alternatively, you can right-click on your browser&rsquo;s logo in the Windows taskbar and select the option to open a private window. As a reminder, your history won&rsquo;t save. If you need to later refer to your research, you must manually save the links, or use a secondary profile or account.</p>



<p>This method may sound unnecessarily complicated, but once it becomes habit, you&rsquo;ll spend less effort than continually going into your YouTube history and deleting irrelevant videos from your history. It also works well for other platforms or websites where manual curation isn&rsquo;t available (like looking at apartment listings on real estate sites), where retraining the algorithm takes time and work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird how variable the price of computer components is. If you want to buy, say, a PlayStation 5 or a new couch, you&rsquo;re gonna pay the sticker price unless you find a store that puts it on sale. But components like RAM, graphics cards, and storage have prices so fluid, you might wonder why retailers don&rsquo;t just slap &ldquo;market price&rdquo; on the listing, like it&rsquo;s a surf-and-turf entree at a restaurant. Case in point: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">SSD prices</a> seem to have been in freefall for the last few months. </p>



<p>The reason is that, very much like seafood and livestock, the price of the raw materials and manufactured parts that go into your computer&rsquo;s guts is part of a worldwide market that shifts in both the short and long term. And for a variety of reasons, there&rsquo;s a huge abundance of NAND flash storage right now &mdash; the kind of storage that goes into SSD drives and flash drives of all sizes. Most of the major manufacturers of this hardware are experiencing a huge drop in demand from both consumers and enterprise customers.</p>



<p>With industrial chip manufacturing unable to nimbly lower its output to match that demand, the result is an overabundance of NAND flash hardware on the market. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/18777/prices-of-nand-flash-drop-rapidly-so-do-prices-of-ssds&amp;xcust=2-3-1664694-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">As Anton Shilov of AnandTech notes</a>, pretty much every storage maker is seeing huge drops in revenue as a result. And that sucks if you&rsquo;re a flash memory manufacturer&hellip;but it&rsquo;s a really good time to be in the market for a new storage drive. </p>

<p>SSDs in all capacities are currently at multi-year lows in prices. That&rsquo;s true even for super-speedy popular models like the 2TB Samsung 980 Pro, which was $240 last October and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RK2SR23&amp;xcust=2-3-1664694-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">is now sitting pretty at $170</a>. The SK hynix Gold P31 2TB, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393364/sk-hynix-gold-p31-ssd-review-the-first-128-layer-nand-drive.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">one of PCWorld&rsquo;s favorites</a>, dropped from $208 <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099RHVB42&amp;xcust=2-3-1664694-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all the way down to $120</a>, or just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DKB5LWY&amp;xcust=2-3-1664694-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$72 for a 1TB model</a>. More capacious drives are seeing similar drops: The Western Digital Black 4TB SN850X, which is about as big and fast as you can get in a consumer drive without going for a bleeding-edge PCIe 5 design, is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7CQ2CHH/&amp;xcust=2-3-1664694-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">down to $380</a>. That&rsquo;s more than $220 off its initial retail price despite being the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394512/the-best-pcie-40-ssd.html">best PCIe 4.0 SSD around</a>. </p>



<p>While you can find similar price reductions in other flash storage devices, like older SATA drives or external USB-based drives, this rule isn&rsquo;t being applied everywhere. More niche products, like super-tiny M.2 2230 drives that can be squeezed into a Steam Deck, are as hard to find as ever. If you can find one, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHQ91SGM/&amp;xcust=2-3-1664694-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">don&rsquo;t expect much of a discount</a>, if any. And the brand new PCIe 5.0 drives, which can melt your face (figuratively) and your PC&rsquo;s components (literally) with their blazing speed, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1529758/the-first-hyper-fast-pcie-5-0-m-2-ssd-is-available-now.html">aren&rsquo;t really on the market except for one drive</a>. Even when more of them arrive later this year, expect to pay a pretty penny for that cutting-edge hardware. And that&rsquo;s assuming you&rsquo;ve got a motherboard that can actually use it. </p>



<p>But if you happen to be in the market for a standard NVMe or SATA SSD, or you can scrounge together a few bucks just for the heck of it, it&rsquo;s a great time to upgrade. Most desktops sold in the last four years or so should have an M.2 drive available, and so do many laptops, though some ultraportable models (especially 2-in-1s and tablets) have storage soldered into place and can&rsquo;t be upgraded.  </p>

<p>The Arzopa A1 Gamut is a simple portable monitor sold at a very low price. Its specifications, feature set, and image quality won&rsquo;t blow your hair back, but the monitor delivers the fundamentals most shoppers will expect while avoiding serious flaws. It&rsquo;s an easy, reliable budget pick.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">best monitors</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in monitor, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="arzopa-a1-gamut-the-specs">Arzopa A1 Gamut: The specs</h2>



<p>The Arzopa A1 Gamut&rsquo;s specifications are identical to most portable monitors sold around $200 and below. It has a 1080p panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and doesn&rsquo;t support Adaptive Sync. Input options include two USB-C and Mini-HDMI.</p>



<ul><li>Display size: 15.6-inch</li><li>Native resolution: 1,920 x 1,080</li><li>Panel type: IPS monitor</li><li>Refresh rate: 60Hz</li><li>Adaptive Sync: None</li><li>HDR: None</li><li>Ports: 2x USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode, 1x Mini-HDMI</li><li>Stand adjustment: Tent, tilt</li><li>VESA mount: None</li><li>Speakers: Yes</li><li>Price: $189.99</li></ul>



<p>Arzopa&rsquo;s MSRP is $189.99, but pricing can dip as low as $118. Amazon price-tracking websites show <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B091GFZNJ5&amp;xcust=2-2-1532023-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">these cuts happen with clockwork regularity</a>, so it&rsquo;s wise to wait a week or two if you see the monitor being sold at MSRP.</p>



<h2 id="arzopa-a1-gamut-design">Arzopa A1 Gamut: Design&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Arzopa opts for a mostly flat portable monitor with a small bump on the lower half to house the monitor&rsquo;s electronics. This has more-or-less become the default design for a portable monitor, minimizing size, weight, and price. The display panel is clad in mundane plastic, but the non-gloss finish seems likely to hold up well to travel&mdash;and the scratches and bumps that inevitably result.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arzopa A1 Gamut" class="wp-image-1532030" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/azorpa-a1-gamut-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Arzopa A1 Gamut&rsquo;s faux leather cover and stand.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Arzopa A1 Gamut looks and feels sturdy, has a nice bundled cover, offers plenty of connectivity, comes with all required cables, and delivers a bright, usable picture.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The monitor ships with a faux-leather cover and stand that attaches magnetically to the monitor. It&rsquo;s sturdy enough to provide some protection and the magnets are strong. The case seems unlikely to slip off the monitor while it&rsquo;s in a bag or suitcase or while moving the monitor to a new desk.</p>



<p>Flipping the cover open converts it into the monitor stand, which holds the monitor up at a slight angle. The stand feels planted and doesn&rsquo;t easily slip backwards. Adjustment is limited, providing just a few degrees of tilt, and VESA mounting isn&rsquo;t an option. This is typical for a budget monitor but a few, like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520990/aoc-i1601fwux-porable-monitor-review.html">AOC I1601FWUX</a>, have a stand that can also hold the monitor in portrait orientation.</p>



<h2 id="arzopa-a1-gamut-features-and-menus">Arzopa A1 Gamut: Features and menus&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arzopa A1 Gamut" class="wp-image-1532032" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/azorpa-a1-gamut-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>With USB-C, DisplayPort Alternate Mode, and Mini-HDMI, the Arzopa A1 Gamut has decent enough connectivity.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The Arzopa A1 Gamut has three input options: two USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and one Mini-HDMI. Both USB-C ports provide power to the monitor, so an external power source isn&rsquo;t required when using the monitor with a laptop, tablet, or other device that can deliver power over USB-C. A small power brick is included and required if you connect to the monitor over HDMI, or if connecting with a USB-C device that can&rsquo;t provide power.</p>



<p>Many competing portable monitors, like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Monitor-15-6inch-Computer-Protector/dp/B088D8JG3L/ref=sr_1_3?crid=29CW786Y5FE2B&amp;keywords=1080p+portable+monitor&amp;qid=1677866421&amp;sprefix=1080p+portable+monito%2Caps%2C142&amp;sr=8-3&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.08f69ac3-fd3d-4b88-bca2-8997e41410bb&amp;xcust=2-2-1532023-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">KYY K3</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/KOORUI-Portable-Protective-Speakers-External/dp/B0B6DQT72C/ref=sr_1_19?crid=29CW786Y5FE2B&amp;keywords=1080p+portable+monitor&amp;qid=1677866421&amp;sprefix=1080p+portable+monito%2Caps%2C142&amp;sr=8-19&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc&amp;xcust=2-2-1532023-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Koorui 15B1</a>, offer a similar arrangement of ports&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not guaranteed. The AOC I1601FWUX and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ZenScreen-Portable-Monitor-MB166C/dp/B09MZQ978N/ref=sr_1_13?crid=29CW786Y5FE2B&amp;keywords=1080p+portable+monitor&amp;qid=1677866421&amp;sprefix=1080p+portable+monito%2Caps%2C142&amp;sr=8-13&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0&amp;xcust=2-2-1532023-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Asus Zenscreen MB166C</a> have a single USB-C input.</p>



<p>Arzopa provides all required cables and accessories. This includes a USB-C power brick and three cables: USB-C to USB-C, USB-A to USB-C, and HDMI to Mini-HDMI. It&rsquo;s great to see all required cables included at this price.</p>



<p>The monitor&rsquo;s menu system and image-quality adjustments could hardly be more basic. A toggle button on the right flanks offers the only options. Toggle up to adjust brightness, or down to adjust volume. The power button acts as the back button. There&rsquo;s no color temperature, gamma, or color preset adjustments. That will disappoint anyone looking to calibrate the monitor&mdash;though, at this price, a limited range of image-quality adjustment is expected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speakers are included, but they&rsquo;re rather awful. They&rsquo;re fine for basic system noises or listening to a podcast in a pinch, but you&rsquo;ll want to use external speakers or headphones in most situations. A 3.5mm audio-out is included.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="arzopa-a1-gamut-sdr-image-quality">Arzopa A1 Gamut: SDR image quality</h2>



<p>Budget portable monitors often struggle with image quality, for obvious reasons. Squeezing a halfway decent IPS display panel into a monitor under $150, and which also includes USB-C connectivity and a bundled cover, isn&rsquo;t easy. Fortunately, the Arzopa A1 Gamut makes few compromises in its pursuit of low pricing.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arzopa A1 Gamut" class="wp-image-1532033" height="838" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/arzopa-a1-gamut-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Brightness comes in at a respectable maximum of 297 nits. That&rsquo;s the second-highest of the monitors included for the comparison, beating not just the AOC I1601FWUX portable monitor, but also the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631916/acer-k242hyl-review.html">Acer K242HYL</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1339808/monoprice-24-inch-crystalpro-monitor-review.html">MonoPrice 44029</a>, a pair of budget 24-inch desktop monitors. The Arzopa A1 Gamut isn&rsquo;t bright enough to use comfortably outdoors, or next to a sunlit window, but it&rsquo;s otherwise up to the task.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arzopa A1 Gamut" class="wp-image-1532034" height="847" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/arzopa-a1-gamut-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Contrast comes in at a ratio of 880:1. The Arzopa A1 Gamut can provide some sense of depth, but it can&rsquo;t display a deep, uniform level of black in dark scenes. This limitation is most noticeable when the monitor is used in a darkened room, and it can make photos, movies, and games look flat and hazy.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not great, but comparable to other monitors of similar price. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1500398/viewsonic-colorpro-vp16-oled-review.html">Viewsonic&rsquo;s VP16-OLED</a> is obviously the champion. However, with a price closer to $400, I&rsquo;d expect it to be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The A1 Gamut&rsquo;s color gamut spans 97 percent of sRGB and 74 percent of DCI-P3. This isn&rsquo;t a spectacular result, but comparable to other budget monitors. The color gamut could be much worse&mdash;as evidenced by the AOC I1601FWUX&rsquo;s lackluster performance.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arzopa A1 Gamut" class="wp-image-1532036" height="911" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/arzopa-a1-gamut-color-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>I can say the same of color accuracy. The A1 Gamut isn&rsquo;t the most accurate monitor, but also far from the worst. This level of color accuracy won&rsquo;t hold up in professional or semi-professional content creation. However, that&rsquo;s not the A1 Gamut&rsquo;s target audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the A1 Gamut has an on-target default gamma curve of 2.2, which means the luminance of content appears as it should. The color temperature is also near ideal at 6600K, a hair off the target of 6500K. That means the image doesn&rsquo;t appear too warm or too cool. Combined, these traits help provide an image that looks realistic and accurate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharpness is excellent, as well. 1080p resolution may not sound impressive but, on a 15.6-inch panel, it works out to 141 pixels per inch (PPI). That&rsquo;s much sharper than a 27-inch 1440p monitor, which delivers 109 PPI, and almost as sharp as a 27-inch 4K monitor, which packs 163 PPI.</p>



<p>The Azorpa A1 Gamut won&rsquo;t leave anyone&rsquo;s jaw on the floor, but its image quality is more than adequate for a budget portable monitor. It has a bright, lifelike picture with excellent clarity, and it outperforms similarly priced alternatives with bottom-rung IPS panels.</p>



<h2 id="arzopa-a1-gamut-hdr-image-quality">Arzopa A1 Gamut: HDR image quality</h2>



<p>The Arzopa A1 Gamut doesn&rsquo;t support HDR. That&rsquo;s just as well. Though its image quality is solid for the price, the monitor lacks the brightness and color gamut required to do HDR justice.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="arzopa-a1-gamut-motion-performance">Arzopa A1 Gamut: Motion performance</h2>



<p>Gamers won&rsquo;t find the Arzopa A1 Gamut alluring. It has a standard 60Hz refresh rate and lacks Adaptive Sync. Games feel responsive, but no more so than with any modern LCD computer monitor.</p>



<p>Motion clarity isn&rsquo;t great. Test images that scroll through scenes from <em>DOTA 2</em> and <em>League of Legends</em> show significant blur. Fine details, like character names, are impossible to read, and even character silhouettes can be difficult to discern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not to say games are unplayable. Most games look fine, and titles with less frequent motion are easy to play. Still, those who want a portable monitor for fast competitive games should consider an alternative with a 144Hz refresh rate.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-arzopa-a1-gamut">Should you buy the Arzopa A1 Gamut?</h2>



<p>The Arzopa A1 Gamut isn&rsquo;t an amazing display, but it checks the right boxes on a tight budget. It looks and feels sturdy, has a nice bundled cover, offers plenty of connectivity, comes with all required cables, and delivers a bright, usable picture. It&rsquo;s a decent deal at its MSRP of $189.99&mdash;and, when its price falls below $150 (which is common), it&rsquo;s a steal.</p>

## Don’t be fooled: Comcast’s ‘10G’ doesn’t mean what you think it does

<p>You probably already know that 5G is a widely used abbreviation for a version of mobile network standards. (Also, that it&rsquo;s the most current standard in use.) That &ldquo;G&rdquo; slapped next to the number means &ldquo;generation.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a reference to the download or upload speeds you get on your cell phone.</p>



<p>You also may have already seen the advertisements about Comcast&rsquo;s new 10G Xfinity network blanketing the airwaves and other platforms. And since the Xfinity website <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xfinity.com/10g&amp;xcust=2-1-1662111-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">doesn&rsquo;t really clarify what &ldquo;10G&rdquo; really means</a>, you might assume that the company&rsquo;s home internet service is a faster version of 5G.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s likely what Comcast&rsquo;s marketing team wants. But don&rsquo;t let them confuse you. &ldquo;10G&rdquo; is a reference to 10Gbps, or the maximum speed the Xfinity broadband network is capable of. You&rsquo;re reading that right: It has nothing to do with cellular network terminology (like 5G) whatsoever, and Comcast&rsquo;s service is for home internet, <em>not</em> mobile.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s deeply misleading. </p>



<p>In fact, Xfinity&rsquo;s 10G network is actually <em>slower</em> than 5G. A 5G network is capable of zippier speeds, up to 20Gbps download and 10Gbps upload. Xfinity caps out at 10Gbps down and up.</p>



<p>Comcast&rsquo;s offerings become even more complicated when you consider what&rsquo;s currently available&mdash;most customers can only get about 1 Gbps down as the maximum speed, with an absurdly asymmetrical upload speed of 35Mbps (yes, megabits). Faster uploads are slowly rolling out to different locations, but you only get access by opting into the company&rsquo;s $30/month xFi Complete add-on, which includes unlimited data. Oof.</p>



<p>Long story short, take Comcast&rsquo;s boasts about its new network with a huge grain of salt. Many people will probably think a 10G network is better than a 5G network, but it&rsquo;s just not the case&mdash;at least here. Meanwhile, AT&amp;T&rsquo;s &ldquo;gigillionaire&rdquo; advertising campaign may be hard to sit through, but at least the language isn&rsquo;t tricky to understand.</p>

</div>


<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there&mdash;chilling at the local caf&eacute;, minding our own business, when some hip remote worker comes in with a MacBook Pro and starts working away. No judgement from me&mdash;I use Macs, Windows PCs, and Linux devices on the regular. But since Apple went with its own custom processors, those machines have proven hard for the PC industry to match. Not only are the latest MacBooks attractive, they boast surprising power and incredible efficiency, too.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why HP partnered with AMD to create the new HP Dragonfly Pro. This slim laptop packs the latest Ryzen processor, with 8 high-performance cores and powerful graphics, to take on the Mac. While you&rsquo;ll need to decide for yourself if you&rsquo;d rather have this over a MacBook, we found that this is a computer worth considering.</p>



<h2 id="hp-dragonfly-pro-specs-and-features">HP Dragonfly Pro: Specs and features</h2>



<p>Our review unit came with the following specifications and features:</p>



<ul><li><strong>CPU</strong>: AMD Ryzen 7 7736U (8 core, 16 threads)</li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB LPDDR5 6400 MHz RAM soldered (up to 32 GB available at purchase)</li><li><strong>Graphics/GPU</strong>: AMD Radeon 680M (12 graphics cores)</li><li><strong>Display</strong>: 14-inch 1920&times;1200 16:10 IPS touchscreen, 400 nits&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: 512 GB PCIe NVMe solid state drive (soldered)</li><li><strong>Webcam</strong>: 5MP IR camera</li><li><strong>Connectivity</strong>:&nbsp; 2x USB 4 Type-C (40 Gbps, Thunderbolt 3 compatible), 1x USB-C 3.2 10 Gbps</li><li><strong>Networking</strong>: Qualcomm WCN685x with Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2</li><li><strong>Biometrics</strong>: Windows Hello facial recognition and fingerprint reader</li><li><strong>Battery capacity</strong>: 86Wh</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 12.4 W x 8.7 L x 0.7 H inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 3.33 pounds, 3.95 pounds with AC adapter</li><li><strong>Price as Reviewed: </strong>$1,399</li></ul>



<h2 id="hp-dragonfly-pro-design-and-build-quality">HP Dragonfly Pro:: Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro design" class="wp-image-1661612" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-dragonfly-pro-logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>If HP was targeting Apple&rsquo;s quality, I&rsquo;ve got to hand it to them&mdash;the Dragonfly Pro gets close by most measures. This thin laptop feels high quality from the moment you tear off its recycled paper covering. Although you don&rsquo;t get a lot in the box, you get a high-powered 96 watt power brick and a braided USB-C charging cable. The power brick and laptop both sport the sleek, angular HP logo, which sets them apart from lower-end laptops offered by the company.</p>



<p>The laptop on its own has a nice shape, with high-quality materials like polycarbonate and aluminum used in its construction, some of which are post-consumer recycled. The black color I sampled has a slight fleck to its color, lending it a spacy sheen in the right light. That said, it&rsquo;s not glossy and the only portions that picked up any fingerprints were on the keycaps and the glass touchpad surface. Underneath, you&rsquo;ll find a pair of raised rubber strips that slightly raises the angle of the keyboard while giving the cooling vent ample access to air. And, when under load, it&rsquo;ll need all the air it can get, as the fans spin up and can be easily heard, albeit with a consistent whoosh and not an annoying whine.</p>



<h2 id="hp-dragonfly-pro-connectivity">HP Dragonfly Pro: Connectivity</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro ports" class="wp-image-1661616" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-dragonfly-pro-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>Like Apple, HP has taken a minimalist approach to ports. If you do most of your work online, and rely on cloud storage, you won&rsquo;t be too annoyed but for those of us who plug in a bunch of accessories and still use corded headphones may have a tougher time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Dragonfly Pro at least gives you the opportunity to add ports thanks to its set of two USB 4 ports. These are compatible with the Thunderbolt 3 standard, and will let you attach high speed storage (up to 40Gbps), docks, and fast chargers. These two ports are on the left side of the computer, with a small LED letting you know if the laptop is still taking in power from the charger.</p>



<p>On the right side is a single plain-old USB-C 3 port with significantly lower bandwidth. With only 10Gbps transfer speeds, I&rsquo;d say this is more useful for slow accessories or as a dedicated charging port. If I&rsquo;m going to gripe about the connectivity here it&rsquo;s that even Apple has a headphone jack on its mainstream Mac laptops. That omission is frustrating to say the least. The other thing I can&rsquo;t understand is why the third port has such downgraded throughput. Whenever Apple gives users more than two ports, it tends to give them a similar baseline of performance. Here, you&rsquo;ll have to pick and choose ports based on their speed.</p>



<p>Wireless is what I&rsquo;d expect from a 2023 premium PC, thanks to a chipset from Qualcomm. What you get is the latest Wi-Fi 6E technology, along with Bluetooth 5.2 for your headphones and other wireless peripherals.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="hp-dragonfly-pro-keyboard-and-trackpad">HP Dragonfly Pro: Keyboard and trackpad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro keyboard" class="wp-image-1661617" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-dragonfly-pro-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>Like the HP Dragonfly G3 Folio I tried recently, the Dragonfly Pro provides a top-notch on-the-go typing and mousing experience. The keyboard is a standout for me, with its relatively light touch but intuitive snap that lets you know just when you&rsquo;ve pressed a key. One key, next to the power button, houses the fingerprint reader, which some may prefer for unlocking their device. I found that I was able to get up and running at just about my normal typing comfort level and speed within a matter of hours&hellip;with one major caveat.</p>



<p>You see, this keyboard pitches up a slight curveball to those of you with ingrained typing habits&mdash;there are four special keys assigned to HP services along the right side of the keyboard. What this means is that the keys on the edges of the keyboard are sometimes narrower and everything is squished towards the left side. Sometimes that meant that when reaching for backspace, I&rsquo;d overreach and hit one of these grey keys instead. Unfortunately, these buttons cannot be remapped using any of HP&rsquo;s included utilities, and they&rsquo;re meant to point towards some subscription services you&rsquo;ll need to pay for. We&rsquo;ll get into those a little later in the review.</p>



<p>The smooth glass touchpad was a nice surprise. It has a haptic feedback mechanism, like what you&rsquo;d find on an Apple laptop, using a linear motor to simulate clicks. It feels really great to use, and you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to tell it&rsquo;s not actually clicking a mechanical button down. While the palm detection could use a little improvement, scooting the cursor around the interface and dragging files here and there was no problem at all.</p>



<h2 id="hp-dragonfly-pro-display-speakers-and-webcam">HP Dragonfly Pro: Display, speakers, and webcam</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro webcam" class="wp-image-1661621" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-dragonfly-pro-webcam.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>Unlike with many laptops I&rsquo;ve tried in recent months, I&rsquo;m going to start this section with the speakers. These speakers are super impressive! Everything I threw at them sounded incredible, from loud action sequences in movies to spoken content, and even the grueling abuse of pingy, bleepy electronic music. If you use your laptop as your main entertainment system, the Dragonfly Pro&rsquo;s quad speaker system can play just about anything and make it sound lively without distortion I could notice. Those upgrading from an older laptop to this HP Dragonfly&mdash;your ears are in for a treat.</p>



<p>The display is nice enough, but especially if HP is aiming for the MacBook Pro 14-inch, it might have a bit more work to do. I found that the Dragonfly Pro has a high contrast, colorful, and especially bright 16:10 display with a peak brightness of around 400 nits. But this screen is fixed at 60hz and doesn&rsquo;t have any next-gen tech like mini LED for improved contrast, much less higher refresh rates for gaming or just making the interface look smoother. You get all these things with the high-end MacBook Pro models. One thing to note is that HP has opted for rounded corners on the LCD, which admittedly is a nice match for the rounder look of Windows 11.</p>



<p>The wider 16:10 screen leaves room up top for a 5 megapixel webcam, two microphones, and an infrared sensor. That lets you choose to unlock your laptop with facial recognition, which remains something Apple hasn&rsquo;t put into its laptops&hellip;ever. The webcam has a bunch of useful features built into HP&rsquo;s myHP app, which you can access with a dedicated key on the keyboard. Autoframing is done rather well here and I found that my face was well-exposed and detailed even with this feature turned on. Audio was about what I&rsquo;d expect for a work-focused machine and you&rsquo;ll find two noise reduction settings (conference and personal) which let you control how much background sounds get into your Teams or Zoom calls.</p>



<h2 id="hp-dragonfly-pro-the-support-upsell">HP Dragonfly Pro: The support upsell</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro support" class="wp-image-1661627" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-14-092917.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>HP seems to be angling to turn its laptops into more of a subscription service thanks to the inclusion of something it calls Pro Live. Instead of taking your computer into a store for tech help, you&rsquo;re a keyboard button away from reaching a human either via voice or text chat. By making a single key send you right into the myHP app, it&rsquo;s clear they want to get users used to having that function close at hand.</p>



<p>So, the HP Dragonfly Pro gives every buyer a year of warranty with Pro Live support included. For an added fee of $10.99 per month, users can extend their access to live support up to 36 months and also add accidental damage protection for up to 1 replacement computer per year. I can see why someone would find this appealing (especially a freelancer without an IT department), but if I&rsquo;m honest, it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine instances where I&rsquo;d need instant help but also still have a computer that&rsquo;s working well enough to run the support software.</p>



<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d rather have a normal keyboard layout or the power to remap these three keys to do something different than access myHP settings and features. The one olive branch HP has handed users is the generic ellipse key, which is the only one you can program yourself. Otherwise, the three keys on top of it&mdash;mapped to myHP&rsquo;s control panel, support access, and camera settings&mdash;are not yours to alter.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="hp-dragonfly-pro-performance">HP Dragonfly Pro: Performance</h2>



<p>If you need an overachieving Windows laptop in an unassuming body, the HP Dragonfly Pro is all that. While we&rsquo;d expect an Intel P-class chip in a machine of this kind, HP has opted for the latest mobile Ryzen 7736U from AMD instead. Ryzen is a formidable force in big desktop PCs, this HP manages to use the efficiency of this chip to great benefit. With its 8 cores and 16 threads (all of which are high-performance), along with strong embedded Radeon graphics, we found that it ran rings around similar systems equipped with 12th gen Intel and Xe Graphics.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro PCMark" class="wp-image-1661631" height="617" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-dragonfly-pro-pcmark10-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>We benchmark every laptop with the PCMark 10 suite. This software gives us a great baseline, using everyday tasks to gauge a computer&rsquo;s true performance. Due to its 8 powerful cores, the HP Dragonfly Pro keeps pace with and beats competing Intel-based laptops that have 12 cores. Rest assured that this laptop, despite its thin profile, packs in more than enough power for all kinds of tasks.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro Cinebench" class="wp-image-1661636" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-dragonfly-pro-cr15-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>In this performance test, we use Cinebench R15 to get a sense for how well all a laptop&rsquo;s processors work together to render 3D graphics. In this test, we found that the HP Dragonfly Pro acquitted itself very well, although not significantly surpassing the Intel-powered competition.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro 3DMark" class="wp-image-1661639" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-dragonfly-pro-3dmark-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>Although your typical Intel slim notebook has better-than-ever graphics, AMD&rsquo;s Radeon cores are still a cut above. When running the 3DMark Time Spy benchmark, the HP Dragonfly Pro showed off impressive performance without a separate GPU chip, putting recent Intel Xe Graphics test results to shame.</p>



<p>I got curious so I downloaded and played Forza Horizon 4 and took it for a spin. I saw consistent 60 fps performance on medium settings, which other ultrabooks could only wish for. Gamers with day jobs&mdash;the HP Dragonfly Pro can just as handily help you best Excel workbooks <em>and</em> your Steam library.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro Handbrake" class="wp-image-1661641" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-dragonfly-pro-handbrake-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>In our final performance chart, we use Handbrake and time how long it takes to turn an HD movie into a tablet-friendly file that&rsquo;s heavily compressed. The HP Dragonfly Pro was able to spin up and tackle this challenge faster than many other thin laptops in recent memory, taking far less time than other high-quality notebooks like the Surface Laptop 5 and its cousin, the HP Dragonfly Folio G3.</p>



<h2 id="hp-dragonfly-pro-battery-life">HP Dragonfly Pro: Battery life</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Dragonfly Pro battery life" class="wp-image-1661643" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hp-dragonfly-pro-batterylife-chart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>If you&rsquo;re expecting battery life that is world-beating from the HP Dragonfly Pro, you might be a little disappointed. In our looping video battery life rundown, we measured a couple minutes short of 10 hours of playback. When compared to similar 13-inch ultraportable notebooks, it&rsquo;s basically middle-of-the-pack.</p>



<p>But when you take a closer look at that mid-pack, you realize that the Dragonfly Folio G3 and Surface Laptop 5 both run on lower-power U-class Intel chips. With that in mind, you&rsquo;re getting a huge boost in computing and graphics performance while getting battery life competitive with weaker machines. The HP Dragonfly Pro runs two hours longer than the performance-focused Dynabook Portege X40, which shows how well balanced this AMD-powered notebook is.</p>



<h2 id="hp-dragonfly-pro-conclusion">HP Dragonfly Pro: Conclusion</h2>



<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I saw a computer I tested that I&rsquo;d actually want to own, but I&rsquo;d say that the HP Dragonfly Pro checks off most of the boxes for this freelancer. It feels nice to use, is zippy and responsive, has great speakers, and even has a relatively sane price. Although it&rsquo;s an unorthodox choice to pick AMD for this kind of machine, it&rsquo;s clear that when Ryzen is given a chance to shine, it can kick a lot of butt.</p>



<p>As to whether or not I&rsquo;d take this over a MacBook Pro 14 with the new M2 Pro chip, well, that&rsquo;s a tricky question. Apple&rsquo;s latest have incredible screens, lots of ports, magnetic charging, and heaps of efficient power to boot. But those models also start at the eyewatering price of $2,000&mdash;$600 more than this HP with fairly close specs, too. If you don&rsquo;t have a strong preference for macOS, you&rsquo;ll get a lot of value with the HP Dragonfly Pro. It&rsquo;s efficient, long-lasting and, unlike the Mac, can actually flex its muscles and play games during your downtime.</p>

<p>People are creatures of habit. Nerds, doubly so. That&rsquo;s why we all had that one job that was still using a DOS inventory management program on its computers well after 2000, and it&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re still getting <em>Pokemon </em>games while some of the original &ldquo;gotta catch &rsquo;em all&rdquo; generation are now grandparents. It takes a lot to change the way a nerd does things, is my point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on that note: LastPass. I was a happy user of LastPass for years, and an evangelist of the service for my less technical friends and family. (No, Aunt Laura, you can&rsquo;t just have &ldquo;password1&rdquo; as your password for everything.) But if you&rsquo;ve been following the news lately, you know that LastPass and its parent company GoTo have been getting an absolute shellacking among users of all levels after <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1483993/goto-says-lastpass-hackers-stole-encrypted-backups-and-keys.html">a series of high-profile hacks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="lastpass-deserves-no-sympathy">LastPass deserves no sympathy&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Now, a company getting hacked isn&rsquo;t necessarily its fault, and it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily indicate any kind of deficiency. After all, criminals are criminals, and they&rsquo;ll hack any high-profile target that they can. But in the case of LastPass, the hacks <em>absolutely were its fault </em>&mdash; a series of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526524/the-latest-lastpass-fail-came-from-an-employees-home-pc.html">lax security standards</a> and vulnerabilities to targeted phishing attempts were how the malefactors got in.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lastpass" class="wp-image-1419521" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/800.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">II.studio/Shutterstock.com</p></div>



<p>And perhaps more damning, LastPass&rsquo;s failure <em>absolutely indicates a severe deficiency. </em>Aside from the general convenience of remembering your passwords for you, keeping them safe from prying eyes is LastPass&rsquo;s entire business model &mdash; and one that it charges you for if you want to use it on more than one device. If you&rsquo;re going to ask people to pay for basic functionality, functionality that&rsquo;s built into the base level of operating systems and browsers at this point, you had better nail it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LastPass did not nail it. And with the scope of its failure, it&rsquo;s hard to see how anyone can trust the company ever again. If you need a reason to get rid of software you&rsquo;ve been using for years, it&rsquo;s hard to think of a better one than putting every single bit of your online life in danger.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="a-few-alternatives">A few alternatives</h2>



<p>But I&rsquo;m still human, and I have [checks notes] one hundred and forty-two different websites and services that I have to log in separately at this point, and that list is only growing. So a password manager, and moreover, a password manager that&rsquo;s both reasonably secure and cross-platform, is a necessity for both my personal and professional lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this point there are several options if you want to ditch LastPass. I tried <a class="product-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://1password.com/sign-up/&amp;xcust=2-1-1655588-1-389933-13384&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">1Password</a>, and in full disclosure, I did this because the company offers free upgrades to its premium service for members of the press. But unlike LastPass, there&rsquo;s <em>no </em>free version of 1Password, just a free trial, and I felt like that makes it something very difficult to recommend to the average user.&nbsp;I ran into the same issue with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">PCWorld&rsquo;s pick for the best overall password manager</a>, Dashlane, which only offers access on one device on its free tier. </p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://bitwarden.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1655588-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bitwarden</a>, PCWorld&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394731/bitwarden-password-manager-review.html">favorite free password manager</a>, and the password manager that sells itself on being open-source. That doesn&rsquo;t actually matter to me personally, since I can code software about as well as I can practice alligator dentistry. But there&rsquo;s a bit of comfort knowing that there&rsquo;s an army of nerds that can check Bitwarden&rsquo;s work if they want to. And since, again, this is a company you&rsquo;re trusting with the keys to your proverbial castle, they&rsquo;re motivated to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="the-ups-and-downs-of-bitwarden">The ups and downs of Bitwarden</h2>



<p>&ldquo;Open-source&rdquo; comes with a few expectations. One is that it&rsquo;s free, or at least has a free option. Check: Bitwarden&rsquo;s free personal tier gets all the basic functionality of storing and recalling passwords, plus the essential extra of a randomized password generator. (This is absolutely something you want, unless you&rsquo;re great at inventing 14 randomized characters at the drop of a hat.) And as a plus over both LastPass and 1Password, the free tier includes access via apps and browser extensions on unlimited devices. That&rsquo;s hard to beat.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bitwarden pricing model" class="wp-image-1655621" height="841" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bitwarden-pricing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Bitwarden&rsquo;s free tier is extremely generous compared to other password managers, and its premium options are cheap too.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Bitwarden</p></div>



<p>Another expectation of open-source is a somewhat lackadaisical attitude towards the user interface. Alas, this too is the case. Bitwarden&rsquo;s UI is frankly ugly and a bit janky next to its competition. But after using it for a few months you get the ins and outs of its mostly menu tree-based system&hellip;if only by dint of going through each and every menu looking for that one little tweak.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Bitwarden user interface, Chrome browser extension and Android" class="wp-image-1655635" height="692" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bitwarden-interface.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="823" /><figcaption><p>Bitwarden&rsquo;s all-menus, all-the-time interface (Chrome extension left, Android app right) isn&rsquo;t exactly welcoming.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Bitwarden</p></div>



<p>Bitwarden is also missing a few creature features. For example, though the Windows app is more or less redundant if you have a browser extension, you can&rsquo;t set up access to your vault via Windows Hello fingerprint or face scanning without it. That&rsquo;s despite the fact that Chrome can handle Windows Hello authentication on the web just fine. Bitwarden&rsquo;s mobile apps are similarly unintuitive &mdash; at least once a week I have to manually copy and paste my credentials into some app or another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But despite that jank, it&rsquo;s hard to argue with Bitwarden&rsquo;s value proposition. You only need to pay for some extra authentication features and premium access to support, and even that&rsquo;s shockingly cheap at just $10 a year. So I&rsquo;ll continue to use Bitwarden for myself, and recommend it to my friends and family, except for those few who are willing to pay for a good-looking menu interface.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&hellip;and even then, I&rsquo;ll recommend <a class="product-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://1password.com/sign-up/&amp;xcust=2-1-1655588-1-389933-13384&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">1Password</a> over LastPass, at least for the foreseeable future. Because 1Password has yet to have a catastrophic hack or leak&hellip;that we know about. That&rsquo;s how you change a nerd&rsquo;s habits: Give them something free, functional, reliable, and when it comes to security software, something trustworthy.&nbsp;</p>
