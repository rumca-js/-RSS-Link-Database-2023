<p>Microsoft is preparing to launch an Xbox store on iOS and Android as early as next year, according to Phil Spencer. The head of the company’s gaming division shared the timeline in a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7707705e-b288-4531-b30d-7fa993325018"><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a> interview published on Monday, noting the plan is dependent on regulators approving Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html"><ins>$68.7 billion acquisition</ins></a> of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>“We want to be in a position to offer Xbox and content from both us and our third-party partners across any screen where somebody would want to play,” Spencer told the outlet. “Today, we can’t do that on mobile devices but we want to build towards a world that we think will be coming where those devices are opened up.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft first revealed it was working on an Xbox store for mobile devices in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html"><ins>regulatory documents</ins></a> the company filed with the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last year. At the time, the tech giant didn’t provide a timeline for the plan, noting only its proposed merger with Activision Blizzard would play a critical role. Spencer was more direct on Monday. “The Digital Markets Act that’s coming — those are the kinds of things that we are planning for,” he said. “I think it’s a huge opportunity.”</p><p>Under the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html"><ins>Digital Markets Acts</ins></a> (DMA), major platforms the European Union designates as “gatekeepers” will be required to open their devices to competing app stores. Last fall, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-third-party-app-stores-report-195840839.html"><em><ins>Bloomberg </ins></em><ins>report</ins></a> said<em>&nbsp;</em>Apple was already at work preparing to make iOS compliant with the legislation ahead of its March 2024 deadline. The EU will allow companies it labels as gatekeepers to appeal the designation, a carveout that could delay enforcement of the law. Additionally, with challenges from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html"><ins>Federal Trade Commission</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uks-competition-watchdog-says-microsofts-activision-merge-could-harm-uk-gamers-132410352.html"><ins>CMA</ins></a>, there’s no guarantee Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard will close before the new rules apply to Apple and Google, a fact Spencer seemed to acknowledge when interviewed by the <em>Financial Times</em>.  However, he said it would be “pretty trivial” for Microsoft to adapt its existing Xbox and Game Pass apps to sell games and subscriptions through mobile devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/xbox-head-says-microsofts-mobile-game-store-could-arrive-next-year-180007168.html?src=rss

The compatibility is limited to the Lite SE, Pro, Pro 2, SN30 Pro+, SN30 Pro for Android and Ultimate Controller 2.4g, but more models are &quot;incoming.&quot;</p><p>The company's offerings are already some of our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mobile-game-controllers-140023505.html">favorite mobile gaming controllers</a>, and for good reason. They promise good ergonomics, substantial customization and (in some cases) a tinge of nostalgia. It's relatively easy to switch between your Apple devices and other hardware, such as consoles and PCs. That makes them particularly handy if you're playing action games away from home, or just don't want to poke at a touchscreen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These aren't the only strong options for mobile controllers. SteelSeries' Nimbus and Stratus models are well-suited to enthusiasts who want an Xbox-style pad. And if you want a makeshift Switch or Steam Deck, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-kishi-v2-iphone-ios-release-date-price-150017344.html">Razer Kishi</a> is your pick. Still, it's good to have more choices for Apple-friendly input — particularly if you like 8BitDo's priorities.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/8bitdo-controllers-now-work-with-apple-devices-163657954.html?src=rss

<p>LG announced pricing and availability today for its sleek <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-gram-style-16-hands-on-032237742.html">2023 Gram Style laptops</a> announced at CES. The Windows-running ultra-portables are available now, ranging from $1,499 to $1,999.</p><p>The 14-inch LG Gram Style costs $1,499 for 512GB storage and 16GB memory; you’ll pay $1,799 to make it a 1TB SSD and 32GB of RAM. Meanwhile, the larger 16-inch variant costs $1,799 for 1TB and 16GB RAM, while $1,999 will stick with 1TB but move up to 32GB RAM. In addition, LG is currently offering a deal that will get you a 32GB memory model for the price of a 16GB one (with the same screen size) if you order from <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=472a467b-5d76-4e49-b1e8-d1e77258dd8e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LG+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0NzJhNDY3Yi01ZDc2LTRlNDktYjFlOC1kMWU3NzI1OGRkOGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGcuY29tL3VzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3ZjVmYTYzNi1kNGI3LTQzZGEtOTFkMi02NDE4YTA1NGUxYmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWYTEDwEtKDnsU06cvoWp7h7t2ccymwjgygnfsR1HJjW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus">LG’s website</a> between now and April 16th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We were intrigued by LG’s stylish new notebook during our CES demo. Its lid and keyboard deck are made with iridescent Gorilla Glass 3 (with a nano-magnesium alloy base). It has a vanishing trackpad that visually and tactilely blends into the keyboard base when you aren’t using it. They’re light, too: Even the larger model weighs a mere 2.7 lbs (Engadget’s Cherlynn Low had no problem doing a bunch of bicep curls with it). However, we were less sure about its build quality, as the 16-inch model yielded a bit during our lifting tests on the CES floor — and we've run into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-30-lg-gram-17-review-price-specs-big-screen-thin-light.html">build-quality issues</a> with past LG Gram models.</p><p>The LG Gram Style has a 3,200 x 2,000 OLED with a 120HZ refresh rate for the 16-inch model and a 2,880 x 1,800 OLED at 90Hz for the 14-inch variant. It runs on Intel’s latest 13-generation Core processors.</p><div id="5c534761166d452493a42f2109e4a681"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lgs-iridescent-2023-gram-style-laptops-start-at-1499-162230620.html?src=rss

## Amazon will lay off another 9,000 employees in the coming weeks

<p>Amazon may not be done <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html">widening the scope of its layoffs</a>. Amazon chief Andy Jassy has <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/update-from-ceo-andy-jassy-on-amazons-operating-plan-and-additional-role-eliminations">sent a memo</a> to staff indicating the company will cut another 9,000 jobs in the &quot;next few weeks.&quot; The reductions will primarily affect Twitch, advertising and cloud computing divisions like Amazon Web Services, according to the message. The CEO also warns that the final cuts aren't likely to be finalized until mid-to-late April, and that Amazon won't inform affected workers until that point.</p><p>Jassy says the expanded layoffs follow a &quot;second phase&quot; of operational planning focused on trimming costs. Some teams weren't ready for the initial round of layoff announcements <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html">in November</a>, and the company wanted to announce decisions early to provide information &quot;as soon as possible,&quot; Jassy adds. The online retailer is promising severance pay, transitional health insurance coverage and help finding jobs elsewhere.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon confirmed the memo's existence to Engadget following <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/amazon-layoffs-company-to-cut-off-9000-more-workers.html">a leak</a> by <em>CNBC</em>. As before, Jassy attributes the cutbacks to an &quot;uncertain economy&quot; and lingering doubts about near-future performance. The firm wants to be &quot;more streamlined&quot; while still having the resources to invest in better experiences, the executive claims.</p><p>The company said it would lay off 10,000 employees last fall, but adjusted that to 18,000 in January. At the time, most of the cuts focused on retail and recruiting. Last year, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-closing-bookstores-4-star-stores-210240474.html">shuttered some of its physical stores</a> and wound down some business units. While the brand benefited from the shift to online shopping at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, it faced turbulence as people returned to pre-pandemic habits.</p><p>Amazon isn't the only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html">big tech company announcing layoffs</a> this year, or even the only one planning deeper cuts. Meta said this month it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zuckerberg-touts-year-of-efficiency-as-meta-lays-off-an-additional-10000-workers-131957819.html">let go of another 10,000 workers</a> after slashing 11,000 positions in the fall. However, Amazon is now cutting more aggressively than many others. It's also notable that Twitch is part of the layoffs. The livestreaming service thrived during the early pandemic, but Streamlabs and Stream Hatchet <a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-and-stream-hatchet-q3-2022-live-streaming-report">estimate</a> that viewership has been on a steady decline since spring 2021. Simply speaking, there isn't as much demand for Twitch as there was when people were stuck at home.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-will-lay-off-another-9000-employees-in-the-coming-weeks-152653190.html?src=rss

## How to organize your desk at home

<p>If you’ve been working from home for a while, you’ve hopefully moved on from your dining table or kitchen counter to an actual desk. But just like a traditional office cubicle, it’s easy for your work-from-home desk to get cluttered with paperwork, cables, supplies, coffee mugs and more. Cleaning your desk may not be high up on your priority list, but you’ll benefit from it if you do take the time to bring things back to a more tidy status quo. . Here are a few of our recommendations that will help you organize your desk and hopefully be more productive as a result.</p><h2>Monitor riser</h2><p></p><p>We suggested getting an external monitor in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/work-from-home-essentials-irl-124500348.html">previous WFH guide</a>, too, and for good reason. It seriously increases your screen real estate and is oftentimes easier on the eyes. However, not all monitors are height adjustable and they do take up quite a bit of desk space. A monitor stand or riser is a way to resolve that. A simple yet effective one is the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BbWF6b25CYXNpY3MtQWRqdXN0YWJsZS1Db21wdXRlci1Nb25pdG9yLVJpc2VyL2RwL0IwMFg0U0NDRkc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcGUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjY2I4MTJmLTBhOTgtNDg0OC1hZGRlLTU0NGZkNDA2MjU5ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASWyPgEw9dX9mkhA7JWQjLWqQ5FM3SpKmlGwpjvfC_Hw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmazonBasics-Adjustable-Computer-Monitor-Riser%2Fdp%2FB00X4SCCFG">Amazon Basics model</a>, which has stackable legs for your desired height (up to 4-⅞ inches) plus an 11-inch wide storage space underneath to store your laptop or other knick knacks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If, on the other hand, you want something a little more stylish, this bamboo monitor stand from <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TT05HTUlDUy1Nb25pdG9yLU9yZ2FuaXNlci1DZWxscGhvbmUtTExEMjAxL2RwL0IwMDhPVjVBMks_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcGUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjY2I4MTJmLTBhOTgtNDg0OC1hZGRlLTU0NGZkNDA2MjU5ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaxGM3tbh6WrqXIGcQX9Cs8CxxRwXbsTLaoYnCQBKkdV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSONGMICS-Monitor-Organiser-Cellphone-LLD201%2Fdp%2FB008OV5A2K%3F">SONGMICS</a> is a particularly attractive one.

This particular model also works well as a laptop stand thanks to three holes designed for optimal heat ventilation.</p><p>If you really don’t want a monitor on your desk at all, consider a monitor arm. This is an especially good choice if you’re restless and need to change your monitor position frequently.

It has a removable VESA plate and a clamp mount, plus the option of mounting the arm to grommet holes if your desk has them. It accommodates 13- to 32-inch monitors and can support a max weight of 19.8 pounds.</p><h2>Laptop stand</h2><p></p><p>If you’re using your laptop as-is on your desk or on your lap, you’re doing it wrong. Hunching your shoulders to look at your screen is harmful for your posture, which can lead to back, neck and arm pain if you’re not careful. Instead, you’ll want your screen to be at eye level, and if you don’t have an external monitor, that means elevating your laptop with a stand. This has the added benefit of giving you more desk space as well.</p><p>We particularly recommend the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9SYWluLURlc2lnbi0xMjAzMS1BZGp1c3RhYmxlLU5vdGVib29rL2RwL0IwMExTVTRRRDg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcGUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRjY2I4MTJmLTBhOTgtNDg0OC1hZGRlLTU0NGZkNDA2MjU5ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARXZ8PkBEU-CPcJ0voGq6_4VpFlpAWIRSX_qJKNPkbzW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRain-Design-12031-Adjustable-Notebook%2Fdp%2FB00LSU4QD8%3F">Rain Design iLevel2</a>.

Our favorite is the Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 pad as it features 15W MagSafe charging for the iPhone, fast charging for Apple Watch Series 7 plus a spot for AirPods or any other Qi-compatible earbud case. The Apple Watch charger is especially notable as it works not just horizontally and vertically, but there’s also a knob that lets you accommodate different sizes plus third-party cases. On top of that, the horizontal layout lets you charge any wireless phone at reduced speeds.</p><p>Alternatively, if you want a version with a smaller footprint, the BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 wireless charger is a fantastic option.

A Netflix spokesperson told Engadget that the games should remain on other services after next year. Meanwhile, developer Ustwo (which is behind last year's <em>Desta: The Memories Between</em>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ustwo-desta-netflix-game-173008612.html"><ins>also available on</ins><em><ins>&nbsp;</ins></em><ins>Netflix</ins></a>) has hinted that another Monument Valley game is on the way as part of its Netflix deal.</p><p>Also in the pipeline is a game based on an unannounced upcoming Netflix IP. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-30-mobile-moba-vainglory-pc.html"><em>Vainglory</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>developer Super Evil Megacorp is working on the exclusive title, which it says will build on the studio's expertise in team-based combat. You can expect to learn more about this project later this year. Netflix vice-president of external games Leanne Loombe recently told reporters that this game is part of a "big bet" and a "transmedia play" for the company.</p><p>All told, Netflix has 70 games in development with its partners and 16 in the works at its internal studios. Most of the games Netflix's own teams are making are still in the very early stages, though Night School Studio's <em>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals </em>is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oxenfree-2-delayed-2023-164908520.html"><ins>slated to arrive later this year</ins></a>. Netflix is promising to release new games every month for the rest of 2023, including "indie darlings, award-winning hits, RPGs, narrative adventures [and] puzzle games."</p><p>Loombe said that since Netflix started offering games in 2021, it has found that players are largely drawn to three types of experiences: recognizable titles from elsewhere, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-ios-android-netflix-mobile-exclusive-193022210.html"><em><ins>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/immortality-arrives-on-ios-android-225120433.html"><em><ins>Immortality</ins></em></a>; ones that encourage daily play, including <em>Solitaire </em>and <em>Knittens</em>; and games based on its own shows and movies, like <em>Stranger Things</em>.</p><p>Given Netflix's designs on becoming a world-class game publisher, I hope it doesn't focus on those areas exclusively. In any case, it's off to a strong start. For instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-games-downwell-poinpy-devolver-digital-reigns-three-kingdoms-173333076.html"><em><ins>Poinpy</ins></em></a><em>,</em> a vertical platformer that doesn't fall neatly into any of those three categories, was my favorite game of 2022.</p><p>Netflix has said it's looking into cloud gaming, so you may eventually get to play its library on computers, smart TVs and even consoles. But its focus is primarily on mobile. Making sure <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-mobile-games-no-one-playing/">more people are aware</a> they can play some great games as part of their subscription will be key to Netflix Games' growth plan too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netflix-plans-to-add-roughly-40-more-titles-to-its-mobile-game-library-this-year-140014333.html?src=rss

<p>Ceramic kamado-style grills have been some of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-grilling-gear-143011296.html">best grilling gear</a> available for backyard cooks for a long time. However, it takes practice to master lighting them and maintaining proper temperatures. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-harvard-barbecue-desora-kamado-joe-cinder-grills.html">Kamado Joe</a> aims to get rid of those frustrations with its latest smart grill. The Konnected Joe is equipped with a push-button charcoal igniter and a digitally controlled fan system. The former gets the grill going and while the latter keeps the heat level where you need it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Konnected Joe is a true kamado grill at its core. The ceramic chamber has trademark Kamado Joe design features like an Air Lift hinge that raises the lid with ease, two-tier cooking inside, side shelves and a slide-out ash drawer for quick cleaning. The 18-inch diameter cooking surface offers 250 square inches of grilling space. The company says this is enough room for 13 burgers, four whole chickens or two pork butts. In the bottom of the cooking chamber, Kamado Joe has added a so-called Automatic Fire Starter that ignites charcoal with a simple button press. The company says this tool can have your grill ready to use in less than 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Kamado Joe Konnected Joe" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/99f14b40-c6d3-11ed-bfff-a7c96916d2cc" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kamado Joe</div></figure><p>The smart grilling features center around Kamado Joe's Kontrol System. This setup includes the Kontrol Board digital display, the Kontrol Fan that maintains temperature and the Kontrol Tower vent up top. The entire system is controlled from the Kamado Joe app where you can adjust and monitor grill temps, keep tabs on food temperatures (up to three probes at once) and check in on cook times. Plus, you can do all of this without being near the grill. The Konnected Joe has a temperature range of 200-700 degrees Fahrenheit, so you can expect to do low-and-slow smoking, high-heat searing and everything in between. An Automatic Cook Mode puts step-by-step guidance on the grill's display and a Classic Cook Mode allows you to do everything manually.&nbsp;</p><p>The Konnected Joe is $1,699, $300 less than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kamado-joe-pellet-joe-ceramic-smart-grill-specs-price-availability-201946770.html">the WiFi-equipped Pellet Joe</a> that debuted in 2020. Pre-orders start today at the company's website, The Home Depot and other retailers. Kamado Joe says the grill will begin shipping in June.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/kamado-joe-konnected-joe-grill-price-specs-133020818.html?src=rss

## Samsung's expanded OLED TV lineup includes a new lower-priced series

<p>Samsung is finally offering more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-77-inch-s95-qd-oled-tv-goes-on-sale-for-4500-094444385.html">one OLED TV series</a>. The company is expanding its Quantum Dot OLED range to add a more affordable S90C family (pictured above). You'll have to settle for a scaled-back version of object-tracking sound and won't get the S95C's near-flush wall mounting or external connection box. You'll still get a punchy QD-OLED image, AI-based HDR mapping, Dolby Atmos audio and syncing with Samsung soundbars.</p><p>The S90C starts at $1,899 for a 55-inch model and scales up to $3,599 for a 77-inch version. A 65-inch set is &quot;coming soon.&quot; Conveniently, those prices match what LG is asking for equivalent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lgs-2023-oled-tvs-arrive-in-late-march-starting-at-1299-175513466.html">C3 TVs</a> — Samsung is clearly eager to upstage its main rival, although it still doesn't offer Dolby Vision HDR.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You'll also have more options if you're willing to spend extra on the S95C. In addition to the already-shipping $4,499 77-inch model, Samsung is adding more reasonable 55-inch ($2,499) and 65-inch ($3,299) screens. Those prices are higher than last year's models, but match the prices of LG's G3 line. Samsung claims a slightly brighter 2,000-nit output and a 144Hz refresh rate for compatible PC games.</p><p>Both the S90C and S95C are rolling out today. It's too soon to say if Samsung or LG has the best OLED TV family this year, but it may come down to differences like Dolby Vision support or a brighter picture. However, it's safe to say Samsung is now fully invested in OLED TVs after avoiding them for years. The extra competition may be good news if it leads to more aggressive pricing and feature upgrades.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-expanded-oled-tv-lineup-includes-a-new-lower-priced-series-130035154.html?src=rss

## The next-gen ‘Digits’ robot gets a head and hands

<p>Agility Robotics announced an updated version today of its bipedal Digits warehouse robot. Designed to take on repetitive or injury-risking tasks, the new version adds a head (with LED animated eyes) and hands, and it can handle a wider variety of demanding workloads than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">its predecessor</a>.</p><p>The new Digits robot can “reach higher, carry more, last longer, charge faster and convey intent” better than the previous model. In addition, it’s better at manipulating its surroundings, and it has keener perception and is better at human-robot interactions. The machine is 5’9” tall and weighs around 140 lbs, including newly designed “end effectors” (hands) that help it reach high or low spaces and pick up or place plastic totes or other objects found in shipping warehouses.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Warehouse work includes many process-automated, repetitive tasks that all too often lead to injury and high turnover, leaving costly gaps in the workforce that snarl supply chains,” explains the company in a press release. “While automation can help fill those gaps, existing automation solutions are typically single purpose, meaning companies have to onboard and maintain dozens of different solutions for different tasks, or they require expensive customization to the workspace.” The idea is that a humanoid robot can best replicate the tasks typically assigned to humans.</p><figure><img alt="Two humanoid bipedal robots: one (left) reaching onto warehouse shelves to grasp plastic storage bins, the other (right) walking with a bin to the right." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/60dd72a0-c504-11ed-aff5-f7948af55e0e" style="height: 1135; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Agility Robotics</div></figure><p>Although automation can spare human workers from the most grueling activities, it isn’t always that tidy: Machines are as likely to erase human jobs altogether. Moreover, with wealth disparity already astronomically high, the robot arrives as the world’s largest corporations have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html">laying off</a> thousands of employees; it’s hard not to view these machines with as much cynicism as awe.</p><p>Agility Robotics will perform fully autonomous live demos of Digits at <a href="https://www.promatshow.com/">ProMat Chicago</a> this week (March 20th to 23rd). The company is also opening applications for spots in its Agility Partner Program (APP), which will be the only place to purchase them initially. Pricing has yet to be announced, and the first units are expected to ship to APP participants in early 2024. The company is aiming for 2025 for general availability.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-next-gen-digits-robot-gets-a-head-and-hands-120001329.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: NASA’s AIM spacecraft goes silent after a 15-year run

The agency said it was ending operational support for the spacecraft due to a battery power failure. NASA first noticed issues with AIM’s battery in 2019, but the probe was still sending a “significant amount of data” back to Earth. Following another recent decline in battery power, NASA says AIM has become unresponsive.</p><p>NASA launched the AIM – Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere – mission in 2007 to study noctilucent or night-shining clouds, which can last hundreds of years in the Earth's upper atmosphere. It was only meant to operate up in the skies for two years, but it’s provided data for multiple groundbreaking studies, including a recent <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/climate-change-responsible-these-rare-high-latitude-clouds-180969712/">2018 study</a> that found methane emissions (and the climate change effects) are causing night-shining clouds to form more frequently.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">Acer</a> is making a serious left turn in its product offerings with today's announcement of the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=56197a86-8c27-4ba2-9aa1-20de6e52c761&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Acer&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1NjE5N2E4Ni04YzI3LTRiYTItOWFhMS0yMGRlNmU1MmM3NjEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNlci5jb20vZWJpaS91cy1lbi9pbmRleC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmNzMwZWI3My1lNzI0LTQ1NDctOTQ5Mi03ZDljMTYzZDU0YjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaHHaR95McwMKYzQT4PldWJwoLGN20AgGRGaaQ-gvZe5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Febii%2Fus-en%2Findex.html">ebii e-bike</a>. The Taiwanese company — typically known for its PCs, laptops and accessories — touts ebii as a bike designed for cities, with AI features used to learn riders' personal preferences and change gears depending on road conditions. Weight wise, it's about 35 pounds, making it lighter than most e-bikes. Acer claims it has a maximum assist speed of 20 MPH and can go just under 70 miles on one charge.&nbsp;</p><div id="489717c4f2384e90b0a0d70c08d0ecbf"></div><p>The bike takes about two and a half hours to reach full battery life. In this area, Acer connects back to its roots, as the power brick can also be used as a portable charger for your laptop or phone. Riders must download the ebiiGO app for information on battery life, recommended routes, speed checks and to lock and unlock the bike. However, ebii will also auto-lock anytime the linked phone leaves the immediate area. Plus, it has an anti-theft alarm.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additional features of the ebii include collision detection sensors, lights in every direction and airless tires to avoid a flat.&nbsp;</p><p>Acer hasn't specified how much the ebii costs or when it will be released.

## Apple's 512GB Mac Mini M2 is $99 off right now

<p>Apple's Mac Mini M2 is the cheapest way to get the company's latest processors, and now Amazon is offering the more desirable model at the best price we've seen. You can buy the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJTSEdUUE1WLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1wNi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDkxNzBhNGMtZWM5MS00NTQyLTgyOTEtZGExNzEyZmFiYTg2In0&amp;signature=AQAAATT1xXXFlqK_FJVQDSRdj3v5xgXl5SGpBcBthuYjBdoU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BSHGTPMV%2F">512MB Mini M2</a> for $700, or $100 (12 percent) off the regular price. The one caveat is that the shipping date is set for April 12th, but if you're not in a huge hurry, it's the best deal to date.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-mini-review-m2-pro-2023-140052205.html">In our review</a>, we gave the Mac Mini a solid score of 86, lauding the performance and classic aluminum design. It's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-mini-review-m2-pro-2023-140052205.html">tiny but mighty</a>, with the M2 model easily powerful enough for productivity chores and multitasking. The chip combines computing operations, like CPU, GPU, input/output interfaces and certain memory processes into one "system on a chip," allowing for faster processing speeds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of that, you get killer connectivity, with two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C connections, HDMI 2.0 (with 4K 240Hz and 8K 60Hz output), two USB-A ports, a headphone jack and gigabit Ethernet (upgradeable to 10 gigabit). The M2 Pro model adds two additional USB-C ports, making it even more useful for creatives with a ton of accessories.</p><p>The Mac Mini M2 won't replace your gaming machine, but it can handle nearly everything else you throw at it. We wouldn't recommend the overpriced storage or RAM upgrades either, as the M2 is much more efficient with RAM than typical PCs. Still, if you're looking for a cheap but powerful Mac, this is the way to go.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-512gb-mac-mini-m2-is-99-off-right-now-093619032.html?src=rss
