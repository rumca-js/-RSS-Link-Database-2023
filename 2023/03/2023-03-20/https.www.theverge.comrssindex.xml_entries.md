  <p id="z9WUNH">Google is rolling out a fix for a bug that made Pixel Watch alarms go off at the wrong time. The Clock app update will be delivered via the Play Store, according to a statement from the company provided by spokesperson Sofia Giovannello.</p>
<p id="6I6eEM">Reports of the problem <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/113tvvo/alarm_sounding_at_incorrect_times/">started cropping up last month</a>, with users reporting that their smartwatch alarms would sometimes go off a few minutes early or late. Apparently, they could miss the mark by up to 10 minutes, which could be the difference between making a meeting and missing it. </p>

  <p id="zUQOaU">Book publishers and the Internet Archive will face off today in a hearing that could determine the future of library ebooks — deciding whether libraries must rely on the often temporary digital licenses that publishers offer or whether they can scan and lend copies of their own tomes.</p>
<p id="0tnmx1">At 1PM ET, a New York federal court will hear oral arguments in <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17211300/hachette-book-group-inc-v-internet-archive/?page=1"><em>Hachette v. Internet Archive</em></a>, a lawsuit over the archive’s Open Library program. The court will consider whether the Open Library violated copyright law by letting users “check out” digitized copies of physical books, an assertion several major publishers made in their 2020 suit. The case will be broadcast over teleconference, <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2023/03/17/heres-how-to-participate-in-mondays-oral-arguments/">with the phone number available here</a>.</p>

  <p id="k8NS7k">Netflix is still working on its cloud gaming service, which could make its burgeoning games lineup easier to play and available across more devices. The company’s VP of games, Mike Verdu, announced in October that Netflix was “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23411684/netflix-cloud-gaming-studio-pc-tv">seriously exploring</a>” a cloud gaming service, and work on the project is “underway,” Leanne Loombe, Netflix’s VP of external games, said in a briefing with reporters.</p>
<p id="8Mfv4A">“We are very early in that side of our journey,” Loombe said. “We do believe that cloud gaming will enable us to provide that easy access to games on any screen and be frictionless and provide the accessibility into gaming experiences.” She cautioned that Netflix is being “super thoughtful” about how it builds the service, perhaps to avoid <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378713/google-stadia-shutting-down-game-streaming-january-2023">a Google...</a></p>

There were no further instructions, no rules. Users’ votes just implicitly set the percentage of things like butter, flour, sugar... and vanilla extract.</p>
<p id="vOZAL9">If you’re already a Tumblr user, <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/please-dont-trust-twitter-with-your">you know how this went</a>. The resulting cake recipe was 44 percent vanilla — briefly turning the phrase “<a href="https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/vanilla%20extract?sort=top">vanilla extract</a>” into a sitewide meme. While the gag was short-lived and the cake (<a href="https://youtu.be/falApGAB8Rc?t=440">based on one real-life baking test</a>) far from delicious, it’s become part of a much larger trend on Tumblr: turning the site’s polls into sometimes surprisingly complex — and often very funny — games.</p>
