[{"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "How Long Is Tchia?", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/tchia/\">Tchia</a> casts players as the titular character as she explores fictional islands inspired by the real-life island group of New Caledonia, offering hours and hours of laid-back exploration and creative gameplay mechanics. Though there's a lot to do, you don't necessarily have to engage with all of it, so your time spent in Tchia's world will vary pretty greatly based on how much time you <em>want</em> to invest. If you're wondering what to expect before diving in, we'll give you an idea of how long you'll spend with Tchia.</p><h2>How long is Tchia?</h2><p>An average playthrough of Tchia should take around <strong>10-12 hours</strong>, which includes seeing the main story through and doing some casual exploration for additional items. However, completing the core adventure ignores a lot of what makes Tchia such an intriguing experience, as this open-world game is very much designed to be explored thoroughly and mined for its various collectibles and challenges.</p><p>If you're looking to get 100% completion in Tchia--which also will net you all of the trophies and achievements--you can expect to spend somewhere between <strong>15-20 hours</strong> with the game. This includes things like tracking down well over a hundred collectibles in the open world and completing all of the rock-stacking challenges, races, and shooting galleries. Doing so can feel a bit tedious at times due to the game's limited fast travel points, but the relaxing atmosphere and chill gameplay loop help make up for it somewhat.</p>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-is-tchia/1100-6512044/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-20 21:50:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Elden Ring Death Count Revealed | GameSpot News", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4114957-news0320_v0.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Bandai Namco is celebrating the first anniversary of the game with an infographic revealing some of the first year's most impressive statistics.", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/elden-ring-death-count-revealed-gamespot-news/2300-6460910/", "date_published": "2023-03-20 21:11:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Diablo 4 Mount - How To Get The Spectral Charger Horse", "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/\">Diablo 4</a> beta has only given players a small slice of what they will be able to fully access when the game officially launches on June 6, 2023. For starters, players are just limited to the major city of Kyovashad and the surrounding region of Fractured Peaks. While this region is chock-full of dungeons, side quests, and Strongholds, it's nothing compared to what the full game will offer.</p><p>As a part of the beta, some of the content in Diablo 4 is simply not available. This includes most of the main story campaign, the neighboring regions around Fractured Peaks, and additional character and Renown levels, among other things. However, one missing bit of content that players would love to have in the Diablo 4 beta are mounts. However, possibly due to a<strong> bug or unintentional loot drop</strong>, players are actually able to receive a mount in the Diablo 4 beta--but even then, the mount is not yet rideable, which for many players will defeat the purpose of following the steps written below. This mount is called the Spectral Charger/Ghastly Reins, and if you still care to try to obtain it for yourself, keep reading.</p><h2>Unlocking the Spectral Charger mount</h2><p>This mount unlock was first discovered by a Reddit user, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/11vhq04/spectral_charger_ghastly_reins/\">u/oPawix00</a>, over the closed beta weekend.

Whether you made it to the level cap with all three available classes or weren't fortunate enough to have access to this invite-only test, one thing many Diablo fans will be interested in is what kind of Legendary items are available. And, more specifically, what the effects of those Legendaries are.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Legendaries are among the rarest items in Diablo, and they typically come associated with some kind of unique effect that can be some combination of fun and devastating to wield. Although the recent Diablo IV beta was limited in scope--only allowing us to try out the early portion of the game, and only with the Rogue, Sorceress, and Barbarian classes--we did nonetheless get to see quite a few Legendary items and their associated effects.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We've compiled those below, including those that are class-specific and some that can be wielded by multiple classes. These are items we either obtained ourselves or inspected on other players. Some of these effects are attached to weapons through the Imprint process, which allows you to take an effect extracted from one item (or unlocked through the Codex of Power) and apply it to another.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-open-beta-dates-queues-early-access-and-how-to-get-into-beta/1100-6511672/\">Diablo 4's beta returns this Friday, March 24</a>, this time as an open beta available to all players.

Former WWE Champion and Grand Slam winner The Miz will serve as the official host for the event. WrestleMania 39 will be the sixth to be held in the greater Los Angeles area (after 2, VII, XII, 2000, and 21). It'll be the seventh in the state of California overall (including 31, which was held in the San Francisco Bay Area).</p><p>Along with Rhodes and Reigns, another big match is Charlotte Flair defending her Smackdown Women's Championship against Royal Rumble winner Rhea Ripley. This is a rematch of sorts from 2020 when Charlotte won the Women's Royal Rumble for the right to take on Rhea for her NXT Championship, but since then, Ripley has come into her own as a viable opponent. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins will take on Logan Paul which will surely get a lot of eyes as Paul has also impressed wrestling fans over the last year with his own high-flying style.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-wrestlemania-2023-match-card-start-time-how-to-watch-and-more/1100-6512501/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-wrestlemania-2023-match-card-start-time-how-to-watch-and-more/1100-6512501/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-20 16:47:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Best Buy Is Slashing Prices On Video Games, Laptops, And More This Week", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4114842-reddeadredemption2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Best Buy is running some impressive discounts this week, with price cuts on video games, laptops, TVs, gaming monitors, and dozens of other popular electronics.

No one expected him to lace up his boots and step back into the ring again, yet the Heartbreak Kid made a triumphant return in 2002, eventually going on to cement his legacy with unforgettable matches against the likes of Triple H, The Undertaker, and Ric Flair. The quality of the second half of Michaels' career ensured that his surprise comeback would be remembered as one of the most spectacular returns in WWE history, and it's one that's echoed in some ways by WWE 2K23. Following the disaster that was 2K20--a game so bad its successor was outright canceled--developer Visual Concepts returned to the squared circle last year with a solid foundation that 2K23 improves upon in a variety of ways, finally putting the long-running series back on form with a surprise comeback Mr. WrestleMania himself would be proud of.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Little has changed since last year's entry from a gameplay perspective. You still alternate between light and heavy strikes to execute various combos; grapple your opponent to hit them with suplexes, DDTs, and spinning neck breakers; and build up meters to gain access to signature moves and flashy match-ending finishers. Some may bemoan that it still doesn't play like No Mercy--an N64 game that many still consider the best wrestling game ever--but the series has never tried to. 2K23 is a solid wrestling sim, with most matches swaying back and forth as momentum shifts via desperate reversals and last-ditch kick-outs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The improvements Visual Concepts has implemented are subtle, yet prove to be welcome adjustments, successfully banishing some minor annoyances from 2K22. The timing window on reversals, for instance, has been tightened up. Previously, it was a little too easy to turn the tide of a contest thanks to the generous amount of time you were given to nullify an attack. With a shorter window, reversals feel more impactful this year, encouraging you to study your opponent's move set and sharpen your reaction times as a result. This ensures matches are more engaging and also imbues each one with some added tension.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k23-review-head-of-the-table/1900-6418048/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k23-review-head-of-the-table/1900-6418048/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-20 15:16:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Hideo Kojima Intended Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes To Be The First In Episodic Series", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">It's been nine years since Snake appeared drenched by the rain in Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes.
