But he hasn\u2019t</p><p>Since becoming a mother, I\u2019ve found myself thinking a lot about stay-at-home mums.<br /><br />What a job. It is hard graft \u2013 round-the-clock physical, mental and emotional labour. Stay-at-home parenting is mostly undertaken by women, but does that mean that it\u2019s our \u201cnatural nurturing role\u201d, as the Tory MP George Eustice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/19/stay-at-home-motherhood-being-undermined-says-senior-tory-mp\">said recently</a>? He argues that the government is prioritising childcare policy at the expense of incentivising women to stay at home. \u201cFathers, of course, have a very strong paternal desire to spend time with their children, but you can\u2019t get away from the way we are biologically wired \u2013 and the maternal instinct is a strong one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is generally the case that mothers in particular will want, if they can, to spend that time with their young children.\u201d<br /><br />Many of us would disagree with the idea that women are biologically programmed to perform all of the work of stay-at-home parenting, or that men don\u2019t want to be central to their children\u2019s lives. It feels terribly convenient, doesn\u2019t it? <br /><br />Yet our ideas of fatherhood are shifting. Both the Fatherhood Institute and Dr Anna Machin, one of the UK\u2019s leading evolutionary anthropologists and author of The Life of Dad, have deplored the comments for the outdated, ignorant and insulting drivel they are. Machin in particular pointed out how unsupported men are when they want to be present parents in their children\u2019s lives.<br /><br />Not all dads. Some use \u201c<a href=\"https://www.care.com/c/what-is-weaponized-incompetence/\">weaponised incompetence</a>\u201d when it comes to childcare. Often both halves of a heterosexual couple will engage in the delusion that the father is useless, so the mother has to do everything. The woman, therefore, becomes \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/24/mum-watched-me-correct-my-husband-then-sagely-warned-me-dont-become-the-expert-in-the-baby\">the expert in the baby</a>\u201d. And so she never lets him learn, or he never bothers, and he never becomes the dad he could be.<br /><br />Why do I mention this? Because, in this way, society has been performing a sort of weaponised incompetence when it comes to childcare policy for decades now: \u201cit\u2019s easier if you do it.\u201d Society hasn\u2019t been supporting women to stay at home, but it has been expecting it.<br /><br />It isn\u2019t easier. Women often feel they have no choice. Hence the need for affordable childcare. Of course, if a woman chooses to be a stay-at-home mother, then that choice should be supported. Some women can\u2019t wait to get back to the office, but some are heartbroken to be putting their babies in full-time nursery and would rather stay home, but can\u2019t.</p><p>Stay-at-home mums are often left out of these discussions because their existence is inconvenient to both sides. Women who actively want to be stay-at-home mums are uncomfortable for some feminists to contemplate because they have traditionally been so lionised.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist<br /></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/20/george-eustice-stay-at-home-mums-society-women-tory-mp-childcare\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/20/george-eustice-stay-at-home-mums-society-women-tory-mp-childcare", "date_published": "2023-03-20 14:02:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Rail strikes: RMT votes to accept Network Rail pay offer", "description": "<p>Members voted overwhelmingly in favour of the offer, worth 9% over two years, in deal that should bring worst of disruption to end</p><p>Members of the RMT union have voted to accept a pay offer from Network Rail.</p><p>Thousands of rail workers including signalling staff voted by three to one in favour to accept the offer, a 9% pay increase over two years, in a referendum that closed on Monday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/20/rail-strikes-rmt-vote-network-rail-pay-offer-aslef\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/20/rail-strikes-rmt-vote-network-rail-pay-offer-aslef", "date_published": "2023-03-20 14:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018Heinous, calculated\u2019: Colorado dentist suspected of wife\u2019s murder by poisoning", "description": "<p>James Toliver Craig, 45, of Aurora held for murder after taking wife Angela to hospital with severe headaches and dizziness</p><p>In what authorities have called a \u201cheinous, complex and calculated murder\u201d, a dentist from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/denver\">Denver</a> area is facing accusations that he poisoned his wife and killed her.</p><p>James Toliver Craig, 45, of Aurora, Colorado, came under scrutiny after he drove his 43-year-old wife Angela to a hospital on Wednesday night as she complained of severe headaches and dizziness, according to police.

Fiction is fuelled by it.</p><p>In November 1616, the first English ambassador to India, Sir Thomas Roe, wrote a letter to his paymasters in the East India Company. Roe\u2019s letter is full of frustration at being treated as the representative of a minor \u201cFrankish\u201d power by the opulent Mughal court, but its main focus is on the company\u2019s own errors. He warns them repeatedly that \u201cwarr and trafique [trade] are incompatible\u201d, and it was better to seek profit in \u201cquiett trade\u201d. Roe was no idealist when it came to English global ambitions. His advice was grounded in the best use of the company\u2019s resources rather than any view of the ethical justification of empire, but it is significant all the same. As history tells us, quiet trade did not remain the aim of the English in India. What would have happened if Roe\u2019s advice had been followed? As I worked on a history of the first English embassy to India, this was a question that raised its head repeatedly, both in my own thinking and in conversations with others. While the simple answer is that there is no telling, ignoring the question means imposing a sense of inevitability on the presence of the British in India, erasing the uncertainties that defined it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/20/the-big-idea-why-we-should-study-the-history-that-never-happened\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/20/the-big-idea-why-we-should-study-the-history-that-never-happened", "date_published": "2023-03-20 12:30:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Derby expected to be named new HQ of Britain\u2019s rail network", "description": "<p>Exclusive: Midlands city is frontrunner to become official home of Great British Railways</p><p>Derby is expected to be named the new headquarters of Britain\u2019s rail network by ministers this week, the Guardian understands.</p><p>The delayed result of the competition to become the official home of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/19/uk-rail-overhaul-privatised-great-british-railways-\">Great British Railways</a> is expected as early as Tuesday, with the Midlands city the frontrunner on a shortlist of six including Birmingham, Crewe, Doncaster, Newcastle and York.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/20/derby-hq-britain-rail-network-great-british-railways\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/20/derby-hq-britain-rail-network-great-british-railways", "date_published": "2023-03-20 12:18:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "A year ago my Essex home town was abuzz at becoming a city \u2013 now a \u2018toxic\u2019 culture war has taken over | Tim Burrows", "description": "<p>Southend\u2019s struggles with political decision-making and underfunding tell us a lot about modern England</p><p>It is a little more than a year since Southend-on-Sea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/01/i-will-tell-my-grandchildren-southend-celebrates-city-status\">became a city</a>, sealed with a visit from the Prince of Wales.

It\u2019s as if writer-director Alfonso Quijada, better known hitherto as an actor and producer, doesn\u2019t know if he wants to make a telenovela-style melodrama or something more elevated and arty \u2013 in the tradition of Claudia Llosa\u2019s The Milk of Sorrow or Lila Avil\u00e9s\u2019s films The Chambermaid and T\u00f3tem \u2013 with long takes and oblique storytelling strategies. In the end, it fails to satisfy either ambition.</p><p>Josefina and her younger brother Alfredo (William Castillo) lost their mother not long ago and seem to have no father in the picture; they live with their godmother in a rural part of El Salvador. Josefina picks coffee on an estate owned by Don Villagran (Boris Barraza) while Alfredo is supposed to be going to school. However, he has taken to bunking off with some bad boys, as Josefina\u2019s friend Dalia (Emy Mena) describes them.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/20/the-whisper-of-silence-review-coffee-taster-drama-makes-most-of-stunning-locations\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/20/the-whisper-of-silence-review-coffee-taster-drama-makes-most-of-stunning-locations", "date_published": "2023-03-20 11:00:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "How we met: \u2018I was almost scared to see him again, because I knew he would change my life\u2019", "description": "<p>Niall, 66, and Poul, 62, met in a bar in London in 2001.

The antics of this entitled flibbertigibbet expose the absurdity of a culture in which the self only exists if it is validated by a selfie, membership of society depends on the mirage of social media and the reality in which we were all once anchored has been replaced by a flimsy virtual replica.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/20/paris-the-memoir-review-paris-hilton-how-a-celebrity-nymph-conquered-the-earth\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/20/paris-the-memoir-review-paris-hilton-how-a-celebrity-nymph-conquered-the-earth", "date_published": "2023-03-20 07:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018I could probably tolerate one Abba track\u2019: Kerry Godliman\u2019s honest playlist", "description": "<p>The actor grew up listening to Toni Basil and the Beatles, but what would she play at a party, and who did she see on an early date with her future husband?</p><p><strong>The first songs I remember hearing</strong><br />Bowie, Steely Dan and Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles were the stuff my parents played when I was little.
