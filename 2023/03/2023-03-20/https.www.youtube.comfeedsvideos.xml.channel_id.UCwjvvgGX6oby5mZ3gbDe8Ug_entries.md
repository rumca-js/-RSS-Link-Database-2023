It can be said that the so-called influenza A has broken out on a large scale before the Covid-19 epidemic in China receded. According to data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on March 11th, the number of Influenza A patients nationwide grew by 60 times in 28 days. That is, in the 28 days from February 5 to March 5, the positive rate of influenza virus jumped from 0.7% to 41.6%, a nearly 60-fold increase.
