This ancient Elven city is where the Council of Elrond was held to determine what was to be done about the great evil known as The One Ring, and this incredible Lord of the Rings LEGO Rivendell set captures that moment, and the splendor of the site as a whole, in a level of LEGO detail that's nearly as astonishing as the location upon which it's based.\n\nComposed of 6167 pieces, this build will take you as long as watching both The Lord of The Rings and Hobbit trilogies. And yes, we're talking about the extended cuts. Set #10316 is a beautifully designed Elven town that comes with 15 Minifigures and we haven't been able to take our eyes off it. Play with it at your own risk as this particular set's designed for the collectors.\n\nSet built by: Tim Russell (Instagram/timb0russell)\n\n#IGN #Lego", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vbmiMMac-g", "date_published": "2023-03-20 23:00:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Pulling the PlayStation Plus Collection Hurts New PS5 Owners - Podcast Beyond Clip", "description": "The PS+ Collection is being pulled, and Akeem and the Podcast Beyond crew discuss how this will hurt new PS5 owners.
