Somehow, a monkey got ahold of a puppy in the middle of a market in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elephant-woman-funeral" target="_blank">India</a> and then proceeded to hop from a balcony to a rooftop with the pooch in hand. The <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elderly-dog-falls-manhole-treats" target="_blank">dog</a> was struggling to get out of its grip, which the monkey maintained with ease as it stared down the crowd. It's his dog, now. </p><p>The crowd just laughed as the monkey disappeared with the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dog-salad-meat-lady" target="_blank">dog</a>. The dog's fate is tragically still unknown at this time. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Apparently, this isn't uncommon in Jaipur, where the video was taken. That's because they actually have an entire Monkey Temple just down the road. It's really a massive Hindu temple complex, but, due to its humungous monkey colony, it's been nicknamed "The Monkey Temple." Naturally, this is a huge draw for tourists. But travel websites warn of the monkey's kleptomaniac tendencies and urge people to keep their distance, lest they lose their wallets. Or beloved pets. </p><p>Monkeys kidnapping dogs isn't new to India, either. Monkeys of a nearby city, Maharashtra, have a particularly sadistic streak with dogs. In 2021, two monkeys reportedly killed a combined 250 dogs by dragging them to the tops of buildings and trees and dropping them to their deaths. No, seriously. Monkeys did this. The killings were thought to be retaliation against a dog who killed one of the monkey's babies. The killer monkeys were captured by local authorities and released into a different forest.  </p><p>I know we've all been displeased with the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/new-orleans-carjackings" target="_blank">rising crime</a> and general<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-police-36-hours" target="_blank"> horrible qualities</a> of American cities as of late. But this story really put it all in perspective for me. At least we don't have to deal with sadistic killer monkeys who pluck pets from our window sills and terrorize the local dog population. Always a silver lining. </p>

## 'It's About Fear': Watch Fauci get wrecked by dude who won't even take the schmaccine for money

Because we just haven't heard about him enough over the past three years. The program is part of a larger series called "American Masters" series, aimed at making viewers "discover insightful profiles of important figures in America's artistic and cultural life." Something tells me they won't be covering the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/show-notes-fire-fauci" target="_blank">AIDS portion of Fauci's career</a>. </p><p>A clip from the program shows <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/disney-releases-trailer-fauci" target="_blank">Fauci</a> going door-to-door in Washington D.C. with Mayor Muriel Bowser back in 2021. The pair is trying to convince residents to take the COVID vaccine. It did not end well. </p><p>The first lady shown in the clip simply said, <em>"Well, I heard that it doesn't cure it, and it doesn't stop you from getting it. So..." </em></p><p>Fauci then claimed the vaccine makes you feel less sick when you have the virus. Until you have a climate-change-induced heart attack, of course. But that's completely unrelated. </p><p>The real star of the show is the second dude featured in the clip. He said, <em>"I'm not going to be lining up taking a shot or a vaccination for something that wasn't clear in the first place. And then you all create a shot in miraculous time. It takes years to create a vaccination." </em></p><p><em>"Nine months is definitely not enough for nobody to be taking no vaccination that you all came up with."</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Bowser tried to hit him with the whole "you must get vaccinated for to save Grandma" spiel, but he was not having it. He pointed out the virus is "something like the common flu". And he really hit his stride after he told them he was passing on the vaccine. </p><p><em>"When you start talking about paying people to get vaccinated, when you start talking about incentivizing things to get people vaccinated, there's something else going on with that."</em></p><p><em>"Y'all's campaign is about fear. It's about inciting fear in people. You all attack people with fear. That's what this pandemic is."</em></p><p>I cannot believe PBS allowed this footage to see the light of day. Fauci got obliterated by an unsuspecting civilian who wouldn't take his, shot even if he got paid to do it. Brings a tear to me eye. </p>

## Watch: Farmer uses his chickens to illustrate the globalist utopia of a 15-minute city and it looks miserable

Here is a farmer to explain with chickens.</p><p>Before we start, the idea of a "15-minute city" tends to be fodder for conspiracy theorists. As if there is a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-unelected-government" target="_blank">grand cabal</a> of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/klaus-schwab-education" target="_blank">global elites</a> looking to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mike-rowe-elities-fox-news" target="_blank">control people</a> by limiting them to a fifteen-minute radius. Get those dark thoughts out of your head. As WikiPedia tells us, a 15-minute city is nothing more than an "urban planning concept in which most daily necessities and services, such as work, shopping, education, healthcare, and leisure can be easily reached by a 15-minute walk or bike ride from any point in the city" to "reduce car dependency, promote healthy and sustainable living, and improve the overall quality of life for city dwellers."</p><p>Got it? Now here is the farmer with his chickens.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">15 minute cities explained beautifully. 👀 <a href="https://t.co/RnFPxfVMsA">pic.twitter.com/RnFPxfVMsA</a><br />— vegastar (@vegastarr) <a href="https://twitter.com/vegastarr/status/1637316161883832320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>As you can see, the chickens are so happy they can hardly sit still. They own nothing and the like it. They LOVE it! And some may even already be eating the bugs.</p><p>Could they leave their 15-minute "city?" Sure. Do they want to? No. Do they know enough to know there are other things out there? That's unclear.</p><p>And while the chickens are happy, no one is happier than the farmer. He walks in to collect their means of production for himself. The chickens get the exact amount they need. The farmer gets everything else. You know, since he's part of an elite group of leaders that is in charge.</p><p>It's a total paradise. We the People should be so lucky to live like this.</p>

Today, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/steven-crowder-rumble-58000" target="_blank">Louder with Crowder</a> returned to YouTube and Rumble, with the extended MugClub segment debuting exclusively on Rumble. It was a jam-packed show that definitely cannot fit into a single blog post, so make sure to check out the full episode linked below. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p><p>Crowder got to the biggest news stories of the past few weeks, including <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/donald-trump-arrested-tuesday" target="_blank">Donald Trump's possible pending arrest</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rachel-levine-transition-adult" target="_blank">Rachel Levine's burning desire to trans the kids,</a> and a deep dive into YouTube's brand-new CEO. Spoiler: he may just be even worse than the last one. </p><p>In terms of show news, Crowder announced the brand new talent that will be joining the MugClub umbrella:  Bryan Callen, Nick Di Paolo, MrGunsNGear & Jim Breuer. Crowder hinted there are a few more names in the works, but those are super secret until further notice. So stay tuned. </p><p>And finally, the biggest announcement of the many announcements from today's show. I told you it was jam-packed. Louder with Crowder has launched a Fight Like Hell Pledge for all business owners of pro-First Amendment media companies. This pledge, signed so far by Louder with Crowder and Rumble, states that signees will "fight against and shine a light on Big Tech censorship," "never penalize any content creators [...] should they experience targeted, unjust, or punitive actions from Big Tech," will not  "capitulate to boycott campaigns," and "will protect the right of content creators to express themselves" by "partnering with companies that share values and interests." </p><p>Crowder explained that this is something "every single person on the right can be on board with." Anyone out there who supports free speech and wants to stick it to Big Tech, go over to <a href="http://www.thefightlikehellpledge.com" target="_blank">www.thefightlikehellpledge.com</a> and sign this pledge in solidarity. </p><blockquote><em>"Big Tech platforms have engaged in censorship by banning, suspending, throttling, shadow banning, demonetizing, or otherwise negatively impacting the ability of content creators to reach their subscribers or followers.<br /></em><br /><em>As a business owner/operator of a pro-First Amendment media company (be it video, audio, written word or tech), I pledge to fight against and shine a light on Big Tech censorship.<br /></em><br /><em>Furthermore, I will never penalize any content creators that engage in business with my company should they experience targeted, unjust, or punitive actions from Big Tech, be said actions monetary, or the limitation of the reach of their content.<br /></em><br /><em>I also pledge not to capitulate to boycott campaigns. I will protect the right of content creators to express themselves on my platform through a proactive approach of partnering with companies that share our values and interests."</em><br /></blockquote><p>And make sure to watch today's entire show for all the laughs and giggles over the current state of our country. Which just so happens to be jailing political opponents. For democracy, of course.</p>

I can't speak to that."</p><p>Long story short, the Soros-funded Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, a man known for turning felonies into misdemeanors, is turning a misdemeanor into a felony with the claim Trump paid off a porn star he allegedly had an affair with, over a minute technicality on how the money exchanged hands. So minute, even the Biden Justice Department thought it wasn't worth investigating.</p><p>DeSantis went on to say he didn't know what was going to happen, but that Bragg's actions were an example of pursuing a political agenda and weaponizing his office. "He has downgraded over 50% of the felonies to misdemeanors, he says he doesn’t even want to have jail time for the vast majority of crimes. [...] If you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction and he chooses to go back many, many years ago to try to use something about porn star hush money payments, that’s an example of pursuing a political agenda and weaponizing the office."</p><p>The Florida governor concluded by saying he has"no interest in getting involved in some type of manufactured circus by some Soros DA." Alvin Bragg is trying to virtue signal; to his base by creating a media circus. DeSantis has real issues to focus on in  Florida.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Elderly dog looking for treats miraculously survives a 23-foot fall into a manhole

And what better than another dog <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-lifeguard-rescues-dog" target="_blank">rescue story</a>? This definitely brightened my day, so I'd like to share it with you all. You're welcome. </p><p>Tess, a 14-year-old Labrador Retriever in Portland, was on the hunt for snacks last Friday when she fell down a 23-foot utility hole. The manhole was exposed because city workers were inspecting a storm drain. Tess apparently thought they were there to give her a treat, as most dogs naturally believe of any human being they encounter. </p><p>The fire department arrived and sent a firefighter down the hole to rescue Tess since she was miraculously still alive. She was completely uninjured, as a pile of leaves and various debris had cushioned her fall. They pulled her up with a pulley system and she emerged, totally fine. You can see in the video below how she's pulled up and immediately goes to her owners, tail wagging and all. What a chill gal. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The Portland Fire Department detailed the rescue on Facebook, along with pictures of Tess chillin' in the manhole: <em>"Your Portland Firefighters rescued a 14-year-old lab named Tess this morning at SE 9th and Lambert. Environmental services had removed a manhole cover to inspect storm drains, and the unsuspecting pup fell 23’ to the bottom. The technical rescue team was dispatched, creating a high point to lower rescuers down to the dog. Tess was safely extricated with no injuries."</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Gavin Newsom is spending tens of millions of tax dollars on 1200 tiny homes, claims it'll cure homelessness

Because it was "trendy." It was like the newest hippie thing to do. </p><p>Well, apparently, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gavin-newsom-clean-sober" target="_blank">Gavin Newsom</a> saw that show too. And thought it would be perfect for the ever-growing homeless population of his state. He's enlisting the National Guard to "deploy" 1200 tiny homes to homeless people. For 30 million dollars. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>I had no idea the National Guard just has an arsenal of tiny home building materials to be deployed at their discretion. Though this will only house about 1% of the homeless population in California. For 30. Million. Dollars. </p><p>The tiny homes will be deployed to Sacramento, San Jose, San Diego, and Los Angeles. Sacramento will get 350 tiny homes, San Jose will get 200, San Diego, 150; and Los Angeles will get a whopping 500. The executive director for the Sacramento Regional Coalition to End Homelessness, Bob Erlenbusch, acknowleged how little this will actually do to combat homelessness in his city:<em> “I wish that elected officials, not only the governor but up and down the state, would have a broader perspective in terms of trying to approach our homeless crisis and affordable housing crisis with a sense of scale rather than a 10% solution." </em></p><p>So this is clearly not a great solution. If it can even be called a solution. But this brings me to one of my less popular opinions: a country as wealthy as America shouldn't have homeless people. At the very least, not at the current level. Homelessness is a sign of a systemic failure of society and individualism run amuck. We <em>should</em> live in communities where we care about our neighbors - but most people don't have communities anymore. Plus, the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-homeless-encampment" target="_blank">cities</a> with the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/711-austin-opera-music" target="_blank">worst</a> homelessness problems also tend to have the most lax drug and crime policies, which contribute to and perpetuate the homelessness problem. So you see where I'm going with this. Sorry, Libertarians. </p><p><p>

## Drinking coffee is the new thing that makes you raaaaacist and even Elon Musk is all like WTF

My assumption was it would be told drinking my coffee black was problematic. Turns out, it's drinking coffee at all. This is what a new article that's gone viral is telling us. </p><p>Last week it was finding out <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pantry-college-professor" target="_blank">your pantry makes you raaaaaaacist</a>, though that was written by an academic.

<p>This part is particularly fun:</p><p>"It’s a well-known fact that whites would be eating bland food, like plain bread and gruel, if it weren’t for their theft of culinary secrets from people of color, and especially Black folks.

<p>None of us whites are more surprised that Twitter CEO Elon Musk. The South African entrepreneur thought he was safe drinking coffee. Nope!</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Even my coffee!?<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1637425587294818306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>In fairness, the clues were there all along.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">That N in Nespresso don’t stand for “New”.<br />— Lavern Spicer 🇺🇸 (@lavern_spicer) <a href="https://twitter.com/lavern_spicer/status/1637429489591279623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>None of us here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website are mad. Our eyes are too busy rolling to register an emotion. If anything, we're jealous. Being a woke blog sounds like the easiest thing ever. You only need a noun and a verb and to call something RAAAAAAAACIST.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The inherent racism of drinking coffee was there all along.

I'm sure someone has hit exercise already.  Having three meals a day is a possibility. But if I were to guess? The inherent white supremacy of converting carbon dioxide to oxygen.

What luck! One of them was Chris Rock, and like everyone outside of Alvin Bragg, Rock thinks arresting Trump would be a mistake.</p><p>Adam Sandler was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, won in the past by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-cosby-eddie-muprhy-prison" target="_blank">Eddie Murphy</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-accepts-mark-twain-prize-defends-2nd-amendment-video" target="_blank">Dave Chappelle</a>. Being <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adam-sandler-chris-rock-oscars" target="_blank">one of his closest friends</a>, Chris Rock was one of the performers saluting <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adam-sandler-gotham-awards" target="_blank">The Sandman</a>. The event took place at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC in front of the DC elite. Rock asked them <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/3908205-adam-sandler-honored-with-mark-twain-prize-for-american-humor/" target="_blank">what many of us have been asking all weekend</a>.</p><p>“Are you guys really going to arrest Trump?”</p><p>Long story short, the Soros-funded Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, a man known for turning felonies into misdemeanors, is turning a misdemeanor into a felony with the claim Trump paid off a porn star he allegedly had an affair with, over a minute technicality on how the money exchanged hands. So minute, even the Biden Justice Department thought it wasn't worth investigating.</p><p>Probably for the same reason Rock points to as why arresting Trump is a mistake.</p><p>“You know this is only going to make him more popular. It’s like arresting Tupac. It’s just going to sell more records!”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The story has changed somewhat. Trump was never formally told he was going to be arrested on Tuesday as much as he read something on the internet. And there was a lot of conservative pushback on his calls for protests since the last time he asked his supporters to protest...</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">FYI: The last time Trump’s biggest fans protested on his behalf, he left them all to rot in jail without so much as a penny from him in legal fees. Not a penny. <br /><br />Shame on him for this. Do NOT go to a blue area and protest for this man. Ignore this. <a href="https://t.co/dnwnC6Uvyd">pic.twitter.com/dnwnC6Uvyd</a><br />— Jesse Kelly (@JesseKellyDC) <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseKellyDC/status/1637143644145610758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>In my opinion, I don't think Trump will ever be arrested. This is nothing more than a lot of "pay attention to me" saber-rattling by a corrupt district attorney.</p><p>Though I have to admit, I am REALLY looking forward to these new rules towards criminal investigations into your political opponents during the next Republican Administration. The new norms created by the left are going to be a blast when we are in charge again.</p><p><p>

Girls were girls and men were men. People weren't compelled to tell you which they thought they were. An eyeball test was enough. But that was the bygone era of 2019. Now, one is expected to volunteer their pronouns if one wants to stay in the good graces of the internet. Even though, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pronouns-poll-harvard-harris" target="_blank">a majority of people think it's all silly</a>. It would appear the feline community hasn't gotten the memo, either.</p><p>No, not people who identify as cats using mew/meow pronouns.
