Wie geht’s</em>?” “<em>Sehr gut, und dir</em>?” At which point, Georgia Stanway and I have pretty much exhausted our meagre supply of German. It’s not entirely our fault: as any Brit living in Germany will tell you, it is virtually impossible to learn the local language when everyone is intent on chattering away at you in English. Since moving to Bayern Munich last summer Stanway has been taking weekly lessons, but admits she’s “still waiting for that click”. The coach, Alexander Straus, conducts his team meetings in English. The training ground instructions are in English. The WhatsApp group is in English. Mercifully, so is the rest of this interview.</p><p>Still, for a Barrow girl there are times when Munich feels a long way from home. Beans on toast is one example: you can buy baked beans in Germany, but somehow they don’t taste the same to her. The 24-year-old misses her family and friends, even though they do their best to visit. She broke up with her boyfriend because of the difficulties of maintaining a long-distance relationship, even if they’ve stayed on friendly terms. But as she puts it: “I’m quite an independent person. I like my own space.” Besides, she has important work to do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/20/bayern-munich-georgia-stanway-england">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tackling the climate emergency needs public funding, but without socialising the risk and allowing banks to privatise the profit</p><p>The world is only a few tenths of a degree away from the globally accepted goal of limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. On current trends, we will shoot past the target within a decade. That’s the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/20/ipcc-climate-crisis-report-delivers-final-warning-on-15c" title="">warning</a> from the world’s leading scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In their last report while it is still feasible to stay within 1.5C, they warn that what governments do in the next few years to limit greenhouse gas emissions will determine whether temperatures keep rising dangerously or fall back to safe levels.</p><p>Billions of poor people who bear the least responsibility for the climate emergency are already being hit hard. Extreme weather events such as the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11863199/At-14-killed-Turkey-shocking-videos-victims-swept-away-floods.html" title="">flash floods</a> in Turkey or <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/15/africa/malawi-death-toll-cyclone-freddy-intl/index.html" title="">Cyclone Freddy</a> over southern Africa, which took hundreds of lives, are becoming more common occurrences. It is unequivocal, say the scientists, that human activity has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. It is also human activity that can bring temperatures down. Cutting carbon pollution and fossil fuel use by nearly two-thirds by 2035 would give humanity a decent<strong> </strong>shot at the target. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, spelled out what this <a href="https://apnews.com/article/un-climate-change-report-ipcc-guterres-science-30d8451c0f3fb7b8a857e3ed4fd01172" title="">means</a>: an end to new fossil fuel exploration and rich countries exiting coal, oil and gas by 2040. The UK, which is opening coalmines and approving North Sea oil and gas licences, should take note.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-ipcc-warning-a-last-chance-to-save-the-planet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scrapping the work capability assessment is welcome, but the government’s proposed alternative won’t rebuild trust</p><p>One month before Jodey Whiting took her own life, she received a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) saying her employment and support allowance was being stopped. Ms Whiting, who was disabled, had been told that she had to attend a work capability assessment.

<p>England full-back’s challenge on Hugo Keenan, subject to a hearing on Tuesday, could have repercussions at all levels</p><p>Freddie Steward was sent off for a dangerous tackle just before half-time after colliding with Hugo Keenan. The Ireland full-back had just stooped to gather the loose ball which had been knocked forward by Mack Hansen. Steward’s arm was tucked by his side but as he twisted his body – with both feet briefly leaving the floor – to brace for contact, he struck his opponent’s head with his elbow. Keenan was taken off the pitch and, after failing his head injury assessment, did not return.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/20/freddie-steward-red-card-why-was-it-shown-what-happens-now-rugby-union-six-nations">Continue reading...</a>

But the discussion and debate in the weeks and days leading up to the Iraq war was the most intense and emotional that I have witnessed in the Commons. It was literally about matters of life and death. It was obvious from the beginning that Tony Blair was determined to go to war, shoulder to shoulder with George W Bush. The prime minister’s relationship with the US seemed to matter more more to him than opinion in his own party, and it also seemed to matter more than whether the war was even legal or not.</p><p>The public rationale was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was harbouring those responsible for 9/11: al-Qaida and its leader, Osama bin Laden. In order to shore up support, Alastair Campbell, Blair’s spin doctor, was involved with the production of a dossier on Iraq’s weapons programme. Reading it at the time, I realised there was very little substance to it.</p><p>Diane Abbott has been the Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington since 1987</p><p><em>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>When it comes to atoning for the slave trade, we need to acknowledge how much we have benefited, says <strong>Prof Sir Roderick Floud</strong>.<strong> </strong>Plus letters from<strong> Nic Madge, Morris Gyles, Rex Knight </strong>and <strong>Kit Jackson</strong></p><p>“My ancestors gained nothing from slavery,” writes John Cookson (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/15/the-fair-way-to-pay-slavery-reparations" title="">Letters, 15 March</a>). Sadly, he is wrong. Everyone in Britain and the rest of the developed world has benefited from at least 200 years of cheap tobacco, coffee, chocolate and, above all, tea and sugar, produced by slaves or indentured labourers (or, today, low-paid workers) in conditions even worse than those his forebears experienced in Manchester and Salford in the 1840s. In addition, they were probably paid to make clothes out of raw cotton grown by slaves in the southern United States.</p><p>The direct responsibility for slavery certainly lies with the slavers and plantation owners, including the British royal family and most of the aristocracy and merchant classes who invested in the hateful trade. But the moral responsibility has to be borne much more widely and should be in our minds whenever we buy “cheap” goods today.<br /><strong>Prof Sir Roderick Floud</strong><br /><em>Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/20/like-it-or-not-we-all-bear-some-responsibility-for-slavery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Decision over bonds rips up convention and could undermine confidence in banking system</p><p>Here, first, is what the Swiss financial authorities got right. They recognised that outsiders’ confidence in Credit Suisse was shot. They saw that the flight of depositors, which was reported to have reached €10bn (£8.7bn) a day last week, would get worse. They knew that only a full takeover, as opposed to complicated financial surgery, could withstand another onslaught by markets.</p><p>That being so, the buyer had to be UBS, a credible institution whose management could be told to think of its patriotic duty and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/19/credit-suisse-bank-of-england-wont-object-to-takeover-as-ubs-considers-1bn-bid">do the deal over a weekend</a>. And the terms, at face value, look generous to UBS, so the risk of creating a bigger banking whirlpool is lessened. The danger is not eliminated but plenty of grown-up banking voices judged that the acquirer is getting a bargain (a better one, for example, than the non-bargain that was Lloyds TSB’s rescue of Halifax Bank of Scotland in 2008).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/mar/20/credit-suisse-bondholders-bonds-banking-system">Continue reading...</a>

As <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-65012702">the BBC reports</a>, Fox and Strange’s lawyers filed in Los Angeles federal court on Friday, requesting the case be dismissed and stating that the two musicians had reached a settlement with Tesfaye and his team, and were “still in the process of formalising, executing, and consummating” the deal.</p><p>At the time of the lawsuit’s initial filing, Fox and Strange – who perform together as Epikker – claimed that the “lead guitar and vocal hooks” of Call Out My Name bore similarity to their song Vibeking. Although Tesfaye denied the claims, the duo also claimed they had evidence that the singer had previously been aware of the track. The BBC reported that Fox and Strange had sent Vibeking to Eric White, one of Tesfaye’s collaborators, in 2015; later, White had allegedly replied saying that Tesfaye thought the song was “fire”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/20/the-weeknd-reaches-settlement-over-call-out-my-name-copyright-case">Continue reading...</a>

The pair had made appearances in some of Fowler’s early novels – Rune (1990), Darkest Day (1993) and Soho Black (1998) – before breaking out into their own long-running series, starting with Full Dark House in 2003.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/20/christopher-fowler-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Victory over Madrid in the <em>clásico</em> leaves Barça 12 points clear. It will have been a different kind of success this season</p><p>Franck Kessié hasn’t always been in the right place at the right time but on Sunday night at 10.53pm he was <em>exactly</em> where he needed to be, and when. One morning, soon after arriving at Milan, the Ivorian pulled into Milanello and parked in the space reserved for the big boss. Stopped by security, told he couldn’t go there because that was the president’s spot, he replied: “I <em>am</em> the president.” It fit somehow and the title stuck. That day he became The President; now, five years on, he became President, King, Emperor, anything he likes. Above all, he became La Liga champion, they all did. Which is why he, the son of a soldier, was standing to salute, and Camp Nou was going wild around him.</p><p>Sometimes the difference is a fine line, and sometimes that’s literal. The clock showed 80.15 in the 258th <em>clásico</em>, the one that would decide the destiny of the league, and the tension had been growing for a while, everything and everyone on edge, when Marco Asensio scored to make it 2-1 to Real Madrid. As he set off pointing to the badge on his shirt, over on the touchline Carlo Ancelotti clenched his fists and, to his left, Xavi Hernández couldn’t help but think how unfair it was. It was Asensio’s first touch, the kind of moment you knew was coming even when it wasn’t coming, and it reopened the title race.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/20/la-liga-clasico-barcelona-real-madrid-franck-kessie">Continue reading...</a>

What drives them to leave their friends and families – and what awaits them if they do come back?</p><p>Sitting at her dining room table in Hampshire, 60-year-old Karen Bone tells the story of her son’s disappearance. It was early March 2018 when Matt Bone, 26, left the family home after telling his parents he was going for a walk. “He came downstairs, took his front door key and walked out. We thought he’d gone to clear his head. Later that day we were due at my mum’s for her birthday celebration. He never came back.”</p><p>Matt had been an academically gifted child. He had sailed through school, before completing a degree in environmental sciences at the University of East Anglia, where he swiftly moved on to his doctorate. His research was going well, taking him around Britain and beyond, even as far as Antarctica. “He seemed on top of things to begin with,” his mother explains.

## George Eustice’s drivel about stay-at-home mums reinforces the trap set by society for women | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett

<p>If the Tory MP really valued the role of women in early-years childcare, he’d offer them financial support. But he hasn’t</p><p>Since becoming a mother, I’ve found myself thinking a lot about stay-at-home mums.<br /><br />What a job. It is hard graft – round-the-clock physical, mental and emotional labour. Stay-at-home parenting is mostly undertaken by women, but does that mean that it’s our “natural nurturing role”, as the Tory MP George Eustice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/19/stay-at-home-motherhood-being-undermined-says-senior-tory-mp">said recently</a>? He argues that the government is prioritising childcare policy at the expense of incentivising women to stay at home. “Fathers, of course, have a very strong paternal desire to spend time with their children, but you can’t get away from the way we are biologically wired – and the maternal instinct is a strong one,” he said. “It is generally the case that mothers in particular will want, if they can, to spend that time with their young children.”<br /><br />Many of us would disagree with the idea that women are biologically programmed to perform all of the work of stay-at-home parenting, or that men don’t want to be central to their children’s lives. It feels terribly convenient, doesn’t it? <br /><br />Yet our ideas of fatherhood are shifting. Both the Fatherhood Institute and Dr Anna Machin, one of the UK’s leading evolutionary anthropologists and author of The Life of Dad, have deplored the comments for the outdated, ignorant and insulting drivel they are. Machin in particular pointed out how unsupported men are when they want to be present parents in their children’s lives.<br /><br />Not all dads. Some use “<a href="https://www.care.com/c/what-is-weaponized-incompetence/">weaponised incompetence</a>” when it comes to childcare. Often both halves of a heterosexual couple will engage in the delusion that the father is useless, so the mother has to do everything. The woman, therefore, becomes “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/24/mum-watched-me-correct-my-husband-then-sagely-warned-me-dont-become-the-expert-in-the-baby">the expert in the baby</a>”. And so she never lets him learn, or he never bothers, and he never becomes the dad he could be.<br /><br />Why do I mention this? Because, in this way, society has been performing a sort of weaponised incompetence when it comes to childcare policy for decades now: “it’s easier if you do it.” Society hasn’t been supporting women to stay at home, but it has been expecting it.<br /><br />It isn’t easier. Women often feel they have no choice. Hence the need for affordable childcare. Of course, if a woman chooses to be a stay-at-home mother, then that choice should be supported. Some women can’t wait to get back to the office, but some are heartbroken to be putting their babies in full-time nursery and would rather stay home, but can’t.</p><p>Stay-at-home mums are often left out of these discussions because their existence is inconvenient to both sides. Women who actively want to be stay-at-home mums are uncomfortable for some feminists to contemplate because they have traditionally been so lionised.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/20/george-eustice-stay-at-home-mums-society-women-tory-mp-childcare">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Analysis shows record occurred after La Niña period, when temperatures across central and eastern Pacific tend to be cooler </p><p>Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) reached a record high on 16 March this year, surpassing the previous record set in March 2016, according to an analysis by the US’s <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>. This is particularly surprising as it occurred after three years of La Niña, where SST anomalies across the central and eastern Pacific tend to be cooler than normal. The previous record set in 2016 was recorded after an El Niño: this would be more normal as SSTs across the central Pacific are warmer than average and therefore have time to build warmth at the ocean surface. It means a particularly intense El Niño year or a long period of Pacific Ocean warming is no longer necessary to achieve record high global SSTs.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Australia a heatwave has been building throughout the past week, bringing scorching conditions across much of the country with many weather stations breaking their March maximum temperature records as well as their highest minimum temperature records. By Sunday, many areas of New South Wales in particular recorded temperatures in the high 30s and low 40s celsius. For example, Beaudesert Drumley Street, a station near Brisbane, registered a record high temperature for March of 38.4C on 17 March and Wilcannia reached a scorching 43.8C on 19 March. This hot spell is also not likely to break down completely until later next week with temperatures continuing into the high 30s celsius. With the addition of an El Niño on the horizon later this year, Australia could see the return of drought conditions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/20/weather-tracker-sea-surface-temperatures-hit-record-high">Continue reading...</a>

As the fish die, a woman gasps to the surface of the water. This is Magdalena (Mía Maestro), who drowned herself decades ago. Now she is back from the dead as if time stopped – still gorgeous, still dressed in the boilersuit she wore when she drove her motorbike deliberately into the river. Magdalena’s husband collapses when he spots her outside a mobile phone shop. Their adult daughter Cecilia (Leonor Varela) – just a girl when her mum died – drives from the city with her two kids to look after him at the family’s dairy farm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/20/the-cow-who-sang-a-song-into-the-future-review-francisca-alegria">Continue reading...</a>

## The big idea: why we should study the history that never happened

<p>Dismissed by some as mere speculation, examining ‘what ifs’ can shed valuable light on neglected perspectives</p><p>Thinking about alternative scenarios is tempting, both in our everyday lives and when we are trying to make sense of the past. Questions about what happened slide very easily into conjectures: what if it didn’t happen, or happened differently? Historians tend not to take kindly to such speculation. Fiction is fuelled by it.</p><p>In November 1616, the first English ambassador to India, Sir Thomas Roe, wrote a letter to his paymasters in the East India Company. Roe’s letter is full of frustration at being treated as the representative of a minor “Frankish” power by the opulent Mughal court, but its main focus is on the company’s own errors. He warns them repeatedly that “warr and trafique [trade] are incompatible”, and it was better to seek profit in “quiett trade”. Roe was no idealist when it came to English global ambitions. His advice was grounded in the best use of the company’s resources rather than any view of the ethical justification of empire, but it is significant all the same. As history tells us, quiet trade did not remain the aim of the English in India. What would have happened if Roe’s advice had been followed? As I worked on a history of the first English embassy to India, this was a question that raised its head repeatedly, both in my own thinking and in conversations with others. While the simple answer is that there is no telling, ignoring the question means imposing a sense of inevitability on the presence of the British in India, erasing the uncertainties that defined it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/20/the-big-idea-why-we-should-study-the-history-that-never-happened">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Southend’s struggles with political decision-making and underfunding tell us a lot about modern England</p><p>It is a little more than a year since Southend-on-Sea <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/01/i-will-tell-my-grandchildren-southend-celebrates-city-status">became a city</a>, sealed with a visit from the Prince of Wales. A lot has happened since – the prince is now a king – but locally it is hard to tell if much in my Essex coastal home town has actually changed. “We became a city out of a tragedy,” says Liberal Democrat councillor Carole Mulroney, referring to the fact that Southend achieved city status after the murder of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/david-amess-last-act-two-year-plot-ali-harbi-ali">David Amess</a>. The Conservative MP for Southend West was killed on Friday 15 October 2021; by Monday, Boris Johnson announced that the Queen had agreed to honour one of Amess’s long-term campaigns, to make Southend a city.</p><p>Sitting in the council chamber on that cold March day when the future monarch provided a ceremonial rubber stamp, I struggled to work out what this would all amount to. It initially sparked a great burst of energy, but reality kept getting in the way. A community organisation trying to revive a former amusement park and music hall, the Kursaal, stepped up its campaign, only to discover the building is owned by the UK arm of an American investment firm with a 200-year lease and <a href="https://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/local_news/19216898.aew-200-years-left-kursaal-lease-dont-want-sell/">no break clause</a>, meaning no one but the pigeons gets to go in. Last summer a planned music festival to celebrate the new city, which promised acts including Damon Albarn and Africa Express, was postponed due to “<a href="https://www.essexlive.news/whats-on/whats-on-news/southend-city-festival-postponed-until-7471712">logistical challenges</a>”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/20/home-town-city-toxic-culture-war-southend-underfunding-england">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Alfonso Quijada’s feature follows a young woman gifted with an extraordinary sense of smell. It looks great, but fails to satisfy</p><p>This drama from El Salvador has several commendable features, starting with a tender, sympathetic central performance from Laura Osma as Josefina, a sweet young woman who discovers she has an exceptional sense of smell. However, something doesn’t quite smell right about the way the film clumsily layers uplift and violence, served up with excessively stylised visuals and sound. It’s as if writer-director Alfonso Quijada, better known hitherto as an actor and producer, doesn’t know if he wants to make a telenovela-style melodrama or something more elevated and arty – in the tradition of Claudia Llosa’s The Milk of Sorrow or Lila Avilés’s films The Chambermaid and Tótem – with long takes and oblique storytelling strategies. In the end, it fails to satisfy either ambition.</p><p>Josefina and her younger brother Alfredo (William Castillo) lost their mother not long ago and seem to have no father in the picture; they live with their godmother in a rural part of El Salvador. Josefina picks coffee on an estate owned by Don Villagran (Boris Barraza) while Alfredo is supposed to be going to school. However, he has taken to bunking off with some bad boys, as Josefina’s friend Dalia (Emy Mena) describes them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/20/the-whisper-of-silence-review-coffee-taster-drama-makes-most-of-stunning-locations">Continue reading...</a>

## US maternal mortality is more than ten times higher than in Australia. Why? | Moira Donegan

<p>What do we make of a nation that has made giving birth so dangerous – yet forces more and more women to do it?</p><p>America is in a maternal health crisis. According to new <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm">CDC data</a> released this week, the rate of maternal mortality – defined as deaths during pregnancy or within 42 days of giving birth – rose <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/16/1163786037/maternal-deaths-in-the-u-s-spiked-in-2021-cdc-reports">by 40%</a> in 2021. At a rate of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/16/health/maternal-deaths-increasing-nchs/index.html">33 deaths for every 100,000 live births</a>, 1,205 women died of maternal causes that year. That rate was more than twice as high for Black women, whose maternal mortality rate was 70 deaths for every 100,000 live births. The latest federal compilation of data from reviews of maternal deaths suggests that 84% were <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/10/21/1129115162/maternal-mortality-childbirth-deaths-prevention">preventable</a>.</p><p>Experts believe that 2021’s spike in maternal mortality can be attributed at least partly to the Covid-19 pandemic, though it’s not clear exactly how. Perhaps infection and exposure to the virus made pregnant women more vulnerable; perhaps the pandemic caused some women to delay or forgo prenatal care as hospitals strained to treat the surge of virus patients and shutdowns made all kinds of care harder and riskier to get.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/20/us-maternal-mortality-rate-climbing-health-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For many of us, it has been a cold and traumatic year. But, as one reader found, difficult times can lead to new and revolutionary ways of thinking</p><p>Walking into the NHS clinic where I work as a psychotherapist, I saw that the daffodils by the path had finally flowered. My heart lifted: new life; spring springing; winter ending. But the change in the seasons may bring little relief to those whom this longest and bleakest of winters has tipped into “survival mode”. These are people who have found themselves choosing between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/the-heat-or-eat-diaries">heating and eating</a>, or who are stuck on a waiting list for vital healthcare, or who have caring responsibilities that leave them drained of energy for themselves. Others feel despairing and hopeless, reading endless catastrophic headlines about the climate emergency, the war in Ukraine, the cost of living crisis. All this is what you, our readers, wrote about when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/16/tell-us-are-you-going-through-life-in-the-uk-in-survival-mode">we invited you to tell us</a> what living in survival mode means to you.</p><p>When I asked reader Nicky Marchbank, 40, from Kent, what images this phrase brought to mind, I found her answer striking. She studied history at university, and what she associates with survival mode, she told me over Zoom, is “winter before the Industrial Revolution, because that is literally getting from one day to the next and not dying, isn’t it? These days, emotionally, we’ve managed to get there without the harsh winters, somehow.” Perhaps what many of us are experiencing at the moment is a kind of internal harsh winter: a frost that creeps into the mind and the body, freezing green shoots and hope, stunting growth. Not death, but not quite life either. Survival.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/20/a-winter-of-the-mind-how-to-escape-survival-mode">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Antonio Conte comes out swinging, Rob Holding steps up for Arsenal and Brighton’s talent conveyor belt keeps rolling</p><p>Will Antonio Conte be in charge of Tottenham for their next fixture, on 3 April at Everton? Those in the St Mary’s press room on Saturday evening were in little doubt that his instant-classic rant – two questions batted away during 10 minutes of fury – was a kiss-off, an ejector seat activated. Conte levelled blame at everyone but himself and even threw an olive branch to his predecessors, a list including arch-rival José Mourinho. “They can change the manager, a lot of managers, but the situation cannot change,” Conte declared in a critique of the club’s culture, and by extension, the owners Enic and the chairman, Daniel Levy. It was the players who received the most bilious invective, creating a potentially awkward situation post-international break, should Conte still be around. “They don’t want to play under pressure, they don’t want to play under stress,” he hissed. Listening back to the tape, it was amusing to hear Conte entering the room with a demure apology for being late. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p><p><em>Premier League report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/18/southampton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Southampton 3-3 Tottenham</a></em></p><p><em>FA Cup report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/19/manchester-united-fulham-fa-cup-quarter-final-match-report">Manchester United 3-1 Fulham</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/20/fa-cup-and-premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

This made me think about the presentation of women in European painting, and the volume of work in our galleries that we accept as beautiful nudes, but are in fact glorified depictions of violence against women.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/20/lecherous-abusers-why-artemisia-gentileschis-susanna-reminded-me-of-paula-yates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With its dizzying spirituality and devotion to ‘sacred’ skincare, Paris Hilton’s memoir exposes a culture in which the self only exists if validated by a selfie</p><p>Twenty years ago, Paris Hilton was the stiletto-heeled embodiment of the zeitgeist. With a chihuahua called Diamond Baby kennelled in her designer handbag, this nepotistic partygoer juggled five mobile phones while cantering across continents to sell branded merchandise to the fans she smarmily addresses as “my Little Hiltons”. Now, in her early 40s, she has published a memoir, which for ephemeral, unreflective celebrities like her is usually a way of fending off imminent obsolescence.</p><p>The book – ventriloquised by Joni Rodgers, who describes herself as a “story whisperer” – is as vapid and vaporous as the fragrances Hilton sells; all the same, archaeologists may one day consult it in the hope of understanding how and why our species underwent a final mutation into something glossily post-human. The antics of this entitled flibbertigibbet expose the absurdity of a culture in which the self only exists if it is validated by a selfie, membership of society depends on the mirage of social media and the reality in which we were all once anchored has been replaced by a flimsy virtual replica.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/20/paris-the-memoir-review-paris-hilton-how-a-celebrity-nymph-conquered-the-earth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This documentary about a small Japanese island, a once thriving mining outpost that now has only 100 residents, lightens its existential concerns with a focus on human connection</p><p>In his second full-length documentary, Swiss director Andrea Pellerani gives us a guided tour of what a post-industrial, post-growth, or even an eerily post-human future might look like. We are on the south-western Japanese island of Ikeshima. Once a thriving mining outpost that was home to 8,000 people, since the facility’s closure in 2001 it has been reduced to just 100 mostly elderly holdouts. As the residents fish the grey sea off abandoned wharves, inspect pregnant cats and loiter around derelict lots, there is a sense they inhabit the set of a long-shuttered stage play, and are awaiting new lines.</p><p>Though it begins with long tracking shots of greenery choking empty apartment blocks, Dreaming an Island isn’t exactly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/14/ruin-porn-cinemas-obsession-with-disused-buildings-grey-gardens-la-soledad">ruin porn</a>. Pellerani is more interested in the vestiges of human activity, and milks a distinct absurdity from the stalwart locals. One collects “fun” beach flotsam, there are guides waiting rather optimistically for an upswing in coal-mining tourism, while Ikeshima’s sole restaurateur hopes for a customer. “Is there anything interesting to see?” asks one who finally turns up. “In what sense interesting?” she replies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/20/dreaming-an-island-review-documentary-japan">Continue reading...</a>

I have also been diagnosed with a degenerative eye condition, which means my trips to galleries will be truncated. Would releasing some cash via equity release be a good idea? I own my own flat, which is worth about £230,000.<br /><strong>RN</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> I can’t say if equity release is right for you but I can say that it is an option. Because you are over 55 and your flat is worth more than £70,000, you are able to release cash from your home with an equity release mortgage. How much cash you can release depends on your age and the value of your home. According to Andy Vickery, a qualified equity release and mortgage adviser at Money Release who specialises in over-55s finance, at 55, for example, you can take 21.5% of the value of your property; at 70, 37.1%, going up to 50% if you are over 80.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/mar/20/i-have-little-spare-cash-so-should-i-consider-equity-release-my-flat-is-worth-230000">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Ukraine is a false justification’: America’s destructive new rush for natural gas

<p>As the war in Ukraine sent natural gas prices skyrocketing, liquid natural gas (LNG) plants are springing up all along the fragile Gulf Coast – seriously harming not just local communities but the world’s ability to keep the entire climate crisis at bay</p><p>About 30 miles south of New Orleans, a construction site visible from space is rising. Sandwiched between the Mississippi River and disappearing wetlands, the 256-hectare (632-acre) site is visited by a stream of tipper trucks and concrete mixers that stir up dust on Louisiana 23, the state highway that goes down to Venice, the last spot of land before the river’s water flows into the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>The wetlands protect the area from hurricane surge and provide critical habitat for fisheries. But when completed in 2025, the construction site here will host a series of tanks and pipes designed for one purpose: to supercool natural gas into liquid form, so it can be transported on giant tankers to sell around the world to the highest bidder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/20/ukraine-is-a-false-justification-americas-destructive-new-rush-for-natural-gas">Continue reading...</a>

He is reinstalled, the BBC is cowed, and the Conservatives are nursing a bloody nose having lost this round in the culture war. But all it illustrated was the strength of the chokehold the right has on our ability to speak against its agenda without vilification. When significant resources are directed towards scapegoating and punishing those whose rights have been taken away by a government, the result is a country where everyone’s rights are by extension removed. Disagreement is turned at once into dissidence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/20/gary-lineker-culture-war-government-cruelty-migrants-rights">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘A billion listens? Is that a lot?’ John Cooper Clarke on penning possibly the world’s favourite poem

<p>I Wanna Be Yours, a love poem that rhymes Ford Cortina with vacuum cleaner, has been a school text and a wedding staple. But now, thanks to TikTok and Arctic Monkeys, it has gone spectacularly global. So who was it written for?</p><p>Forget TS Eliot’s The Waste Land, Philip Larkin’s High Windows and Sylvia Plath’s Lady Lazarus. While those works may have more cultural heft, for sheer popularity no 20th-century British poem can touch John Cooper Clarke’s I Wanna Be Yours. In this love poem, to prove his devotion, an abject Clarke offers to metamorphose into everyday items: “I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust / I wanna be your Ford Cortina, I will never rust.” The work became an irreverent favourite at weddings soon after being written in 1982, and its addition to the GCSE English syllabus in the 1990s brought it to a younger generation. One of those studying it was Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys, who later said: “It made my ears prick up in the classroom, because it was nothing like anything I’d heard.” Turner eventually adapted it into the ballad that closes out the band’s most successful album, 2013’s AM.</p><p>Thanks in part to another new audience, teens finding it on TikTok, the band’s version of I Wanna Be Yours is now wildly, improbably popular: it will clock up its billionth stream on Spotify this week, having spent months on the platform’s Top 50 songs chart, not in the UK but globally. This slow ballad, with Clarke’s poetry referencing setting lotion and electricity meters, sticks out a mile next to K-pop and Puerto Rican reggaeton. Spotify says the song is most popular in the US, Indonesia, Mexico and Brazil; the band’s label Domino says the song’s popularity is particularly growing in India, the Philippines and Turkey. If it was previously Britain’s favourite wedding poem, it’s now quantifiably the world’s favourite British poem, full stop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/20/john-cooper-clarke-arctic-monkeys-worlds-favourite-poem-i-wanna-be-yours-ford-cortina">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Polydor)</strong><br />The songwriter’s third album is heavy and disarmingly truthful, yet widens its close lens thanks to her wide-ranging, alluring aesthetic looseness</p><p>You could describe <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/lana-del-rey">Lana Del Rey</a>’s career thus far as a Benjamin Button-type situation: the more hushed, insular, formally experimental and self-referential her music gets, the more popular she seems to become. Last year, she collaborated with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> as the only featured artist on her 10th album, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/21/taylor-swift-midnights-review-small-hours-pop-rich-with-self-loathing-and-stereotype-smashing">Midnights</a>; every other week, a new song from 2014’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/12/lana-del-rey-ultraviolence-review">Ultraviolence</a> or 2019’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/20/best-albums-2019-no-1-lana-del-rey-norman-fucking-rockwell">Norman Fucking Rockwell!</a> (NFR!) goes viral. Pop’s new generation seems to look to her as a guiding light, perhaps more than any other star; her impact on culture is outsized, evidenced by a recent <a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/lana-del-rey-and-billie-eilish-fall-in-love">artist-on-artist interview</a> in which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-eilish">Billie Eilish</a> gushes about Del Rey, revealing that a photo of her was the background on her first ever phone.</p><p>Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, her ninth album, fits Del Rey’s curious career arc: it is her quietest, most wilfully inscrutable record in a long time, perhaps since 2015’s glacially paced, rebelliously quiet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/18/lana-del-rey-honeymoon-review-third-album">Honeymoon</a>. Many of the songs here don’t have choruses or hooks, and instead feel like the result of Del Rey simply standing in front of a microphone and vibing out. As on 2021’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/oct/22/lana-del-rey-blue-banisters-review">Blue Banisters</a>, her usual US iconography has been largely replaced with specifics from her own life – the names of her siblings recur; one song is named for Margaret Qualley, the actor girlfriend of Del Rey’s producer, Jack Antonoff; five songs were written with Mike Hermosa, an ex-boyfriend. Del Rey’s artistic universe has long been a closed feedback loop, and in Ocean Blvd’s most dramatic, dynamic moments – the jaw-dropping A&amp;W and hazy closer Taco Truck x VB – she outright samples herself, reusing elements of two NFR! songs to create a psychedelic, unexpected time warp.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/20/lana-del-rey-did-you-know-that-theres-a-tunnel-under-ocean-blvd-review">Continue reading...</a>
