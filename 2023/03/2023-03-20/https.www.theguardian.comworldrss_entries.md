This includes but is not limited to TikTok, whose parent company is the Chinese firm ByteDance.</p><p><em>The government has <strong>received the review and is considering its recommendations</strong>. We are working to undo the years of inaction under the previous government, who failed to act or even provide advice about these issues as they developed.</em></p><p><em>I’m not yet convinced that we can adequately deal with the non-proliferation risks involved in what is a novel arrangement by which a non nuclear weapons state under the [non-proliferation treaty] comes to acquire weapons-grade material … There is no particular reason to expect the Aukus arrangement will be the only one of its kind.</em></p><p><em>For having the temerity to ask legitimate questions about those non-proliferation issues the now opposition leader referred to me in this place as ‘Comrade Wilson’.
