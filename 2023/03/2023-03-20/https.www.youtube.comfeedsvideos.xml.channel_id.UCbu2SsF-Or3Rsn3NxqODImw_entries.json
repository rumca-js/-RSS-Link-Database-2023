Bandai Namco is celebrating the first anniversary of the game with an infographic revealing some of the first year's most impressive statistics, so let's dive into them. \n\n\nElden Ring players have died more than 9 billion times, with 69% of those deaths coming from enemies or NPCs. 15% of deaths were due to status effects, 14% from falling, and only 2% of player deaths were caused by other players.\n\nPlayers have also attempted nearly six billion boss battles in the first year, with Malenia, Blade of Miquella receiving the most attempts at 329 million. Margit The Fell Omen ranks second with 281 million, followed by Limgrave Tree Sentinel at 277 million, Radagon of the Golden Order at 148 million, and Starscourge Radahn at 139 million.\n\nOver one billion summons have been called by Elden Ring players, with 88 percent of those being co-op focused as opposed to 12 percent invasion summons. Bandai Namco also ranked the top five casted spells, with Rock Sling being the most popular, as well as the top five incantations used, with Blessing Of The Erdtree topping the list.\n\nThose are some gigantic numbers and as someone that normally skips the FromSoft games, it's an honor for all of my deaths to be a part of that 9 billion. If only I also had the privilege of summoning Let Me Solo Her, the legendary Elden Ring player known for helping others defeat Malenia. \n\nHe\u2019s onto bigger and better things now, like challenging himself with the mod that replaces all enemies with the famed Blade of Miquella.\n\nThis Malenia mod is created through the Item and Enemy Randomizer mod, and players can choose specific settings like scaling enemy health and damage. It also seems like Malenias in the mod are also very aggro, as pointed out by Let Me Solo Her, and will hunt players until they reach a Site of Grace.\n\nLet Me Solo Her ended the first stream by taking down Magma Wyrm Malenia and Draconic Malenia and is planning on continuing in the near future.\n\nPast players have successfully cleared a mod where everything is Malenia before, with YouTuber Bushy streaming a successful completion.\n\nLet Me Solo Her streamed his first attempt over on YouTube, and he listed his goals as no leveling vigor, getting the Jar Helm--Let Me Solo Her's signature accessory--and beating the game.\n   \nBut that's enough Elden Ring talk for now. Let's discuss another game with swords and magic: Final Fantasy 16. According to a Famitsu interview with the game\u2019s director and producer, FF16 will take around 70 to 80 hours to 100%. Director Hiroshi Takai told the site, \"You\u2019ll see the entirety of Clive\u2019s way of life, and the game will probably take about 35 hours to clear. If we include side content, it can be double that amount.\u201d\nWhile there's plenty to do if you want to earn 100% completion, Square Enix wanted to ensure that busy players could reach the end of the game in a reasonable amount of time.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCJHEI0ou0o", "date_published": "2023-03-20 21:15:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor: Official Story Trailer", "description": "The dark times are closing in as Cal Kestis seeks out a safe haven far from the reach of the Empire.
