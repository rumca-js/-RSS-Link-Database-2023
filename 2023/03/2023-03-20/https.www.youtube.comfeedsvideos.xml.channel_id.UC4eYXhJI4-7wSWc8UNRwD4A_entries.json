As the band warmed up, there was concern that his voice might not carry over the fullness of the talented ensemble. During the rehearsal, he stood nearby, directing music cues, occasionally taking a moment to make \u201cgrrrr\u201d vocalizations as the band adjusted to bring the loudness down. They quickly found just the right level and when Tribbett moved into place for sound check, his lead vocal both blended into and soared above the magnificence of the band\u2019s high energy praise music.\n\nEven before the production crew pushed their record buttons, an excitement filled the air. As the first song developed, the intensity rose to an even higher level, setting the tone for an emotional, spiritual experience. Musical excellence was abundant as the singers lifted their voices with precise intonation, and Tribbetts\u2019 vigor was infectious. The complex instrumental arrangements included jazzy licks and funky beats that drove spontaneous but smooth transitions in and out of six inspiring songs.\n\nBefore the last tune, the encouraging \u201cBe Alright,\u201d Tribbett exclaimed, \u201cThere is hope! You\u2019re never hopeless. I know your world gets dark and you feel all by yourself. You think nobody sees you but God sees you and not only does he see you but he\u2019s been with you the whole time.\u201d \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cNo Way\u201d\n\u201cGet Up\u201d\n\u201cVictory\u201d\n\u201cEverything\u201d \n\u201cHe Turned It\u201d\n\u201cBe Alright\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nTye Tribbett: vocals\nJoseph Bethea: keys\nBrandon Jones: keys\nThaddaeus Tribbett: bass\nGeorge \"Spanky\" McCurdy: drums\nJabari Johnson: guitar\nKevin Woods: trumpet\nJoseph Streater: trumpet\nFrank Rein: trombone\nJalisa Faye: vocals\nJewell Jones: vocals\nJocelyn Bowman: vocals\nSharon Ann: vocals\nBilly Crayton Jr.: vocals\nBrandon Edwards: vocals\n\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Neil Tevault \nAudio Mix: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel, Maia Stern\nAudio Assistant: Josephine Nyounai \nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Pilar Galv\u00e1n\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk nydesk #nprmusic #tyetribbett", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZWZ82Em-Q8", "date_published": "2023-03-20 09:00:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
