Just over 25 years after it's initial release, Titanic is still considered one of the greatest blockbusters ever made.  James Cameron perfectly marries his ability to tell timeless love stories with his passion for realism in story telling.   The stunt work within Titanic is utilized to sell the immense scope of one of histories greatest disasters.  Even 25 years later, these stories, stunts, and connections continue to live on as fans flock back to theaters to see Titanic on the big screen once again.
