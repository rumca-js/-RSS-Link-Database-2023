Few places in Middle-earth stoke the imagination like Rivendell, the home of the highest elves and a place where joy and splendor make even the passage of time feel unimportant. This ancient Elven city is where the Council of Elrond was held to determine what was to be done about the great evil known as The One Ring, and this incredible Lord of the Rings LEGO Rivendell set captures that moment, and the splendor of the site as a whole, in a level of LEGO detail that's nearly as astonishing as the location upon which it's based.

Composed of 6167 pieces, this build will take you as long as watching both The Lord of The Rings and Hobbit trilogies. And yes, we're talking about the extended cuts. Set #10316 is a beautifully designed Elven town that comes with 15 Minifigures and we haven't been able to take our eyes off it. Play with it at your own risk as this particular set's designed for the collectors.

## WWE 2K23 Review

WWE 2K23 reviewed by Jarrett Green on PlayStation 5, also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, and PC.

Whether you want to experience a TV-inspired story of young wrestling talent rising to glory or take a guided tour of John Cena's most humbling moments, WWE 2K23 is worth pinning down. It’s at least incrementally better in almost every way from last year’s entry in that combat feels more rewarding, flexible, and consequential. Where it overachieves, like in MyGM, it starts to finally restore the feeling that we could be on the ramp watching a new golden age of pro wrestling games make its glorious entrance.
