The DMV, or Dual Mode Vehicle, on the Asa Coast Railway in Shikoku, Japan, is a hybrid bus and train. And I rode it. â–  The railway: https://asatetu.com/en/  (English) or https://asatetu.com/ (Japanese)

An accessible English dub of this video is available. Plus, as there was (unusually) room for it in this video, there's also a version with audio description. You can turn those on in your device's player settings. Both are experimental and use an AI-generated voice, so they're a long way from perfect; I can't guarantee they'll be available for future videos, or even for this one long-term! But hopefully it's a step in the right direction.
