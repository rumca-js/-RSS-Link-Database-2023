Whilst The Coalition haven\u2019t officially confirmed anything just yet, it was well known they were at one stage working on a new IP in Unreal Engine 5. In fact, there are two games in the works at one point, both of which have potentially fallen by the wayside in favour of the next entry in Microsoft\u2019s hugely successful Gears of War franchise. So successful is Gears of War in fact that alongside a new game \u2013 which, whilst not announced, seems inevitable at this stage \u2013 there are movie tie-ins and an animated series in the works thanks to a freshly minted partnership with streaming giant Netflix.\n\nThe inevitability of a sequel to 2019\u2019s Gears 5 rests on that game\u2019s ending too, which inarguably concluded on a cliff-hanger.

It wasn't, of course, but the combination of Exosuits, rampaging hordes of dinosaurs, and sleek AI conducting live-fire exercises in virtual reality was still interesting.\n\nAs time passed, many of the usual worrying things started to pop up \u2013 online only, a Battle Pass, a $60 price, post-launch plans, etc. I thought the developer was simply jumping on board the live-service bandwagon several years too late, that too with something that looked tedious.\n\nHowever, after playing the open beta early, I can confirm that Exoprimal is a ton of fun. There are still several unknowns and more than a few concerns, but the core gameplay loop is easy enough to jump into without feeling too mindless (for the most part). Let's examine ten new things you should know before jumping in.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH1HdQH2Chs", "date_published": "2023-03-17 13:30:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Resident Evil 4 Remake Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "RE4 Remake never misses a beat.
