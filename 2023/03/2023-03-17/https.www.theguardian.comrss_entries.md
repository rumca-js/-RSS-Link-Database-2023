<p>The Guardians of the Galaxy writer-director and DC Studios CEO has turned his focus to the company’s ultimate hero. But will anyone ever fill Christopher Reeve’s 45-year-old red boots?</p><p>The old DC adage (with apologies to Voltaire) always went that if Superman did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. Perhaps such religious imagery goes some way to explaining why, despite umpteen reboots over the years, and even though the character had been in existence for four decades by the time he really arrived on the big screen, it is Richard Donner’s 1978 take, starring the quietly majestic Christopher Reeve, that remains the definitive iteration. For comic-book fans, that version of the man of steel really was right up there with Jesus and, frankly, there never has been a second coming.</p><p>Nobody could accuse James Gunn of not being up for a challenge then, following the news this week that <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/james-gunn-to-direct-superman-legacy-movie-1235347753/">the Guardians of the Galaxy film-maker will direct Superman: Legacy</a>, from his own script. Not content with jumping in to take charge of Warner Bros’s stumbling DC extended universe – a movie mega-saga that has had more ups and downs than Batman has had run-ins with the Joker, the newly installed DC head honcho will now take charge of what is billed as an epoch-defining reboot for the last son of Krypton.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/17/james-gunn-superman-big-screen-second-coming-dc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A talent drain, club academies and player development mistakes have all put English rugby union on the back foot</p><p>Rarely have Ireland and England approached the final day of a Six Nations championship with such wildly contrasting expectations. For Irish rugby these are truly the best of times. For their white-shirted cousins another winter of despair is playing out. It is hard not to see it as a cautionary Dickensian tale of two unions, reaping the results of their respective eras of wisdom and foolishness.</p><p>And if Ireland do complete a grand slam at the Aviva Stadium and reinforce their status as the game’s No 1 international side less than six months before the Rugby World Cup, comparisons with England’s current predicament will be all the more glaring. A huge occasion looms but Ireland, in reality, have long since galloped away over the horizon in terms of their developmental pathways and administrative vision.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/17/hard-yards-and-tough-calls-await-england-rugby-union-to-become-a-force-again">Continue reading...</a>

He would miss the rest of the season. He would miss Belgium’s Euro 2016 campaign. Most worryingly of all, he would be injured for the arrival of a man he was keen to impress: City’s new manager Pep Guardiola.</p><p>In a sense, the qualities that helped Kompany navigate a two- decade career were the same qualities that made him such a peerless defender: a razor-sharp instinct for danger, the ability to intuit threats and convert them into opportunities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/17/vincent-kompany-burnley-manchester-city-pep-guardiola">Continue reading...</a>

Such a view would have flown resolutely in the face of AP McCoy’s post-race analysis, in which he praised Townend for producing “as brilliant a ride as I have ever seen on a racecourse”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/17/paul-townend-atones-for-famous-blunder-with-win-on-galopin-des-champs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The toll of the disastrous US decision to invade, backed by the UK, becomes clearer every year</p><p>It did not take long for anyone to realise that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/iraq-war-20-years-on" title="">the Iraq war</a> was the disaster that many had predicted; not much longer than it took to confirm that it was launched on a lie and that there were no weapons of mass destruction. Whatever relief or joy was felt by Iraqis at the fall of Saddam Hussein’s violent and oppressive regime, it was soon subsumed by the horror of what followed. The body count and wider damage have not stopped rising since. When the 10th anniversary arrived, Islamic State (IS), birthed by the war’s fallout, had yet to make its frightening rise to establishing a “caliphate”. Two decades on from the beginning of the war, with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/20/iraq.julianborger" title="">“shock and awe” assault</a> of 19 March 2003, we are still fathoming the impact of the US-led and UK-backed invasion.</p><p>The toll has been felt most of all, of course, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/iraq-war-invasion-2003-aftermath-middle-east-islamic-state" title="">within Iraq itself</a>. Hundreds of thousands of civilians died in the violence that followed. The <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/" title="">Costs of War project</a> estimates that several times as many may have died from knock-on effects. More than 9 million Iraqis were displaced. Thousands of coalition personnel, mostly American, were killed. Trillions of dollars that could have been spent on improving lives were instead squandered destroying them. Much of the Pentagon spending went to <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2021/ProfitsOfWar" title="">just five huge corporations</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/17/the-guardian-view-on-iraq-20-years-on-the-costs-of-war">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>David Blunkett </strong>says the chancellor has distorted the truth about childcare in his budget statement, while <strong>Tony Roberts </strong>says<strong> </strong>the Tories have always misunderstood the importance of early years provision. Plus letters from <strong>Margaret Varley </strong>and<strong> Ursula Shone</strong></p><p>In his budget statement, the chancellor said: “In 2010, there was barely any free childcare for under-fives. A Conservative-led government changed that …” Why would someone, respected for their integrity and decency, be prepared to tell such an untruth? I asked myself this question after listening to that part of Jeremy Hunt’s speech relating to the initiative on childcare, and his interviews the following morning.</p><p>In broadcast interviews, he then went on to claim that this was the greatest investment in his lifetime. Bearing in mind, of course, that in the coming year, this will amount to £140m and future expenditure will depend entirely on recruiting a workforce to deliver much-needed improvement: much needed because of the devastation caused over the last 13 years, including the demolition of the Sure Start programme, pioneered 25 years ago by the late Tessa Jowell and myself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/17/children-are-a-numbers-game-to-jeremy-hunt-and-his-ilk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The New Zealand actor’s new memoir reveals that he has been ‘crook’ with blood cancer and will need chemo for the rest of his life. But relaxing on his farm, he is philosophical. ‘Dying? I couldn’t care less,’ he says</p><p>If you came to Sam Neill’s memoir without knowing the first thing about it, chapter one would hold a terrible shock. It begins amusingly enough: a lovely anecdote about his daughter Elena being asked at school when she was little about what her dad does for work. “My daddy sits in caravans,” she says, an answer “both perceptive and entirely accurate” writes the actor, who then goes on to describe a life spent on film sets: sitting in trailers, reading the paper, having cups of tea, waiting for the magic moment when someone comes and says: “We need you on set, Mr Neill.”</p><p>The tone shifts to reflective. There’s a potted preamble on what it means to live a good life, thereby setting tone and topic for the book, there’s musing about why he’s even writing a book, about who will read it, then he’s sounding somewhat <em>swan-songish</em>. And then, there’s this:</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/17/sam-neill-cancer-memoir-interview">Continue reading...</a>

They had made the initial leap from sex shop to what they styled as a “lingerie boutique”; it would be more accurate to say they took it from a shop women never went into to a shop women did go into, while still selling the same sex toys and lucky knickers.</p><p>The impact of Jacqueline Gold, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/17/ann-summers-founder-jacqueline-gold-dies-aged-62">who has died aged 62</a>, went far beyond the shops themselves or even the operation. The irony is that British culture in the 80s was hardly a stranger to images of women in their underwear, but these images were pretty well always used to sell random things to men. The notion of erotic imagery and shop frontage aimed at women was quite novel, and freighted with innuendo – this is one sense in which I can just about allow that Britain <em>is </em>exceptional, the peculiar humour it derives from sex: that Carry-On, seaside postcard, slightly mirthless and dutiful performance, where anyone revealing a sexual identity is considered to make themselves ridiculous, becoming the butt of some inexpressible joke. It was not cost-free, therefore, for women to go browsing in Ann Summers, and Gold attacked this from two directions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/17/jacqueline-gold-proudly-smutty-ann-summers-changed-uk-high-street">Continue reading...</a>

For much of the past seven days, I’ve been right back there, immersed in the realm of regime change, weapons of mass destruction, or WMD, and the dodgy dossier – along with the rest of the vocabulary that, in the lead- up to the invasion of Iraq, whose 20th anniversary falls on Monday, became the dominant lexicon of British and global politics.</p><p>I have gone back to the inquiries – Hutton, Butler and Chilcot – and dug out long forgotten newspaper columns and Commons speeches.

<p>It’s a hyper-energetic dance off that’s watchably perky to the end. But unless you’re a specialist choreographer, you may be baffled by the criticism. ‘Needed a lot of face’, anyone?</p><p>Reality TV competitions which require professionals to compete with other professionals, thus putting their reputations and perhaps even careers on the line, are usually excellent. MasterChef the Professionals is more fraught with peril than regular old MasterChef. There’s always that moment when a head chef of many years’ standing reveals that they have no idea how to butterfly a chicken, or whip up a quick béarnaise sauce, or grill a slice of toast. Ditto the high pressure of Bake Off: The Professionals, which puts its pastry chefs through hellishly difficult feats of chocolatiering. Now the same principle has been applied in Dance 100, a new Netflix series that pits professional dancers against each other to find the “next superstar choreographer”.</p><p>Much to my disappointment, Dance 100 turns out not to be a remake or spin-off of Physical 100, the smash hit Korean fitness-fest, though I did like the idea of a Hunger Games for contemporary dancers. My main reference point for dancers remains In Bed With Madonna, and on the basis of that, I suspect that concept might have been even more ruthless than pitting bodybuilders against MMA fighters and military veterans. Instead, there are eight contestants, each with a degree of prominence in the dance world. The 100 of the title are dancers, who serve as participants in the routines, as well as audience, judge and jury.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/17/dance-100-review-netflix-choreography-competition">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We have a saying that captures the devastation of our country: ‘Saddam has gone, but 1,000 more Saddams have replaced him’</p><p>Twenty years ago, around this time, the US-led military operation to invade Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein’s regime finally seemed inevitable for Iraqis. With it, the idea of leaving started to sink in.</p><p>By leaving, I do not mean fleeing the country. That was not even an option. After the 1990s Gulf war, and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/mar/04/weekend7.weekend9">international sanctions</a> that followed it, Iraqis were isolated from the rest of the world. For many, there was no exit. Leaving meant departing schools, universities or workplaces, saying goodbye to friends and colleagues, and moving to relatively safer places within the country, away from the areas targeted by strikes and bombings. But my parents decided to stay at home in Baghdad. “If we were meant to die, it would be better to die at home” – that was our logic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/17/iraqis-saddam-hussein-us-invasion-country">Continue reading...</a>

Today’s pie is slightly different from an American one – the pastry is short and sweet, rather than salty and flaky, and, for ease, I bake it in a shallow, round casserole dish and serve it straight from that with some cold cream.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/17/rhubarb-and-apple-pie-recipe-ravneet-gill">Continue reading...</a>

## When it comes to wine, what does ‘value’ mean anyway | Fiona Beckett on drinks

<p>If you cut margins to the bone, someone has to pay, and it’s unlikely to be the supermarket</p><p>I went to two tastings the other day that couldn’t have been more different, namely the latest seasonal range from <a href="https://www.lidl.co.uk/our-wine-range">Lidl</a> and the spring tasting at Mayfair wine merchant <a href="https://www.bbr.com/">Berry Bros &amp; Rudd</a>, which threw into stark relief what constitutes value in the wine world. Most of BBR’s bottles are at least twice and often three or four times as expensive as Lidl’s, but are they three or four times as good? Most of you, I suspect, would say not, but that’s not the only factor at play.</p><p>So long as you could afford it – and I appreciate that these days many can’t – most of you, I imagine, wouldn’t buy the cheapest chicken on the supermarket shelf because of concerns about the conditions under which it was reared. Similarly, you might not shop at Primark because you wonder what the working conditions are like for the garment workers who are making clothes at such low prices. Well, much the same goes for wine. If you cut margins to the bone, someone has to pay, and it’s unlikely to be the supermarket. I’m citing Berry Bros, but many local wine shops, much like butchers and bookshops, provide a real service to their community. If we like the idea of our town being populated with independent shops and want small winemakers to be able to make a living, we ought to patronise these independents. By and large, they stock more interesting wines than supermarkets, too, although the remarkably luscious <a href="https://www.lidl.co.uk/p/white-wine/haraszthy-sauvignon-blanc/p41425">Hungarian Haraszthy Sauvignon Blanc</a> that Lidl is selling for £8.49 in its latest Wine Tour is certainly the exception to that rule.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/17/wine-what-does-value-mean-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

## It’s time to kick up our (sensible, mid-height) heels again | Jess Cartner Morley

<p>Whether it’s a kitten slingback or block-heeled court, the medium heel is the two-glasses-of-wine, home-by-midnight option. And there’s no shame in that</p><p>It has taken a long old time but things have finally returned to normal. The pandemic is gradually receding in life’s rear-view mirror. We are still ravaged, the scars are still there – people lost, years lost – but we have relearned how to blur the scars with makeup and small talk. We have gone back to worrying about all the stupid things we used to worry about before we had that to worry about.<br /><br />You know how I can tell? Because of shoes. Covid killed the high heel and elevated the slipper into a style icon. At the end of lockdown everyone went hysterical. Some declared they’d be flats-only for ever more. Others embraced Revenge Dressing in reckless spindly heeled sandals that they couldn’t walk in. And some changed their mind every weekend, pinballing from the trainers-only camp to the four-inch heel brigade.<br /><br />But for the past month, the footwear I have worn most has been a pair of knee-high snakeskin leather boots bumped up on an inch of kitten heel and some square-toed loafers that sit on a chunky two-inch block. So the wearable heel is back – and it’s not just me. I’ve been travelling to fashion weeks for most of the past month, and everywhere I go – in airports, on pavements and in pizza restaurants – I see others in them too.</p><p>Last winter, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/06/why-fun-practical-stomper-boots-are-a-street-style-hit" title="">chunky stomper was the only boot in town</a>, but this time around there are lots of block-coloured midi-length dresses swishing around the calves of non-stompy leather boots. Trouser shapes that don’t hug the leg are definitely happening – either a pleat-front loose trouser, perhaps a loose leather jogger, definitely a cargo pant – and the women wearing them are figuring out that they look more fun, more lighthearted, if the foot isn’t too caged in. So instead of trainers I’m seeing them with sandals where it is warm enough, or with a block-heel court.<br /><br />There is even a whole bunch of mid-height heels on the catwalks themselves, which is unusual, because wearable, comfortable shoes with a bit of a heel but not too much are like hens’ teeth in fashion. Designers prefer to make grand, showboating statements with dramatic pancake flats or super-high heels. Pancake flats are fine if you are 5ft 11 and mostly legs but most of us could use a little boost, you know? And a towering heel is an instant showstopper, but a fashion show lasts 15, 20 minutes, max. Whereas when you or I are getting dressed at 7am, we have to live with our footwear decision all day, whether we get a seat on the train or not.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/17/its-time-to-kick-up-our-sensible-mid-height-heels-again">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Not Dead Yet addresses the return of Godley’s ovarian cancer. But mostly it is a celebratory farewell from a performer who has welcomed the crowd into her remarkable life</p><p>Not Dead Yet is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/19/janey-godley">Janey Godley</a>’s last tour, she has announced. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2021 and given the all-clear after treatment – but the cancer has since returned. That’s a very particular context in which to perform a comedy show; one might expect Godley’s mortality to cast a long shadow. But it doesn’t. OK, so the night begins with what Godley’s daughter and support act <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/12/ashley-storrie-funniest-things">Ashley Storrie</a> describes as a “sad funeral montage” of snapshots from the 62-year-old’s life. And yes, she addresses her health at the top of the show, with lots of jokes about the state of her “fanny” and a story about her husband bringing her the wrong sort of underwear for a hospital stay.</p><p>But her illness isn’t the focus of the show. If this is Godley taking her leave, she wants to leave us with happy memories, of a comic who found a place, particularly in Scottish hearts, and carved her own niche. Until recently that niche was all about earthy stories – spread across memoir, a novel and standup comedy – of an extraordinary working-class life: a childhood lived in extreme poverty, a murdered mother, marriage into a notorious gangster family. Latterly she won a legion of new fans with a series of viral videos in which she dubbed Nicola Sturgeon’s lockdown-era press conferences into gossipy broad Glaswegian.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/17/janey-godley-not-dead-yet-final-tour">Continue reading...</a>

American high jumper whose innovative ‘flop’ technique transformed his sport<p>It is easily arguable that the most significant technique change in athletics was high jumping’s “Fosbury flop”. Dick Fosbury, who has died aged 76, invented the eponymous unconventional way of getting over the bar. In the words of the American coach John Tansley, “he literally turned his event upside down”, but besides the sport, the flop’s impact as a paradigm change was even more remarkable.</p><p>For millennia, humans had proceeded over obstacles in their paths one foot at a time. Even as the sport of athletics was refined, high jumpers basically followed the techniques of hurdlers and steeplechasers without considering that they, unlike those runners, did not have to continue to propel themselves forward after their jumps. The early “scissors” technique was essentially a hurdle of the bar; the later techniques, the “straddle” and various rolls, looked the way their names implied. High jumpers preceding Fosbury were tall but strong, like sprinters, in the upper body.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/17/dick-fosbury-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

But its point is obvious and its lead character totally unengaging</p><p>Swarm is the first fruit of Amazon Prime Video’s production deal with Donald Glover, creator and star of the modern classic Atlanta. If that doesn’t make it a must-watch, or at least a must-try, Glover’s parallel career as the rapper Childish Gambino increases the intrigue: Swarm is about the dark side of music fandom, and if anyone can turn that into art, you would think Glover can.</p><p>Dominique Fishback is Dre, whom we first meet in Houston in 2016. She is a nobody, living in a drab apartment with her much more capable and confident sister Marissa (Chloe Bailey), working in a sales job that doesn’t suit her in the local mall and spending all her time thinking and posting online about Ni’Jah, a singer clearly styled to resemble Beyoncé. Clumsy, resentful, walking with a flat-footed shuffle and often nearly mute, Dre is fearful of alcohol, drugs and sex, replacing all those vices with an all-consuming love for her fave singer. She gets a new credit card to buy front-row Ni’Jah tickets she is nowhere near being able to afford, and is devastated when Marissa – who used to be as keen a member of the Swarm, the Ni’jah fan collective, as Dre still is – does not want to accompany her to the gig because she is well into her 20s now and has moved on.</p><p>Swarm is on Prime Video now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/17/swarm-review-donald-glovers-beyonce-inspired-serial-killer-satire-is-cold-and-dull">Continue reading...</a>

It revolves around ageing patriarch Ray Hanrahan, a washed-up artist who is preparing for his first solo show in 20 years in the hope of recapturing past glories. As family members gather at the Hanrahans’ ramshackle north London home, all brace themselves to do battle with Ray and his despotic ways.</p><p>Chief among the downtrodden is his wife, Lucia, a sculptor with twice her husband’s talent but who, for a quiet life, has taken pains not to outshine him. Lucia is recovering from cancer surgery and from Ray’s infidelity but, after an affair of her own with a local politician, she is now “ablaze with awkwardness, menopause, lust”. Meanwhile, Ray’s adult children – daughters Leah and Jess and stepson Patrick – are variously scared, resentful and hopelessly compliant, each holding secrets or grudges they dare not share.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/17/the-exhibitionist-by-charlotte-mendelson-audiobook-review-living-with-an-art-monster">Continue reading...</a>

I was expecting the news – the Beyoncé hashtag I follow on Twitter was brewing with speculation, and her fans, the Beyhive, are more coordinated and well-informed than the CIA. However, I still felt unprepared and panicked. Post-pandemic, attempting to grab tickets for shows and events is an event in itself, and getting Beyoncé tickets felt like a virtual Takeshi’s Castle. So I mobilised my friends in the group chat, imploring them to focus – this was no time for slow replies or ghosting, and leaving the convo was only allowed under the most extreme of circumstances.</p><p>For many, the pent-up angst of the Covid era has meant that we are all desperately seeking to live life to the fullest. FOMO is stronger than ever, as is our desire to capture every moment on camera and burn every funny thing that happens into our brains so the in-jokes can go on for years. We didn’t secure tickets for the early release but knew more were coming, so we tried our luck with the next release date. We all signed up for the pre-release and held our breaths when 10am arrived, and our individual queue numbers were revealed. There were 52,000 people in front of me on my laptop, 45,000 in front of me on my iPhone and, by some act of divine intervention, 10,000 people in front of me on my Android. Yes, I attempted it on every device in my home. My friends were way behind, so it fell on me to ensure that I secured the tickets, which I did, falling to my knees when the confirmation email arrived.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/17/why-just-getting-beyonce-tickets-felt-like-a-massive-cultural-event">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Inspired by Yeats, Wagner and French realist painting, the (W)rapper tower was meant to reawaken the city skyline. But is this monstrous erection just a monument to its designer’s ego?</p><p>A chunky grey staircase thrusts out from the side of a new office tower in Los Angeles, lunging towards a rail line before jerking back on itself and lurching up the building in jagged twists and turns. It crashes into a warped lattice of bands that wrap around the glassy hulk, swooping past corner windows that jut in and out like broken teeth. This is <a href="http://ericowenmoss.com/project-detail/wrapper/">(W)rapper</a>, “an outrageous creative office tower”, in the words of its leasing agents, set to “reawaken the Los Angeles skyline”. It is also the bombastic tombstone of a bygone era, a carbon-guzzling monument to a time when architectural ego trumped the interests of people and planet.</p><p>It is the first vertical element to sprout from an eccentric district of low-rise creative workspace that has been developing here in Culver City, on LA’s west side, over the last few decades. This 60-acre swath of former warehouses, known as the Hayden Tract, is an exhibition of <a href="http://ericowenmoss.com/project-detail/the-new-city/">architectural experimentation</a>, a place where windows slant, columns convulse and globular protuberances burst out of walls. Rippling glass canopies erupt through rooftops, held on mangled knots of steel, while other structures are flayed open or gnawed down to their bones, their exposed skeletons mutilated beyond recognition. It looks like the buildings have been attacked by some flesh-eating bacteria or succumbed to a violent parasitic invasion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/17/a-gas-guzzling-villains-lair-welcome-to-las-grotesque-new-high-rise">Continue reading...</a>

## The Darkness’s Justin Hawkins on his YouTuber second act: ‘I can say anything I want!’

<p>The glam metal vocalist is used to slaying arenas but his second career, as a YouTuber breaking down famous songs, has taken on a life of its own – and annoyed Maroon 5’s lawyers</p><p>‘It is I, Justin Hawkins from the Darkness,” began the singer on 23 October 2021, launching his YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JustinHawkinsRidesAgain">Justin Hawkins Rides Again</a>. In the short clip that followed, the rocker explained that he would be uploading several videos each week, in which he would deconstruct classic and new songs or comment on issues in the music industry. He wasn’t expecting it to become popular. “I worried that people might think I seemed desperate,” he explains, video-calling from a cottage in the Scottish Highlands, fresh off a Darkness arena tour. “Or that I’d lost my mind.”</p><p>Three hundred and thirty-odd videos, 375,000 subscribers and 47m views later, the singer needn’t have worried. Justin Hawkins Rides Again reaches a constituency well beyond the Darkness fanbase. Although best known for their No 2 smash hit I Believe in a Thing Called Love 20 years ago, the often tongue-in-cheek bombastic rockers are still filling arenas today. When he first started the channel, he noticed that other musicians mentioned it. “But now if people stop me at an airport, it’s not to talk about the Darkness. They’ll go: ‘I love your YouTube.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/17/justin-hawkins-rides-again-youtube-darkness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We asked Guardian writers and readers about the habits and rituals they have with their partners to keep things ticking over nicely. Here are 33 of our favourites</p><p>‘My boyfriend and I have a rule where we’re not allowed to wear tracksuits in front of each other. He once told me that seeing me in a tracksuit every day was not good for our sex life. So since then, we’ve worn ‘sexy’ loungewear in the house together. It has saved our relationship.”</p><p><em>“If we bicker we remember a friend’s advice on arguing – in the heat of the moment say, ‘Would you rather be right, or would you rather be closer?’ It can </em><em>snap you out of point-scoring and into remembering you love each other and want to resolve things.</em><em>”</em></p><p>“If I have an event or important meeting my husband always irons a shirt for me – he knows I get flustered when I iron.”</p><p>My wife and I have been together since we were 16. At 36 we moved in together when she became pregnant but remained in separate bedrooms. I never invite myself into my wife’s room. Some might say we cohabit like flatmates but we feel it helps maintain a degree of mystery – there is no complacency and the intimacy side of things is always fresh and exciting. I’m sure if we shared a room and bed we wouldn’t still be together.”</p><p>“My spouse and I joke that the other three little words are ‘You were right’. Ideally, this is said with joy and admiration, but rueful admission is fine”</p><p>“We take walks where we each talk about three good and three bad things that happened that day. This creates a space to debrief and reflect, but also to share how we’re feeling about a particular event or something one of us might have said or done. It’s helps foster open and honest communication.”</p><p>“I was working a late shift on Valentine’s Day when a colleague was telling everyone that her husband had bought her a bunch of flowers. My husband arrived in the pouring rain with a hot homemade meal to ‘keep me going through my shift’. I knew what I would rather have – and so did he.”</p><p>“A non-negotiable is our ‘we time’, usually on a Sunday evening, when we are partners and not parents. The main goal is to have quality time and sex together. So no TV, no phones – just us, candles, music, a fire and time to let the romance grow”</p><p>“I always forget to charge my toothbrush, but once every few weeks I come home to find it charging in the bathroom. My husband’s been doing it for nearly three years now but it still makes me smile.”</p><p>“My husband and I have three children under five so our home is full, alive, loud and a total mess. Every day, it looks like it has been raided, and every night we’re cleaning poo off a carpet or peeling stickers off a shoe. Once everyone is asleep, without saying a word or asking if I need it, my husband will open his arms wide and pull me in. For as long as I need. When the hug is over, I’ve been recharged.”</p><p>“When my partner senses I’m stressed or on edge, he massages that tension out of my shoulders. He is quite knowledgable about the human body, pressure points, where tension builds and how to release it; he has a strong yet gentle and effective touch. When someone devotes time and effort to try to help you, it gives you a feeling like no other.”</p><p>“My partner always asks me if I want a drink at 6pm, when I’m usually preparing a meal for the family. It doesn’t have to be alcoholic, but just for him to come in and ask is one of the best moments of my day.”</p><p>“I fold the end of the toilet paper in a triangle like they do in hotels. My girlfriend says it makes her feel incredibly loved and looked after.”</p><p>“My husband always defrosts my car and pumps up my bike tyres and oils my chain (not a euphemism). I recommend marrying a bike mechanic.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/17/couples-reveal-the-little-things-that-make-a-relationship-work">Continue reading...</a>

I was 45 and living with my young family in Devizes, Wiltshire, but had always wanted to visit Africa. When I read about the five-day white-water tour, it seemed the perfect way to do it.</p><p>I was struck by the heat and the aroma as I got off the plane in Zimbabwe, before travelling across the border to Livingstone, Zambia, to meet the rest of the team. Each of the rafts carried eight to 10 people, and we were split into two groups. Before starting our training, we had a riverboat ride and swam beneath Victoria Falls. I have wonderful memories of seeing elephants and hippos, and camping beside the river each night under skies filled with stars.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/17/experience-i-got-sucked-into-a-whirlpool">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A brooding hero, a kidnapped heroine and lusty couplings in a swashbuckling yarn that plays knowingly with the romantic genre</p><p>A novel born of extensive historical research presents a temptation to its author: to shoehorn in every morsel hoovered from the archives, regardless of whether or not it slows down the action. Kim Sherwood’s third doesn’t fall into that trap, but it’s overstuffed in a different way. The extra material here – interpolations, commentary, pastiche – gives an intertextual gloss to what might otherwise come across as a straightforward swashbuckling yarn.</p><p>The novel begins when toddler Molly is abducted over the body of her dead mother by the king of the Devon smugglers, Tom West. The ramifications of that night, 26 November 1703, will rumble on for centuries as the story of the orphan and the freebooter passes into legend. Molly, who grows up to become daredevil Orlando, a member of Tom’s crew, believes Grace Tucker was shot by the “Revenue man” who came to arrest Tom that stormy night, and vows to avenge her mother’s death. However, everyone present has a different account, and a different motive for sticking to it. One story is that Grace, Tom’s lover, betrayed the smugglers’ code. Whether vows and codes are just thin justifications for selfish actions is a key theme.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/17/a-wild-true-relation-by-kim-sherwood-review-smugglers-and-lovers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An impossibly starry cast put in brilliant performances in this anthology series about the climate crisis. If only it weren’t a chaotic, overly worthy plod</p><p>I’m not too sure where to begin with Extrapolations, Apple TV+’s star-studded anthology series about the possible impact of the climate crisis on humanity’s future. On the one hand, it is well intentioned and at its best drives home the horror of our impending doom through finely constructed tales and brilliant performances. On the other, there is a death-by-walrus that is not played for laughs, Meryl Streep voicing a humpback whale and the opening episode is an impenetrable heap of chaos.</p><p>Let’s call it a mixed bag. Creator Scott Z Burns wrote the 2011 Steven Soderbergh hit Contagion, which enjoyed a resurgence during the pandemic as people rewatched it to admire its prescience and, as the months wore on, score it for realism. In Extrapolations there is less to get hold of, even though there is plenty going on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/17/extrapolations-review-even-meryl-streep-cant-save-this-convoluted-eco-drama">Continue reading...</a>

Four years after 2019’s raw-skinned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/18/lankum-the-livelong-day-review">The Livelong Day</a>, with its exploratory epics, False Lankum teems with similar moments of iridescent bliss. But the 12 tracks here also unfurl into each other without a break, alternately lulling the listener then casting them into storms of shuddering sounds.</p><p>Recorded in Dublin’s Hellfire Studio by day, while the band spent their nights sleeping in a Martello tower on the coast, False Lankum begins with Radie Peat, the best folk singer of our times, instructing us to Go Dig My Grave. When Peat sings she magically straddles realities, sounding both like an uncompromising everywoman and a mystical instrument of bellows and reeds – a magic she employs to spiritual effect on the beautiful 17th-century ballad Newcastle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/17/lankum-false-lankum-review-folk-rough-trade">Continue reading...</a>

Siraj bowls over the wicket to the left-hander where Shami was coming around. Head back-cuts so close to the body, as he always tends to do. Then flashes at a wide one and misses, shades of Warner in both. Misses out again off his pads, then finally climbs into a delivery, wide and not so short but lumberjacked out through cover. Siraj dials back the length and Head is beaten on the top edge, nice bounce from this surface. The bowler gives him a long stare off a long follow-through. A challenge to ask whether he’s willing to come after the ball. So Head does, the last ball of the over. Walks at it, swings through midwicket, and gets a bottom edge back onto the stumps. Advantage Siraj.</p><p><strong>1st over: Australia 1-0 (Head 1, Marsh 0) </strong>A good start from Shami, the cricket following on from the Test series as he hits a length outside the off stump, finds some bounce, and Head plays cautiously for a few balls before carefully taking a single to point. Marsh gets squared up but survives a thick outside nick along the ground.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/mar/17/india-vs-australia-cricket-live-updates-score-first-one-day-international-50-over-odi-latest-scores-ind-v-aus">Continue reading...</a>

## Why are women so marginalised by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame?

<p>Barely 8% of its inductees are female. The canon-making doesn’t just reek of sexist gatekeeping, but also purposeful ignorance and hostility</p><p>I got into this business to write great songs and have fun. I was a quick learner. I read every music magazine I could get my hands on and at 12, after digesting many issues of Creem, I decided to base my personality on Lester Bangs, the rock critic raconteur; his abiding belief in the transformative power of a great rock song matched mine. (I also obsessed over his running arguments with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/lou-reed" title="">Lou Reed</a> – they confounded me, but I loved it.) Artists and their songs shaped my life, my beliefs, my self-conception as a musician – Patti Smith’s growling Pissing in the River, Heart’s Barracuda, the Runaways’ Dead End Justice, which I still know every word of. But what no magazine or album could teach me or prepare me for was how exceptional you have to be, as a woman and an artist, to keep your head above water in the music business.</p><p>The magnificent Chuck D rapped: “Elvis is a hero to most, but he doesn’t mean shit to me.” I concur. Big Mama Thornton first sang Hound Dog, written for her (and possibly with her) in 1952, which later put the King on the radio. Sister Rosetta Tharpe covered it, too, hers being the fiercest version. Her song Strange Things Happen Every Day was recorded in 1944. It was these songs, and her evangelical guitar playing, that changed music for ever and created what we now call rock’n’roll.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/17/why-are-women-so-marginalised-by-the-rock-roll-hall-of-fame">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A public health expert charts the cumulative effect of prejudice on peoples’ bodies, from heart disease to cancer</p><p>Arline Geronimus has spent the last 40 years researching racial and class injustice in the US. Her first non-academic book<em> </em>is the culmination of a life’s groundbreaking work. The term “weathering”, which she coined decades ago, is today widely recognised in public health, and refers to the process of chronic social and psychological stress that activates harmful biological processes among people in marginalised communities, ageing their bodies prematurely. She presents a staggering accumulation of evidence to show how daily discrimination grinds people down and all too often leads to debilitating illness and early death.</p><p>While the impact of weathering is starkest and most shocking in the health outcomes of Black Americans compared to other communities, the phenomenon transcends race. Only 50% of impoverished white people in Kentucky – from the social group sometimes stereotyped as “hillbillies” – are expected to reach the age of 50 without a “health-induced disability”. It’s a statistic mirrored among Black people living in deprived areas of Chicago. For both, the leading causes of excess deaths are not <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/opioids">opioids</a> and gun crime, as the respective cliches might suggest but, rather, chronic issues of the kind associated with weathering: cardiovascular disease and cancer. What these two groups have in common is not simply poverty: it is the fact that they are both viewed with “contempt, fear or resentment” by those around them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/17/weathering-by-arline-geronimus-review-how-discrimination-makes-you-sick">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Capcom; PC, PS4/5, Xbox Series S/X<br /></strong>This reimagining includes all the design knowledge of the whole series, from the awkward shuffling tension of the first version to the gory horror of Resident Evil 7</p><p>It begins in the way it always has. Leon Kennedy, the bruised, damaged rookie cop from Resident Evil 2 is now a spec-ops super soldier sent on a mission to a remote village somewhere in Europe. He’s searching for the US president’s kidnapped daughter and this is her last known whereabouts. His entry point is an overgrown woodland path, dark and cold; ravens peck at the bodies of dead animals, weird sounds fill the fetid air. And finally he spots it – an abandoned hovel just visible among the dead branches…</p><p>But from this point on, we’re in slightly different territory. Although this updated version of Capcom’s seminal survival horror sequel retains the narrative, characters and major locations of the original, the structure of the game, the way each terrifying and exhilarating set-piece plays out, has been subtly remixed. It’s definitely a remake, but it feels fresh and vibrant. And it is brilliant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/17/resident-evil-4-remake-review-beautiful-tense-camp-gory-all-thats-best-about-the-series">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This animation, co-created by Priscilla Presley, depicts The King as a secret agent with a psychotic sidekick chimp. He beats bad guys to death while tripping on LSD – and it’s hugely funny</p><p>In some ways it’s surprising that the show Agent Elvis, where Elvis Presley is a secret agent saving the world between Las Vegas concerts with a plucky chimp sidekick, doesn’t already exist. Throughout his career, his image was commodified and it’s easy to picture this show’s concept as a cartoon playing on Saturday mornings between Superman and Josie and the Pussycats to wide-eyed American children. But Netflix’s Agent Elvis is extremely child unfriendly and has more in common with Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood than Hanna-Barbera’s Super Friends.</p><p>This is a show where hot tubs are blocked by an excess of “monkey spunk”, Elvis’s surrogate mother has a friends-with-benefits situation with William Shatner and jars of Howard Hughes’ piss line the walls of Elvis’ spy plane. It’s a strange tone to initially settle into, somewhere between the outrageous comedy of the long-running spy parody Archer and the historical reimagining of Forrest Gump. It changes Elvis’s famous meeting with President Nixon into a spy mission that goes terribly wrong and involves a chimp doing cocaine in the Oval Office. While it takes a little getting used to, it’s easy to stay transfixed by the gorgeously bright and sharp animation, which shines most in the action scenes where Elvis breaks out his karate moves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/17/agent-elvis-review-matthew-mcconaughey-foul-mouthed-violent-presley-is-hilarious">Continue reading...</a>

## Alexander Skarsgård: ‘There’s a politeness to Swedes. It’s a facade. Deep down we’re animals’

<p>The actor talks about his new film, the explicit sci-fi horror Infinity Pool, why he gave up acting for eight years – and why he likes playing darker, more twisted characters</p><p>Alexander Skarsgård is an embarrassing creep who tries to coerce women into partying naked with him in hotel suites. Or so it would seem from the version of himself that he played last year in Donald Glover’s comedy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/atlanta">Atlanta</a>. “I’m not saying that I dance around in a leopard-print thong in front of girls I don’t know,” he says. “But I’m also not saying that I <em>don’t</em>. That kind of thing works really well when there’s a kernel of truth in it.”</p><p>This twinkling, teasing playfulness represents the default setting of the 46-year-old actor. His natural self-deprecation is what makes it so startling when he turns up on screen as another of the brutes and bastards that have become his speciality over the years. There was the violently abusive husband in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/17/big-little-lies-domestic-violence">the HBO series Big Little Lies</a> and the violently abusive cop in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/09/war-on-everyone-review-cops-alexander-skarsgard-michael-pena">War on Everyone</a>; a racist in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/28/passing-review-rebecca-hall-racial-identity-tessa-thompson-ruth-negga">Passing</a> and a rapist in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/03/straw-dogs-review">Straw Dogs remake</a>, as well as a sad, moustachioed sleazeball who sleeps with his partner’s underage daughter in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/06/the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl-review-coming-of-age-comedy">The Diary of a Teenage Girl</a>.

<p>No matter how bad I feel, I have to remind myself that the treatment is working to reducing my tumour</p><p>Nausea, diarrhoea, joint pain, fatigue, hair loss – the list of side-effects for most cancer drugs reads like symptoms of many illnesses in their own right. Before I had this disease, I would have considered making a GP appointment if I’d been suffering just some of the problems that I later came to just write off as simply the downside of being cured. The problem with all the side-effects the drugs have caused is that as they pile up, you can lose sight of why you are taking them.</p><p>It’s not as if you’re not warned that chemotherapy has its downsides. Before I started my treatment for breast cancer, the oncologist went through a long list of the things that I could experience as side-effects. It covered most of an A4 sheet of paper, and she appeared to have ticked every suggested problem as possible from the one or several of the cocktail of drugs I was going to be on.</p><p>Hilary Osborne is the Guardian’s money and consumer editor</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/17/breast-cancer-treatment-life-health-chemotherapy-drugs-side-effects">Continue reading...</a>

## From The Hurt Locker to American Sniper: how Hollywood tried to tackle the Iraq war
 - [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/16/hollywood-iraq-war-hurt-locker-american-sniper](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/16/hollywood-iraq-war-hurt-locker-american-sniper)

<p>Two decades on from the beginning of the war, a handful of films have tried various ways to show the conflict with audiences mostly choosing to stay away</p><p>When The Hurt Locker, perhaps the most significant film about the Iraq war, won best picture, it also made a dubious kind of history, posting the worst box office of any previous winner. It had only made $11m at the time – and then several more millions after the Oscar bump – despite the pleadings of critics who insisted, correctly, that director Kathryn Bigelow and her screenwriter, Mark Boal, had made a studiously apolitical thriller about an army bomb squad that spends its days defusing improvised explosive devices. And what could be more exciting than that? How many hit movies and TV shows have been built around the tick-tick-ticking of bombs that are about to go off? Too many to count.</p><p>And yet, five years into the war, Americans simply did not want to hear about it. The dramatic events of the invasion were over within a few months: Saddam Hussein’s regime had been toppled, along with his statue in Baghdad’s Firdos Square, and George W Bush had flown onto an aircraft carrier with a “Mission Accomplished” banner, declaring that major combat operations were over. The minor combat operations would continue indefinitely, of course, as the power vacuum was filled by the chaos of a growing insurgency and great spasms of sectarian violence. That’s the Iraq war of The Hurt Locker – a rudderless, perilous, borderline nihilistic endeavor that politicians could not risk their careers to end. It didn’t matter that Bigelow and Boal were not making an explicitly anti-war film, focused on visceral, exciting, on-the-ground experiences. The backdrop was too much of a bummer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/16/hollywood-iraq-war-hurt-locker-american-sniper">Continue reading...</a>

A caption flashes across the screen: “I’m not a doctor just FYI”. Moments later she advises her nearly 20,000 followers on how to get started on the drug. “Start on the 0.25 mg,” she says directly into camera. “Work your way up with each dose. Do not skip doses.

You need to figure out if paying that cost will be a fair deal</p><p><strong>I’ve been “friends” with a person since secondary school (nearly 30 years). We have had short phases where we’ve been pretty close but also times where we really just don’t see eye to eye or have anything in common. The past couple of years I believe her behaviour has become particularly toxic and I’ve been trying to keep my distance from her. Unfortunately though our paths do cross from time to time due to a particular social circle and also a couple of shared WhatsApp groups.</strong></p><p><strong>I believe she’s a narcissist and feel like I’m walking on eggshells whenever I’m in her company.
