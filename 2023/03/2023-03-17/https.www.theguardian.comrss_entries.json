Most of BBR\u2019s bottles are at least twice and often three or four times as expensive as Lidl\u2019s, but are they three or four times as good?

If you cut margins to the bone, someone has to pay, and it\u2019s unlikely to be the supermarket. I\u2019m citing Berry Bros, but many local wine shops, much like butchers and bookshops, provide a real service to their community. If we like the idea of our town being populated with independent shops and want small winemakers to be able to make a living, we ought to patronise these independents. By and large, they stock more interesting wines than supermarkets, too, although the remarkably luscious <a href=\"https://www.lidl.co.uk/p/white-wine/haraszthy-sauvignon-blanc/p41425\">Hungarian Haraszthy Sauvignon Blanc</a> that Lidl is selling for \u00a38.49 in its latest Wine Tour is certainly the exception to that rule.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href=\"https://fionabeckett.substack.com/\">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/17/wine-what-does-value-mean-fiona-beckett\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/17/wine-what-does-value-mean-fiona-beckett", "date_published": "2023-03-17 14:00:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "It\u2019s time to kick up our (sensible, mid-height) heels again | Jess Cartner Morley", "description": "<p>Whether it\u2019s a kitten slingback or block-heeled court, the medium heel is the two-glasses-of-wine, home-by-midnight option. And there\u2019s no shame in that</p><p>It has taken a long old time but things have finally returned to normal. The pandemic is gradually receding in life\u2019s rear-view mirror. We are still ravaged, the scars are still there \u2013 people lost, years lost \u2013 but we have relearned how to blur the scars with makeup and small talk. We have gone back to worrying about all the stupid things we used to worry about before we had that to worry about.<br /><br />You know how I can tell? Because of shoes. Covid killed the high heel and elevated the slipper into a style icon. At the end of lockdown everyone went hysterical. Some declared they\u2019d be flats-only for ever more. Others embraced Revenge Dressing in reckless spindly heeled sandals that they couldn\u2019t walk in. And some changed their mind every weekend, pinballing from the trainers-only camp to the four-inch heel brigade.<br /><br />But for the past month, the footwear I have worn most has been a pair of knee-high snakeskin leather boots bumped up on an inch of kitten heel and some square-toed loafers that sit on a chunky two-inch block. So the wearable heel is back \u2013 and it\u2019s not just me. I\u2019ve been travelling to fashion weeks for most of the past month, and everywhere I go \u2013 in airports, on pavements and in pizza restaurants \u2013 I see others in them too.</p><p>Last winter, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/06/why-fun-practical-stomper-boots-are-a-street-style-hit\" title=\"\">chunky stomper was the only boot in town</a>, but this time around there are lots of block-coloured midi-length dresses swishing around the calves of non-stompy leather boots. Trouser shapes that don\u2019t hug the leg are definitely happening \u2013 either a pleat-front loose trouser, perhaps a loose leather jogger, definitely a cargo pant \u2013 and the women wearing them are figuring out that they look more fun, more lighthearted, if the foot isn\u2019t too caged in. So instead of trainers I\u2019m seeing them with sandals where it is warm enough, or with a block-heel court.<br /><br />There is even a whole bunch of mid-height heels on the catwalks themselves, which is unusual, because wearable, comfortable shoes with a bit of a heel but not too much are like hens\u2019 teeth in fashion. Designers prefer to make grand, showboating statements with dramatic pancake flats or super-high heels. Pancake flats are fine if you are 5ft 11 and mostly legs but most of us could use a little boost, you know? And a towering heel is an instant showstopper, but a fashion show lasts 15, 20 minutes, max. Whereas when you or I are getting dressed at 7am, we have to live with our footwear decision all day, whether we get a seat on the train or not.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/17/its-time-to-kick-up-our-sensible-mid-height-heels-again\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/17/its-time-to-kick-up-our-sensible-mid-height-heels-again", "date_published": "2023-03-17 14:00:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Taylor Swift eras deathmatch!

I was expecting the news \u2013 the Beyonc\u00e9 hashtag I follow on Twitter was brewing with speculation, and her fans, the Beyhive, are more coordinated and well-informed than the CIA. However, I still felt unprepared and panicked. Post-pandemic, attempting to grab tickets for shows and events is an event in itself, and getting Beyonc\u00e9 tickets felt like a virtual Takeshi\u2019s Castle.

We didn\u2019t secure tickets for the early release but knew more were coming, so we tried our luck with the next release date. We all signed up for the pre-release and held our breaths when 10am arrived, and our individual queue numbers were revealed.

I\u2019m sure if we shared a room and bed we wouldn\u2019t still be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy spouse and I joke that the other three little words are \u2018You were right\u2019. Ideally, this is said with joy and admiration, but rueful admission is fine\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe take walks where we each talk about three good and three bad things that happened that day. This creates a space to debrief and reflect, but also to share how we\u2019re feeling about a particular event or something one of us might have said or done. It\u2019s helps foster open and honest communication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was working a late shift on Valentine\u2019s Day when a colleague was telling everyone that her husband had bought her a bunch of flowers. My husband arrived in the pouring rain with a hot homemade meal to \u2018keep me going through my shift\u2019. I knew what I would rather have \u2013 and so did he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA non-negotiable is our \u2018we time\u2019, usually on a Sunday evening, when we are partners and not parents. The main goal is to have quality time and sex together. So no TV, no phones \u2013 just us, candles, music, a fire and time to let the romance grow\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always forget to charge my toothbrush, but once every few weeks I come home to find it charging in the bathroom. My husband\u2019s been doing it for nearly three years now but it still makes me smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband and I have three children under five so our home is full, alive, loud and a total mess. Every day, it looks like it has been raided, and every night we\u2019re cleaning poo off a carpet or peeling stickers off a shoe. Once everyone is asleep, without saying a word or asking if I need it, my husband will open his arms wide and pull me in. For as long as I need. When the hug is over, I\u2019ve been recharged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my partner senses I\u2019m stressed or on edge, he massages that tension out of my shoulders. He is quite knowledgable about the human body, pressure points, where tension builds and how to release it; he has a strong yet gentle and effective touch. When someone devotes time and effort to try to help you, it gives you a feeling like no other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy partner always asks me if I want a drink at 6pm, when I\u2019m usually preparing a meal for the family. It doesn\u2019t have to be alcoholic, but just for him to come in and ask is one of the best moments of my day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fold the end of the toilet paper in a triangle like they do in hotels. My girlfriend says it makes her feel incredibly loved and looked after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband always defrosts my car and pumps up my bike tyres and oils my chain (not a euphemism). I recommend marrying a bike mechanic.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/17/couples-reveal-the-little-things-that-make-a-relationship-work\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/17/couples-reveal-the-little-things-that-make-a-relationship-work", "date_published": "2023-03-17 11:00:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Sowing seeds is fussy work \u2013 I\u2019ll hold off until after next week\u2019s equinox", "description": "<p>The longer, warmer days mean seeds sown later will catch up with the struggling seedlings that were started off in January</p><p>There comes a time in March when, for a few blissful days, it feels as though spring has arrived.
