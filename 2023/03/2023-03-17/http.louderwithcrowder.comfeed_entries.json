And they really, really want to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-trans-kids\" target=\"_blank\">trans the kids. </a></p><p>This week, Levine promised that medically transitioning children will soon be normalized and said such, <em>ahem</em>, \"medical care\" has support at the highest levels of the Biden administration.

But <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-texas-utopia\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk</a> did it anyway. Because he's cool like that. </p><p>Musk replied to the video on Twitter, writing, <em>\"Not when they\u2019re fed propaganda by adults.

It's insane to think that children should be able to make any sort of life-altering decision. Have these people ever been around a child? They change their minds <em>constantly. </em>Like, by the time you get out the bread to make them a sandwich for lunch, they've already decided they want soup instead. So why in the world would any well-meaning adult subject them to brutal \"medical procedures\" that will leave them mutilated and sterilized?</p><p>And I'm going to take it a step further. To the -<em>gasp</em>- \"extremist\" arena, if you will. Ultimately, \"gender reassignment surgeries\" should not be available to anyone, regardless of their age. \"Doctors\" are mutilating human beings because they think they can recreate a man or a woman. They're trying to play God. What magically happens when a person turns 18? Do these surgeries become any less harmful and life-altering? <br /></p><p>And the procedures are far from \"life-saving medical care\". According to <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/sex-reassignment-doesnt-work-here-the-evidence\" target=\"_blank\">The Heritage Foundation,</a> <em>\"The <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885\" target=\"_blank\">most thorough follow-up of sex-reassigned people</a>\u2014extending over 30 years and conducted in Sweden, where the culture is strongly supportive of the transgendered\u2014documents their lifelong mental unrest. Ten to 15 years after surgical reassignment, the suicide rate of those who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery rose to 20 times that of comparable peers.\" </em><br /></p><p>So it's <em>not</em> life-saving, and <em>not</em> a medical procedure. It should be outlawed, <em>at least </em>until 18. And it's a good thing we have the one of the richest men in the world on our side in this fight. </p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-trans-kids", "date_published": "2023-03-17 20:06:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Watch: Local morning show gets St. Patrick's Day off to a raunchy start over confusion on getting \"double-fisted\"", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33311608&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=200%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>I'm a professional and have NOT started drinking yet today.

Oh.</p><p>According to Tucker, this happened 11 years ago, and the professor studied the brains of more than 100 troops who died after encountering UFOs.

Since it's for <em>dogs. </em>It can include animal byproducts like udders and lungs that are not considered safe for people to eat. Veterinarian Tracy Navarra also said,<em> \"Dogs\u2019 intestines are equipped to deal with pathogens, bacteria, dirt, virus, litter, parasites, etc., that the human gut is not accustomed to.

Such as camping out in their parent's <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktokker-buys-shed-avoid-rent\" target=\"_blank\">sheds</a>. </p><p>This chick on TikTok gave a tour of her shed home after a viewer commented she \"lives in a f**king shed\". To which she responded, \"I do live in a shed. This is my shed.\" But this was no ordinary shed. I've never seen a shed this nice in my lifetime.</p><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@aniahhhhwarne/video/7000061374919347461\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n<section>\n<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@aniahhhhwarne\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@aniahhhhwarne\">@aniahhhhwarne</a>\n<p>Reply to @delaney002 i love my rent free shed</p>\n</section>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br /></p><p>The shed is the size of a studio apartment and fully equipped with a walk-in closet, heater, and air conditioner. It also has a large bed, tapestry, television, desk, and a nice garden view. It doesn't have a bathroom or kitchen, however. She has to go into her parent's house for those, which seems quite inconvenient. <br /></p><p>In a follow-up video, she responded to viewer's questions about the bug situation: <em>\"Honestly, I don't have an issue with spiders or mosquitos or flies. </em><em>I have the door and the window open right now, and there is not a single fly in here. I do have to be concerned about leaving food out, though, because of ants.\"  </em>I need to know how what kind of bug spray she's using, cuz this seems a <em>tad</em> unbelievable. I don't know how the shed could possibly repel bugs even with the door wide open all the time. </p><p>In an earlier TikTok, she said she always thought she would get a job, move away, and go to an out-of-state school. But instead she went to college in her hometown, moved into her parents' backyard, and became a \"stoner.\" The American dream. </p><p>Now, obviously, living in your parent's backyard as an adult isn't ideal, no matter how cool the shed is. But since making this video, it looks like this chick actually did move out to Salt Lake City, Utah. So maybe the shed life was just a transitory phase. And a pretty cool one at that. </p><p><p>\n<i>\n<strong>Editor's Note:</strong>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>It\u2019s official. MugClub. Is.

He's charged with two counts of battery, four counts of criminal mischief, and abusing an elderly or disabled adult.

His boys saw a one-armed man standing outside a hotel and dared Max to go do something.</p><p>3. This one also implies alcohol, but Max wasn't in his right mind and accidentally confused Allen for Vince Neil, lead singer of Motley Crue who Def Leppard is on tour with. Like most Crue fans, Max can't stand to see the band as they are and thought he was doing rock n' roll a favor by taking out Neil. Only, he took out Allen in his confusion.</p><p>Those are our guesses. Feel free to speculate on your own in the Facebook comment section.</p><p>What's most important is that Allen is okay and Def Leppard will continue rocking across America. Losing an arm didn't stop the music. Some schmuck from Ohio won't either.</p><p><p>\n<i>\n<strong>Editor's Note:</strong>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>It\u2019s official. MugClub. Is.

We've seen videos of people <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-store-stolen-merchandise\" target=\"_blank\">casually strolling out of stores with armfuls of clothes</a>. Or in the case of one brazen gentleman, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-walgreens-shoplifter\" target=\"_blank\">riding his bike</a>. I can assume this is one of those cities. This woman looks like she walked out with an entire rack's worth of slacks. Maybe she should have brought a calculator with her to make sure she didn't go above the legal limit. If $950 is the cutoff between police being told to look the other way and a misdemeanor, jeans can easily run more than $100 a pair. That looked like more than ten pairs that were dropped when the lady realized she no longer had a ride home. I guess math isn't her strong suit.</p><p>But the best part of the video? It's not seeing the cop suddenly run into the shot. It's not even seeing the woman get put in handcuffs. It's hearing the dude recording the video laughing in the background, and the dude's daughter telling him to stop. That alone makes this a 10/10 video.</p><p><p>\n<i>\n<strong>Editor's Note:</strong>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>It\u2019s official. MugClub. Is.

All it would take is one person to be offended by one thing and tweet about it, and the holiday would uncritically go away. Singing \"Fields of Athenry\" would become hate speech. Celebrities would suddenly decide St. Patrick's Day was full of too much \"whiteness.\" Politicians would look to score points off activists and have the name changed to Little People Appreciation Day. President Biden would sign whatever executive order about it after someone tells him to. That's the point Maniscalco is making. Sadly, no. No one is embarrassed about it.</p><p>To you, Sebastian, I accept your wishes of a happy St. Patrick's Day on behalf of my people. I'd also like to offer you an early happy St. Joseph's Day.
