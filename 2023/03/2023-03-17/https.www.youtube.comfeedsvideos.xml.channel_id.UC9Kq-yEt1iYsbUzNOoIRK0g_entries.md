After many years of development, Shazam has joined the DCEU! Billy Batson gets chosen by a wizard to take on the mantle of Shazam and develops the ability to turn into a full-grown superhero. The movie is a ton of fun, but definitely raises a lot of questions. Like what’s up with the bullies being absolute psychopaths? Why is the villain so generic? Why was it so easy for Billy’s mom to just abandon him? Why was the Shazam family so good with their powers?!

To answer all these questions and more, step inside the pitch meeting that led to Shazam! It’s super easy, barely an inconvenience!
