<p><em>Trombone Champ</em> is a blast to watch, but a beast to play even compared to some other rhythm games — you try nailing a slide during the "William Tell Overture." Thankfully, developer Holy Wow Studios is putting the game within reach of more players. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1059990?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791468151861&amp;emgid=5216896531506590592">introducing</a> an "Autotoot" option that takes away the need to press buttons. If you have hand mobility issues, you'll have a better chance of squonking your way to an S rank. Your score is halved to prevent leaderboard cheating, but you can advance the story.</p><p>The update is also more streamer-friendly, with icons warning when a tune might be muted on services <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-dmca-takedowns-notice-193717690.html">like Twitch</a>. It's faster to restart a track when your performance goes askew, and you'll see your character in the points screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Trombone Champ</em> quickly became a viral sensation after its debut last September. Anyone who's familiar with <em>Guitar Hero</em> or <em>Rock Band</em> will grasp the basic mechanics, but the laugh-'til-you-cry hilarity of playing trombone over classic pieces can't be overstated — this is one of those precious games where messing up is almost more entertaining than a perfect score.

<p>Researchers at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, have <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202205656">developed</a> a flexible 3D bioprinter that can layer organic material directly onto organs or tissue. Unlike other bioprinting approaches, this system would only be minimally invasive, perhaps helping to avoid major surgeries or the removal of organs. It sounds like the future — at least in theory — but the research team warns it’s still five to seven years away from human testing.</p><p>The printer, dubbed F3DB, has a soft robotic arm that can assemble biomaterials with living cells onto damaged internal organs or tissues. Its snake-like flexible body would enter the body through the mouth or anus, with a pilot / surgeon guiding it toward the injured area using hand gestures. In addition, it has jets that can spray water onto the target area, and its printing nozzle can double as an electric scalpel. The team hopes its multifunctional approach could someday be an all-in-one tool (incising, cleaning and printing) for minimally invasive operations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The F3DB’s robotic arm uses three soft-fabric-bellow actuators using a hydraulic system composed of “DC-motor-driven syringes that pump water to the actuators,” as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-bioprinting">summarized</a> by <em>IEEE Spectrum</em>. Its arm and flexible printing head can each move in three degrees of freedom (DOFs), similar to desktop 3D printers. In addition, it includes a flexible miniature camera to let the operator view the task in real time.</p><div id="2f97b55acdc041d1b0c63cb83aada353"></div><p>The research team ran its first lab tests on the device using non-biomaterials: chocolate and liquid silicone. They later tested it on a pig’s kidney before finally moving onto biomaterials printed onto a glass surface in an artificial colon. “We saw the cells grow every day and increase by four times on day seven, the last day of the experiment,” said Thanh Nho Do, co-leader of the team and Senior Lecturer at UNSW’s Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering. “The results show the F3DB has strong potential to be developed into an all-in-one endoscopic tool for endoscopic submucosal dissection procedures.”</p><p>The team believes the device is brimming with potential, but further testing will be necessary to bring it into the real world. The next steps would include studying its use on animals and, eventually, humans; Do believes that’s about five to seven years away. But, according to Ibrahim Ozbolat, professor of engineering science and mechanics at Pennsylvania State University, “commercialization can only be a matter of time.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/this-insertable-3d-printer-will-repair-tissue-damage-from-the-inside-185147733.html?src=rss

## Eventide Misha review: A playful sequencer that says to hell with tradition

<p>Standalone sequencers are something of a luxury in the modern music-making landscape. These days, even the cheapest synths and samplers have at least rudimentary sequencing capabilities. And while many MIDI controllers have on-board sequencers, they’re usually meant to back up live performance rather than replace it. Of course, there are a few exceptions to this rule (Arturia’s BeatStep Pro remains incredibly popular even eight years after it was introduced), but you have to start looking into the complex and often intimidating world of Eurorack and modular synths to regularly come across devices whose sole purpose is playing back strings of notes for you.</p><p>Eventide, best known for its high-end effects units like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eventide-h-90-harmonizer-guitar-effects-pedal-insanely-powerful-expensive-133052541.html"><ins>H90</ins></a> and TimeFactor, is not an obvious candidate to delve into the world of Eurorack. But that’s exactly what it decided to do with <a href="https://www.eventideaudio.com/rackmount/misha/"><ins>Misha</ins></a>, its first sequencer. Now, nobody would have blamed the company for playing it safe with its first foray into the space. Instead, it decided to chuck the usual conventions out the window and make something unique that is equal parts fun and confounding, especially if you’re deeply entrenched in traditional music theory and keyboard-based composition.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I am not an adept pianist. Nor do I have a particularly deep knowledge of Western music theory. And even still I initially struggled to wrap my head around Misha. That’s because the buttons on its face don’t play specific notes. Instead they play intervals related to the last note played within a scale.</p><figure><img alt="-4, -3, -2 and -1 interval buttons on the Eventide Misha." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/29f6e910-c4dc-11ed-bffb-09e1fd94e666" style="height: 1125; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The easiest way to explain this is through an example. Let’s say we’ve set the Misha to play a C Major scale. Below the screen, which shows you the key and scale, are nine colored buttons labeled -4 through +4. If you press 0, you get a C right off the bat, because that is the root note and it is zero intervals away from the start of the scale. If you press the +1, instead of getting a C#, you’ll get a D, the next note in the scale.</p><p>So far, so good, right? But if you press the +1 again, you won’t get a second D, and instead you’ll get an E, one interval higher in the scale. To get a second D note, you’d have to press 0. And if you wanted to go back to C, you’d have to press -1. It’s not complicated necessarily, but it breaks a basic expectation that any musician would understandably have – that if you do the same thing, you should get the same note. If I play the fifth fret on the low E of a guitar, I expect to get an A every time. If the notes continued to climb by five steps, without moving my hands, I would have a <em>much</em> harder time playing anything.</p><p>But this is the core concept of the Misha. It’s not built around absolute pitch and instead forces you to compose based purely on the relationships between notes in a scale. If that idea sends you running for the hills, then this probably isn’t the sequencer for you. If, however, you’re like me and intrigued by Misha’s unique approach, hang around and let’s dig a little deeper.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><figure><img alt="Eventide Misha MIDI in and out jacls" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/d0166050-c4dc-11ed-b3b7-2bd80db1a9b8" style="height: 1125; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Before we go too far down the rabbit hole of scales, modes and sequencing, let’s take a step back and look at the hardware. While my unit came with a dedicated pod for housing the Misha, it’s ostensibly designed to live in a Eurorack setup. At 28hp wide, it’s a relatively large module, but it’s quite shallow at just 19mm deep, meaning it should fit in even the most portable skiffs. That width is kind of necessary, though. The 17 buttons, two knobs, microUSB port, microSD slot and and 16 ¼” jacks for MIDI, audio and control voltage would feel impossibly cramped on anything smaller.</p><p>The layout feels just spacious enough to be viable as a performance tool, without completely dominating a smaller Eurorack setup. The nine interval buttons are well-spaced, the screen is large enough to deliver all the necessary information and the knobs are sturdy. My only issue hardware-wise is that the shift buttons have a hollow spring to them that feels a bit cheap and they make an audible popping sound.</p><p>The 12 CV (control voltage) jacks are split across three tracks, with three pairs of gate and CV outputs as well as two inputs each. This gives you a decent amount of options for controlling multiple synth voices or modulating the Misha’s sequencer. There’s also MIDI in and out jacks, as well as stereo out and a clock in. The microUSB port can also be connected to a computer keyboard for use with custom keymappings. You’re not gonna be wanting for connectivity options here.</p><figure><img alt="Eventide branding and CV jacks on the Misha." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/6ace39b0-c4dd-11ed-bfbb-34f959e28722" style="height: 1125; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The screen in the dead center gives you all the info you need about navigating Misha’s interface, though it can take a bit to figure out how it all works. I highly recommend reading the manual. It’s not long and can save you lots of time and frustration. Once you come to grips with how the Misha works, it’s almost deceptively simple. In fact, I frequently felt like I had to be missing something. That, for sure, this module, with all its buttons and knobs and 1-inch screen, was hiding features from me.</p><p>Definitely take time to customize those four user buttons, though. While the default functions of up and down one octave (button one and two), and up and down one chromatic step (three and four) are useful enough, they can offer a lot of performance power when mapped to meet your specific needs. Personally I like swapping in “move pitch” for the chromatic steps, and setting it to a fifth. That adds a bit more spice than a simple octave, but generally still works well musically with whatever else is going on.</p><p>One last thing worth noting is that Misha has a built-in oscillator that you can turn on in the settings. But, beyond providing a simple sound source for auditioning melodies and generally getting a feel for the sequencer, it’s practically useless. In fact, it’s not even mentioned in the manual.</p><h2>Composing</h2><figure><img alt="Eventide Misha set to play A Major scale." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/b4574c70-c4dd-11ed-bffe-c622df6ac362" style="height: 1125; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Misha ships with <a href="https://downloads.eventide.com/audio/manuals/misha/MishaScalesandModes.pdf"><ins>100 preloaded scales</ins></a> ranging from basic (Melodic Minor), to exotic (Enigmatic), to microtonal insanity (48 note equal-tempered). And, if somehow that’s not enough for you, there are 100 user slots for loading your own scala files. Between the various scales, modes and keys, the musical options baked into Misha are seemingly endless.</p><p>The most immediate way to start exploring them is to select a scale and then start pressing the interval buttons. This is actually a pretty satisfying way of playing an instrument, too. I don’t have a big rig to stick this in, but I paired it with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cre8audio-east-best-and-west-pest-cheap-modular-synthesis-review-143003424.html"><ins>Cre8Audio’s East Beast and West Pest</ins></a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moog-subharmonicon-semi-modular-synth-review-160011051.html"><ins>Moog Subharmonicon</ins></a> and Elektron Digitone all to wonderful effect.</p><p>This is not the sort of process you go to when you want to translate a melody you hear in your head to the real world. Perhaps someone could train themselves to think in intervals to use Misha that way, but it would take a lot of work. Instead this can create happy accidents. You just have to pay especially close attention to what you play to make sure you can recreate anything that catches your ear.</p><p>Now, yes, there are ways to lock a controller to a specific scale, similar to the Misha – basically making it impossible to play out of tune. But there’s something about playing intervals instead of notes that feels both intuitive and surprising, in a way a keyboard never could. Crafting melodies becomes a rewarding exploration where I’m basically forced to cede control, rather than a frustrating attempt to use my limited theory knowledge to turn ideas into reality.</p><figure><img alt="Scale knob on the Eventide Misha." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/eb1853d0-c4dd-11ed-bcfb-225b8f26504a" style="height: 1125; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>One of the few things I have to decide beforehand is how many octaves I want to play around in. Setting the note range to two octaves, for instance, means, once I climb beyond that cap, the intervals will swing back around to two octaves below my root note. It’s probably best to try and avoid going all the way around, though. Jumping down two octaves can sound a tad harsh.</p><p>The octave limits also apply when using Misha as a sequencer, so you can play a melody line spread out over four octaves worth of a scale before starting over. The sequencer, though, is where things get a little dicey. It’s built around the idea of a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_row"><ins>tone row</ins></a>,” a device used in serial composition where all twelve notes in the chromatic scale are played, without repetition, to create a motif. The innovation here is that this concept of a tone row can be applied to any scale, not just a twelve-note, Western chromatic one.</p><p>This method of composition definitely falls on the experimental end of the spectrum and with certain scales it can come off a little awkward. This also means that the number of steps in a sequence is dependent on which scale you’re using. A single octave sequence in a minor pentatonic scale will only have five steps, while two octaves of the quarter tone scale will have 48 steps. While I appreciate the novel approach, part of me really wishes that the tone row was a mode you could turn on and off. I’d love to see Eventide add a more traditional sequencer through a firmware update where notes can be repeated.</p><p>There is also a chord mode that allows you to send three-notes out over MIDI or divided between the three CV outs. If you have a Eurorack setup with multiple synth voices, this is a great way to create some complexity and variation, especially if you have other utilities that can further modulate what the Misha puts out. For example, you can send the root note through a simple arpeggiator for the bass while using the other notes to play leads or pads. Unfortunately, there is no onboard way to sequence chord voicings. You can manually change it while performing, but it’s kind of a pain. Alternatively, you could use another sequencer to send MIDI CCs to Misha and change chord voicings, which seems like overkill.</p><figure><img alt="Diagram showing the default MIDI mapping for the Eventide Misha" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/395dd2a0-c4dd-11ed-bbd9-61cbe177279c" style="height: 1294; width: 1976;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Easily the best way to use the Misha is as a performance tool paired with an external MIDI controller. Here, the white keys give you an even broader range of interval jumps (nine in either direct) as well as quick access to the root note, while the black keys can repeat a note, play a random scale note or move chromatically up and down one step at a time. And, of course, you can still hit the four user programmable buttons on the front of the module or even map other notes on the keyboard to put more variables at your fingertips.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt="Eventide Misha on a desk with book, patch cables and a very pretty pen." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/cf6092f0-c4de-11ed-bbff-245ce7401a05" style="height: 1125; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>At $599, <a href="https://store.eventideaudio.com/products/misha?variant=42767925215393"><ins>Misha</ins></a> is not cheap. And that jumps to $699 if you need a Eurorack pod and power adapter. But it’s also truly unique. If the allure of interval based performance or tone row sequencing is what you’re after, well, this is the only game in town (at least that I’m aware of). I’m sure that there are ways of getting a similar effect using software, but when it comes to hardware, this is it.</p><p>I do wish that Eventide made a few more concessions to traditional composition, though. I want to be able to repeat notes or program passages that are an arbitrary length, rather than be limited to the number of notes in a scale. Maybe those will be added in a future firmware update, at which point it might be harder to come up with reasons <em>not</em> to buy one. For now, Misha is a pricey, niche tool that’s also undeniably playful and creative.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/eventide-misha-review-a-playful-sequencer-that-says-to-hell-with-tradition-170058588.html?src=rss

We gave it a review<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-2022-review-battery-life-workout-health-tracking-144551799.html"> score of 89</a>, calling it the best smartwatch $250 can buy. There's no always-on display and it doesn't have blood oxygen sensors, skin temperature readings or ECG monitoring like the Series 8. The screen isn't quite as robust either.

We gave them an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html">87 in our review</a>, praising the excellent active noise cancellation, powerful sound and punchy bass. They also happen to fit a wide range of ear shapes thanks to the "fit wing" that's comfortable while keeping the buds securely in place.&nbsp;</p><p>The Beats audio brand is owned by Apple, so they take on some of the more helpful iOS compatibility features like good Siri integration and support for spatial audio. Despite that, they'll also pair up with Android devices.

In<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-review-170044941.html"> our review</a> of the Pixel Buds Pro, we appreciated the responsive touch controls, excellent bass and solid noise cancellation. They've got an excellent 11-hour battery life if you're not using active noise cancellation. Turn the feature off — and drop the buds in the charging case — and you'll get a full 20 hours on a charge. One of our complaints was a lack of quality in handling phone calls, but if you're more of a texter anyway, perhaps that won't matter as much. Our other concern was the price.

## Rivian issues its second airbag recall in less than a month

<p>Rivian is <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2022/RIVIAN/R1S#recalls">issuing</a> a recall for airbag-related issues for the second time in the last few weeks. The EV automaker is notifying affected owners of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1s-suv-ev-review-video-160029394.html">R1S SUV</a> (2022-23) about potentially faulty side-curtain airbags.</p><p>The recall says one or more of the models’ side-curtain airbags (left or right side) may not have been properly fastened. A report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says the affected models were manufactured at the company’s Normal, IL plant between October 28th, 2022 and January 21st, 2023. Rivian began contacting customers on March 2nd to schedule an inspection and secure them properly. In addition, the company says it will reimburse any owners who already paid for the repair elsewhere.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although the latest recall only affects 30 vehicles, it’s the second time the automaker has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-recalls-more-than-12700-evs-over-airbag-deployment-flaw-201518265.html">issued an airbag-related recall</a> in less than a month. A March 1st one was much broader, affecting over 12,000 R1T pickups and R1S SUVs (2022) over an airbag deployment issue. In that case, a supplier’s faulty seatbelt sensors, which prevented the front passenger airbags from deploying, were the culprit. However, the vast majority in that group won’t likely have the flaw, as Rivian estimated only one percent of the recalled vehicles were affected.</p><p>Although the recalls won’t likely hurt Rivian’s finances significantly, it still isn’t a great look for the young automaker — especially when it recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-layoffs-184047174.html">laid off six percent of its workforce</a> for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-layoffs-report-200719638.html">second time</a> in less than a year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/rivian-issues-its-second-airbag-recall-in-less-than-a-month-163154213.html?src=rss

## Google won't pay remaining parental or medical leave for laid-off employees

<p>Google is facing pushback from some of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-parent-alphabet-is-laying-off-12000-employees-105523115.html">12,000 laid-off employees</a>. <em>CNBC</em> has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/17/google-nixes-paying-out-rest-of-medical-leave-for-laid-off-employees.html?__source=sharebar|twitter&amp;par=sharebar">learned</a> that over 100 ex-staffers have formed a &quot;Laid off on Leave&quot; group asking Google to pay for the full leaves they were approved to take before the January 20th layoff announcement, including parental, medical and caregiver leave. While the company said in early 2022 that it was extending all parental leave to 18 weeks for full-time staff (24 weeks for birth parents), it told terminated employees that they'd get 16 weeks of severance pay plus two weeks for every added year of employment, with paid time off included.</p><p>The group members say the approach has not only impacted their parenting plans (including those who had recently given birth), but has also disrupted healthcare. Some former workers tell <em>CNBC</em> they lost access to Google's in-house medical care the day they received their layoff notices, denying them access to ongoing in-person treatment. Google has offered virtual doctor's appointments, but has otherwise asked affected people to find alternatives.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a statement to Engadget, Google repeated its 16-week severance pay plan and noted that outgoing employees would be eligible for regular salary and stocks for their &quot;60+ day&quot; notice window. Google claims its accommodations for people on leave compare &quot;favorably&quot; with those of other companies.</p><p>The affected people are demanding that CEO Sundar Pichai and other management quickly clarify the leave policy. Google is poised to finalize severance terms as soon as March 31st.</p><p>Google is far from alone in creating potential issues for workers laid off while on leave. Numerous tech giants have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html">announced mass layoffs</a> in the past several months as they grapple with a tough economy. However, the uproar at Google highlights one of the problems these companies face: they previously promised extensive benefits to attract would-be hires, but now have to reconsider those perks as they cut costs.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-wont-pay-remaining-parental-or-medial-leave-for-laid-off-employees-161713912.html?src=rss

## How to declutter your iOS devices

<p>If you’ve owned your iPhone or iPad for a while, there’s a good chance there are apps, contacts and settings that you either don’t use anymore or aren’t serving you as well as they could. This guide will take you through how to reclaim your notifications and your device’s storage.</p><h2>Delete your unused apps</h2><figure><img alt="A screenshot showing how to access the iPhone Storage utility." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/f74471e0-c1b6-11ed-bcee-2e409183eab4" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>You don’t need me to tell you to delete apps you don’t use to free up space on your iPhone, but you might not know that iOS has a dedicated tool to help you do this. You can access it by opening the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad, then tapping “General,” followed by “iPhone Storage” or “iPad Storage.” It may take a few moments for the interface to populate, but once it does, you’ll see a handy visual representation of how much of your device’s storage you’ve given over to apps, photos and other types of files. You will also see a list of every app installed on your device, as well as how much space it takes up and when you last used it – all helpful information you can use to decide what to delete.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Depending on the app, iOS will present you with at least two options when you tap on it. You can delete the app and all its related data or “offload” it. In the latter case, iOS will delete the app from your iPhone or iPad but leave your data untouched. As such, when you reinstall the app, you can pick up right where you left off. It will also remain in your App Library for easy access. From the iPhone Storage menu, you can also set your device to automatically offload unused apps when you’re running low on storage, which is useful for all, but especially those with older, low-storage devices.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots of the Apple Music and Messages sections within the iPhone Storage utility. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/d66bb6c0-c1b8-11ed-afdc-27e51f9d5a9c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you use Apple Music and Messages frequently, tap on them since they offer a few additional options for managing their footprint. The interface for Apple Music includes a list of every download on your iPhone or iPad sorted by artist and album, offering a much better way of culling your library than from within the app itself.</p><p>Messages, meanwhile, has a few handy options for serial texters. At the bottom of the interface, you will see a breakdown of all the different attachments you may have received in messaging with your friends and family. Seeing how much storage those old photos, videos and GIFs take up may be eye opening; in fact, iOS will prompt you to review large attachments. That’s a good place to start since the interface does a good job of highlighting the biggest space hogs right at the top. You can also set iOS to automatically delete messages and attachments that are more than a year old. Unless space is at an absolute premium on your device, I would recommend against turning on this option, if only because it might delete a photo or video that has sentimental value to you.</p><h2>Trim your contacts list</h2><h2></h2><p>If you’ve had an iPhone for a while, there’s a good chance your contacts list could use an edit. Unless you plan to one day<a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/5whnab8/186-the-contact-list"> call everyone on that list</a>, why not delete contacts you don’t speak to anymore? Your iPhone will give you a head start by identifying suspected duplicate contacts. Outside of that, there’s not much to this process other than going through each contact and ensuring the information you have is up to date.</p><h2>Review your notification settings</h2><figure><img alt="Screenshots showing how to access the Scheduled Summary feature." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/28bd1650-c1b7-11ed-acf2-1516bbd4b1a8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Something everyone should do every so often is review their notification settings since alerts can be a drain on your device’s battery (not to mention frequently take your attention away from more important things, too). To get started, open your device’s Settings app and tap on “Notifications.” If you haven’t already, I would recommend taking advantage of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">iOS 15’s</a> scheduled summary feature. Let’s be honest, most notifications don’t require your immediate attention, and you’re better off addressing them all at once instead piecemeal. The schedule feature will help you do that by allowing you to set a few times per day when your device displays some notifications all at once.</p><p>For most people, that should make their notifications more manageable, but if you want to take things a step further, you can adjust individual settings for each app.  For some of the worst offenders (Instagram and Twitter come to mind), it’s worthwhile to jump into their in-app settings to limit or disable the notifications they send you.</p><h2>Focus Modes</h2><figure><img alt="Screenshots showing how to access iOS's Focus Mode functionality." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/674e15e0-c1b7-11ed-9d87-c51a3e5bb053" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Another tool you can use to get a handle on your notification is Apple’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-wwdc-2021-facetime-messages-notification-summary-live-text-172526551.html">Focus feature</a>, which allows you to configure custom do not disturb settings for different activities. By default, your device will come with a few preconfigured ones, and it’s worth reviewing the settings for each to optimize them for your needs.</p><p>To create a new custom Focus Mode, open the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad and tap “Focus,” which is located in the same subcategory as notifications. You can also create a new Focus mode directly from your device’s Control Center by long pressing on the “Do Not Disturb” icon and tapping “New Focus.”</p><p>Once you create a new Focus, customizing it is straightforward. You can specify contacts you want iOS to either silence or allow notifications from. You can do the same for apps as well. After you customize those lists to your liking, tap the “Options” prompt below your contacts and apps lists to see a few additional settings. Specifically, there’s an option to allow silenced notifications to display on your lock screen that you might find helpful.</p><p>The last thing I want to draw your attention to are the options around customizing your Home Screen for different Focus modes. By limiting the apps I can easily access, I find I’m less likely to get distracted. For instance, I’ve set my Reading Focus to limit my Home Screen to apps like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/libby-app-irl-123053789.html">Libby</a>, Pocket and Apple Music.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-organize-apps-iphone-ios-declutter-150038492.html?src=rss

The Google-owned video service has <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1636731005263544320">lifted</a> a ban on video uploads from Trump's channel.

## New Zealand is the latest country to ban TikTok from government devices

<p>New Zealand has joined the growing list of countries and jurisdictions that have banned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tiktok/"><ins>TikTok</ins></a> from certain government devices. Unlike elsewhere, the restriction doesn't apply to all government employees. It's limited to devices that have access to New Zealand's parliamentary network, though the country's defense force and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said they've banned TikTok on work devices too.</p><p>The ban will come into force by the end of March. However, there may be exceptions for those who need access to TikTok to carry out their jobs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Officials made the move in the wake of advice from cybersecurity experts and talks between people in the government and with other countries. &quot;Based on this information, the Service has determined that the risks are not acceptable in the current New Zealand Parliamentary environment,” parliamentary service chief executive Rafael Gonzalez-Montero told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/new-zealand-ban-tiktok-devices-linked-parliament-2023-03-17/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>.</p><p>Chris Hipkins, New Zealand's prime minister, shed some light on why the country limited the ban to devices linked to the parliamentary network. &quot;Departments and agencies follow the advice of the (Government Communications Security Bureau) in terms of IT and cybersecurity policies ... we don't have a blanket across the public sector approach,&quot; he said.</p><p>Earlier this week, the UK <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-bans-tiktok-from-government-devices-with-immediate-effect-142516712.html"><ins>announced an immediate TikTok ban</ins></a> on government devices. It said users of such devices would only be able to use third-party apps that are on an approved list. Over the last few months,  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-us-government-ban-devices-omnibus-bill-funding-nasa-234803320.html"><ins>the US</ins></a>, dozens of states, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canada-is-reportedly-banning-tiktok-from-government-issued-devices-170230648.html"><ins>Canada</ins></a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-commission-bans-staff-from-using-tiktok-on-work-devices-185157323.html"><ins>European Commission</ins></a> have also banned TikTok on devices they own.</p><p>As with those other jurisdictions, New Zealand is limiting government access to TikTok due to security fears. Officials in many countries have expressed concern that TikTok's parent company ByteDance (which is based in Beijing) may be compelled to share sensitive user information, such as location data, with China for purported national security reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>ByteDance has said it wouldn't share user data with China, but US officials have claimed the company would legally have to comply if the government demanded the information. TikTok has tried to assuage privacy worries in the US and Europe by routing traffic from each territory to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-user-data-us-200500287.html"><ins>domestic servers</ins></a> and conducting third-party <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oracle-tiktok-algorithms-content-moderation-review-171742979.html"><ins>security</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/project-clover-is-tiktoks-effort-to-get-ahead-of-eu-privacy-and-security-concerns-173813888.html"><ins>data audits</ins></a>.</p><p>TikTok's troubles don't end with bans from government devices. This week, the company said that the US <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-us-government-is-trying-to-force-bytedance-to-sell-tiktok-005751763.html"><ins>told ByteDance to sell the app</ins></a> or TikTok could face a nationwide ban.

<p>Finding a suitable TV for your PlayStation or Xbox used to require a careful look at spec sheets. But that’s not the case these days as the best TVs for gaming are usually the best TVs you can buy, period. While nobody <em>needs</em> a fancy TV to enjoy a good video game, the right set can help you maximize your gaming hardware’s potential. If you’re unsure of where to start, we’ve laid out some helpful advice for buying the right model below, along with a few recommendations for the best gaming TVs you can buy today.</p><h2>What to look for in a gaming TV</h2><p>Whether you use it for gaming or not, all good TVs are built on the same foundations. You want a 4K resolution (which is standard nowadays), sufficient brightness, high contrast ratios with deep and uniform black tones, colors that find the right balance between accuracy and saturation, and wide viewing angles. For video games specifically, you want a TV with minimal input lag and fast motion response, with no blur or other unwanted artifacts behind quick-moving objects. Of course, finding a set that ticks all those boxes and fits into your budget can be the trickiest part of the process.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For now, a top OLED TV will offer the best picture quality for gaming or otherwise. Good OLED TVs still tend to cost more than LED LCD alternatives, however, and they still may not get bright enough for those who have their TV set in a particularly well-lit environment. (Some OLED TV makers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-2023-oled-tv-lineup-specs-010035157.html?uuid=eDkym7q8449T05I632845">say they’ll address</a> the latter with future models.) If you opt for an LCD TV, an advanced backlight with mini-LEDs and effective <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/742183/what-is-full-array-local-dimming/">full-array local dimming</a> will usually improve contrast and lighting detail, while a quantum dot filter can enhance colors.</p><p>One thing you don’t need to worry about is 8K support. Although the PS5 and Xbox Series X are technically capable of outputting 8K video, very few games are made for that resolution, and 8K’s practical benefits are <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/size-to-distance-relationship">extremely minimal</a> unless you plan on sitting unreasonably close to a massive TV. The few 8K TVs on the market are also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-2023-8k-mini-led-tv-starts-at-5000-163559445.html">very expensive</a>.</p><p>All that said, there are a few terms you should look for in particular when buying a TV for your new game console or high-end graphics card.</p><h3>HDMI 2.1</h3><p>To get the most out of a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S, your TV should have full HDMI 2.1 support. This is the latest major update to the HDMI spec, enabling a higher maximum bandwidth – 48 gigabits per second, up from HDMI 2.0’s 18 Gbps – and a handful of features that are beneficial for gaming specifically. These include variable refresh rate (VRR) and automatic low latency mode (ALLM), which we detail further below.</p><p>Beyond that, perhaps the chief perk of HDMI 2.1 is its ability to transmit ultrasharp 4K video at up to 120Hz refresh rate. Not every <a href="https://www.psu.com/news/all-ps5-games-that-support-120-fps-the-smoothest-games-on-playstation-5/">PS5</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/ps5-and-xbox-series-x-games-with-120fps-support">Xbox Series X/S</a> game supports frame rates this high – and some only do so at lower resolutions – but those that do will look and feel especially fluid in motion. HDMI 2.1 also brings support for <a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec21sub/enhancedaudioreturnchannel">Enhanced Audio Return Channel</a> (eARC), which allows for higher-quality 5.1- and 7.1-channel audio from a source device connected to the TV to a compatible soundbar or receiver.</p><p>The more full HDMI 2.1 ports your TV has, the better. “Full” is the key word there. As reported by <a href="https://tftcentral.co.uk/articles/when-hdmi-2-1-isnt-hdmi-2-1"><em>TFT Central</em></a>, because HDMI 2.1 is backwards compatible with HDMI 2.0, TV and monitor manufacturers have been allowed to brand ports as “HDMI 2.1” even if they lack full (or any) support for the spec’s upgraded features. We recommend a few TVs below that have true HDMI 2.1 ports, but if you’re buying a new TV for gaming, make sure your chosen set isn’t trying to hide any capabilities you may consider essential.</p><h3>HDR — High Dynamic Range</h3><p>HDR refers to a TV's ability to display a wider range between the darkest and brightest parts of a picture. This broader range can bring out details that would otherwise be missing on a standard dynamic range (SDR) TV, in both the very dark and, especially, the very bright areas of an image. HDR typically comes with an improvement to color reproduction as well, displaying a larger palette of more vibrant colors that brings content closer to its creator’s original vision.</p><p>To get an HDR picture, you need both content that is mastered to take advantage of the tech and a TV capable of displaying that content. HDR also comes in a variety of formats, which are generally split between those that utilize static metadata (e.g., HDR10) and those that utilize dynamic metadata (e.g., HDR10+, Dolby Vision). In short, the latter allows a TV to optimize its brightness and colors on a per-scene or even per-frame basis, while the former uses one set of optimized settings for the entirety of the given content. Support for these formats can differ depending on the TV, content and game console you use. The Xbox Series X and S, for example, support <a href="https://www.dolby.com/experience/xbox/#gref">Dolby Vision for gaming</a>, while the PS5 does not.</p><p>The good news is that most TVs you’d buy in 2023 are HDR-ready in some fashion, even on the budget end of the market. The catch is that some TVs are much better at getting the most out of HDR than others. The same goes for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-26-disney-the-mandalorian-hdr-quality.html">actual content</a> mastered in HDR. With video games in particular, there aren’t as many games designed to take advantage of HDR as there are movies (though the number is growing), and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-31-red-dead-redemption-2-not-true-hdr.html">variance in quality</a> tends <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-105-015615945.html">to be wider</a>.</p><h3>HGiG — HDR Gaming Interest Group</h3><p>HGiG stands for the <a href="https://www.hgig.org/">HDR Gaming Interest Group</a>. Sony and Microsoft are both members, as are many TV makers and game developers. What this means is that, ideally, all the groups communicate information so that you can start up a new game on a console or PC and have it automatically recognize your display. Once that happens, the game can adjust the internal settings to adjust for that display's capabilities and give you the best picture quality possible, without losing details in the brightest or darkest areas of the screen. For example, daylight at the end of a dark tunnel may portray a brightly lit environment instead of looking like an overexposed white blob.</p><p>This is a good thing, but the reality is a bit more complicated. Not all TVs highlight HGiG compatibility in their settings menu, while only some PlayStation and Xbox games recognize and follow the guidelines. If an HGiG option is listed in your TV's tone mapping settings, you should turn it on prior to running the console's HDR settings. Then, if you're playing a game that supports HDR and HGiG, you should be in good shape without having to adjust the various luminance levels again. Still, how all of this looks to <em>you</em> might differ depending on your TV and the game you’re playing. Owners of certain LG OLED models, for instance, may prefer their TV’s Dynamic Tone Mapping setting. Use whatever settings you think look best.</p><h3>ALLM — Auto Low Latency Mode</h3><p><a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec21sub/autolowlatencymode">ALLM</a> allows a source (like your PS5 or Xbox) to tell the display to switch into a mode that reduces lag between receiving each frame of an image and displaying it on the TV. This cuts out additional processing that could be the milliseconds of difference between landing a precise input or not. A good modern TV can automatically switch to game mode, then back out when you'd rather watch a movie or TV show.</p><h3>VRR — Variable Refresh Rate</h3><p><a href="https://www.hdmi.org/spec21sub/variablerefreshrate">VRR</a> is a familiar feature to PC gamers, but it’s still relatively new for most TVs. Most gamers have experienced slowdown, screen tearing or stutters that can happen as your system struggles to render each frame at the target speed, which is usually 30 or 60 fps on a TV. If the game stutters, then the TV either stays on the same frame or displays part of two different ones, which is the visual artifact of tearing.</p><p>With VRR, however, everything stays in sync — your display won't show the next frame until it's ready, which can make things feel smoother and more responsive, even if the system fails to deliver on its target of 30, 60 or even 120 fps.</p><p>There are a few different implementations of VRR available, including <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f52348f6-2304-415e-b16c-1fb252794066&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NVIDIA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmNTIzNDhmNi0yMzA0LTQxNWUtYjE2Yy0xZmIyNTI3OTQwNjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnZpZGlhLmNvbS9lbi11cy9nZWZvcmNlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2ctc3luYy1tb25pdG9ycy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY1ODQzYTUwLTFjMTEtNDllZS1iZjg2LTJmYTVkNDIxOTQ0MCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAW-0GsAVE8eGkzSggX3VcDBHrBy1gmYQ4YocWtXb-8wc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fproducts%2Fg-sync-monitors%2F">Nvidia’s G-Sync, </a><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/free-sync">AMD’s FreeSync</a> and the HDMI Forum’s VRR spec, which is part of the full HDMI 2.1 standard. Both a TV and an input device need to support the same VRR tech for it to work, and different devices may only support VRR within a specific refresh rate window. On a 120Hz display, for instance, the PS5’s VRR only works between 48Hz and 120Hz.</p><p>As a reminder, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-variable-refresh-rate-vrr-release-date-193228613.html">PS5 supports</a> HDMI Forum VRR, the Xbox Series X/S support HDMI Forum VRR and FreeSync, while gaming PCs may support G-Sync or FreeSync depending on whether they use a Nvidia or AMD graphics card. An ideal gaming TV supports all the big VRR formats, but missing, say, G-Sync, isn’t a killer if you only game on a PS5 or Xbox.</p><h2>The best gaming TVs you can get right now</h2><p>We’re updating this guide during a transitional period for the TV market. The major brands have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-bets-on-micro-led-and-8-k-for-its-premium-2023-t-vs-030033433.html">largely announced</a> their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-2023-bravia-xr-tv-hands-on-bigger-brighter-and-even-better-looking-150030819.html">TV lineups</a> for 2023, but most aren’t available to buy yet. When the new sets do arrive, their prices <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lgs-2023-oled-tvs-arrive-in-late-march-starting-at-1299-175513466.html">will be higher</a> out of the gate than last year’s models, which manufacturers often sell for less now to clear out inventory. Since some of those 2022 TVs are still excellent, they can offer strong value while they’re still available at a discount, particularly if their successors only wind up being iterative upgrades.</p><p>All of this is to say that, if you can wait for prices on 2023’s TVs to come down, or if you don’t care about paying more for the latest and greatest set, it’s best to hold off and see how this year’s models stack up. However, if you can’t wait for a new TV, a good set from <em>last year</em> should provide the most bang for your buck as of this writing.

## A free-to-play 'Persona 5' mobile game is on its way

<p>A new group of Phantom Thieves will be stealing hearts in Tokyo. Black Wings Game Studio, the developer owned by Chinese company Perfect World Games, has <a href="https://p5x.wanmei.com/news/gamenews/20230314/242680.html">unveiled</a> a <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/news/persona-5-phantom-of-the-night-p5x-mobile-game-revealed-for-ios-android-2609693/">new mobile game</a> set in the <em>Persona 5</em> universe. The previous spinoffs of the title, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/persona-5-strikers-release-date-west-february-23-2021-150035263.html"><em>Persona 5 Strikers</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-28-persona-3-dancing-in-moonlight-friendships.html"><em>Dancing in Starlight</em></a>, feature the original gang, but this one comes with a brand new cast of characters. While it wasn't created by Atlus itself, <em>Persona: Phantom of the Night</em> (or <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, shortened as <em>P5X</em>) had SEGA's blessing. It was also developed under the supervision of P-Studio, the team behind the mainline <em>Persona</em> games.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, its trailers show us a red-haired protagonist who's juggling high school life and Metaverse thievery, a brown-haired girl reminiscent of <em>P4</em>'s Chie and a talking owl who, like Morgana, can transform into a getaway vehicle. The developer has also released character artwork for another female character with long black hair and another for Igor's new assistant in the Velvet Room.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0919ee17924049fb9a290aff13190d79"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>According to the game's announcement, franchise character designer Shigenori Soejima created the game's protagonist and exclusive Persona. And if you watch the trailer below, you'll see that Black Wings was able to capture the look and feel of the original <em>Persona 5</em> game quite well. It uses the same gameplay and battle effects, and it features the same victory close-ups, as well as the popular <em>P5</em> battle soundtrack <em>Wake Up, Get up, Get Out There</em>.</p><p>Unlike the original<em> Persona 5</em> game, P5X will be free to play, which means it will have in-app purchases. It will be available to beta testers on Android, iOS and Windows (as a port) starting on March 29th, but only in China. The developer has yet to announce if it will be released outside the region.&nbsp;</p><div id="01714bf658c04ad594ce8770ce5f712d"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/free-to-play-persona-5-mobile-game-114009191.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: TikTok's parent company reportedly under FBI investigation

<p>In December, ByteDance confirmed it fired four employees who used TikTok to spy on the locations of two journalists. Now, <em>Forbes </em>reports the FBI and the Department of Justice have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-is-reportedly-under-investigation-for-surveillance-of-us-journalists-224223010.html">investigating</a> the incident. This investigation couldn’t come at a worse time, as ByteDance faces mounting pressure to sell its stake in TikTok.</p><p>Critics in Congress have previously raised questions about the app’s surveillance tactics, particularly in light of ByteDance’s acknowledgment that employees had inappropriately accessed US user data. &quot;We have strongly condemned the actions of the individuals found to have been involved, and they are no longer employed at ByteDance,” a spokesperson said. “Our internal investigation is still ongoing, and we will cooperate with any official investigations when brought to us.&quot;</p><p>The incident late last year involved employees accessing the data of several TikTok users in the US, including journalists, to locate the sources of leaks. <em>Forbes </em>reported ByteDance tracked three of its reporters who previously worked for <em>BuzzFeed News</em>. These publications have all run reports on TikTok, with many focusing on alleged ties to the Chinese government.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

However, the remake loses focus quickly, and it feels like much of Capcom’s effort was poured into upgrading enemies and environments. The <em>RE4</em> remake introduces new boss fights and also allows Leon to parry powerful attacks. Sometimes. When the prompt does pop up, it’s easily interrupted by environmental nudges, the actions of other enemies and Leon’s own animations. Like most of Leon’s movements, the parry ability is simply too inconsistent to be satisfying.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-4-review-a-half-step-backward-for-capcom-remakes-070100973.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/valves-steam-deck-is-on-sale-for-the-first-time-185156337.html">Valve's Steam Deck is on sale for the first time</a></h2><h3>A 10 percent discount coincides with the Steam spring sale.</h3><h3></h3><p>Valve's terrific portable gaming system is on sale for the first time.

## The 20-year-old metaverse game 'Second Life' is getting a mobile app

<p>Nearly two decades before Facebook and others were talking about the metaverse, <em>Second Life</em> was letting millions of users partake in virtual worlds. Now, all this time later, developer Linden Labs has announced that it's developing a mobile version of the game, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/20-years-later-second-life-is-launching-on-mobile/?comments=1&amp;comments-page=1"><em>Ars Technica</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>has reported. A beta version is expected to launch later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>In a YouTube video posted to <em>Second Life</em>'s community forum, the publisher detailed some details about the mobile app. It's being built using Unity, mainly so it'll be easy to build and distribute the game on both iOS and Android phones/tablets. It also shows some footage of characters and environments, and how Linden Labs will try to make it as much like the desktop game as possible.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="5ca676c148424e478d3f97be99f1affe"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Facebook has struggled to get the metaverse off the ground, but over 73 million accounts have been created for <em>Second Life</em> to date, and the number of active users hit 900,000 during the pandemic — 17 years after the game launched. Typical virtual events include &quot;live music performances, shopping fairs, fan fiction conventions, book and poetry readings, academic lectures, fashion shows, and art exhibitions,&quot; the company told <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4aydzg/virtual-reality-is-going-to-change-live-events-culture-forever"><em>Vice</em></a> in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Linden Labs had been working on a VR version of the game called Sansar, but ended up stopping development and selling off the rights in 2020. The company said it did so to become &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-27-why-second-life-linden-lab-sold-sansar.html">cash-positive</a>,&quot; while noting that VR headset adoption didn't come as fast as it hoped. To that end, a pivot to mobile makes sense, but it remains to be seen if people will still be interested in <em>Second Life</em> after all this time.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-20-year-old-metaverse-game-second-life-is-getting-a-mobile-app-110254437.html?src=rss

All of those things make the 2022 iPad Air future-proof and helped it garner a top-notch 90 score in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-5th-generation-review-130019050.html">Engadget review</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It has more than speed going for it. You get a 10.9-inch liquid Retina LCD display with Apple’s True Tone feature for optimizing the screen’s color temperature based on ambient light, to start with.

## Amazon no longer sells print and Kindle magazines

<p>You can no longer buy either print or Kindle Newsstand magazine and newspaper subscriptions from Amazon, as the company appears to implement yet another cost-cutting measure. The e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/arp/B0BWPTCP4K?deviceType=A1FG5NAKX0MRJL&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]23407776[m]social[s]twitter[t]w[c]theverge[r]https://trello.com/[d]D">announced</a> that it was halting Newsstand subscriptions on March 9th (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/16/23643735/amazon-kindle-newsstand-print-magazine-newspaper-subscriptions-ending"><em>The Verge</em></a>) and that the change was going to take effect that very day. If you have an annual subscription, it will not be renewed, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>You can continue managing your subscriptions — such as changing your delivery address — through Amazon until June 5th at 11:59PM PST. But after that, you'd have to get in touch with the publisher for any inquiry. Finally, Amazon will only be sending you the latest issues for your magazines and newspapers until September 4th. The good news is that you'll still be able to access all the digital issues that have already been delivered, and Amazon will send you a pro-rated refund for any undelivered issue.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a statement, Amazon spokesperson Julia Lee told <em>The Verge</em> that the company looks at each of its businesses to see what it should change as part of its annual operating planning review process. Lee explained: &quot;Following an assessment of our magazine and newspaper subscriptions and single-issue sales, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue these services. We don't take these decisions lightly and are winding down these offerings in a phased manner over several months. We will continue to support customers, sellers and publishers during that time.&quot;</p><p>Based on Lee's statement, the company wasn't making money from subscriptions, and they likely became a casualty that could be attributed to its cost-cutting efforts. Back in January, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html">expanded</a> its planned job cuts to cover 18,000 roles in the company after hiring thousands of new people to keep up with the heightened demand during the previous years' COVID lockdowns. Amazon also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-freezes-construction-of-second-headquarters-in-virginia-amid-job-cuts-173755605.html">paused construction</a> on its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-shutting-down-eight-cashierless-go-stores-100102563.html">shut down</a> several cashierless Go stores over the past few months.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to keep receiving the newest issues of your magazines and newspapers, you'll have to look at alternative subscription options from their publishers. Some of them, however, will still be available as part of Amazon's Kindle Unlimited service.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-no-longer-sells-print-kindle-magazines-092833960.html?src=rss

## Bandcamp's workers are forming a union

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/bandcamp-buy-music-again-2020-120043639.html">Bandcamp</a> has always been known as an artist-friendly alternative to streaming services like Spotify, where you can buy music directly from the musicians themselves. Now, workers at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-acquires-bandcamp-173446180.html">Epic-owned</a> online audio distributor want to ensure that they're treated as well as its creators by forming a union called Bandcamp United. According to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bandcamp-union-1234695308/"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/16/employees-at-epic-owned-bandcamp-form-union/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, a majority of workers are in favor of unionizing, and all 62 of its non-managerial and non-supervisory personnel in the US will make up its bargaining unit. Those 62 workers are composed of support staff, designers, engineers, writers and other roles within the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, Bandcamp's personnel have been quietly working on their organizing efforts since last summer. They ultimately decided to join Tech Workers Union Local 1010 of the Office and Professional Employees International Union, which is the same group that helped full-time <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006">Kickstarter employees organize</a> back in 2020. Based on the mission statement written on <a href="https://www.bandcampunited.org/">Bandcamp United's website</a>, the group aims to fix pay disparities and promote &quot;equitable conditions and economic stability.&quot; They want to make sure workers have access to paid time off and that their salaries &quot;will grow to meet economic necessity.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Rolling Stone</em> says they're also looking to address management's lack of transparency after Epic's takeover last year. Workers were reportedly asked to sign new employment contracts when the <em>Fortnite</em> developer acquired the platform, and they were given a limited amount of time to review its terms with no room for negotiations.&nbsp;</p><p>Ethan Diamond, Bandcamp's CEO, told the publications that management is &quot;aware that some... employees are seeking to organize a union and [is] reviewing the petition to understand their concerns.&quot; Bandcamp United has already filed for a petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to administer a union election and will hold one to make things official once it gets approved.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bandcamp-workers-forming-a-union-075803951.html?src=rss

## 'Resident Evil 4' review: A half-step backward for Capcom remakes

<p>The <em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake starts out strong. Updated aiming mechanics and a fresh infusion of processing power make this the most exciting version of <em>RE4 </em>Capcom has ever delivered, and Leon Kennedy looks better than ever, even with his new chin implant. The remake performs well for the first few hours, as Leon shoots and stabs his way through the misty Spanish village where<em> las plagas</em> has transformed the locals into murderous tentacle monsters. These early scenes, set among crooked wooden buildings and the shores of a twisting cave system, establish the game’s blood-soaked tone and provide a satisfying balance of asset management, puzzle solving and modern third-person shooting.</p><p>As the game grows in complexity, it becomes clumsy. Capcom’s approach to modernizing <em>RE4 </em>is to add more enemies, cramped environments and fewer ammo drops – all of which <em>could </em>result in a high-tension action experience, if its controls were consistent. As it stands, the <em>RE4 </em>remake is plagued by sluggish animations and frustrating combat sequences. Leon constantly feels underpowered, unable to evade basic attacks or reliably land a shot.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7e91846685034df395feb6b5c650d840"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p><em>Resident Evil 4</em> set the standard for action-horror games when it came out in 2005, and the remake shines when it embraces the innovations of the original: over-the-shoulder precision shooting and an atmosphere blending combat and terror. However, the remake loses focus quickly, and it feels like much of Capcom’s effort was poured into upgrading enemies and environments, leaving Leon in the GameCube-era dust.</p><p>The <em>RE4 </em>remake introduces new boss fights and head-bursting enemies, and it also allows Leon to parry powerful attacks. Sometimes. The parry ability is only available if Leon has a knife on standby, and when the prompt does pop up, it’s easily interrupted by environmental nudges, the actions of other enemies, and Leon’s own animations. Like most of Leon’s movements, the parry ability is simply too inconsistent to be satisfying, and it generally does nothing to heighten the tension of combat scenes.</p><p>The remake often places Leon at the center of a swarm of enemies, without the option to quickly dodge incoming attacks. He has to shoot or press his way through the horde – but he runs as if he’s knee-deep in sludge, and even a bullet to the head doesn’t always stop a rushing cultist. Meanwhile, enemy attacks <em>always </em>interrupt Leon. Sluggish movement is authentic to the experience of the original four Resident Evil games, and it’s something that the <em>RE2</em> and <em>RE3 </em>remakes specifically address, offering updated controls and environments that feel at home on modern hardware. In comparison to those games, <em>RE4 </em>feels unfinished, or at least un-finessed.</p><figure><img alt="Ashley and Leon flee an explosion on the turret of a castle in Resident Evil 4." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/0f15bd10-c464-11ed-beee-16dc498684d2" style="height: 2160; width: 3840;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Capcom</div></figure><p>One boss fight that Capcom reimagined for the remake is against Méndez, the mutant priest with the extra long spine. In the original, Méndez slings a repetitive series of attacks from the rafters of a burning slaughterhouse. In the remake, Méndez drops back to hurl flaming logs and explosive oil drums at Leon, before rushing forward for close-quarters fighting and alternating these positions a few times. Even though the environment in the remake is larger, it’s cramped with flames that interrupt Leon’s actions any time he touches them. Méndez moves quickly and so do the objects he throws, while Leon has a sluggish run ability, no way to quickly dodge, and lethargic animations for reloading, retrieving items, touching fire and knifing enemies. Méndez seems like a fully remade character here; Leon, not so much. This results in a frustrating boss fight.</p><p>I died a few times while trying to defeat Méndez – and that’s when Capcom pranked me. I was playing on Standard, and during my Méndez death screens, the game started prompting me to turn on Assisted mode, the lowest difficulty setting. I generally don’t do this during reviews, but a dozen infuriating attempts later and I relented, pressing OK without reading the fine print. Assisted mode makes the game incredibly forgiving, and I easily defeated Méndez in the following run.</p><p>And then I was unable to change my difficulty settings at all. Keep this in mind: Assisted mode is permanent in <em>RE4</em>.</p><p>I played a few more minutes on the lowest difficulty setting, but it truly felt like a different game than the Standard version, devoid of tension or risk. Luckily, I was on PlayStation 5, which only syncs cloud saves when you exit a game. I turned off the console’s internet connection, closed the game and then downloaded the old save file from before I switched settings. Then I defeated Méndez the old-fashioned way, on Standard difficulty, and carried on with a newfound fear of accidentally switching to Assisted mode in my soul.</p><p>Permanent downward mode-switching is a standard feature in Resident Evil games, but I find it to be baffling. It’s especially confusing as <em>RE4 </em>actively encourages Standard players to try Assisted mode in loading screens and death menus. I asked Capcom why the team designed <em>RE4</em> this way, and a spokesperson said, “The difficulty mode a player completes the game on has ramifications for in-game achievements and trophies.” This doesn’t fully answer the question for me: Plenty of action games have dynamic difficulty settings without disrupting achievements, and this response doesn’t address my perception that Capcom is prioritizing trophy integrity over accessibility.</p><figure><img alt="Resident Evil 4 remake" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/0f15bd12-c464-11ed-9ebc-114f91de39d7" style="height: 2160; width: 3840;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Capcom</div></figure><p>While we’re in the complaints department, I also want to encourage all PS5 players to turn off controller sounds in the audio settings. This goes for <em>RE4 </em>and literally every other game with this feature. Why is the volume on the DualSense so loud, all the time? Please, someone, make it stop.</p><p>This is what the <em>RE4 </em>remake has reduced me to: a pleading mess of unfulfilled nostalgia and frustration. It’s not a terrible game, but it isn’t seamless, either. It adds enemy variety and fresh environments, but Leon’s bullets routinely hit their targets without dealing damage, his movements are clumsy and his new parry ability is only semi-functional. The game clearly establishes combat strategies for each scene, but then its mechanics get in the way, punishing the player in the process. Overall, the word for the <em>RE4 </em>remake is <em>inconsistent</em>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-4-review-a-half-step-backward-for-capcom-remakes-070100973.html?src=rss

## Qualcomm's Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 will debut in mid-range phones this month

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/qualcomm/"><ins>Qualcomm</ins></a> has unveiled its latest chipset that will power a wealth of mid-range phones starting later this month. Redmi and Realme are among the brands that will use the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 chipset.</p><p>As you might expect, the chipset isn't quite as powerful as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapdragon-8-gen-2-isim-support-150031144.html"><ins>Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</ins></a>, but it appears to offer a notable upgrade over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-120047819.html"><ins>Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</ins></a>. Qualcomm says the CPU will deliver a performance improvement of over 50 percent, with speeds of up to 2.91GHz. The company claims the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 will offer improvements in GPU performance (by two times) and power efficiency (by 13 percent) as well. Moreover, Qualcomm says that &quot;on-device AI is integrated across the entire platform.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can expect over twice the AI performance compared with the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 and 40 percent better per-watt performance, Qualcomm says. AI Super Resolution is said to be capable of upscaling game visuals and photos from 1080p to 4K resolution.</p><p>Other gaming features include volumetric rendering, which adds particle graphics such as fog and smoke. Auto variable rate shading should help to boost performance and power by rendering content that's in focus at full resolution and limiting the background of a scene to a lower resolution, according to Qualcomm. The company claims that Snapdragon Sound with Qualcomm aptX will deliver lossless music streaming and lag-free gaming audio too.</p><p>The chipset supports photo captures up to 200MP, along with HDR video capture with triple exposure from two cameras at the same time. Thanks to 18-bit Triple ISP support, it could be easier to capture better images in very low light. Qualcomm says devices using the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 can capture 30 images and blend the best parts of them into a single shot to provide you with brighter, clearer and more colorful photos.</p><p>On the connectivity front, there's support for 4G and 5G dual SIMs, along with download speeds of up to 4.4 Gbps over a data network thanks to the new X62 5G modem. As for WiFi, Qualcomm says the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 will enable download speeds of up to 3.6 Gbps.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/qualcomms-snapdragon-7-gen-2-will-debut-in-mid-range-phones-this-month-060023883.html?src=rss

<p>IKEA's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-may-release-a-spotify-enabled-vappeby-speaker-that-doubles-as-a-lamp-121658421.html">Vappeby</a> lineup continues to grow with a new waterproof Bluetooth speaker designed for the shower and priced at just $15 — undercutting all but the cheapest no-name devices. &quot;The fundamental goal with the new product was to offer quality sound in a versatile product that can really be used anywhere,&quot; said product design developer Stjepan Begic in a <a href="https://about.ikea.com/en/newsroom/2023/03/16/ikea-expands-the-vappeby-range-with-a-new-waterproof-speaker">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It's silicone-coated and just three inches square by two inches thick. It comes with a lanyard-style cord, so you can easily hang one in the shower or carry it around. It comes in yellow, black or red and can be used as a stereo pair if you splurge another $15 for a second one. They offer a surprising 80 hours of battery life at 50 percent volume, and are IP67 rated for water and dust resistance.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>IKEA launched its Vappeby lineup with an outdoor LED lamp that doubles as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ike-as-latest-bluetooth-speaker-doubles-as-an-outdoor-led-lamp-120025062.html">Spotify-enabled Bluetooth speaker</a>. That model has an IP65 dust and splash rating and delivers 360 sound. The Swedish retail giant also offers the Symfonisk lineup of Sonos speakers, with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-ikea-symfonisk-review.html">bookshelf speaker, </a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-floor-lamp-120050988.html">floor lamp/speaker</a> and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-floor-lamp-120050988.html">wall art/speaker</a> combo.&nbsp;</p><p>The only thing lacking on the new Vappeby waterproof model is a USB-C charger, but you probably have a few of those lying around. Given the ridiculously low price, shower-friendly design and crazy-long battery life, they should fly off the shelves — though I wouldn't expect great sound quality. It's set to arrive in April for $15.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ikea-just-launched-a-15-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker-051134013.html?src=rss
