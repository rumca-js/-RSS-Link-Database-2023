"<p><strong>Bernard B Jacobs Theatre, New York</strong></p><p>The Broadway transfer of the first major New York revival for the 1998 musical features luminous turns from Ben Platt and Micaela Diamond</p><p>Parade, the 1998 Broadway musical now undergoing its first New York revival, is not an uplifting show. The book by Alfred Uhry (author of Driving Miss Daisy), with music and lyrics from Jason Robert Brown, tells the ill-fated story of Leo Frank, a New York Jewish transplant to Atlanta falsely scapegoated for the murder of a 13-year-old white girl at his pencil factory in 1913; the wave of antisemitism that led to his conviction and lynching two years later spurred both the formation of the Anti-Defamation League and the resurgence of the KKK. The show doesn\u2019t obscure the tragic facts of the case \u2013 those attending the new production, which just transferred to the Bernard B Jacobs Theatre after a lauded run at New York City Center, will take their seats to a photo projection of the \u201cLeo Frank lynching\u201d memorial plaque in Marietta, Georgia.</p><p>With the fates established from the jump, it\u2019s remarkable that Parade feels as dynamic and moving as it does. That\u2019s in large part thanks to Brown\u2019s Tony-winning score and orchestrations \u2013 music director and conductor Tom Murray\u2019s version is lush and chill-inducing from the jump \u2013 and a top-to-bottom slate of excellent vocal performances, particularly from leads Ben Platt and Micaela Diamond.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/16/parade-broadway-musical-review-ben-platt-micaela-diamond\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/16/parade-broadway-musical-review-ben-platt-micaela-diamond", "date_published": "2023-03-17 02:00:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
