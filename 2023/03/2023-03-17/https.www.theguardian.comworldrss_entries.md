<p>Deputy PM says offer on the table for junior doctors</p><p>Good morning. Yesterday the government and unions representing health workers, including nurses, announced they had reached a new deal on pay. It involves compromises on both sides – the government has improved the pay offer for the current financial yeart, which it had ruled out; the RCN demand for RPI inflation plus 5% is a distant memory – but there seems a good chance that it could end the strikes by workers like ambulance staff and nurses in England. Here is our story by <strong>Heather Stewart </strong>and<strong> Anna Bawden.</strong></p><p>But the negotiations did not included junior doctors – the specialists below consultant level who keep hospitals functioning, and who have also been on strike over pay. This morning <strong>Dominic Raab</strong>, the deputy PM and justice secretary, was giving interviews and he confirmed to the Today programme that a similar offer was on the table for junior doctors, and that he hoped they would resume talks too. He said:</p><p>A similar offer is on the table [for junior doctors]. I think it would be good for BMA [which represents junior doctors] to meet with the health secretary, as he’s offered. And I hope that we can resolve that issue as well.</p><p>Our position has been that we are open to talk in good faith, meaningfully, at any time.</p><p>We were ready to talk months ago.
