Bob's Burgers is a near perfect show just on it's own.  The Belcher family is not your typical animated sitcom family.  They operate fully out of love and admiration of each other, even when things seem to work against them.  But this episode of Bobs Burgers showcases the Belcher family at their craziest and most wholesome.
