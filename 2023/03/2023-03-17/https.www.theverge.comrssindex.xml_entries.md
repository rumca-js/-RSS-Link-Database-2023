  <p id="C2DrMX">Growing up, I learned <em>The Way Things Work</em> from author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Macaulay">David Macaulay</a>’s incredible illustrated books. This week, I was surprised to see Macaulay’s endorsement in my inbox for a new illustrated explainer by a different author — but the surprise didn’t last long.</p>
<p id="KEBXHf">Fifteen minutes after I began skimming through an advance copy of <em>Hidden Systems</em>, which just came out this week, I immediately ordered the book for my kids. It looks like a fantastic way to help them conceptualize the internet, the world’s water supply, and our power grid — and get them thinking about the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22421637/infrastructure-week-broadband-hospitals-biden-plan-ev-charging">infrastructure</a> of the world they’ll someday inherit.</p>

  <p id="KoDnQl">Microsoft is trying to make it easier to share your experiences with its GPT-4-powered Bing Chat by adding a button that lets you post the AI’s response to Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest. People have already been sharing the interesting (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams">sometimes upsetting</a>) things that the chatbot has been saying via screenshots, but it seems like Microsoft is leaning into it now. Perhaps that’s a sign that it’s more confident in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/21/23608888/microsoft-bing-ai-edge-chatbot-conversation-limits">all the guardrails</a> it’s put up around the system after users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/16/23602965/microsoft-bing-ai-sydney-fury-furry-venom">pushed it to the breaking point</a>.</p>

## Someone please buy me this glass mouse pad

  <p id="Gw5yUW">Mouse pads are one thing. Mouse pads made of glass? Quite another. This, at least, is what I’m assuming based on the promotional materials for the Razer Atlas, Razer’s first glass mouse pad. “Absolute functionality and durability,” <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mouse-mats%2Frazer-atlas&amp;subid1=VergeGlassMouse031723">Razer’s website</a> proclaims. “Experience pure polished precision,” the press release demands of me.</p>

But the main idea behind a glass mouse pad, or so I gather, is that you can glide a mouse across it very, very fast. </p>

  <p id="uqpOwx">Endings are hard. That’s particularly true for serialized mystery box TV shows, ones where plentiful juicy secrets hook viewers but the answers often fail to satisfy them. Putting a final bow on a story like that is a unique challenge. That’s part of what makes <em>Servant</em>, the Apple TV Plus psychological thriller helmed by M. Night Shyamalan, so interesting. Whereas many of these shows seem like they’re making it up as they go, <em>Servant</em> had a specific ending in mind. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23549963/m-night-shyamalan-interview-servant-season-4-apple-tv-plus">As Shyamalan told me ahead of the most recent season premiere</a>, “The story wanted to be four seasons.” The show has been weird, confusing, and frequently nonsensical. But at least there has been the promise that it’ll all make some sense eventually.</p>

  <p id="WLpW6a">Regulators in the US have introduced new rules to combat the growing number of text messaging scams. Announced on Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) now requires that mobile service providers block automated text messages that are “highly likely to be illegal,” such as texts from unused, unallocated, or invalid phone numbers. This also includes blocking messages from phone numbers identified by government agencies or other organizations as not being used for texting.</p>
<p id="esINig">Automated messages, or “robotexts,” have become frustratingly common, relentlessly clogging up our phones with unwanted and often scammy promotions. It’s almost impossible to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22555521/spam-text-block-security-iphone-android">block junk texts</a> completely, and some spammers have gotten creative to stand out...</p>

Unfortunately, none of the press materials mention an international launch, so it sounds like it might be exclusive to China.</p>
<p id="LCHSlu">That’s a shame, because (from the trailers at least) this looks like a pretty faithful Persona experience. The game appears to be set in the same locations as 2016’s <em>Persona 5</em>, but revolves around a new cast of characters including protagonist Wonder, their owl sidekick Luffy, and friend...</p>

  <p id="xDTfBk">What’s better than a cool <em>Tron</em> action figure? A cool Tron action figure with your face and voice, obviously. </p>
<p id="SJ7WJY">That’s the idea behind the Tron Identity Program, a new piece of merch that Disney will be selling visitors to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/10/23548928/the-tron-lightcycle-ride-is-coming-to-disney-world-on-april-4th">Lightcycle attraction</a> that’s opening in Tomorrowland in Walt Disney World Florida on April 4th. The idea is that you get your face scanned, record six lines of dialogue, and then manually customize your character’s look with different helmets, bodies, and team colors, and you’re left with a figurine that feels truly “you.”</p>

  <p id="KzQD9s">Project Zero, Google’s team dedicated to security research, has found some big problems in the Samsung modems that power devices like the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, and some models of the Galaxy S22 and A53. <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/03/multiple-internet-to-baseband-remote-rce.html">According to its blog post</a>, a variety of Exynos modems have a series of vulnerabilities that could “allow an attacker to remotely compromise a phone at the baseband level with no user interaction” without needing much more than a victim’s phone number. And, frustratingly, it seems like Samsung is dragging its feet on fixing it.</p>
