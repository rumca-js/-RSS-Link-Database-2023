The Star Trek Episode I am reviewing in this video is "Threshold". It is a Star Trek Voyager episode. 

This is the final part of a little series I decided to do where I reviewed some of the worst episodes of Star Trek. The first one I did was The Next Generation, while this one is on Star Trek: Voyager! 

Enjoy!
