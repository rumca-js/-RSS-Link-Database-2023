There are two additional scenes to the movie once the credits begin, the first containing major hints about the future of the character of Shazam (Zachary Levi) and the end-credits scene teasing big things if DC were to go forward with a third Shazam movie.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Warning: The following contains spoilers for Shazam: Fury of the Gods. Proceed with caution.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">After Billy (Asher Angel) <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shazam-2-director-reveals-how-that-wonder-woman-cameo-came-to-be/1100-6512460/\">is revived by Wonder Woman</a> (Gal Gadot) in the final scenes of the film, the mid-credits sequence teases where Shazam might be heading in the larger DC cinematic universe. As Shazam is doing some lightning target practice, he\u2019s approached by Peacemaker's Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) and John Economos (Steve Agee) on behalf of Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) with an invite to the Justice Society.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-ending-and-post-credits-scenes-explained/1100-6512466/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-ending-and-post-credits-scenes-explained/1100-6512466/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-17 22:24:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Bungie Outlines Upcoming Trials of Osiris, Iron Banner Changes", "description": "<p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab_03_16_2023\">Bungie developer blog</a> outlines events coming to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/\">Destiny 2</a>, including Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trials-of-osiris-rewards-this-week-in-destiny-2-march-17-21/1100-6512436/\">Trials of Osiris</a> returns from hiatus on Friday and resets on Tuesday, March 21.

New Trials of Osiris rewards include:</p><ul><li>The Immortal, a brand new 750 RPM Strand Legendary Submachine Gun that utilizes perks like Rangefinder and Killing Wind.</li><li>Astral Horizon, a Kinetic Aggressive Frame Shotgun. This weapon returns with the Slideshot, Surplus, and Opening Shot perks.

In the world of games, he also played Commander Zavala, the stalwart leader of The Last City and its Guardians in Destiny. Zavala has, over the years, grown from a by-the-by commander into a fixture of the game, a fan-favorite character, and a sort of father figure to many, due in no small part to Reddick's incredible performance, which has seen the character through momentous personal highs and lows.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-players-paying-tribute-to-lance-reddicks-commander-zavala-in-game/1100-6512463/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-players-paying-tribute-to-lance-reddicks-commander-zavala-in-game/1100-6512463/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-17 20:43:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Super Meat Boy Spin-Off Puzzle Game Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine Announced", "description": "<p>Thunderful, Headup, and Team Meat have announced Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine, a spin-off game that takes place within the Super Meat Boy universe.

It was a movie packed full of humor and hijinks, and even a cameo to link it to the rest of the universe--Superman appeared, though we never saw his face and it was not Henry Cavill in the suit. Now, with <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shazam-2-fury-of-the-gods-review-the-shazamily-lair-is-too-crowded/1900-6418046/\">Shazam: Fury of the Gods</a> in theaters, director David F. Sandberg has taken it a step further by bringing one of the stars of Justice League into the fold.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The inclusion of Wonder Woman in Shazam 2 was spoiled early by Warner Bros. and DC Studios, due to the character being featured in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhQQiWGkcD4\">one of the movie's trailers</a>. Unlike the first Shazam film, though, the actor known for portraying the role actually shows up. That's right, though a third Wonder Woman movie is no longer in the works, Gal Gadot suited up one last time for Shazam: Fury of the Gods in a pretty fantastic cameo.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As Sandberg tells GameSpot, Wonder Woman was always planned to appear in the film, much like Superman in the first Shazam--a cameo that ultimately fell apart.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shazam-2-director-reveals-how-that-wonder-woman-cameo-came-to-be/1100-6512460/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shazam-2-director-reveals-how-that-wonder-woman-cameo-came-to-be/1100-6512460/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-17 20:02:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "These Video Game Locations Are In Desperate Need Of A Powerwash", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091996-rapture.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">PowerWash Simulator is one of those games that we definitely didn't think we needed until we tried it. A game that replicates the chore of thoroughly cleaning with pressurized liquid, PowerWash Simulator is an incredibly relaxing and satisfying experience. Methodically removing the grime from things to make them look brand-new again is a whole lot of fun whether you're playing on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or PC.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The base game already has enough PowerWashing-joy to transfix players for many zen-like sessions, but publisher Square Enix has also released two official crossovers this year that take PowerWashing aficionados to locations in Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy VII Remake. The latter released earlier this month and contains five levels set in Midgar. Meanwhile, the Tomb Raider update lets players clean Croft Manor, the obstacle course from Tomb Raider III, and more. her Both DLCs are available for free to existing owners of the game, and <span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0?icid=CNavAllXboxGamePassUltimate\">Xbox Game Pass subscribers</a> </span> can find PowerWash Simulator on Xbox and PC.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Is this the start of a new metaverse, in which players can visit famous video game locations that are in dire need of some liquid-based physical therapy so that they can shine once again? The answer is a definite we hope so, and if developer FuturLab wants to strike while the pressure-washer iron is hot, we've got a few ideas of where it can point it tools next. While most gaming locations are surprisingly sterile, the last couple of years have seen developers embrace the filth, utilizing advanced rendering technologies to create biomes that look like they've been on the receiving end of a muck tsunami.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We've rounded up some video game locales that are in desperate need of a nice powerwash.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arkham Asylum (Batman Arkham Trilogy)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091976-arkham-asylum.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Sure, some parts of the factory that churns out colorful inmates for Batman to justice-punch might be reassuringly sterile, but the rest of Arkham Asylum is a dank and dingy collection of corridors leading to jail cells caked in oddly specific graffiti and what we're hoping is raspberry jam on the walls. You're probably going to want to charge double for Clayface's cell alone.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Baker House (Resident Evil 7)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091977-residentevilvii.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Can a flamethrower double as a pressure-washing tool? The jury is out on that one, but when you've got a creepy home that looks like a nightmare hybrid between a landfill and an abattoir, you're going to need more than just some strong detergent to mop up those trouble spots. Just remember, you'll probably want to save your strongest detergent--and a bucket to heave into--for the kitchen.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Great Mighty Poo\u2019s lair (Conker\u2019s Bad Fur Day)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091978-conker%27sbadfurdaygreatmightypoo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It's a crap job, but someone has to do it. Between gigantic pieces of corn and a river of singing fecal matter, you'll be very happy to be decked out in a hazmat suit that <em>hopefully </em>keeps the smell out.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Great Deku Tree  (The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091979-thegreatdekutree.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Not to be confused with the My Hero Academia fandom, the Great Deku tree is home to something far worse than bioweapon viscera and sentient poop: spiders, scores of them in fact, who have constructed a great big nest inside the ancient sage. Sure, that curse is also bad and you'll probably need to switch from a high-pressure hose to a proton pack to cleanse the tree of it, but spiders, <em>man</em>.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Night City (Cyberpunk 2077)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091980-cyberpunk2077.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Night City is a dangerous metropolis, and between rampant littering, cyber-baddies roaming the street, and people being treated as disposable pieces of meat to mutilate, there's more than enough grime and blood needing to be power-washed off of these neon-lit streets. <em>Especially </em>on Jig Jig street. Wake up samurai, we've got a city to clean.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Rhulk\u2019s Pyramid ship (Destiny 2: The Witch Queen)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091981-rhulk%E2%80%99spyramidship.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Okay, being stuck on an alien swamp in Mars while Scorn and Hive troops try to violently dissuade you from hanging about an ancient ship created by a primordial force of cosmic nature will make you think twice about tackling this job. But as most PowerWash Simulator fans know, the chance to attack the dust, mud, and ethereal Hive magic coating this ship will be a cathartic delight thanks to that structure having some sharp angles to clean up.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Krato\u2019s Cabin (God of War)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091982-krato%E2%80%99scabin.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Boy! This hovel, which barely qualifies as a hut, needs a good cleaning. You'll probably want to tackle this job while Kratos is out and about saving the nine realms, and keep an eye out for a few ravens bearing messages from the Midgard mauler while you choose the right nozzle to clean off Balder's blood from a nearby pile of decorative rocks that used to be a mountain.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sevastopol Station (Alien: Isolation)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091983-sevastopolstation.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Sevastopol station has a slight bug infestation, but it's one that you can easily clean up. While you're trying to avoid slipping on puddles of Xenomorph drool and avoid the nightmare fuel shape in the shadows, you might want to switch your power washer out for a flamethrower when you reach that room that's full of slimy Facehugger eggs. Just watch out for the green stuff dripping from the ceiling several decks above; it'll eat right through your suit.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Gray (Fallout: New Vegas)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091985-the_gray.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Another location where you'll need to don your thickest rad suit, The Gray has certainly seen better days. Just because the world is in a post-nuclear apocalyptic state though, it doesn't mean that this hub for the locals of New Vegas can't be cleaned up. You'll probably want to bring some special attachments for your tools when tackling Andy Scab's room though, as that ghoul earned that nickname for a very good (and gross) reason.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Iosefka\u2019s Clinic (Bloodborne)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091986-iosefka%E2%80%99sclinic.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>I hope you're not afraid of blood! The clinic isn't going to pass any medical inspections in its current state, what with all the rusty surgical tools, blood splatters, and monsters decorating the location. It's in dire need of a good cleaning, especially if Iosefka--who definitely isn't a sinister impostor with dark designs on her mind--wants to continue treating people in her operating room during the night of the hunt.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Your island in Animal Crossing after you haven't played since lockdown</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091987-tomnook.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Tom Nook is so disappointed in you right now.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Any Splatoon level after a match</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4091988-splatoon.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Nintendo's Splatoon games are heavenly for anyone looking for ink-tastic fun, and hell for the janitors who have to clean up that mess.

Blizzard Entertainment has broken the mold when it comes to a character's skill tree, as the core system from previous games is still in place.</p><p>However, since Diablo 4 is only in its beta stage, players might be more willing to test out different builds and skills. If you fall into this crowd, then you may be looking at ways to respec your character's skill tree. Luckily, this isn't a complicated process, but unlike other RPGs, it's not a free endeavor. Read below for the full scoop on how to respec your skills in the Diablo 4 beta.</p><h2>How to respec in Diablo 4</h2><p>From the moment you reach level two and unlock your first skill, you will be able to respec in Diablo 4. In order to do so, bring up your skill tree panel (Shift+S on keyboard) and you will see your current skill tree. At the bottom of the panel, you will see an option that says \"Refund All.\" This button, when clicked, will reset every single one of your skills.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-how-to-respec/1100-6512454/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-how-to-respec/1100-6512454/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-17 17:49:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Get 10 Steam Games For Just $7 This Month", "description": "<p>In the mood for a surprise?

A major change coming with the new set that longtime players will notice is the shift from yellow to silver borders, which marks the first time in the game's history that cards outside of Japan will feature silver along the edges of the cards. The silver borders offer one extra benefit, however, as any holographic cards pulled from packs will also shine around the edges.</p><p>The Pokemon ex mechanic returns from previous Pokemon TCG sets, with 12 Pokemon receiving special \"ex\" cards with more powerful abilities. A few of those ex cards are further enhanced as \"Tera Pokemon,\" which add the extra perk of not receiving any damage unless they are in the Active Pokemon slot on the battlefield.</p><p>The Pokemon TCG Scarlet and Violet expansion will be available March 31 for prices ranging from $5 for a pack of 10 cards to $60 for premium box sets. We recently opened nearly 50 packs from the new expansion--including some from the<a href=\"https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/184-85457/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-pokemon-center-elite-trainer-box-miraidon\"> Miraidon Elite Trainer Box</a>. These are our favorite cards pulled from those packs.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Koraidon ex</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113337-img_1958.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>One half of Scarlet and Violet's legendary duo, Koraidon ex packs a massive punch for only three Energy--with the caveat that it can't attack on the next turn. Thanks to its Dino Cry ability, the lack of attack isn't all that bad, as it lets you pull extra Energy cards from the discard pile while forcing the end of your turn anyway.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Miraidon ex (Regular and Gold Variant)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113338-img_1959.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>While Miraidon ex also lets you hit for over 200 damage for three Energy--and disables the attack the following turn--the fact that it lets you search for two Pokemon to put on your Bench <em>without</em> immediately ending the turn is powerful. Also, since Tandem Cry is an ability and not an attack, you can do it while Miraidon sits safely out of the Active Pokemon slot. </p><p>(Oh, and check out that gold variant. Phew!)</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Spidops ex</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113339-img_1960.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Spidops is an unexpected choice to receive the ex card treatment, as the spider Pokemon didn't seem notable during the Scarlet and Violet journey. We can't argue with its moves however, as its ability makes retreating more difficult for the opponent and adds 30 damage to its two-Energy attack at the same time. Spidops ex could be the surprising star of the set in the right hands. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Gyarados ex (Tera)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113340-img_1961.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>The only Tera Pokemon we were able to pull is the formidable Gyarados, one of the first Pokemon cards we've ever seen to require <em>five Energy</em> for a single attack. The fact that it does 360 damage if the opposing Active Pokemon has incurred any damage beforehand, however, puts that huge cost in perspective. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Great Tusk ex (Regular and Special Illustration Rare)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113341-img_1962.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Paradox Pokemon from Scarlet and Violet will also feature within the cards, with the massive mammoth Great Tusk included in the mix. Its Bedrock Breaker attack's secondary ability can be a game-changer, as Stadium cards are some of the most powerful in the game, while Gigantic Tusks is powerful but risky thanks to 50 self-inflicted damage.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Banette ex</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113342-img_1964.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Banette is the ghost with the most in this new set, as it's the lone Ghost type to receive the ex treatment. Banette ex will thrive in early turns, as its ability to shut down Item use for a single Energy can stifle an opponent with ease. Once they horde enough useless Items, Banette can swing with Poltergeist and deal 60 damage for each Trainer card--including Items--in their hand. Five Trainers in the opponent's hand will spell disaster for their Active Pokemon no matter who it is.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Toxicroak ex</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113343-img_1965.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>If we're being honest, Toxicroak ex scares the heck out of us. It's durable with 250 HP, it can search for two cards every single turn, and it can inflict a Poison status that's <em>six times more effective than usual</em>. That's effectively a one-hit KO on any Pokemon with 180 HP or less, which is more than you'd think.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Fidough (Illustration Rare)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113344-img_1966.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Fidough here doesn't have the most notable attacks or abilities, though being able to absorb 30 damage for one Energy can give it some longevity. However, look how cute the lil guy is, with his head in the window looking at the bakery's goods! Illustration rares have been a highlight since the Trainer Galleries began in the Sword and Shield era, and it seems this new set is continuing the tradition admirably.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Riolu (Illustration RarE)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113345-img_1967.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Like Fidough, Riolu's ability set isn't going to win you any games. He's a solid starting Pokemon, but with a second ability that can only be used three times, we expect he won't see a ton of play. However, the absolute destruction Riolu has caused the room around him in this picture makes us laugh every time. The \"yeah I did this, what are you going to do about it?\" look on his face is the icing on the cake. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Toedscool (Illustration Rare)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113346-img_1968.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>What happened to Tentacool in Scarlet and Violet? Older Pokemon trainers remember this creature as a blue jellyfish with a really angry evolution, but now it's pink with yellow spots and running around in the grass. It looks like if Tentacool was infected with cordyceps... The Last Of Us/Pokemon crossover confirmed?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Penny (Full Art Variant Rare)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113347-img_1969.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Trainer variants featuring the characters in full-size art have been a staple of the Pokemon TCG for years, and Scarlet and Violet have some strong entries included in the set as well. Penny here needs no introduction to those who played the games, but her ability to recoup a Basic Pokemon and everything attached to it will add an element of spontaneity to your strategy should you wish to use her in your deck.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Miriam (Special Illustration Rare)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/3/37852/4113348-img_1971.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Miriam is the school nurse of the Uva Academy that sits at the center of Paldea, and one of the featured special illustration cards for trainers in the set. Her card's power fits her profession, as the ability to shuffle five discarded Pokemon back into the deck--and then draw three cards right afterward--could be a healing salve should you find yourself fighting from behind.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-expansion-the-best-cards-we-pulled/2900-4684/", "date_published": "2023-03-17 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Resident Evil 4 Remake Review Roundup", "description": "<p>Reviews are now live for Resident Evil 4 remake, Capcom's reenvisioned version of its cult-classic survival-horror game.

It is, at best, an unfair challenge and, at worst, an impossible task. So, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel a second time, developer Capcom has doubled down on the brilliance of the original's design--elaborated on it, and finely tuned the experience. The result is a stunning remake that reminds longtime fans like me of its brilliance, while also introducing an all-new generation to a modern classic and one of the most important games of all time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you're not familiar, the premise of Resident Evil 4 is straightforward: Leon S. Kennedy, the cool and handsome rookie-cop-turned-government-agent who you may remember from his escapades in Resident Evil 2's Raccoon City, has been sent to rural Spain to track down Ashley Graham, the US President's missing daughter. Yes, it's a \"save the princess\" trope but, even 18 years later, its juxtaposition against the survival-horror genre serves as an immaculate setup for the game's over-the-top set pieces. In this case, the princess is in another castle, but it's a castle besieged by parasitic infections and mind-controlled cultists, so you'll have to blast your way from a rundown village to a military island to get her back. While the core pillars of tense, up-close-and-personal action and careful resource management remain welcomingly unchanged, improvements to character development elevate the story as a whole. Now more than ever, Capcom is aware of the tone and humor of the game after it felt accidental in the original. This time, it feels like Capcom is leaning into it, striking a considered balance between heart-pounding horror and laugh-out-loud cheese.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This time, Leon isn't <em>just</em> a cool-looking dude with swoopy hair and a sweet jacket, who says sometimes cool, sometimes corny things, and does super-cool stuff. He's more than that: Now he's a cool dude with cool hair doing cool stuff who also acts like a human being. This is a Leon who carries the trauma of the Raccoon City incident from Resident Evil 2 remake, which gives more weight to his character and serves as compelling context for his motivation to save Ashley Graham. This time around, it's not just another assignment for Leon--it's a chance at redemption for the lives he couldn't save in Raccoon City. This narrative continuity is a strong thread that ties the remakes together with emotional heft, making this new era of the franchise feel stronger and more unified than the originals.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-17 07:01:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Resident Evil 4 Remake Video Review", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4113625-review_re4_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Capcom raises the bar for what a good remake is and simultaneously preserves Resident Evil 4's legacy as a genre-defining experience and one of the greatest games of all time.", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/resident-evil-4-remake-video-review/2300-6460888/", "date_published": "2023-03-17 07:01:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
