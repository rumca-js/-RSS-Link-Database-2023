What are the religious laws that God gave to the Israelites after they were freed from slavery in Egypt? Jordan and the group discuss how God wants us to stay loyal to him and not turn to other gods. He also doesn't want us to make idols or use his name in a disrespectful way. We should take one day a week to focus on him and keep it holy, setting aside our usual work. God is a jealous God and shows mercy to those who love and obey him.
