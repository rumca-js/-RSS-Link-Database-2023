## House prices are in freefall – and so is Britain’s national faith in property ownership | John Harris

But underneath it all, something much more era-defining seems to be afoot: the British public’s two secular gods are taking a battering. The NHS is not in quite the mess it was a couple of months ago, but its deep problems grind on. Meanwhile, a slightly more overlooked story is becoming hard to ignore: a crisis in our national faith in property ownership, and the decline of that strange British belief that in any normal universe, house prices will only go up.</p><p>Figures released last week showed UK house prices were falling at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/01/uk-house-prices-fall-at-fastest-annual-rate-since-2012">fastest annual rate since 2012</a>, with warnings from the financial sector that “economic headwinds look set to remain relatively strong” and property owners reportedly having to cut their asking prices by an average of £14,000. To state the blindingly obvious, high interest rates are sucking demand out of the market by restricting access to mortgages. Houses and flats, therefore, sit unsold, and hundreds of thousands of people remain stranded in the purgatory between wanting – or, as politicians say, “aspiring” – to own a home, and being able to do so.</p><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/05/house-prices-freefall-property-ownership-rent-britain">Continue reading...</a>

Hosts Steve Doocy (Mikey Day), Ainsley Earhardt (Heidi Gardner), and Brian Kilmeade (Bowen Yang) report on the $1.6bn lawsuit Dominion Voting Systems has brought against Fox News over their 2020 election conspiracy-mongering. Much like the network’s viewers, who’ve been kept in the dark about the case, the hosts don’t seem to know anything about it, with Kilmeade confusing Dominion for “the little yellow guys with the overalls” and Earhardt mistaking her boss Rupert Murdoch for convicted family killer Alex Murdaugh.</p><p>Lazy jokes about Fox News personalities’ private texts and short pop-ins from Mike Lindell (James Austin Johnson, whose impersonation of the MyPillow founder isn’t quite as good as former cast member Beck Bennet’s) and OJ Simpson (Kenan Thompson) follow, before things wrap up.

## ‘She was no submissive puppet’: how I discovered the real Karen Carpenter’s determination and drive

This year marks the 40th anniversary of lead singer Karen Carpenter’s death at the age of 32, as a result of complications from anorexia. Since then, she has been portrayed as a victim, dominated by her family and a ruthless music industry.</p><p>With my biography, I wanted to reframe Karen’s life and legacy. The fact that she was an artist at the top of her game suggested to me she was not a submissive puppet. In talking to friends, musicians and former lovers, I discovered a determined, pioneering woman with her own sense of agency. Although her brother Richard has been attributed a Svengali role as the key arranger, Karen early on was an equal driving force in the band. “She was the boss, the one in control of stagecraft and directing the musicians. She was an amazing singer and drummer – real precision work,” recalls DJ/producer Jeff Dexter, who met Karen in 1974 when the Carpenters were rehearsing their Talk of the Town show.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/05/karen-carpenter-singer-myth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The historian reveals how our lives have been shaped by environmental changes since the emergence of Homo sapiens in this sweeping, riveting study</p><p>Around 2250BC, Naram-Sin reigned supreme over a big chunk of Mesopotamia in modern Iraq – an empire known as Akkad. But then, catastrophically, came “the curse of Akkad”. Rains stopped and crops failed, leading to rampant inflation, mass starvation and political chaos. At the time, it was believed that the “curse” was Naram-Sin’s doing – he’d wronged by “defying the gods” and “losing divine favour”.</p><p>Scientists today have reached a different conclusion. Evidence suggests there was a sudden change in the climate at the time – “an evaporation event” – which caused severe drought followed by several centuries of aridity. As Peter Frankopan puts it in his masterly new book: “the collapse of the Akkadian empire has become an important and salutary example for the modern age” and “a stark warning of how mighty civilisations can fold in on themselves”, because of rapid ecological shocks. “Our world has always been one of transformation, transition and change,” he writes, and yet “the weather, climate and environmental factors have rarely been seen as a backdrop to human history, let alone as an important lens through which to view the past”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/05/the-earth-transformed-by-peter-frankopan-review-why-humans-have-always-been-under-the-weather">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Swedish director Marie Lidén’s documentary about a musician with a chronic sensitivity to electricity is desperately sad yet visually poetic</p><p>This impressionistic documentary takes us into the insulated world of William, a sufferer of a debilitating condition that has forced him to retreat from the world to a barricaded cage in a cabin, deep in a Swedish wilderness. Once a musician and master’s student, a young man who approached life with curiosity and joy, he now suffers from chronic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2015/feb/15/better-call-saul-electromagnetic-hypersensitivity-real-health-risk">electromagnetic hypersensitivity</a> – a reaction to the electronic radiation that surrounds us all in this age of digital connectivity. With his head shrouded in protective fabrics, he cuts a spectral figure that would be absurd if it wasn’t so desperately sad.</p><p>Partly shot on a hand-cranked Bolex camera, to avoid further triggering William’s illness, there’s a glitchy, fluttering quality to the film’s visuals. Film-maker Marie Lidén sidesteps the medical science around this somewhat contested disease, instead adopting a creative, dreamily poetic approach to evoking William’s lonely existence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/05/electric-malady-review-dreamlike-study-of-one-mans-debilitating-illness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Efforts to pin blame for disaster on human error rather than a failed system are set to backfire after union warnings on safety</p><p>First came the mourning, then the handover of loved ones, then the funerals. On Friday it was Athina Katsara, the young mother of a toddler, carried in a white coffin out of Katerini’s church in the first funeral of the first “angel” to meet death in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/01/greece-train-crash-an-unimaginable-tragedy-as-death-toll-likely-to-rise" title="">Greece’s worst ever train crash.</a></p><p>On SaturdayYesterday it was Iphigenia Mitska, like so many of the disaster’s 57 victims in her early 20s, to whom family and friends bade farewell. She, too, was buried in a sealed white coffin in northern Giannitsa. And then it will be others – all identified through DNA samples provided by relatives – who will be laid to rest at the end of a three-day official mourning period for the nation but only the start of profound sadness for the families involved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/05/furious-grief-and-demands-for-answers-as-greece-train-crash-funerals-begin">Continue reading...</a>
