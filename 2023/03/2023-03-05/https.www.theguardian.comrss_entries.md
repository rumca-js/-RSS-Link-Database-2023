<p>Cody Gakpo, Darwin Núñez and Mohamed Salah all scored twice in Liverpool’s 7-0 humbling of rivals Manchester United</p><p>There are few things harder in football management than the dismantling of one side and the construction of another. As Jürgen Klopp’s first Liverpool has aged, it’s been reasonable to ask <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/04/the-aura-has-gone-but-can-jurgen-klopp-summon-another-great-age-at-liverpool">whether he was equipped to build another</a>. One game, even a record victory over Manchester United, is nowhere near enough to assert that a new Liverpool is being born, but it felt a lot closer at the final whistle than it had at kick-off.</p><p>Cody Gakpo, Darwin Núñez and Mohamed Salah all scored twice but the goals were only part of it. The front three had a coherence and a zip that has been rare this season. There is clearly still work to be done. The midfield is not what it was, an awkward combination of the ageing and the developing with not much in between, but, perhaps for the first time, there is the sense that a front three of Salah, Núñez and Gakpo could represent a viable future.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/05/liverpools-front-three-show-future-may-have-arrived-in-anfield-rout">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The lack of reliable information not only weakens communities, but allows disinformation to flourish</p><p>There are probably fewer local newspapers in Britain now than at any time <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/107475/html/" title="">since the 18th century</a>. More people get local news and information – or misinformation – from <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2022/06/uk-towns-have-become-news-deserts-as-people-get-their-news-from-facebook-rather-local-papers" title="">social media</a>. A long-term decline has accelerated: more than 320 local titles <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/107659/html/#_ftnref4" title="">closed between 2009 and 2019</a> as advertising revenues fell by about 70%. The pandemic was another blow. At least as serious as these disappearances is the hollowing out of titles that have seen staffing, resources and pagination slashed, and coverage thus diminished. It is harder to quantify when court reporting is replaced by write-ups of press releases, or generic national stories topped-and-tailed with a little local colour, but it is obvious to readers.</p><p>Publications are less and less likely to be owned by proprietors with a stake in their communities, and more and more by big conglomerates prioritising the extraction of cash. More than two-thirds of UK titles are held by the <a href="https://www.mediareform.org.uk/blog/newsquests-acquisition-of-archant-more-bad-news-for-local-journalism" title="">three largest publishers</a>, leaving <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/uk-independent-community-news-sector/" title="">about 400 independents</a>. Now production costs are <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/media-audience-and-business-data/why-have-paper-prices-risen/" title="">rocketing</a> and businesses are cutting back further on advertising.

A large proportion of these are <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2015/articles/agriculture-and-climate-change" title="">generated</a> by the manure and urine produced by more than 100m cattle, pigs and chickens. To reach the target, and protect <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2022/06/whats-all-the-fuss-about-nitrogen-in-the-netherlands/" title="">biodiversity</a> in the polluted countryside, the government has announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/30/peak-polluters-last-chance-close-dutch-government" title="">plans</a> to reduce livestock numbers by a third.

<p>Readers react to the Conservative party’s attempts to discredit the civil servant after it was revealed that she was going to be Keir Starmer’s chief of staff </p><p>The appointment of Sue Gray as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/02/keir-starmer-considers-sue-gray-labour-chief-of-staff" title="">Boris Johnson allies furious as Keir Starmer hires Sue Gray as chief of staff, 2 March</a>) can be interpreted in one of three ways: 1) Her appointment makes her retrospectively unfit to conduct an inquiry into (inter alia) Boris Johnson’s behaviour; 2) What she saw in her inquiry, as a civil servant of the highest integrity, has made her keen to work with a cleaner alternative; 3) The inquiry and her appointment are unrelated.</p><p>The first interpretation, the Moggist (Jacobean) view, is interesting. Presumably it means that any minister who subsequently takes a job in the private sector with any link of any sort to his previous ministry was unfit to do their ministerial job. Maybe it even means that Lord David Frost, who became a Tory minister, was unfit to be a civil servant. It certainly means that Dido Harding, as a Tory peer, should not have been appointed to a non-partisan job as head of NHS test and trace.<br /><strong>Calum Paton</strong><br /><em>Emeritus </em><em>professor of </em><em>public </em><em>policy, Keele University</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/05/furore-over-sue-grays-labour-job-exposes-tory-hypocrisy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>MI5 has had a questionable record when it comes to sharing vital information with the police, says <strong>Richard Norton-Taylor</strong></p><p>Your account of Sir John Saunders’ report on the Manchester Arena bombing refers to a communication breakdown between MI5 and counter-terrorism police (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/02/manchester-arena-inquiry-victims-families-respond-final-report" title="">Manchester Arena inquiry: victims’ families respond to final report, 2 March</a>). We have heard before how MI5 jealously guards its secrets, with potentially dangerous consequences.</p><p>In its report on the London 7/7 bombings, parliament’s intelligence and security committee described how MI5 adopted Whitehall’s “need to know” principle when it came to sharing information with the police. In his 2017 report on that year’s attacks in London and Manchester, David Anderson, the then independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, referred to (renewed) promises of better data-sharing between MI5 and the police.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/05/when-mi5s-secrecy-endangers-our-safety">Continue reading...</a>

He took an absolutely dominant victory for Red Bull from pole to flag, in complete control at the Sakhir circuit as he put what looks to be a fearsomely competitive championship contender car through its paces with ease. He beat his teammate Sergio Pérez into second with Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso taking a superb third for Aston Martin.</p><p>Alonso’s place confirmed the form Aston have shown all weekend and that they are now very much competing among the big three teams. Indeed they looked comfortably quicker than the Mercedes for whom Lewis Hamilton and George Russell could manage only fifth and seventh respectively as their cars struggled, as they did all weekend.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/05/reigning-champion-max-verstappen-cruises-to-bahrain-grand-prix-victory">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The streamer’s first ever live comedy special saw the star cover everything from Meghan Markle to the infamous slap</p><p>In 2017, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings declared that he considered the streaming platform’s main competitor to be the human need for sleep. This mission to subsume all entertainment in existence under the big red N has now led the upstart studio to train its crosshairs on the meaty legacy target of Saturday Night Live. In hiring former SNL cast member Chris Rock to do live comedy on a Saturday night – his new standup special Selective Outrage being their first foray into non-pretaped content – Netflix has thrown down an unmistakable gauntlet, though it quickly becomes clear to anyone tuning in that there’s no revolution close at hand.</p><p>Watching 90 minutes of goofy sketches broken up by commercials doesn’t demand nearly as much of its viewership as doing the same with an uninterrupted hour of finely honed, politically charged monologuing. Where SNL has the informal atmosphere of a boozy party with friends as likely to crack up at their own antics as you are, Rock’s Baltimore set is by its nature a sit-and-listen affair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/05/chris-rock-netflix-standup-live">Continue reading...</a>

Sean Dyche, back at his old stomping ground, may also be relieved with a point after his well-organised side, leading through goals from Demarai Gray’s penalty and Abdoulaye Doucouré, succumbed to Forest’s impassioned second-half response in what was a feisty and niggly clash.

<p>Once the refuge of artist Brian O’Doherty, Casa Dipinta is an Umbrian house immersed in colour and full of history</p><p>In the ancient heart of 13th-century town of Todi in Italy lies the Casa Dipinta (the painted house), a home that became a refuge for the Irish conceptual artist Brian O’Doherty and his wife, art historian Barbara Novak, amid political turmoil in the 1970s. O’Doherty died in 2022 but his home has become a museum and tribute to the imagination, experimentation, and Celtic origins of the artist.</p><p>The couple were motivated to explore Italy and later buy the house in the wake of the Bloody Sunday killings in Derry in 1972. After those events, Todi became place where they could escape from the anger and violence engulfing Northern Ireland – a space in which to create and rest. O’Doherty, a pacifist by nature, former doctor, teacher and art critic, as well as author of nonfiction texts on art, also decided that “there would be no more” and became “Patrick Ireland” in response to the killings – an alias that symbolised his roots (although, in 2008, he decided to go back to being O’Doherty).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/05/rainbow-colours-and-mystical-symbols-bring-irish-magic-to-an-italian-home">Continue reading...</a>

No appetite.”</p><p>This has been the state of things since last summer, when I was put on new medication.

<p><strong>Hackney Empire, London</strong> <br />Eloise Lally straightforwardly tells this convoluted story of concealed identity ending in a mass poisoning</p><p>Lucrezia Borgia has a bad reputation, and that holds whether you’re talking about the historical figure or Donizetti’s 1833 opera. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/25/portrait-lucrezia-borgia-australia" title="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/25/portrait-lucrezia-borgia-australia">The woman herself </a>is fascinating: was she really the perpetrator of as many murders as she gets the blame for? As for the opera, when it first reached Paris, Victor Hugo – on whose play it was based – got an injunction to stop it being performed, so perhaps even he realised that its plot was something to blush about. Dramatically, it’s a convoluted story of concealed identity ending in a mass poisoning but with all but one of the deaths offstage; in between, there’s an elaborately set-up execution that’s easily foiled when, Bond-villain-style, the instigator simply leaves the room.</p><p><a href="http://www.eloiselally.com/" title="http://www.eloiselally.com">Eloise Lally</a>’s straightforward production doesn’t lift this quite enough, dark and atmospheric though it is in Adam Wiltshire’s sets, with their flaming torches and stained-glass windows. As a touring show it’s necessarily lean, but the lack of a chorus, and therefore of any real sense of public versus private, sometimes confuses things. The party in the final act seems to be taking place in a men’s steam room.</p><p><a href="https://www.englishtouringopera.org.uk/">Touring until 26 May</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/05/lucrezia-borgia-review-hackney-empire-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Consultation on existing system of paid-for access has raised hopes of an end to ‘discrimination’</p><p>George Orwell’s “four legs good, two legs better” has long been the case when it comes to access to England’s forests, the British Horse Society contends. But “equality” may now be in sight.

## An 11-minute walk can save you from an early death? That’s my kind of fitness regime | Emma Beddington

<p>Even an exercise refusenik like me can get behind the latest research from Cambridge University. Most days, I spend longer than that staring into the fridge</p><p>There’s (sedentary) rejoicing in my community, the pathologically lazy, at the news that only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/28/walking-11-minutes-a-day-could-stop-early-deaths">11 minutes of brisk walking a day</a> may save us from early death. Of course, multiple caveats must accompany this statement, distilled from a <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2023/01/23/bjsports-2022-105669">Cambridge University-led meta-analysis</a> of data on physical activity and heart disease. We would have to be in the lucky 10%: only one in 10 early deaths could be avoided with a brief constitutional. Exercise levels were also self-reported, meaning researchers had to make some assumptions about duration and intensity. And 11 minutes is a neatly digestible take-home from analysing 196 studies with more than 30 million participants, not a magic bullet.</p><p>We like a magic-bullet figure though, don’t we? Real-world public health messages ought to be distilled from hard science, but sometimes emerge in the absence of it; as with the persistent “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/03/watch-your-step-why-the-10000-daily-goal-is-built-on-bad-science">10,000 steps</a>” myth. The World Health Organization’s recommendation of 400g minimum of fruit and veg daily became our five-a-day article of faith, even though <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/3/1029/3039477?login=false">2017 research</a> found upping it to 10 a day could prevent 7.8m premature deaths.

## My search for women gardeners’ life stories helped me combat loneliness – and make great friends

I was lonely after lockdown and wanted to know why women gardened so wrote to those I admired. Now I have a host of new friends from different generations and backgrounds<p>This year, I dedicated the drizzly, flat little days between Christmas and New Year to having a clearout. I felt an intangible lightness with each book, old birthday card or defunct gadget that passed out of the door and into a new home. In my late teens I nurtured a habit of taking amateur snapshots on film –and it’s taken me until now to make peace with the fact that I would never actually process decade-old, under-exposed negatives into anything, and throw them away. But there was one contact sheet that made me pause – not because I wanted to preserve it, but because it directed me to a memory too poignant to remember: my 27th birthday.</p><p>The photos, in tiny thumbnail form, reminded me that we threw a party at the flat I was living in at the time and I wore a short black dress. Friends gathered on the balcony and stood in a line up to lift me up, sideways against their bodies. It should have been indistinguishable from any other contact sheet in the box – people who didn’t realise how young and beautiful they were, relationships that were no longer intact, cans on kitchen worktops. But this slip of paper brought with it a reminder of the piercing loneliness I’d felt in my 20s, something I’ve since come to realise but have rarely had to probe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/05/my-search-for-women-gardeners-life-stories-helped-me-combat-lonliness-and-make-great-friends">Continue reading...</a>

## Yazmin Lacey: Voice Notes review – songs to love and savour

<p>(Own Your Own)<strong><br /></strong>The Nottingham-based artist’s debut album delivers a seamless mix of jazz, soul and electronica</p><p><a href="https://www.yazminlacey.com/">Yazmin Lacey</a> is east London-raised but began making music from her living room after a move to Nottingham. Since 2017 she has released three EPs, and the title track of the last one, 2020’s <em>Morning Matters</em>, is a standout, saxophone-heavy ode to a new day. Her debut album, <em><a href="https://yazminlacey.bfan.link/voicenotes">Voice Notes</a></em>, produced by Dave Okumu, is an escapist, feelgood project that overflows with great storytelling. It offers introspective soliloquies, with lyrics derived from voice notes, memos and reminders journalled on her phone.</p><p>The fun and glittery Late Night People embodies the dreaming essence of the album. <a href="https://yazminlacey.bfan.link/voicenotes">Bad Company</a>, a song about a frenemy called Priscilla, is full of refreshingly real humour: “Woke with a demon on my shoulder. She’s smoking all my weed. Before we went to shoot she told me she’s much prettier than me.” The funk and psychedelic soul track Sign and Signal is an enthralling trip through layered sonics, while Lacey’s leisurely tone on Tomorrow’s Child’s dub beat shows versatility. <em>Voice Notes</em> is conceptually and musically accomplished, flourishing with inspired narratives and sensuality at every turn. It seamlessly blends jazz, soul and electronica without overpowering the singer-songwriter’s supple vocals. There’s so much to love and savour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/05/yazmin-lacey-voice-notes-review-songs-to-love-and-savour">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘In the stillness, my mind was able to wander’: how a museum guard found solace in art

<p>After a personal tragedy, Patrick Bringley swapped his glitzy magazine job to work at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. The experience was so profound, he wrote a book about it</p><p>When Patrick Bringley’s beloved older brother fell ill with cancer, he found that he no longer had much appetite for his ritzy job in the events department of the <em>New Yorker</em>. Life then was about hospital rooms and love and “all the very basic things” in this world; there seemed no meaning in hanging his jacket over his desk chair every morning. But what to do instead? In 2008, Tom died, and all Patrick knew was that he needed the kind of work that would not require him to scrap and scrape and constantly “muscle his way forward”. Soon after this, acting on a whim, he applied for a position as a guard at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and by the autumn, there he was in his uniform, standing next to Raphael’s <em><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437372">Madonna and Child Enthroned With Saints</a> </em>– the first post in a job he would happily hold down for the next 10 years of his young life (at the time, he was 25).</p><p>“I knew I wanted something straightforward and nourishing,” he tells me when we talk via video call (he is in Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife and two children). “But it turned out to be much more than that. I had a sense straight away there was something extraordinary about it. Office life is busy. You’ve always got your mind on some project; you’re always pushing the ball forward. All of a sudden, I had that drop away. I was in a gallery. My hands were empty, my head was up, and I was duty bound <em>not</em> to be busy. There was nothing I was meant to do except keep my eyes open. A wave of freedom washed over me. In the stillness, my mind was able to wander.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/05/patrick-bingley-all-beauty-world-museum-guard-moma-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The European Space Agency’s Juice probe launches next month, flying closer to icy moons – including Ganymede, the solar system’s largest – than ever before</p><p>For most of the past 200 years, were you to ask an astronomer where the most likely place in the solar system is to find life, the answer will have been Mars. The red planet and its potential inhabitants have captured our collective imagination for centuries, transforming from an imaginary canal-building civilisation in the 19th century to the much more scientifically plausible microbes of today. But now, the thinking is different.</p><p>In the past few decades, astronomers have been increasingly drawn to the deeper, darker realms of the solar system. Specifically, they have become fascinated by the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Years of research have all but proved that some of these moons contain vast oceans of liquid water below their frozen surfaces.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/mar/05/could-jupiters-icy-moons-support-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Harrogate theatre, and touring</strong><br />Imitating the Dog’s exciting live action-video fusion, which sets the Scottish play in a modern-day crime syndicate, leaves Lady Macbeth out in the cold</p><p>In turning to Shakespeare, the touring company <a href="https://www.imitatingthedog.co.uk/project/macbeth/">Imitating the Dog</a> continues to expand the range of its distinctive form of theatre(previous productions have included adaptations of novels or of film). As often, the action is presented on a stage that is almost bare, except for cameras mounted on tripods or dollies, which are operated by actor-technicians. In place of a set we see blank screens on to which the live action is streamed and integrated into pre-set projections (here, these include animations ranging from film noir cityscapes to manga cartoons).</p><p>The effect is visually and viscerally exciting, combining the fluidity of film and the immediacy of flesh-and-blood performance. But the company’s three artistic co-directors and their team are not aiming only for aesthetic effects. Pete Brooks, Andrew Quick and Simon Wainwright expose the means of production to draw attention to the fact that the performance itself is a construction: as the actors put it in the direct-to-audience opening, “context is everything”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/05/macbeth-review-imitating-the-dog-harrogate-theatre">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This gushing celebration of composers who triumphed against the odds never quite communicates their place in history and leaves a hole at the centre where the music should be</p><p>When do four soloists become a quartet? Group biographies are increasingly ubiquitous, but they are hard to pull off.<em> Quartet </em>is a passionate four-part fugue, intertwining the lives of composers Ethel Smyth, Rebecca Clarke, Dorothy Howell and Doreen Carwithen. Smyth detested being banded with other female composers, and this book never really clarifies why its subjects should be put together. They were not close friends or collaborators, and they shared the Earth for just two decades of <em>Quartet</em>’s 145-year span. The narrative is forever having to restart. Not until page 261, with the birth of Carwithen, are all the plates finally spinning.</p><p>True, all four forged careers against the odds, surmounting serious obstacles and sexist dismissal. Smyth (1858-1944) was the first woman to have a stage work produced by the Metropolitan Opera in New York. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/mar/14/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures4">Clarke</a> (1886-1979) escaped an abusive father to become one of the first female players in a professional orchestra, and composed numerous pieces for her own instrument, the viola. Howell (1898-1982) became famous for her symphonic poem Lamia, a regular at the Proms during the 1920s. Carwithen (1922-2003) was among the first women to compose for film, but her career was curtailed by her dedication to the music of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/01/william-alwyn-doreen-carwithen-piano-music">William Alwyn</a>, her teacher and eventual husband.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/05/quartet-how-four-women-changed-the-musical-world-by-leah-broad-review-off-key-hymn-to-pioneers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A dynamic fusion of ‘gentle density’ housing in green belt Croydon is the latest example of thoughtful, visionary housing design the government would do well to learn from</p><p>Beauty! Michael Gove has declared on several occasions, in his capacity as secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities. Let’s have beautiful buildings. In this he’s picking up on a drumbeat that has been coming from the conservative thinktank Policy Exchange for some years, and from a well-connected campaign group called <a href="https://www.createstreets.com/">Create Streets</a>, which wants “beautiful and popular” new neighbourhoods to be built. Last December, Policy Exchange proposed a “<a href="https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/a-school-of-place/">School of Place</a>”, which, as Gove put it, would enable architects and planners “to go out and build beautiful, sustainable places in which people and communities can thrive”.</p><p>A number of smug Twitter accounts, meanwhile, like to post single images of unquestionably lovely old architecture, while lamenting that contemporary architecture doesn’t reach the same heights. And indeed we all like beauty. If new housing were as loved as old, neighbours might welcome it a little more. Few would wish that, say, the city of Edinburgh or a Cotswolds village would return to the natural landscape they once were, because their architecture is generally loved. Some questions, though, are begged. What actually makes a place beautiful? How can beauty be achieved by modern housebuilders, driven by the wish to erect homes as cheaply, efficiently and predictably as possible?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/05/michael-gove-thinks-beautiful-buildings-must-look-traditional-heres-why-hes-wrong-lion-green-road-mary-duggan">Continue reading...</a>

Nothing can beat a freshly baked biscuit<p>The smell of melted butter and muscovado sugar is curling its way through the kitchen and up the stairs. Vanilla extract and warm oats hang in the air and now again there is the fizz of lemon zest – little clouds of citrus among the mellow notes of biscuits baking. The kitchen is as warm as toast, its surfaces dusted with flour, its windows fugged up. This is not a particularly sweet kitchen: baking days are rare and magical treats, as looked forward to as those of Christmas Eve or Easter Sunday. Special days that end in a cake tin full of homemade cookies.</p><p>This has been a long winter and the first shoots of spring, those longed-for pink buds and green shoots, took forever to appear. Spring always puts me in a baking mood – a batch of fruit-studded buns or a tubby brioche, a basket of flatbreads or a bubbly cushion of focaccia – but right now I am a craving sweet treats: soft oat cookies or crisp lemon biscuits, not to wolf gluttonously (though that is always an option) but to serve with coffee for a mid-morning “fika” or at about 3pm when my energy takes its mid-afternoon dip.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/05/nigel-slater-recipes-chocolate-oat-cookies-and-crisp-lemon-creams">Continue reading...</a>

It has served him well as a director. Nearly 20 years ago, against the odds, he put on <em>Paradise Lost</em> in Northampton, and made it luscious.

The trouble is that though Lulu Raczka’s new play about evil and change has many glinting moments, it lacks a driving force.</p><p>Raczka mashes together the voluptuous violence of 17th-century drama and a sardonic knowingness: it as if she has Googled “change” and “evil” and decided to animate all the results. It is 1642. The king is under threat from Cromwell’s army. Privilege is being challenged, along with the enthroned position of men. In a stately pile a clever servant girl, thought to be a witch, is one cause of disturbance: Alison Oliver cleverly makes her both vulnerable and toughened. The toffs are worse: determined at all poisonous costs to hang on to their inheritance, Lydia Leonard’s sinuous heiress is part serpent, part gimlet-eyed executive. Her doltish brother – an enjoyably grotesquely Leo Bill – blusters around with flying ringlets and groping hands. Beside them, the fellow with horns beneath his hat looks staunch. But perhaps he is shape-shifting into them – who knows?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/05/women-beware-the-devil-almeida-review-romeo-and-julie-dorfman-national-theatre-shirley-valentine-sheridan-smith-duke-of-yorks">Continue reading...</a>

His end, she said, was a strangely warming memory because of the hospice volunteers who entered the pain of strangers and held their hands as they faced the unknown. In her grief, she explained, she’d encountered humanity at its best. I forgot my frustration at the static traffic as I listened. The prospect of a missed train and crowding deadlines was unimportant, seen through the lens of loss. It was an instant realisation that I wanted to be where life matters most, which is when it is ending. I wanted to be one of those hospice volunteers.</p><p>My experience of death had been at a distance. I’d lost grandparents and cats. As a clergyman’s wife, I’d attended funerals of parishioners, tidied tombstones in the churchyard and contemplated my mortality from the pews during Lent. I had never seen a body. I’m frightened of the raw grief of others and I’m squeamish about blood. My volunteering roles have always been with children. I’m used to beginnings, not endings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/05/what-being-a-hospice-volunteer-taught-me-about-life-and-death">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The NHS is planning to offer patients art, music and gardening classes rather than antidepressants. Nice idea, but it won’t work</p><p>Imagine this scenario: a client walks into my therapy room. They are are listless and don’t engage in eye contact. They move slowly and seem heavy, even though they may be physically slight.

A lone female fights off her attacker. Is it inspiring or proof of inherent danger? Well, maybe it’s both<p>I was utterly transfixed last week by a moment captured on CCTV in a Florida gym. A woman – an Instagram fitness model called Nashali Alma – sees a man waiting outside the door and interrupts her workout to buzz him in. It is evening. The two are now alone, sealed inside the empty room.</p><p>After a few minutes the man approaches her and then, shockingly, starts to chase her around the machines. Then he catches her. You think: that’s it, she’s done for. But like one of those dramatic sequences in the very best David Attenborough films – a hatchling iguana evading a nest of snapping snakes, perhaps, or an impala struggling clear of a crocodile death-roll – it is not over. She fights and, eventually – unbelievably – she wins. The exhausted predator has been outdone by his wily prey.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/05/lone-woman-fights-attacker-inspring-proof-inherent-danger-maybe-both">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Schitt’s Creek star on his unlikely new travelogue, the thrill of working with family and his pal Jennifer Coolidge stealing the show</p><p>The much-loved Canadian comic actor Eugene Levy is best known for co-creating and co-starring in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/21/schitts-creek-the-five-things-that-make-it-such-perfect-emmy-award-winning-tv">Schitt’s Creek</a></em> with his son Dan. The sitcom, which also starred his daughter Sarah, became a cult hit during the pandemic and won multiple awards for its sixth and final season, including a best actor Emmy for Eugene. His film roles include four collaborations with <em>Spinal Tap</em> creator Christopher Guest (such as <em>Best in Show</em>) and the flustered father Noah Levenstein in the <em>American Pie</em> teen comedies. Now Levy brings his deadpan wit and distinctive brows to an eight-part TV travelogue, <em>The Reluctant Traveler</em>.</p><p><strong>How reluctant were you making this series?<br /></strong>Pretty reluctant. I couldn’t have said “no” more times. It was pitched to me as a travel show about exotic hotels, I think called <em>A Room With a View</em>. I told my agent: “For anybody else, this would be an extremely exciting proposal but I don’t enjoy travel and I’m not sure how I’m going to hide that. So no, thank them very much but honestly, someone else would do a much better job.” My agent called back and said Apple wanted to have a conversation. So we had a phone call and as I was listing all my reasons, I was getting laughs. They immediately said: “That’s the show! A travel show hosted by somebody who doesn’t like travel.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/05/eugene-levy-reluctant-traveler-schitts-creek-interview">Continue reading...</a>

Matt Hancock’s leaked messages are not the evidence we are waiting for.

On one side were commentators and scientists opposed to any form of social restriction as a way of keeping infection rates down.

Caught between this tug of war were the majority of scientists and the British public.</p><p>Sometime last summer, those debates melted into the background with the promise of a “to be continued…” when the <a href="https://covid19.public-inquiry.uk/" title="">statutory inquiry</a> into Covid eventually starts to publish its findings.

<p>The writer uses her own story of emigration, uncertainty and alcoholism as one thread in a wider historical tapestry</p><p>This hybrid book, which is not quite a memoir and not quite a conceptually linked essay collection, begins with the death of a young Irish woman called Grace Farrell, whose body was discovered outside St Brigid’s Church in Manhattan’s East Village on 20 February 2011. Having arrived in New York from Ireland in 1993 with the dream of becoming an artist, Farrell was 35, homeless, and an alcoholic when she froze to death in an alcove of the church on Avenue B on the coldest night of the year.</p><p>Carmel McMahon came to New York a few years after Farrell, part of a wave of young, pre-Celtic Tiger Irish people whose “background music”, as she puts it, was “sectarian violence, mass unemployment and rising emigration”. Like Farrell, she succumbed to alcoholism, her initially exciting but uncertain life of waiting tables, hanging out and partying turning by stages darker and more chaotic. In desperation, she too gravitated to a familiar haven: a mass at another of Manhattan’s many Roman Catholic churches, Old St Patrick’s on Mott Street. Often she would turn up there, she writes, with a “thrift-store trenchcoat thrown over my pyjamas, reeking of cigarettes and booze, yesterday’s makeup sliding down my face”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/05/in-ordinary-time-trials-of-inherited-trauma-by-carmel-mcmahon-review-powerful-irish-family-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>David Jonsson is being courted by Hollywood. But the star of Industry and Rye Lane prefers roles that reflect Black British life</p><p>The trip David Jonsson took to Los Angeles last month was his first to Tinseltown. And though it was only fleeting, the British actor was busy. “It was a lot,” Jonsson says with a broad smile at a London restaurant a few days after returning. “Everyone was plying me with presents: there were sports tickets, gift baskets, drinks, dinners.” A sheepish giggle. “It was all quite unexpected, to say the least.”</p><p>Except, of course, it was perfectly predictable. Jonsson had arrived in LA fresh from the Sundance Film Festival, where <em>Rye Lane</em>, a new Disney romcom in which he stars, was one of the festival’s big successes. He’d already garnered attention with a chunky role in two seasons of HBO’s <em>Industry</em>. (There is a third season to come.) In LA, he was hot property.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/05/im-not-really-a-freedom-fighter-david-jonsson-industry-rye-lane">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(EQT Recordings/Capitol)<br />The multitalented Micah Davis returns with a signature blend of trap, house and jazz that is nothing short of magical<br /></p><p>As a songwriter, you should disappear the effort of making your music until it sounds like it just poured out of you, so it feels eternal yet new every time we encounter it, like the morning sun. By this rubric, 29-year-old Jamaican-American Micah Davis – <a href="https://www.masegomusic.com/">Masego</a> – may be a magician. Early work such as <em>The Pink Polo EP</em> introduced his “TrapHouseJazz” concept, attempting to splice those three disparate black music strains into something stronger and stranger. Yet his 2018 debut, <em>Lady Lady</em>, while filled with lovely tunes, felt a little familiar. Alt-soul bedroom jams with intriguing diversions – nothing that would frighten Solange or André 3000 fans.</p><p>This time, magic happens. <em><a href="https://masego.lnk.to/MASEGOWE">Masego</a></em> is more unfiltered, more assertive, whether on the pretty pop of Two Sides, thrillingly weird In Style or amapiano-adjacent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=79&amp;v=960TNYKBxxs&amp;embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fviewer.gutools.co.uk%2F&amp;feature=emb_title">Say You Want Me</a>. Davis can sing seductively and play sax, piano, cello and guitar, but knows not to peacock. The key is the space in the arrangements, effortlessly vanishing trap and jazz into house, hip-hop and many other genres with a rhythmic charge, propelling the ghostly harmonies he deploys so cleverly.

## Boris Johnson is peddling new lies in a desperate attempt to save his skin | Andrew Rawnsley

Ludicrous claims that he was brought down by a leftwing conspiracy show he frightened he is<br /><p>I woz framed. Faced with overwhelming, slam-dunk, bang-to-rights evidence against him, the last resort of the old lag is to claim that he is the victim of a conspiracy. Ever since his eviction from the premiership, Boris Johnson has gone around protesting it was the “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnson-removal-stitch-up-bayeux-tapestry/" title="">greatest stitch-up since the Bayeux tapestry</a>”. This is not terribly funny and entirely untrue, neither of which deters him from saying it repeatedly.</p><p>He just can’t stop trying to deceive himself and everyone else about why he was removed because he can no more handle the truth than he can speak it. He is compelled to blame anyone but himself because otherwise he would have to face up to the fatal character flaws that self-incinerated his premiership. He will never find it in himself to accept that the architect of Boris Johnson’s disgrace was Boris Johnson. His hunger for a return to power is the other important driver of his ludicrous claim to be the casualty of a miscarriage of justice. The hopes he has of rehabilitating his reputation, and the dreams he still entertains of making a return to Number 10, depend on persuading fellow Tories that he ought not to have been drummed out of Downing Street in the summer of last year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/05/boris-johnson-peddling-new-lies-desperate-attempt-save-skin">Continue reading...</a>

Fancy having a go at bonsai? Look online<p>Ten years ago I found myself filming in a sleepy suburb of Chang Mai, northern Thailand, making a television series on the world’s most expensive ingredients. My interviewee was a fascinating barista, barely out of his teens, who was winning international awards for just how amazing his coffee was. He revealed to me through a translator that he had learned all he knew from watching YouTube videos, without understanding the dialogue, simply from following the hand actions. My mind was blown.</p><p>A decade on, the enormous power of social media as an educational force is more widely recognised, but surprisingly still not so much in horticulture. So here are my favourite accounts from across the world that have taught me things I could never otherwise have learned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/05/james-wong-on-gardening-theres-a-world-of-gardening-advice-online">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Queen Mary accused of ‘turning students into spies’ to gather data on academics who did not reschedule missed teaching</p><p>A prestigious London university has become the first in the country to use a “student snitch form” to encourage students to report striking staff, while threatening to dock full pay for 39 days if those named fail to reschedule missed teaching.</p><p>Queen Mary University of London <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jul/30/university-bosses-attack-staff-pay-protest-wages-queen-mary-university-london" title="">was branded the “worst university employer in the UK”</a> by the Universities and Colleges Union last July, after it deducted 21 days of full pay from more than 100 staff who refused to mark students’ work in June as part of a national boycott.

Salman Abedi was the product of an unstable country and a radicalised diaspora. How did MI5 not see the signs?<p>Last week’s third and final report by Sir John Saunders into the Manchester Arena bombing offered numerous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/02/how-family-libya-conflict-radicalised-manchester-arena-bomber" title="">startling insights into Salman Abedi</a>, whose murderous instincts cost the lives of 22 people at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in 2017. Among them was the observation that Abedi’s actions could be traced to his family; the “noxious” absences of his parents; their extremist views along with those of his older brother. It was Abedi’s family, said Saunders, who held “significant responsibility” for the radicalisation of Abedi and his younger brother, Hashem.</p><p>Their father, Ramadan, was an active member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG). Like many Islamists, he sought refuge in the UK in 1993 as Muammar Gaddafi’s security apparatus hunted them. Many children of Islamist leaders who sought refuge in our country grew up to become activists and mouthpieces for an Islamist set of narratives that was never really part of British Muslim communities before the mid-90s. Steeped in victimhood, “the west” versus Islam, such narratives propagated heavily laden conspiracies that Islam was under threat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/05/manchester-bomb-victims-paid-price-of-backlash-always-risk-uk-policy-libya">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Belgian director Lukas Dhont’s Oscar-nominated drama about two inseparable boys tragically driven apart is a low-key treat</p><p>A tale of childhood bonds broken lands a weighty emotional punch in writer-director Lukas Dhont’s Oscar-nominated second film, a heartbreaking coming-of-age picture that represents Belgium in the best international feature category feature category, and which shared the Grand Prix at Cannes last year. Astonishingly natural and engaging performances from young newcomers Eden Dambrine and Gustav De Waele lend heartfelt authenticity to a film that builds upon the promise of 2018’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/17/girl-review-lukas-dhont-transgender-ballet-dancer">Girl</a>, </em>confirming Dhont as a deft and empathetic chronicler of the tumultuous anguish and ecstasy of adolescence.</p><p>We meet Léo and Rémi on the cusp of their teenage years, approaching secondary school.

<p>This trend is worth taking seriously: a healthy scalp will produce beautiful hair</p><p>Whether it’s a beauty fad everyone’s talking about or the hot new colour we are all supposed to paint our kitchen cabinets, trends, in my book anyway, should generally be given a wide berth. That said, there are instances when, once you claw past the hype, you will discover something of note. As is the case with the scalp-care trend. There’s a lot of talk about looking after our scalp because the fact is a healthy scalp will produce healthy hair. And yet we focus so much on hair products and treatments. Alas, if those products have no scalp benefit, you are wasting your money and potentially damaging your scalp. For many, this information is not new. In Black communities across the world caring for your scalp is par for the course – cleansing steam treatments to unclog pores, oils to nourish and moisturise, massaging the scalp during hair washing to increase circulation… I understand this sounds like yet another laborious ritual to add to an already time-poor schedule. And I do understand why people don’t pay attention to their scalp: it is easy to forget something you rarely see. But the scalp really does need just as much attention as your skin does – it is skin after all – and should be treated with just as much care. And now that the products in this category are no longer limited to offensively scented medicinal offerings, scalp care is a much more pleasurable experience.</p><p><strong>1.

Peeling back the layers of anything allows for a real change of state<p>A guy came round to mine this week with a knife, and knelt down on my kitchen floor. Casually, he scraped the floorboard with the flat blade, and I, kneeling down then beside him, gasped. I had a go with the knife too after that, stripping the top layer of darkened floor, revealing the raw, pale wood inside, and he went and got his machines then, and started to sand the whole room, giving advice about water damage and mopping suggestions throughout.

I was thinking about two things.</p><p>First, about the floorboards themselves, and Noel Gallagher, and how, as a teenager he was embarrassed to bring girls back to his house because they couldn’t afford carpet. And when he moved to London he called his mum to tell her, did you know, in London, they don’t have carpet on the floor, they just polish the floorboards? And how both of them reeled at the southeners’ utter foolish lunacy. Second, I was watching the floor change, and so quickly, too – I was thinking that this was the experience an exfoliating microdermabrasion facial promises, the instant sloughing-off of time and wear to reveal the true you beneath the skin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/05/stripping-back-a-floor-exposes-more-than-just-fresh-wood">Continue reading...</a>

## Israel is at a crucial crossroads: it can save itself or slide into despotism | Dahlia Scheindlin

Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has quickly transformed into the country’s gravest threat<p>Israel’s right wing is no stranger to political victory. Rightwing parties have governed for the better part of more than four decades and each time Benjamin Netanyahu has won an election since 2009, euphoric supporters have cheered King Bibi, while losers have gloomily prophesied the end of democracy.</p><p>But Netanyahu’s sixth government, formed in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/29/israel-swears-in-benjamin-netanyahu-amid-fears-of-further-slide-to-right" title="">final days of 2022</a>, is alarmingly different. Earlier rightwing governments merely wanted to expand settlements or annex parts of the West Bank, deepen the hold of Jewish religious law over Israeli public and private life, harangue and intimidate Israel’s Palestinian-Arab citizens. To do these things, populist illiberal governments of the last decade threatened to constrain the judiciary, but their vitriol didn’t yield significant reforms, other than judicial appointments of their choice. The new government is no longer testing the illiberal waters; it is going for the jugular in its assault on the institutions of democratic governance. Israel’s direction looks cataclysmic and challenges key alliances – western democracies, and even diaspora Jewry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/05/benjamin-netanyahus-government-has-quickly-transformed-into-the-countrys-gravest-threat">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This wide-ranging and disturbing account of Jewish persecution from the 12th century to the present day is strikingly relevant</p><p>Dave Rich, author of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/13/the-lefts-jewish-problem-corbyn-israel-and-antisemitism-dave-rich-review">The Left’s Jewish Problem</a></em>… (2016), now turns his attention to a wider examination of antisemitism. This new book is full of troubling stories, but one of the more disturbing revelations turns up quite late on, when Rich explains how antisemitism is growing among the young in Britain. Unlike other forms of racism, antisemitism rises as you move down the generations. Those under 25 are “the least likely to say they are just as open to having Jewish friends as they are to having friends from other sections of British society”. More than a quarter of young people agree that “Jews have disproportionate control of powerful institutions, and use that power for their own benefit and against the good of the general population”, compared with just 6% of those over 65.</p><p>This alone tells us why Rich’s book is so important. Such rising hatred demands that we take antisemitism more seriously and that we look at how we got here. Although I am Jewish myself, I am pretty ignorant of much of the relevant history. I was shaken by some of Rich’s stories from 12th-century England, for instance, when the Crusades led to a huge increase in antisemitic violence. Jews were banned from attending the coronation of King Richard I in 1189, and when some attended anyway, they “were set upon by the crowd, who beat around 30 of them to death”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/05/everyday-hate-by-dave-rich-review-how-antisemitism-is-built-into-our-world">Continue reading...</a>

People like Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, they’re incredibly cut off from the world. They’re not serial killers, they’re just ignorant of others. They treat people like they’re asking for change… Here you go, have a bit, tossing a coin while they’re eating a sandwich, looking at their mobile phone. I’ve visited Eton, there’s loads of places like it, and if that’s all you know, then you’ve definitely not had to worry about pulling a tenner out of the bank…”</p><p>“I watched this great video and it said that we’ve gone from a nation of people who considered Britain to be Great, to Little England,” says Andrew Fearn, the band’s musician. “Nearly everything’s imported. We don’t produce anything. We’re becoming like a little holiday island that doesn’t do anything. Even countries like Russia are doing better than the UK. But the point is: we’ve called it on ourselves. Our generation didn’t like Great Britain or the flag, we’ve always dissed our own country, so we’ve self-prophesied, in a way.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/05/sleaford-mods-uk-grim-crazy-golf-interview-jason-williamson-andrew-fearn">Continue reading...</a>

The government should speed up asylum seekers’ claims instead of focusing on costly and unworkable deterrents<p>Last weekend, at least 67 people <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/pakistani-international-hockey-player-died-in-italy-migrant-boat-tragedy/ar-AA188GRb" title="">drowned</a> when a wooden boat carrying about 150 people ran into trouble on rocks off the coast of Calabria, Italy.

It is an appalling reminder of the risks some people are willing to take to flee desperate circumstances – often including conflict and torture – in their home countries.</p><p>This movement of people across borders is age old and governments have never been able to fully control it despite developments in border enforcement and technology. It is driven primarily by patterns of conflict and economic deprivation and will increasingly be shaped by the climate crisis. It is a relatively small issue for the west: because the majority of refugees prefer to stay close to their home country to maximise their chances of returning, three-quarters of the world’s refugees live in low- and middle-income countries and <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/" title="">seven in 10 in countries</a> that neighbour their country of origin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/05/observer-view-on-cruel-plans-to-relocate-asylum-seekers">Continue reading...</a>

Small and large <br />plates £8-£20, desserts £7, wines from £24</strong></p><p>All restaurant locations have history. The tall, narrow building at 10 Tib Lane, just back from Manchester’s Princess Street, is no exception. Tonight, chef Robert Owen Brown is the keeper of the memories. “I lugged flagstones up there,” he says, pointing at the stairs to the floor above. He waves a hand airily towards the far end of this dimly lit first-floor dining room. “That was a mirrored door made of smoked glass with a big brass cock for a handle.” Back then the place was called Lounge 10, which sounds like the death throes of a terrible movie franchise that peaked at Lounge 3. Owen Brown was the opening chef and clearly, before launch, assistant builder. The Roman orgy murals were decidedly not safe for work, and at weekends the management installed a clairvoyant in the bogs. “We did a truffle pizza,” says Owen Brown. “And a smoked fillet of beef with quail eggs. Rather good all of that, actually.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/05/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-10-tib-lane-manchester-an-awful-lot-to-be-stimulated-by">Continue reading...</a>

## Chile’s wine industry shouldn’t go up in flames

How to support the wine growers of fire-ravaged southern Chile<p><strong>Emiliana Adobe Reserva Pinot Noir, Bío Bío, Chile 2021, £9.50, <a href="https://www.vintageroots.co.uk/">Vintage Roots</a> </strong>One of the most exciting developments in South American wine in the 21st century has been Chilean winemakers’ discovery, or in some cases re-discovery, of their country’s southern wine-making regions. In the early years of the country’s modern wine boom, which followed hard on the heels of the rise of other non-European wines from the likes of Australia and California in the 1980s and 1990s, most of the winegrowing action took place in the Central Valley which runs south from the capital Santiago. Then as now, the Central Valley was home to some excellent wines, not least the sumptuous cabernet sauvignons that were Chile’s first genuinely world-beating fine wines. But the rise of the south (as well as new vineyards on the coast and to the north on the fringes of the Atacama Desert) has greatly expanded Chile’s winemaking palate, with the relative cool of the Bío Bío Valley emerging as one of the continent’s best places for pinot noirs, such as Emiliana’s refreshingly breezy, strawberry-scented example.</p><p><strong>Longavi Glup País, Itata, Chile 2021, £11.49, <a href="https://www.allaboutwine.co.uk/">All About Wine</a> </strong>The winegrowers of southern Chile have had a nightmare start to 2021 with wildfires sweeping through their vineyards in early February, destroying or seriously damaging vines and buildings as they began to prepare for the 2023 harvest. The fate of the vineyards can seem like a minor concern when set against loss of life (24 people died in the fires) and homes, but the trauma for small producers who make up the majority of winegrowers there, whose very livelihoods are threatened, should not be underestimated. Among the worst-hit regions was the Itata Valley, one of the original traditional homes of Chilean wine, which has been the scene of a remarkable renaissance in recent years after being somewhat marginalised during the modern boom. It’s a rebirth built on the rediscovery, or redeployment, of very old vines, sometimes more than 100 years old, the fruit of which had been disappearing into anonymous blends, but which is now being used to make vibrant, tangy red wines such as Longavi’s Glup País.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/05/how-to-support-the-wine-growers-of-fire-ravaged-chile">Continue reading...</a>

The acclaimed play features unnecessary ‘Jewishness’. Why has it not been condemned?<p>I greatly appreciated Dave Rich’s critique of <em>The Lehman Trilogy</em>; he did an excellent job of laying out the dangers of the normalisation of antisemitic tropes (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/26/antisemitic-tropes-are-back-on-stage-again" title="">Antisemitic tropes back on stage again</a>”, Focus). His highlighting of specific aspects where unnecessary “Jewishness” was injected divulges his sophisticated understanding of the material and its impact.</p><p>I’m left deeply perplexed that in his closing paragraph he does not call for the condemnation of this play. I fail to understand how Mr Rich can claim that those behind the play are not “a bunch of Jew-haters” when the entirety of the article makes it clear that the fundamental antisemitism isn’t accidental.<br /><strong>Aryeh Barson</strong><br />Santa Cruz, California<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/mar/05/antisemitism-in-lehman-trilogy-is-not-accidental-letters">Continue reading...</a>
