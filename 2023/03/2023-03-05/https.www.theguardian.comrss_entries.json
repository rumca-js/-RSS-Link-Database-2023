This new book is full of troubling stories, but one of the more disturbing revelations turns up quite late on, when Rich explains how antisemitism is growing among the young in Britain. Unlike other forms of racism, antisemitism rises as you move down the generations. Those under 25 are \u201cthe least likely to say they are just as open to having Jewish friends as they are to having friends from other sections of British society\u201d.

In the early years of the country\u2019s modern wine boom, which followed hard on the heels of the rise of other non-European wines from the likes of Australia and California in the 1980s and 1990s, most of the winegrowing action took place in the Central Valley which runs south from the capital Santiago. Then as now, the Central Valley was home to some excellent wines, not least the sumptuous cabernet sauvignons that were Chile\u2019s first genuinely world-beating fine wines. But the rise of the south (as well as new vineyards on the coast and to the north on the fringes of the Atacama Desert) has greatly expanded Chile\u2019s winemaking palate, with the relative cool of the B\u00edo B\u00edo Valley emerging as one of the continent\u2019s best places for pinot noirs, such as Emiliana\u2019s refreshingly breezy, strawberry-scented example.</p><p><strong>Longavi Glup Pa\u00eds, Itata, Chile 2021, \u00a311.49, <a href=\"https://www.allaboutwine.co.uk/\">All About Wine</a> </strong>The winegrowers of southern Chile have had a nightmare start to 2021 with wildfires sweeping through their vineyards in early February, destroying or seriously damaging vines and buildings as they began to prepare for the 2023 harvest. The fate of the vineyards can seem like a minor concern when set against loss of life (24 people died in the fires) and homes, but the trauma for small producers who make up the majority of winegrowers there, whose very livelihoods are threatened, should not be underestimated. Among the worst-hit regions was the Itata Valley, one of the original traditional homes of Chilean wine, which has been the scene of a remarkable renaissance in recent years after being somewhat marginalised during the modern boom. It\u2019s a rebirth built on the rediscovery, or redeployment, of very old vines, sometimes more than 100 years old, the fruit of which had been disappearing into anonymous blends, but which is now being used to make vibrant, tangy red wines such as Longavi\u2019s Glup Pa\u00eds.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/05/how-to-support-the-wine-growers-of-fire-ravaged-chile\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/05/how-to-support-the-wine-growers-of-fire-ravaged-chile", "date_published": "2023-03-05 06:00:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "TV tonight: who is Bill Cosby now?
