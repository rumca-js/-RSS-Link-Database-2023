<p dir="ltr">Sonic the Hedgehog has come a long way in the past few years. From the open-world reinvention Sonic Frontiers to the financial success of the movie franchise, everyone's favorite Sega mascot is enjoying a boom period. But while some at Sega might want you to forget some of Sonic's more mediocre (or downright terrible) outings--especially those of the mid 2000s--the die-hard modders in the surprisingly active 3D Sonic scene are here to fix the problems that annoyed thousands of schoolchildren back in the day.</p><p dir="ltr">Of the many, many Sonic games that have emerged over the years, it's fair to say that 2006's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-review/1900-6162205/">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> is the most infamous.

When the developer first played Sonic 2006 as a kid, he was fascinated by its mix of soaring highs and abyssal lows--here was a game that had some of the best art design and music that he had ever seen and heard, yet it struggled with the basics of the platforming genre.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-modders-fixing-the-bad-sonic-games-of-your-youth/1100-6511978/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
