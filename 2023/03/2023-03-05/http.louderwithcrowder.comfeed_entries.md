But he still spoke at CPAC and brought a whistleblower onstage. Like an absolute boss. </p><p>O'Keefe spoke about the stories that broke just before his ouster - the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pfizer-director-mutatiing" target="_blank">Pfizer</a> <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/big-pharma-director-bananas" target="_blank">bombshells</a>. He explained,<em> '"In order to obtain these things, we need brave people, we need brave whistleblowers [...] There were people on the inside of Pfizer who helped us obtain this."</em></p><p><em>"Having been ousted from the company I founded 13 years ago, mere days after the story, and as this was happening, I was talking to one of these people. And she was a little reluctant to go public, rightfully so [...] But after what I went through, we reconnected." </em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cJames O'Keefe: \n\n"Fear is how the enemy controls us."\u201d</div> â€” Citizen Free Press (@Citizen Free Press)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1632295693355483136">1678004594</a>
</blockquote>

<p>He then explained some of what the whistleblower had gone through as a result of leaking the story, saying,<em> "The individual who helped identify this man, helped bring this to light...the person who worked with Pfizer, who was targeted, who was brought into her room, interrogated, who had a red van go to her home, harass her and her loved ones...who is scared for her life -rightfully so, scared for her life- was so inspired by the series of events that have occurred over the last three weeks, that she's decided to go public with me on this stage right now." </em></p><p>"Debbie from Pfizer" then joined O'Keefe onstage to thunderous applause. Debbie said she was scared to speak out because she was scared of ending up in a body bag or a "car accident". But she eventually concluded that "the spirit of fear is not of the Lord," explaining:<em> "And as a believer, I knew that I couldn't just sit there. I couldn't just sit and watch people get lied to. People get gaslit. It made me angry." </em>So, thankfully,  she decided to speak out. </p><p>Apart from being an inspiring tale, this also shows that James O'Keefe will not be going quietly into the night and his whistleblowers will not abandon him. It seems we might get a Project Veritas 2.0 in the near future. </p>

## Watch As Russell Brand Goes Scorched Earth on MSNBC Straight to an MSNBC Journalist's Face

And it was glorious. </p><p>Brand made the comments to John Heilemann on 'Real Time with Bill Maher".  Heilemann is a journalist for NBC and MSNBC. Brand came in hot , explaining to Heilemann:<em> "</em><em>It is disingenuous to claim that the biases that are exhibited on Fox News are any different from the biases exhibited on MSNBC. </em><em>It is difficult to suggest that these corporations operate as anything other than mouthpieces for their affiliate owners, Black Rock and Vanguard."</em></p><p>I feel like saying "Black Rock" on mainstream media is the equivalent of speaking the name of Voldemort aloud. Except instead of The Dark Lord's minions appearing, you'll just get labeled a crazy, Alex-Jones-loving conspiracy theorist and shunned from polite society. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cRussell Brand Calls Out MSNBC's Hypocrisy on COVID\n\n"Do you want an example? The ludicrous, outrageous criticisms of Joe Rogan around Ivermectin deliberately referring to it as a horse medicine when they know it's an effective medicine!"\n\n@rustyrockets @billmaher @joerogan\u201d</div> â€” Chief Nerd (@Chief Nerd)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/TheChiefNerd/status/1632005330979749888">1677935366</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Brand continued, <em>"Do you think you can improve America by determinedly and avowedly condemning FOX News without acknowledging that you're participating in the same game?" </em></p><p>Heilemann was not having it, and seemed to take Brand's comments pretty personally. He even called him "darling". So there was  serious tension there.<em></em></p><p><em>"Russell, darling... I'd like to hear a provable specific example of an MSNBC correspondent or anchor being on television saying something they knew was false, and were saying behind the scenes." </em> He also fired shots at Brand, saying, <em>"You've been on MSNBC once, big f*cking deal."</em><br /></p><p>So, despite the personal attack, Brand did give a specific example: <em>"The ludicrous, outrageous criticism of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-cnn-horse-response" target="_blank">Joe Rogan around Ivermectin</a>. Deliberately referring to it as a "horse medicine," when they know it is an effective medicine. Rachel Maddow turning on the TV, saying if you take this vaccine, you're not going to get [Covid] when it hadn't been clinically trialed."</em></p><p>I would add to this the <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/27/rachel-maddows-deep-delusion-226266/" target="_blank">Russiagate conspiracy</a> that Rachel Maddow peddled for years. I imagine they have to keep her locked in her dressing room over at MSNBC so she doesn't venture outside and accidentally see a newspaper about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-VOrpiifCw" target="_blank">Mueller Report</a>. That might have been the darkest day of her life. </p>

## Watch: Chaos erupts when Walmart employees discover they're both shagging the same manager

What we have for you is a story in two parts of a bizarre love triangle. Though it could also be a bizarre love square or pentagon. This "Wayne" fella sounds like he gets around.

</p><p>Anyone who has worked in retail before knows that workplace romances aren't uncommon. All of those late nights stocking barren shelves and cleaning up after unruly customers, one thing leads to another and you find yourself discovering how many places there are in the stock room to do it. Wayne knows. The (at least) two different women he's been giving the employee discount to know. And, thanks to one of the ladies not handling the sudden news well, everyone in the store knows too.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@damnkeaira/video/7147740416983452971" class="tiktok-embed"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@damnkeaira?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@damnkeaira">@damnkeaira</a> Walmart in Morrow, Ga. ðŸ˜‚ auntie say the manager sleeping with the employees <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="fyp">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/walmart?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="walmart">#walmart</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="foryou">#foryou</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7147740453675273006?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="â™¬ original sound - Keaira ðŸ˜˜">â™¬ original sound - Keaira ðŸ˜˜</a> </section> </blockquote> </div><p>Unfortunately, we missed the initial confrontation when Girl #1 confronted Girl #2 that Wayne was her man. Our story picks up after the fight was being broken up and girl #2 was being dragged away from continuing any physicality.</p><p>Using my deductive reasoning skills, I have determined that Girl #1 was the jilted lover in this scenario. Her removing her Walmart apron and leaving the store leads me to believe she quit her job and was on her way out. But not before pulling an all-time move. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/man-costco-interco" target="_blank">Getting on the intercom</a> and letting the store know Wayne's business.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@damnkeaira/video/7147741026705214763" class="tiktok-embed"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@damnkeaira?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@damnkeaira">@damnkeaira</a> She wasnâ€™t done, she had to let the whole store know about Wayne ðŸ˜‚ <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="fyp">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="foryou">#foryou</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/walma?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="walma">#walma</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7147741056434588458?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="â™¬ original sound - Keaira ðŸ˜˜">â™¬ original sound - Keaira ðŸ˜˜</a> </section> </blockquote> </div><p>As of this writing, it is unclear if Girl #2 stayed with Wayne. OR, if there is a Girl #3, #4 or #5. Wayne sounds like he needs to be reminded of the old adage "you shouldn't sh*t where you eat." It's an odd phrase for saying you shouldn't f*ck people you work with. But it remains solid advice.</p><p><p>

Apolitical Americans will dismiss it as partisan white noise. You have to find a way to reach people talking about the issues they care about, and one TikToker did just that.

Therefore the shopping cart presents itself as the apex example of whether a person will do what is right without being forced to do it."</em></p><p>It's the perfect analogy.</p><p>Republicans give to charity because it's the right thing to do.

It's the same leftists who shun the self-checkout lane, even though it's faster and more effective. Also, and this can't be stressed enough, people who leave their cart in the middle of a pull-through spot should be declared an enemy of the state.</p><p>Republicans put their cart back.

## 'Everyone called him a b*tch': Chris Rock finally goes OFF about Will Smith slapping the taste out of his mouth

	As we approach the one-year anniversary of Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars, the comedian FINALLY addressed the issue live on television. In his new special <em>Chris Rock: Selective Outrage</em>,  Rock went off on Will Smith's "selective outrage" about slapping the comedian for a joke, when the person he should really be mad at is his wife.
</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="27919" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33212321&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>]In March 2022, Chris Rock made a joke about a movie at the Oscars that Will Smith found funny. The rub is that Will Smith's wife didn't find it funny, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/will-smith-chris-rock-oscars" target="_self">so Smith assaulted Rock on stage</a>. Smith's wife <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jada-pinkett-smith-laughing" target="_self">found THAT funny</a>, even though she is a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jada-pinkett-smith-responds" target="_self">"strong woman" who "didn't" want her husband</a> to do that. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adam-sandler-chris-rock-oscars" target="_self">The Grown-Ups were activated</a>. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-attacked-hollywood-bowl" target="_self">Jokes were made</a>. And four months later, Will Smith posted a lame-ass apology.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="2bcef" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33212323&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Chris Rock took the stage and went THERE about the Smiths. Remember when Jada Pinket-Smith interviewed her husband on her podcast, let him know she cheated on him, and he sat there and took it like the world's biggest cuck? Chris Rock remembers.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Chris Rock just slapped Will Smith the right way on stage. <a href="https://t.co/eHAWXQlIso">pic.twitter.com/eHAWXQlIso</a><br />â€” Dom Lucre | Breaker of Narratives (@dom_lucre) <a href="https://twitter.com/dom_lucre/status/1632354462898483200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>"His wife was f*cking her son's friend."</p><p>"We've all been cheated on, everybody in here has been cheated on. None of us have been interviewed by the person that cheated on us on television, like "Hey I was sucking somebody else's d*ck, how did that make you feel?" Why the f*ck would you do that sh*t?"</p><p>"Everybody called him a b*tch. And who is he hitting? Me. A n*gga her knows he can beat. That is some b*tch ass sh*t"</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="0a360" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33212334&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>I believe this finally settles the matter. There is a chance Will Smith responds. But really, he has been so emasculated at this point, there would be no reason to. </p><p><p>
