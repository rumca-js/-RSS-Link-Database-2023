<p>Windows has frequently made managing multiple audio devices a hassle. Over the years, Microsoft has tried to improve the experience in a few ways. In 2021, for example, the company simplified how Windows 10 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-10-aac-bluetooth-codec-support-203929715.html"><ins>categorized Bluetooth devices</ins></a>. In spite of those efforts, it often feels like the OS doesn‚Äôt make switching between audio outputs and managing sound levels as easy as they should be. For instance, I wish <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11‚Äôs</a> Quick Setting panel would allow me to adjust audio levels on a per-app basis.</p><p>Thankfully, Microsoft is finally preparing to solve that minor annoyance for Windows users. This week, the company detailed the latest <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/03/02/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25309/"><ins>Windows 11 Insider Preview</ins></a> and it just so happens to include a redesigned Quick Settings volume mixer. The updated interface element not only allows you to switch between audio devices but you can also use it to enable spatial sound and adjust volume output on a per-app basis, two things you can‚Äôt do with the current design. What‚Äôs more, Microsoft has added a dedicated shortcut to make accessing the feature faster. Once you have access to the volume mixer, press the Windows, Ctrl and V keys on your keyboard at the same time to open it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;With this change, you can now tailor your audio experience with more control and fewer clicks to better manage your favorite apps,&quot; Microsoft says of the redesigned interface. As <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-is-testing-a-modern-windows-11-volume-mixer/"><em><ins>Bleeping Computer</ins></em><ins> points out</ins></a>, the new volume mixer is reminiscent of the popular <a href="https://github.com/File-New-Project/EarTrumpet"><ins>EarTrumpet</ins></a> mod. There‚Äôs no word yet on when Microsoft plans to roll out the latest Windows Insider features to regular users, but here‚Äôs hoping this one doesn‚Äôt take long to make its way to the general public.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Windows 11's redesigned volume mixer, currently available to Windows Insiders.

<p>More than a decade after the release of <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>, Valve is reportedly preparing to announce a new version of its landmark tactical shooter. Moreover, a beta release could arrive as early as later this month. According to esports journalist <a href="https://t.co/ogSk5QnU6L"><ins>Richard Lewis</ins></a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/counter-strike-2-could-be-announced-this-month-its-claimed/"><em><ins>VGC</ins></em></a>), Valve has been working on a sequel to <em>CS:GO</em> for some time, and that game is &quot;about ready to go.&quot; He says the studio recently hosted a secret playtest of the first-person shooter that involved a group of professional players who flew to Seattle. According to Lewis, Valve tentatively plans to begin beta testing the game with the broader Counter-Strike community by April 1st at the latest. &quot;The big priority is getting this out and then polishing it, fixing any bugs and bringing it up to the level people expect from CS,&quot; one of Lewis' sources told him.</p><p>As for improvements, the new Counter-Strike will reportedly feature improved graphical fidelity thanks to a behind-the-scenes shift to Source 2, the latest version of Valve's in-house game engine. Additionally, Lewis says the game will support <a href="https://technology.riotgames.com/news/valorants-128-tick-servers">128-tick servers</a>, a feature that would bring CS in line with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-riot-project-a-shooter-officially-valorant.html"><em><ins>Valorant</ins></em></a> and reduce latency. Valve is also said to have significantly improved the matchmaking experience, which should make the community less reliant on third-party services like FACEIT. Valve did not immediately respond to Engadget's comment request.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8761fc07551742dab521057dcae0a28f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">üò≥üö®With one of the latest NVIDIA Drivers a new Game Profile has been added to the NVIDIA Control Panel called &quot;Counter-strike 2&quot;!!<br /><br />Apparently it has 2 executables:<br />- csgos2.exe<br />- cs2.exe <a href="https://t.co/hWsWOh4YKV">pic.twitter.com/hWsWOh4YKV</a></p>‚Äî Aquarius (@aquaismissing) <a href="https://twitter.com/aquaismissing/status/1631002399111348246?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Rumors suggesting that a new Counter-Strike game is right around the corner have been going around for years, but there are a few reasons to assign more weight to this latest report. To start, Lewis has a strong track record. In 2015, he wrote a report confirming rumors that one of the leading professional <em>CS:GO </em>teams at the time had <a href="https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/match-fixing-counter-strike-ibuypower-netcode-guides-1256"><ins>purposefully thrown a match</ins></a>. There's also corroborating evidence to support his claims. At the start of the month, a few <em>CS:GO</em> fans <a href="https://twitter.com/aquaismissing/status/1631002399111348246?s=20">found evidence</a> that NVIDIA's GPU drivers have included references to &quot;csgo2.exe&quot; and &quot;cs2.exe&quot; since February.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/a-new-counter-strike-game-is-reportedly-in-development-and-could-arrive-later-this-month-202010791.html?src=rss

<p>Apple is readying to release a new 24-inch iMac as early as the second half of the year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-03-05/when-is-apple-aapl-releasing-new-mac-pro-15-inch-macbook-air-new-imac-m3-levgn4yc?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg‚Äôs</ins></em><ins> Mark Gurman</ins></a>. Writing in his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman reports the development of two new iMac models has reached ‚Äúa late stage,‚Äù with Apple recently beginning manufacturing tests. Gurman expects volume production of the 2023 iMac won‚Äôt start for at least another three months, but the good news is the refreshed models will feature a handful of improvements.</p><p>Most significantly, the 2023 iMac will reportedly include Apple‚Äôs next-generation M3 system-on-a-chip. Gurman notes the new chipset is likely to offer significant performance and power efficiency gains given that it‚Äôs expected to take advantage of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-and-apple-expected-to-debut-3-nm-processors-next-year-100632556.html"><ins>TSMC‚Äôs upcoming 3nm process</ins></a>. Other changes could involve the iMac‚Äôs internal components, some of which have reportedly been redesigned by Apple. Gurman says the company is also planning to employ a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù manufacturing process for attaching the iMac‚Äôs stand. That said, the all-in-one will still feature a 24-inch screen and come in the same cheerful colorways as its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html"><ins>2021 predecessor</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Alongside a new iMac, Gurman says the company is readying to release the long-rumored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-15-inch-macbook-air-12-inch-revival-170337389.html"><ins>15-inch variant of the MacBook Air</ins></a>, as well as a refresh of the 13-inch model and its first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-pro-m2-ultra-extreme-report-215731047.html"><ins>Apple Silicon Mac Pro</ins></a>.

<p>March 10th might not be for another few days, but that‚Äôs not stopping retailers like Amazon from offering Mario Day deals early.

<p>There is too much internet and our attempts to keep up with the breakneck pace of, well, everything these days ‚Äî it is breaking our brains. Parsing through the deluge of inundating information hoisted up by algorithmic systems built to maximize engagement has trained us as slavering Pavlovian dogs to rely on snap judgements and gut feelings in our decision making and opinion formation rather than deliberation and introspection.

From finding love to finding gainful employment to finding out the score of yesterday's game, AI has streamlined the information gathering process. But, as Chamorro-Premuzic argues in the excerpt below, that information revolution is actively changing our behavior, and not always for the better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="light blue background, black serif text for " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/ee1c6460-b79d-11ed-affe-d493df9f086c" style="height: 1500; width: 997;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Harvard Business Review Press</div></figure><p>Reprinted by permission of Harvard Business Review Press.

The real problem comes when fast mindlessness is our primary mode of decision-making. It causes us to make mistakes and impairs our ability to detect mistakes. More often than not, speedy decisions are borne out of ignorance.</p><p>Intuition can be great, but it ought to be hard-earned. Experts, for example, are able to think on their feet because they‚Äôve invested thousands of hours in learning and practice: their intuition has become data-driven. Only then are they able to act quickly in accordance with their internalized expertise and evidence-based experience. Alas, most people are not experts, though they often think they are. Most of us, especially when we interact with others on Twitter, act with expert-like speed, assertiveness, and conviction, offering a wide range of opinions on epidemiology and global crises, without the substance of knowledge that underpins it. And thanks to AI, which ensures that our messages are delivered to an audience more prone to believing it, our delusions of expertise can be reinforced by our personal filter bubble. We have an interesting tendency to find people more open-minded, rational, and sensible when they think just like us. Our digital impulsivity and general impatience impair our ability to grow intellectually, develop expertise, and acquire knowledge.</p><p>Consider the little perseverance and meticulousness with which we consume actual information. And I say <em>consume </em>rather than inspect, analyze, or vet. One academic study estimated that the top-10 percent digital rumors (many of them fake news) account for up to 36 percent of retweets, and that this effect is best explained in terms of the so-called echo chamber, whereby retweets are based on clickbait that matches the retweeter‚Äôs views, beliefs, and ideology, to the point that any discrepancy between those beliefs and the actual content of the underlying article may go unnoticed. Patience would mean spending time determining whether something is real or fake news, or whether there are any serious reasons to believe in someone‚Äôs point of view, especially when we agree with it. It‚Äôs not the absence of fact-checking algorithms during presidential debates that deters us from voting for incompetent or dishonest politicians, but rather our intuition. Two factors mainly predict whether someone will win a presidential candidacy in the United States‚Äîthe candidate‚Äôs height and whether we would want to have a beer with them.</p><p>While AI-based internet platforms are a relatively recent type of technology, their impact on human behavior is consistent with previous evidence about the impact of other forms of mass media, such as TV or video games, which show a tendency to fuel ADHD-like symptoms, like impulsivity, attention deficits, and restless hyperactivity. As the world increases in complexity and access to knowledge widens, we avoid slowing down to pause, think, and reflect, behaving like mindless automatons instead. Research indicates that faster information gathering online, for example, through instant Googling of pressing questions, impairs long-term knowledge acquisition as well as the ability to recall where our facts and information came from.</p><p>Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not so easy to fight against our impulsive behavior or keep our impatience in check. The brain is a highly malleable organ, with an ability to become intertwined with the objects and tools it utilizes. Some of these adaptations may seem pathological in certain contexts or cultures, but they are essential survival tools in others: restless impatience and fast-paced impulsivity are no exception.</p><p>Although we have the power to shape our habits and default patterns of behaviors to adjust to our habitat, if pace rather than patience is rewarded, then our impulsivity will be rewarded more than our patience. And if any adaptation is <em>overly </em>rewarded, it becomes a commoditized and overused strength, making us more rigid, less flexible, and a slave to our own habits, as well as less capable of displaying the reverse type of behavior. The downside of our adaptive nature is that we quickly become an exaggerated version of ourselves: we mold ourselves into the very objects of our experience, amplifying the patterns that ensure fit. When that‚Äôs the case, then our behaviors become harder to move or change.</p><p>When I first returned to my hometown in Argentina after having spent a full year in London, my childhood friends wondered why my pace was so unnecessarily accelerated‚Äî‚ÄúWhy are you in such a hurry?‚Äù Fifteen years later, I experienced the same disconnect in speed when returning to London from New York City, where the pace is significantly faster. Yet most New Yorkers seem slow by the relative standards of Hong Kong, a place where the button to close the elevator doors (two inward-looking arrows facing each other) is usually worn out, and the automatic doors of the taxis open and close while the taxis are still moving. Snooze, and you truly lose.</p><p>There may be limited advantages to boosting our patience when the world moves faster and faster. The right level of patience is always that which aligns with environmental demands and best suits the problems you need to solve. Patience is not always a virtue. If you are waiting longer than you should, then you are wasting your time. When patience breeds complacency or a false sense of optimism, or when it nurtures inaction and passivity, then it may not be the most desirable state of mind and more of a character liability than a mental muscle. In a similar vein, it is easy to think of real-life problems that arise from having too much patience or, if you prefer, would benefit from a bit of impatience: for example, asking for a promotion is usually a quicker way of getting it than patiently waiting for one; refraining from giving someone (e.g., a date, colleague, client, or past employer) a second chance can help you avoid predictable disappointments; and waiting patiently for an important email that never arrives can harm your ability to make better, alternative choices. In short, a strategic sense of urgency‚Äîwhich is the reverse of patience‚Äîcan be rather advantageous.</p><p>There are also many moments when patience, and its deeper psychological enabler of self-control, may be an indispensable adaptation. If the AI age seems disinterested in our capacity to wait and delay gratification, and patience becomes somewhat of a lost virtue, we risk becoming a narrower and shallower version of ourselves.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-i-human-tomas-chamorro-premuzic-harvard-business-review-press-153003112.html?src=rss
