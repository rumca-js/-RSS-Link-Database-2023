Theatrics and monologuing are kept to a minimum, and every blow has the potential to be fatal. If an elite cabal of S-tier assassins did fight in the real world, it would probably go down like this, right?\nThe thing is, we know what hand-to-hand slugfests between the world\u2019s greatest fighters look like, and in reality, Keanu Reeves as John Wick probably wouldn\u2019t last long in the octagon. But on the screen, his marriage of MMA moves and Tom Clancy tactics was unlike anything action fans had seen before his 2014 debut.\u00a0\nSome folks call it authenticity, or believability. Film majors call it verisimilitude. I call it \u201cmaking you believe that Keanu Reeves can kill three dudes with a bleeping pencil.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd one way to do that is to put some of cinema\u2019s greatest martial artists directly in his path of vengeance. Artists like Donnie Yen. This international superstar earned his room at the Continental through years of training and study. Drawing on his MMA expertise and the philosophy of Bruce Lee, Yen revolutionized action cinema and set the High Table for John Wick and other films that followed.\nThe bottom line is Donnie Yen fight scenes and a famous Bruce Lee real fight and even the John Wick pencil kill scene all converge at a certain point.\nSo with John Wick: Chapter 4 now out, let\u2019s dig in on the art of realistic movie combat, where Wick, Donnie Yen and Bruce Lee all converge\u2026", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77oTAhtCzjA", "date_published": "2023-03-26 18:30:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Resident Evil 4: Why You Should Get the Bolt Thrower Early (and Save Ammo!)", "description": "While most of the other weapons will deal more damage, you can't beat the bolt throws versatility, and near limitless ammo, especially early on.
