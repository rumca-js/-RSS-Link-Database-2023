Which apparently means TSA is now transphobic. I can honestly get on board with this if it means we can abolish the TSA. I'm almost always patted down during those screenings and it's not pleasant. </p><p>This beautiful and brave person posted a now-deleted sobbing selfie from a bathroom stall and explained that their beautiful and brave balls \"still hurt so bad\".  They also claimed TSA yelled at them for having a penis. In a separate post, they clarified, \"'I don't want the TSA agent that hurt me fired. I want her educated and the entirety of TSA abolished altogether.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">None</div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MailOnline/status/1639962678557908999\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the testicle-punching incident, the TSA worker apparently followed the trans person into the bathroom and discussed what just happened with another coworker, while the trans individual wept in a stall. Which does sound like slightly psychotic behavior, not gonna lie. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-homeless-encampment\" target=\"_blank\">airport</a> has since said they are investigating the incident and responded to the trans individual on Twitter, writing, \"We apologize again for your experience. Your comments have been noted and shared.\" </p><p>This has happened before, and it's apparently due to screenings detecting an \"anomaly\" between trans \"women's\" legs. AKA their lady penis. This anomaly sets off the alarm in the body scanner and leads to uncomfortable screenings. And apparently, punches to their lady testicles. </p><p>What's left out of this story is how uncomfortable it probably makes female TSA agents who have to grope a trans person's testicles because their passport says female. I can understand why the agent would be so upset. Though the following to the bathroom, if true, is a tad over the line. So as much as I hate the TSA, this is just another example of creating problems that really shouldn't exist in the first place. But alas, welcome to 2023. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Kanye West aka Ye no longer hates the Jews. All it took was a Jewish actor and a ten-year-old movie. Ye was watching <em>21 Jump Street</em>, saw a young (and newly svelte) Jonah Hill, and decided the Jews are a-ok after all.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"eb25b\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33354936&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>To recap, 2022 ended with Kanye on a downward spiral. And, in his words, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-adl\" target=\"_blank\">the Jews were to blame</a>. That would be bad enough. But from there, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-burr-kanye\" target=\"_blank\">he praised Hitler as a good guy</a>. Ye went so off the deep end, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/show-notes-alex-jones-ye\" target=\"_blank\">even Alex Jones was like...dude!</a></p><p>We can leave all that in 2022. It's 2023, and after watching 2012's <em>21 Jump Street</em>, Kanye has seen the era of his ways. All it took was the artistic stylings of Jonah Hill. Kanye made amends in an Instagram post.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"ebc7b\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33354950&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><blockquote>Watching Jonah Hill in 21 Jump street made me like Jewish people again<br /><br />No one should take anger against one or two individuals and transform that into hatred towards millions of innocent people<br /><br />No Christian can be labeled antisemite knowing Jesus is Jew<br /><br />Thank you Jonah Hill I love you.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"1d34a\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33354955&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>It's a remake of the 80s TV show, and like most remakes is little more than a parody of the source material, including the necessary Johnny Depp cameo. In Kanye's defense, the movie is damn funny. Hill, Channing Tatum, and Ice Cube all crushed it.</p><p>Though if I'm being honest, upon hearing Jonah Hill cured Kanye of his antisemitism, this was the first thing that came to mind:</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">When Ye says Jonah Hill and 21 Jump Street made him not hate Jews anymore\u2026 <a href=\"https://t.co/li7hMVXcdo\">pic.twitter.com/li7hMVXcdo</a><br />\u2014 Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1639947441733607425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'll let everyone else on all the internets argue about Kanye's sincerity. It's more important to know when the movie is coming out.
