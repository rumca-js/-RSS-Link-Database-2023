Here is the long awaited extreme durability test of the Pico 4. I figured before I do a proper review it would be more than worth it to do the exact same tests I did on the Quest 2 when it released to see EXACTLY how strong the headsets are against each other.\n\nHere I do a headset and controller drop test, controller bash test, lens scratch test, dryer machine test, and headstrap flexibility test. SO! Will the Pico 4 survive?\n\nLinks:\nPolywatch:\nhttps://amzn.to/42JjQEs\nMy Pico 4 Headstrap Upgrade:\nhttps://amzn.to/3TJruu8\n\n\nMy links:\nSupport Content Like this on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\nDiscord: \nhttps://discord.gg/thrill\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Thrilluwu\nOutro Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6JwgNQDVfI", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8JnFHydSlA", "date_published": "2023-03-26 17:09:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
