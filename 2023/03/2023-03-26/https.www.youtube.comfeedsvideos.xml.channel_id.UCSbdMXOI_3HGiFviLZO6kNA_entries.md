Hello! Here is the long awaited extreme durability test of the Pico 4. I figured before I do a proper review it would be more than worth it to do the exact same tests I did on the Quest 2 when it released to see EXACTLY how strong the headsets are against each other.

Here I do a headset and controller drop test, controller bash test, lens scratch test, dryer machine test, and headstrap flexibility test. SO! Will the Pico 4 survive?
