Carmen (Aline K\u00fcppenheim) is a chic older woman whose marriage to a doctor has afforded her an enviably sheltered lifestyle. Her primary concern when we meet her is choosing exactly the right paint colour for the renovations on her summer home. But then the local priest persuades her to care for a wounded radical, El\u00edas (Nicol\u00e1s Sep\u00falveda), and Carmen starts to realise just how dangerous her country is for those who dare to disagree with its leaders.</p><p>K\u00fcppenheim is terrific, her precision and restraint in the role drawing us into the story. Mari\u00e1 Portugal\u2019s analogue electronic score is eerily atmospheric. And a recurring motif of shoes reminds us of the importance of toeing the Pinochet line.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/26/1976-review-manuela-martelli-a-compelling-drama-of-privilege-and-dissent-in-pinochets-chile\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/26/1976-review-manuela-martelli-a-compelling-drama-of-privilege-and-dissent-in-pinochets-chile", "date_published": "2023-03-26 11:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
