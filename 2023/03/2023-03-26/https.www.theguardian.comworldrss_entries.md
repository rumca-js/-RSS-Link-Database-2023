<p>The government is yet to strike a deal that will get its safeguard mechanism bill through the upper house. Follow the day’s politics live</p><p>Federal Liberal MP <strong>Paul Fletcher</strong>, whose electorate of Bradfield covers northern Sydney, is now speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast and he thinks the NSW election loss was down to time.</p><p>I think the first point is that after three terms and 12 years, inevitably, it becomes harder to win a fourth term.</p><p>It’s the nature of our democracy of Australian democracy that the electorate starts to look for alternatives.</p><p>These are not laws which will hand over to the voice without Parliament being able to control it, the extent to which weight has to be given to what the voice says by the executive government from time to time. That’s within the Parliament’s control.</p><p>And it is simply not the case that there is any prospect of litigation that would cause even a slight tick up to executive government.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/27/australia-politics-live-john-howard-moira-deeming-anthony-albanese-chris-minns-new-south-wales-election-peter-dutton-safeguard-mechanism-greens-adam-bandt-vic-qld">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Unions, regulators and NHS England all say staff shortages are affecting health of medics and patients</p><p>“There’s a gap today that no locum filled, so I am carrying both bleeps and doing the work of two people.” That recent tweet, by a children’s doctor, is one of many examples posted on social media by medics illustrating how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/26/nhs-england-staff-shortages-could-exceed-570000-by-2036-study-finds">NHS staff shortages</a> affect them, patients, the smooth running of important services – and, sometimes, the safety of those who are receiving care.</p><p>It is a concern shared by every organisation that represents frontline staff, by regulators such as the Care Quality Commission (CQC), and by NHS England, the body that oversees the service. Just as one example, in January the CQC reported that an inspection it had undertaken of Colchester hospital in Essex found patients were missing out on meals because there were too few staff on duty to feed them. Some patients were wearing dirty dressings, and others did not have their call bells answered promptly, for the same reason.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/26/will-jeremy-hunt-foot-the-bill-for-nhs-staffing-the-signs-arent-promising">Continue reading...</a>
