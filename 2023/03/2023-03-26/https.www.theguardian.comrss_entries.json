It doesn\u2019t sound particularly appetising. Not even for those of us who count ourselves among the 50% of the population that love Marmite (which is famously made from the dead yeast cells, or lees, left over in beer production). I mean, by all means take the wine lees and turn them into a wine-based variation of our favourite savoury yeasty spread (Marwine? Now there\u2019s an idea). But why make a big deal, as some producers do, of harnessing them in a drink that is supposed to be all about the flavour of grapes? The reason is that lees can play an important part in bringing creamier, weightier texture and more savoury, yeasty flavours to some white and sparkling wines. Indeed, sometimes the practice is crucial to a local style, such as the white wines of Muscadet on the Loire estuary in western France, where ageing on the lees or \u201csur lie\u201d brings the subtle salty-yeasty dimension you find in brisk dry whites such as Ch\u00e2teau de la Petite Giraudi\u00e8re\u2019s.</p><p><strong>Vi\u00f1a Lareira Albari\u00f1o Sobre L\u00edas, R\u00edas Baixas, Spain 2021 (\u00a312.99, <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/\">Waitrose</a>) </strong>All wines will have lees leftover from the fermentation process. Some will naturally fall to the bottom of the fermentation vessel along with skin, stem, pips, and other particles, forming a mush known as the gross lees, which are generally separated from the wine immediately. Others, known to winemakers as the fine lees, will remain suspended for longer in the liquid, and, while many winemakers will filter them out, others will leave them in for days, weeks, months or even years depending on the style of wine they\u2019re after. That might include a process known as b\u00e2tonnage, stirring the tank with a special baton to agitate the settled lees like tea leaves for extra enriching effect. Extended lees ageing is a common way for winemakers working with zesty, refreshing whites to add something a bit different to their range \u2013 in Spain, for example, you will often find producers making a \u201csobre l\u00edas\u201d cuvee as a \u201cstep up\u201d from their everyday bottling, as in the satisfyingly substantial but still citrus-fresh and succulently peachy Vi\u00f1a Lareira.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/26/marmite-to-muscadet-the-dead-yeast-cells-adding-flavour-to-wines\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/26/marmite-to-muscadet-the-dead-yeast-cells-adding-flavour-to-wines", "date_published": "2023-03-26 05:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "There\u2019s no greater feminist cause than the climate fight \u2013 and saving each other", "description": "<p>When my country, Pakistan, flooded last year, women faced particular suffering.
