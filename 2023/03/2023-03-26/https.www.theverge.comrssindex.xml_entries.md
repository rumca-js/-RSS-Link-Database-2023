  <p id="GApxVq">Although the expected launch of Apple’s mixed-reality headset is just months away, some employees don’t seem to think the device is ready yet, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/26/technology/apple-augmented-reality-dissent.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">a report from <em>The New York Times</em></a>. While some employees reportedly exited the project due to their doubts, others remain skeptical about the headset’s potential for success — especially at a price point of $3,000.</p>
<p id="oSsJqL">Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23601588/apple-wwdc-vr-ar-mixed-reality-launch-rumor">widely expected to reveal</a> the headset at its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-03-26/apple-reality-headset-details-pro-features-top-100-meeting-watch-like-start-lfpgdgdb?cmpid=BBD032623_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=230326&amp;utm_campaign=poweron&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple recently demoed the device in front of Apple’s top 100 executives at the Steve Jobs Theater in California, “suggesting that a public unveiling is getting close.”</p>

  <p id="lm0CoD">The Wii U and Nintendo 3DS digital storefronts are shutting down tomorrow, March 27th, 2023. While you’ll no longer be able to purchase games or DLC from either eShop, you’ll still be able to redownload the games you’ve already bought and play online for the time being.</p>
<p id="JFvmQT"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/19/23269792/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-eshop-closing-date-2023">Nintendo first warned us of the shutdown last year</a> and started barring users from loading money into the Wii U and 3DS eShops in August. Sadly, this imminent shutdown means we’ll have to bid farewell to the hundreds of great digital-only titles available on either store, such as <em>Dr. Luigi</em>, <em>Pokemon Rumble U</em>, <em>Pushmo</em>, <em>Pokémon Picross</em>, and many others. </p>
<p id="THeLao">The closures will also make it impossible to purchase the full range of Virtual Console games on the 3DS and Wii U, which...</p>

  <p id="tGv0i4">Elon Musk has put a $20 billion value on Twitter, making up less than half of the $44 billion Musk paid to acquire the site, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1639737042828673024?s=20">reports from <em>Platformer</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musk-puts-20-billion-value-on-twitter"><em>The Information</em></a>. In a memo sent to staff viewed by <em>Platformer</em>’s Zoë Schiffer, Musk reportedly says that employees will receive stock grants based on Twitter’s $20 billion valuation.</p>
<p id="BLs5nD">Musk stated last year that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/16/23513407/elon-musk-equity-investment-sucker-born-every-minute">he’s “obviously overpaying” for Twitter</a> at $54.20 per share. Price was also one of the reasons why he attempted to back out of the deal last year, claiming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/8/23200961/elon-musk-files-back-out-twitter-deal-breach-of-contract">that the company made false and misleading statements</a> about the presence of bots on the platform.</p>

  <p id="UugSmz">Apple could soon launch a USB-C version of its second-gen AirPods Pro. That’s according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1639249902483173376?s=20">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, who believes the company could start shipping the earbuds with a USB-C case during the second and third quarters of this year.</p>
<p id="5RrSZT">This apparently doesn’t apply to Apple’s standard AirPod models, though, as Kuo notes that the company “currently appears to have no plans for USB-C versions of the AirPods 2 &amp; 3.” Kuo hinted at the change in response to a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1638248393070768147?s=20">Twitter user @aaronp613</a>, who spotted references to a new AirPods model number (A3048), along with a new AirPods case model number (A29680) in iOS 16.4.</p>

## ChatGPT started a new kind of AI race — and made text boxes cool again

  <p id="SO9dBe">It’s pretty obvious that nobody saw ChatGPT coming. Not even OpenAI. Before it became by some measures the fastest growing consumer app in history, before it turned the phrase “generative pre-trained transformers” into common vernacular, before every company you can think of was racing to adopt its underlying model, ChatGPT launched in November as a “research preview.” </p>
<p id="OpIT98">The <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">blog post announcing ChatGPT</a> is now a hilarious case study in underselling. “ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response. We are excited to introduce ChatGPT to get users’ feedback and learn about its strengths and weaknesses.” That’s it! That’s the whole pitch! No waxing poetic about...</p>
