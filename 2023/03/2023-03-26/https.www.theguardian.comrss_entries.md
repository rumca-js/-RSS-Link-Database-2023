<p>The Oscar winner is so good that the rest of this adaptation from the Peaky Blinders creator feels like filler. But do we really need yet another take on Dickens’ novel?</p><p>My goodness, is it that time already? The Great Expectations adaptation seems to come around quicker every decade, does it not? There have been between 12 and 17 versions for film and television (depending on where you draw the line between “adaptation of” and “inspired by”) since the inaugural 1917 silent film by Robert G Vignola, plus about a dozen for the stage. You would be forgiven for suggesting that Charles Dickens’s 1861 bestseller has delighted us long enough and that perhaps it is time for another author to get a look-in. (Or you could start by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/13/what-the-dickens-do-we-really-need-another-tv-great-expectations">adapting a different Dickens</a>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/22/hard-times-review-northern-broadsides-dickens-halifax-viaduct">Hard Times</a> might go down well.

She appears only in the final few scenes of the opening episode, which was the only one available for review, but it is clear that Colman is her predictably excellent self; there is a risk she will reduce everything else to filler while viewers await her next mesmerising appearance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/26/bbc-great-expectations-review-olivia-colman-is-mesmerisingly-sinister">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Prof Colin Richards </strong>stands by his 1990s criticism of the schools regulator, <strong>Michael Pyke</strong> says it was set up to enforce a marketised system, and other readers give their views</p><p>Twenty-six years ago, following a contentious departure from Ofsted, I wrote an article for the Guardian (The high price of inspection, 3 June 1997). Little did I realise how high that price would be in terms of teachers’ mental health, ruined careers, demoralised schools, retention crises and, in extreme cases, individuals’ suicides (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/24/punishing-ofsted-regime-driving-out-education-school-leaders" title="">Punishing Ofsted regime is driving us out of education, say school leaders, 24 March</a>). Doubtless many schools did improve as a result of Ofsted inspections, but some did not. Some schools benefited from, and gloried in, Ofsted accolades, but many did not. In the many negative instances, both children’s and teachers’ interests were poorly served.</p><p>I finished my article with: “There has to be a better way.” I still stand by that contention, and not just through removing misleading, simplistic overall grades. A better way can be found by drawing on the previous experiences of HM Inspectorate of Schools, abolished in 1992, and on inspection systems in other jurisdictions, including Wales. That will require political goodwill, as evidenced in Labour’s education plans, and determined but humane leadership once the current cloth-eared, ideological chief inspector steps down, or is forced to do so.<br /><strong>Prof Colin Richards</strong><br /><em>Spark Bridge, Cumbria</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/26/ofsted-can-be-summed-up-in-one-word-inadequate">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on teacher shortages: signs of a profession in crisis | Editorial

<p>Teachers are buckling under the pressure of workloads and the Ofsted regime. Fixing this will start with raising salaries</p><p>Do more with less. This has been the government’s expectation of every public sector employee since 2010. In education, this has led to stagnant wages and unsustainable workloads, compounded by a punitive Ofsted inspection process that heaps stress upon teachers and can condemn a school to failure in a single sentence. Many are leaving the profession: vacancies in England<strong> </strong>have almost doubled since the pandemic, according to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/23/teacher-vacancies-in-england-93-higher-than-pre-pandemic-study-finds" title="">recent report</a>. As a result, teachers are being forced to teach more classes outside their specialism. The risk is a creeping deprofessionalisation of the sector that will have a <a href="https://www.nfer.ac.uk/news-events/press-releases/use-of-non-specialist-teachers-could-have-negative-impact-on-learning/" title="">negative impact</a> on learning.</p><p>This crisis has been building for years. Austerity has led to fewer support staff, leaving teachers to cope with a rising tide of mental health and social issues. Meanwhile, a succession of below-inflation pay rises over the last decade means teacher earnings have fallen by <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/what-has-happened-teacher-pay-england#:~:text=New%20and%20inexperienced%20teachers%20received,salaries%20for%20over%2015%20years." title="">13% in real terms</a> since 2010. It is not just <a href="https://www.nfer.ac.uk/media/5286/teacher_labour_market_in_england_annual_report_2023.pdf" title="">absolute pay</a> that is forcing teachers to leave or dissuading people from applying, but the growing gap between teacher pay and salaries in other graduate professions. This is particularly acute in secondary schools, which have struggled to recruit maths and science graduates who can get better-paid jobs elsewhere.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/26/the-guardian-view-on-teacher-shortages-signs-of-a-profession-in-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The row over whether the pandemic started with a lab leak is growing. But the most important question is what we do now</p><p>We may never know for certain how a disease that brought the world to a standstill and has killed almost 7 million people emerged. While many experts believe that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak" title="">Covid-19</a> arose through human contact with infected animals, most likely via a wet market in Wuhan, China, a significant number believe it probably escaped from the city’s Institute of Virology. Others <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/newsletter/2023-03-14/coronavirus-today-the-problem-with-the-lab-leak-theory-covid-wuhan-market-coronavirus-today" title="">retain an open mind</a>. But politics has turbocharged a scientific question. Donald Trump hyped the lab leak theory <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim" title="">without evidence</a>; yet some scientists fear that, in the haste to challenge xenophobic buck-passing that was fuelling anti-Asian hate crime, others may have been too quick to dismiss entirely a genuine possibility.</p><p>The simmering, rancorous debate began heating up again late last month when it emerged that the US Department of Energy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/26/covid-virus-likely-laboratory-leak-us-energy-department" title="">had concluded</a>, though with “low confidence”, that a lab escape was probably to blame. The FBI agrees, while four other US agencies blame natural spillover and two – including the CIA – <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/covid-origin-lab-leak-china.html" title="">remain undecided</a>. Then, a new analysis of gene sequences taken from swabs from the market showed that some Covid-positive samples were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/17/covid-19-origins-raccoon-dogs-wuhan-market-data" title="">rich in DNA from raccoon dogs</a>, bolstering the case that it began through infected animals sold at the site. As the row gathers pace, Joe Biden has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/president-joe-biden-orders-release-of-us-intelligence-on-potential-links-between-covid-and-wuhan-lab" title="">ordered the release of intelligence</a> on the pandemic’s origins.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/26/the-guardian-view-on-how-covid-began-look-to-the-future">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Bath 36-19 Exeter</li><li>Hosts secure bonus point victory with five tries</li></ul><p>Fans wrapped up in the cold would doubtless question whether British Summer Time has really begun, but this was a convincing performance by Bath that suggests the sun will be shining in this part of the west country before long.<br /><br />Johann van Graan, the hosts’ head coach, will argue green shoots of recovery have been visible for some time but at no point this season have his players displayed such a potent blend of attacking intelligence and forward cohesion. Finn Russell will be a welcome addition next season but here, his future teammates often kicked with a similar kind of vision.</p><p>This week’s news that Thomas du Toit, the Springbok tighthead prop, will join the club following the World Cup is another reason to be optimistic. The blindside flanker Ted Hill, returning from injury to make his first appearance since the end of January, was typically effective, tackling hard and often claiming clean lineout ball.<br /><br />Indeed, it was a lineout catch by Hill that set the platform for the first try. Exeter’s most obvious error came from the No 10, Harvey Skinner, who missed an attempted tackle on Cameron Redpath in midfield. Having broken the line, the 23-year-old Scotland international showed pace and composure in equal measure to jink past Olly Woodburn and to the corner, where he executed a flamboyant dive.<br /><br />Ben Spencer, the scrum-half, converted but the Chiefs would soon begin to exert pressure at the other end, Solomone Kata showing strength and determination to force his way over from short range. Henry Slade converted.<br /><br />The spectre of a red card loomed into view when the referee, Karl Dickson, reviewed Beno Obano’s upright tackle on Kata near halfway; but he swiftly decided a yellow sufficed. In Obano’s absence, the Chiefs registered a trademark score when the Australian prop, Scott Sio, battered over under the posts and left Slade with a straightforward conversion, opening up a seven-point lead for the visitors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/26/bath-exeter-premiership-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

While 2016’s debut, <em>Free 6lack, </em>and 2018’s <em>East Atlanta Love Letter </em>both traded on the downtempo, bass-heavy R&amp;B balladry that made a name for Valentine’s contemporaries such as the Weeknd, his third record explores more uptempo, pop-leaning territory.</p><p>Across the mammoth 19 tracks of <em>Since I Have a Lover, </em>Valentine experiments with glittering, guitar-strumming melodies and energetic trap drums to enticing effect. Inwood Hill Park and the title number brighten up his usually murky musical palette with their acoustic backing, giving his gravelly voice space to breathe, rather than mumble. Other songs, such as Temporary, with its fractal breakbeats, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj2S36Qp4Zc">Talkback</a>’s electric guitar hook, further broaden Valentine’s scope from nocturnal bedroom beats to the dancefloor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/26/6lack-since-i-have-a-lover-review-from-bedroom-beats-to-the-dancefloor">Continue reading...</a>

She has been in the vanguard of raising awareness and sounding the alarm about unchecked AI. Her previous book, <em>Artificial Unintelligence</em> (2018), coined the term “technochauvinism” to describe the blind belief in the superiority of tech solutions to solve our problems. She appeared in the Netflix documentary <em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81328723">Coded Bias</a></em> (2020), which explores how algorithms encode and propagate discrimination.

Broussard is an associate professor at New York University’s Arthur L Carter Journalism Institute.</p><p><strong>The message that bias can be embedded in our technological systems isn’t really new. Why do we need this book?<br /></strong>This book is about helping people understand the very real social harms that can be embedded in technology. We have had an explosion of wonderful journalism and scholarship about algorithmic bias and the harms that have been experienced by people. I try to lift up that reporting and thinking.

It hit him hard – but now his nomadic path has found an unlikely end-point</p><p>‘I was in the changing room crying, I burst into tears because I knew what that moment meant and how it had escaped me.” This was Shayon Harrison in the aftermath of what should have been the best night of his life, a Tottenham first-team debut at Anfield aged 19. Six and a half years on, his first ever game as a professional it is still what defines his career.</p><p>Harrison came off the bench in the League Cup fourth round-tie and had a chance to equalise – but he miscontrolled an Érik Lamela cross, allowing Simon Mignolet to collect, and Spurs went on to lose. He would not play for Spurs’ first team again. Now 25, the Hornsey-born striker is playing in his fourth country, leading the promotion charge for Poli Iasi in Romania’s second tier.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/26/spurs-shayon-harrison-romania-interview">Continue reading...</a>

Suddenly, people had time to consider more fundamental thoughts about family life, caring, free time, and the horrors of the daily commute. By the autumn of 2020, the result was a huge amount of media noise about rising conflicts between people’s “core values” and their everyday lives, the choices they were starting to make, and the newly fashionable prospect of somehow exiting the rat race. And it has never died down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/26/life-work-tories-kim-kardashian-britons-government-class">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two married therapists reveal 10 ways to improve the many highs and lows of your love life</p><p>When couples get together, there is often the unspoken expectation that you will remain the same as you were on those first dates. An assumption that your level of curiosity, generosity, adaptability and interest will endure, or even increase, throughout your relationship. Even though we all know fairytales are dangerous, there’s a pervading myth that we can find our “one” or “soul mate” and have a problem-free happy-ever-after. This belief can create an underlying disappointment where expectations are unmet. In reality, relationships are intrinsically challenging.</p><p>We have been together for 25 years and the ups and downs of our journey have taught us not only that these low points are typical, but that the repair process can build trust and deepen intimacy. Through the difficulties we faced, we sought help in therapy, and now we both work as relationship therapists. Here is some of the tried and tested advice we use, as a couple and in our work, to get through hard times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/26/relationships-can-be-a-rollercoaster-ride-10-ways-to-improve-them">Continue reading...</a>

But Young is British and born in 1970. Instead of Bob Dylan or Lou Reed, she invites a succession of our female judges into her spotlit studio. You see them arrive, take their seat and try to keep entirely still.

<p>As the adaptation of her novel, little scratch, returns to the London stage, the author and Nottingham Forest fan traces the links between theatre, fiction and the beautiful game</p><p>When I was six, my family’s tin of felt tips began to deplete. I don’t know whether anyone noticed, or how many disappeared. Memory is fickle like that: it doesn’t care for the whole story. What I do remember is that, nights in a row, I would carefully select my least favourite colour before sequestering the pen in my school bag like a top-secret agent. The pens were for a boy in my class who had set me an entry fee. If I wanted to play football at break, then there was a cost. I knew it was because I was a girl, and that it was unfair, but still I handed over my felt tips. The only thing that really mattered was the football.</p><p>I never expected that my love of football and my life as a writer would have much overlap, but they do. The space for imagination – for what your mind can build – is vast in football. The experience of being a football supporter is complicated and dramatic, and that’s what I love about it. I love the emotions, the bias, the narrative built into watching a game.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/26/novelist-rebecca-watson-little-scratch-interview-football-nottingham-forest">Continue reading...</a>

## John Wick: Chapter 4 review – enjoyably pulpy slaughterfest

<p>If the plot of the latest John Wick outing offers no surprises, the stunts are mind-boggling, and Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins are fun new faces</p><p>You expect that the stunts and fight choreography of a John Wick film will be top tier. The director, former kickboxer Chad Stahelski, got his start in the movie industry as a stuntman after all, serving as Keanu Reeves’s stunt double in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-matrix">The Matrix</a></em>. Extravagantly showy stunt work is a given, and it’s the main reason to watch these enjoyably pulpy slaughterfests – certainly more so than the plot, which reprises the basic structure of past films, with Wick (Keanu Reeves) slicing his way through the countless henchmen of his former employers, the High Table. But even by the standards of the past Wick outings, this is remarkable. Human bodies are hurled into moving vehicles; Reeves’s double tumbles down the entire length of the Sacré-Coeur stairs. And, just to remind us that we are in the hands of an action master, Stahelski delivers one extended, mind-bogglingly complicated fight sequence in what appears to be a single shot, the camera floating overhead.</p><p>Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, who retains his fondness for neon tube structures and colour coding. But there’s fresh blood in the cast, most notably a deliciously insouciant Donnie Yen, as blind assassin Caine, and Scott Adkins, who is enormous fun as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth, all the better for chewing the scenery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/26/john-wick-chapter-4-review-enjoyably-pulpy-slaughterfest">Continue reading...</a>

In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/02/zach-braff-i-used-to-think-everyone-must-be-this-anxious">Zach Braff</a>’s strident addiction melodrama <em>A Good Person</em>, she plays Allison, a young woman whose life shatters following her involvement in a fatal car accident. Allison has everything going for her: she’s beautiful, musically gifted and adored, in an icky, full-throttle way, by her fiance, Nathan (Chinaza Uche). The only fly in the ointment is Nathan’s conspicuously absent estranged father, Daniel (Morgan Freeman).</p><p>Fast-forward a year and Allison is locked in a downward spiral. Her relationship is over, she’s hacking her hair with nail scissors, and she’s addicted to OxyContin. Realising that she needs help, she attends a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, where the first fellow addict she meets is none other than Daniel.

<p>The Ghanaian-Scottish architect is curator of this year’s Venice Architecture Biennale, and more than half of the participants will be African. The story of architecture we are used to, she says, is incomplete</p><p>“Africa” says <a href="https://lesleylokko.com/">Lesley Lokko</a>, stopping over in a London hotel on the way from Accra to Venice, “is the world’s youngest continent. It is the most rapidly urbanising and has the fewest architects.” It is therefore a place of instability and invention, minimally constrained by professional structures, where the “speed of change is likely to outstrip the ability to understand it”. Its countries, meanwhile, have on average the oldest political leaders, which makes for a gap between governance and the pace of events.</p><p>These factors make Africa, for Lokko, a place where the future is taking shape, one of unpredictable creation and imagination, qualities that she plans to bring to the ancient city of Venice, that highly preserved embodiment of things past, just under two months from now. Lokko is curator of this year’s edition of the <a href="https://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/2023">Venice Architecture Biennale</a>, the world’s most significant and influential celebration of things architectural. Under the title <a href="https://www.labiennale.org/en/news/biennale-architettura-2023-laboratory-future-0">The Laboratory of the Future</a>, she intends to get “Africa talking to the world”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/26/architect-lesley-lokko-venice-biennale-ghana-africa-wakanda-david-adjaye">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this hoot of an oral history the stars of 90s chart acts recall how their innocence collided with a cynical music industry</p><p>In 1996, Take That, Britain’s biggest pop act, broke up. This was headline news. It prompted tears, the rending of garments and, according to <a href="https://www.michaelcragg.co.uk/">Michael Cragg</a>, left a vacuum that needed swiftly to be filled. Britpop still reigned, of course, but Britpop “was a bloke-heavy swirl of guitar-led authenticity, coke-sweat and lad mags”.</p><p>Cragg craved the more giddy delights of pop and, courtesy of the Spice Girls, Steps, 5ive, Blue and S Club 7, duly got it. Its ubiquity carried him through adolescence, and later facilitated his becoming a pop music writer (for the <em>Guardian</em>, among others). Now convinced that 1996 to 2006 represents a golden age – after which, he suggests, the genre became drearily “post-ironic”, with everyone making “Billie Eilish-adjacent mope-pop” – he’s written a book arguing for its enduring cultural significance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/26/reach-for-the-stars-1996-2006-fame-fallout-and-pop-final-party-by-michael-cragg-review-the-dark-side-of-90s-poptimism">Continue reading...</a>

He could marshal the progressive tradition that has always eluded the liberal left<p>The Labour party’s 125-year anniversary is two years away. By then, it will have held power for just 33 of those years. The ambition to build a socialist commonwealth – a new Jerusalem – has not been realised, nor is there any prospect of such an outcome in the next 125 years. Tory England – its riches, its schools, its social influence, its press, the inequalities over which it presides, its stranglehold over what is considered political common sense – remains as powerful as it was under prime minister Lord Salisbury in 1900. As an exercise in political futility, there is little to match it. It is often said that the Conservatives are one of the most longstanding and successful parties in the world. What is less said is that it has been given a free pass for more than a century by its opponents.</p><p>For a leader of the Labour party named after its founder, this is not only galling – it cannot be allowed to continue. For Britain does have a great progressive tradition independent of socialism, largely rooted in the best of “new liberalism”, common law and our early embrace of democracy. Moreover, our core values – fairness, tolerance, kindness, openness, admiration for those who dare, championing the underdog – are also fundamentally progressive. The political problem for the liberal left is that it has never marshalled these forces successfully into a sustained political project or party. Instead of uniting in the manner of US Democrats, British progressivism has been fatally divided between a largely workers’ party committed to utopian socialism, at least in its rhetoric, and a middle-class party that so hankers after Conservative acceptance it has only a weak progressive spine. Throw in a first-past-the-post voting system and the past 125 years is explained.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/26/ignore-detractors-keir-starmer-radical-transform-country">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The country’s oldest Trappist brewery faces an uncertain future after a decline in people entering monastic life</p><p>For nearly 190 years the monks of Westmalle in northern Belgium have been involved in making beer. They began brewing in this corner of Flanders in 1836 to have an alternative to milk or water with their daily bread. Today, Westmalle is an international brand, producing 40m bottles of three varieties of beer a year, mostly for Belgium and the Netherlands, but also enjoyed by beer connoisseurs in Britain, France, Italy and beyond.</p><p>Yet uncertainties hover over the future of Trappist beer production in this traditionally Catholic country, where fewer people are drawn to a life of monastic contemplation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/belgium-trappist-beers-under-threat">Continue reading...</a>

## Could a chatbot write my restaurant reviews? | Jay Rayner

Artificial intelligence’s ChatGPT is becoming more sophisticated and polished than ever. In seconds, it will knock out essays, lyrics, poems, almost anything… But could it beat Jay Rayner at his own game?<p>One afternoon an email arrives that threatens to end my career. Or at the very least, it makes me think seriously about what the end of my career might look like. It comes from a woman in Ely called Camden Woollven who has an interest in my restaurant reviews, a taste for the absurd and perhaps just a little too much time on her hands. Woollven works in the tech sector and has long been fascinated by <a href="https://openai.com/" title="">OpenAI</a>, a company founded in 2015, with investment from among others Elon Musk, to develop user-friendly applications involving artificial intelligence.</p><p>In November last year, after $10bn worth of investment from Microsoft, OpenAI released ChatGPT3, a tool which has been trained on a vast array of data and allows us to commission articles and have human-like text conversations with a chatbot. It’s currently free to use and therefore clocked up 1m users in the first week. Within two months it had 100m users, making it the fastest growing web application in internet history. People all over the world were prompting ChatGPT – the initials stand for Generative Pre-trained Transformer – to write essays for them, or computer code, or even compose lyrics in the style of their favourite songwriter. If it involved words, they were getting ChatGPT to do it. And then gasping at the speed and fluency of what came back, while quoting lines from the <em>Terminator</em> movies about the apocalyptic rise of the machines.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/26/could-a-chatbot-write-my-restaurant-reviews-jay-rayner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Like TV journalist Michael Crick, I’m a fan of ties. But for precisely the opposite reason</p><p>Looking neutral can be a challenge. That’s my big take-away from LA fashion week. Did you realise it was LA fashion week? I nearly missed it. I only twigged when I saw a photo in the paper of an oddly dressed young woman holding a dog. It was from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i3bb66Tjak">Anthony Rubio’s show</a> – he’s a designer who specialises in dressing women holding dogs. I mean, I assume they’re allowed to put the dogs down while actually dressing. That would surely be necessary, particularly as he also dresses the dogs.</p><p>The dog in the picture – I think a shih tzu – had been assiduously scrubbed, brushed, combed and then had bits of cloth tied to its hair (fur?). It appeared still to be in shock from this process as its baffled eyes were bulging out in subtly different directions. The lady holding the dog just looked sleepy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/26/my-attire-this-season-anything-unnoticeable-david-mitchell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Why did Brighton bomber Patrick Magee risk all by checking into the Grand hotel under the pseudonym of a fellow IRA member?</p><p>Shortly after noon on 15 September 1984, a young, smartly dressed man walked into the Grand hotel at Brighton and asked for a room facing the sea. The receptionist offered number 629, on the sixth floor. The guest paid £180 cash for three nights. On the registration card, he gave his nationality as English, his address as Braxfield Road, London, and his name as Roy Walsh. Thus was born one of the great riddles of the Troubles.</p><p>Nearly four weeks later, at 2.54am on 12 October, the guest’s purpose was revealed when a bomb in room 629 exploded. It obliterated adjoining rooms and unleashed a blast wave that shredded the roof. A five-tonne chimney stack crashed down into the rooms below, sweeping all away in its path.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/26/false-name-brighton-bomber-nearly-exposed-ira-plot-kill-margaret-thatcher">Continue reading...</a>

If there is a recall byelection, the international media will gorge on the theatre of a former prime minister battling to save his political career<p>Just before the beginning of the trial, one MP was worrying: “I hope they don’t fuck it up.” He was not alone in being nervous that the privileges committee would make a mess of its interrogation of Boris Johnson and give the greased piglet hope of escape from being turned into spit roast. So the first thing to say is that the seven MPs on the committee did a professional job with a systematic and forensic inquisition. You will have been disappointed if you expected them to get him blubbing that he lied, lied and lied again about Partygate. But if you anticipated a confession of his sins, then you are clearly not acquainted with the character of the accused.</p><p>It was a familiar performance from him, a whirlpool of evasive waffle, obfuscation and misdirection. He’d remembered to get his hair cut, but occasionally forgot not to wig out in the dock. “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2023/mar/22/complete-nonsense-key-moments-from-boris-johnsons-partygate-grilling-video" title="">This is nonsense, I mean complete nonsense!</a>” he blustered at one line of questioning he didn’t care for. “The famous union jack cake remained in its Tupperware box,” he remarked, rather pathetically, when grilled about the birthday party in the cabinet room for which he received a police fine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/26/a-comeback-looks-unlikely-but-the-boris-johnson-carnival-will-continue-to-plague-the-tories">Continue reading...</a>

Ludo, Guess Who? Whatever game we play my son always seems to win – but not always by fair means<p>The boy is cheating. We’re playing Guess Who?, the popular family game in which two players guess the identity of their opponent’s character by asking questions and flipping down the tabs until only one remains. More accurately, we’re playing a discounted version of Guess Who? called something like Who Is It? or Identify Yourself! I’m not sure which, since we can’t find the box, and we typically resort to withdrawing the game board and parts from a tidied away storage sack, as if delving into forensic evidence from a long-dormant murder case.</p><p>I like this game. It hasn’t been ruined for me through overplay, since I didn’t have it growing up and neither did any of my friends. This is likely a statistical aberration, but I prefer to think Northern Irish people were suspicious of its clear ulterior motive; teaching children to be better at giving descriptions of political dissidents to the police.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/26/winning-against-your-dad-is-easy-if-you-cheat-ludo-guess-who">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prime minister says his £120m parliament building will set a new order – critics say the design doesn’t match that ambition</p><p>Some time soon the new parliament building of the world’s largest democracy, India, will open for business. No one quite knows when, except perhaps for the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and those close to him, but it has been imminent for months. There were suggestions that it would open in time for the 75th anniversary of Indian independence last year, but the high steel hoardings around it remain in place.</p><p>The £120m project is at the centre of a culture war. For Modi and his supporters it is a statement of freedom from colonial legacy, and a poke in the eye for the old governing class of New Delhi. It is the centrepiece of the Central Vista Project, an ambitious plan to make over the city’s British-built administrative centre. Critics of the new building say that it is an unnecessary replacement of the existing parliament, that short cuts were taken with its procurement and the obtaining of permissions, and that there was minimal consultation with parliamentarians and the public.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/a-fresh-era-for-india-or-a-ham-fisted-ego-trip-welcome-to-modis-new-seat-of-power">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Businesses want to trawl for nickel, manganese and cobalt to build electric cars and windfarms</p><p>An investigation by conservationists has found evidence that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/21/row-erupts-over-deep-sea-mining-as-world-races-to-finalise-vital-regulations" title="">deep-seabed mining</a> of rare minerals could cause “extensive and irreversible” damage to the planet.</p><p>The report, to be published on Monday by the international wildlife charity <a href="https://www.fauna-flora.org/" title="">Fauna &amp; Flora</a>, adds to the growing controversy that surrounds proposals to sweep the ocean floor of rare minerals that include cobalt, manganese and nickel.

<p>The poet’s Joni Mitchell-inspired memoir of her partnerless life marks an important shift in ideas about intimacy and solitude</p><p>A couple of years ago, I tried to create a playlist of songs for those who were, like me, long-term single. The result was not as uplifting as I’d hoped. It kicked off with a couple of bangers – You Can’t Hurry Love by the Supremes, Independent Women Part 1 by Destiny’s Child – but quickly got a bit too real. Goodbye to Love by the Carpenters. Somebody to Love by Queen. I gave up the attempt when I found myself weeping along to George Gershwin’s But Not for Me.</p><p>As melancholic as those tracks were, I never got as far as plundering Joni Mitchell’s oeuvre. After all, Joni’s art is scored to the bone with the pleasure and pain of romantic relationships. Her 1971 masterpiece, <em>Blue</em>, fairly groans with love and the heartaches it has wrought. The real-life affairs enshrined within its 36-minute playtime are well documented, from the two-year relationship with “My Old Man” Graham Nash to the soulful connection with James Taylor that gave Joni her title track. <em>Blue</em> may be one of the greatest singer-songwriter albums of all time, but it’s not an obvious soundtrack for stubborn, unshifting singlehood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/26/arrangements-in-blue-notes-on-love-and-making-a-life-by-amy-key-review-courageous-meditation-on-singledom">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Polydor)<br />Shimmering strings meet trap beats as the songwriter looks back in languor on her richly textured ninth album</p><p>For all the lacquer and haze of <a href="https://www.lanadelrey.com/">Lana Del Rey</a>’s heavily stylised albums, they have often been cries of pain that cut near the bone. “Fuck me to death, love me till I love myself,” she sings on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuY54A3bOmg">title track</a> of this sprawling ninth album. On the extraordinary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYqky795R1s">A&amp;W</a>, she despairs of ever being loved: “This is the experience of being an American whore,” she offers, almost offhand. At 16 tracks, <em>…Ocean Blvd</em> leans heavily on a combination of muted piano, hovering strings and Del Rey’s voice. That instantly recognisable instrument is by turns ghostly or Joni Mitchell-pristine, often multitracked, or accompanied by the backing vocalists whose first take opens the album (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZegtK54DC4c">The Grants</a>; Grant is Del Rey’s real family name).</p><p>But although one mood is uppermost, spine-tingling stylistic swerves happen too, where the songwriter’s old-timey atmospheres abruptly turn digital (Fishtail is just one example). Del Rey appears to have recorded a sermon from a pew and put it straight on the record (Judah Smith Interlude), while on closer Taco Truck x VB she reuses great swathes of her old song Venice Bitch, with added textures and trap beats. Elsewhere, the act of remembering, family and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.co.uk/music/features/lana-del-rey-she-does-it-for-the-girls-album-27426/">metacommentaries on her own fame</a> enliven this engrossing, audacious record.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/26/lana-del-rey-did-you-know-that-theres-a-tunnel-under-ocean-blvd-review-bold-and-enthralling">Continue reading...</a>

Benefits policies are simply aggravating the inequalities that shape British lives<p>From the cradle to the grave. Once that phrase was a description of the ambition of the welfare state. Now, it is an illustration of how far that old vision has frayed. An illustration, too, of the extent to which inequality shapes people’s lives, from the beginning to the end, often with the aid of policymakers.</p><p>Two weeks ago, in the budget, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, made a big show about the expansion of childcare, promising £4bn to extend the current policy of 30 hours a week free nursery care for over-threes to one- and two-year-olds too.

<p>Extra childcare won’t work without the right funding. And without childcare it will be parents throwing toys out of the pram</p><p>So I had this baby in lockdown, I mentioned it, I think – this fabulous boy, sort of oniony looking, divine. He grew gently and without much fuss, evolving over the next two years into a kind of Bernie Sanders-type, gentle, fair, tender, made a lot of sense when you thought about it. The tenderness has been a big thing – he likes sometimes to very gently stroke my cheek and solemnly gaze, and has gone through phases of identifying strongly with mice. Which is why his recent… change, into a child who screams until he’s red at the suggestion that he, say, might put a jacket on, has felt particularly galling.</p><p>This is not my first tantrum rodeo. My daughter, too, “found her voice”, to use the parlance of the parenting books, at a similar age, a voice she continues to find most evenings and some mornings, too. But while I might have spent the minutes she was screaming harriedly panicking, today I use the time to rock quietly on the floor nearby and distract myself with the news. Which is where I was when I read about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/14/budget-2023-hunt-to-announce-4bn-boost-for-childcare-in-england" title="">Jeremy Hunt’s plan for a £4bn boost for childcare</a> in England. It sounded good, it sounded like he had listened to the charity <a href="https://pregnantthenscrewed.com/" title="">Pregnant Then Screwed</a>, who recently reported that three-quarters of mothers who pay for childcare say it doesn’t make financial sense for them to work. But then the screaming cut through again and I wondered what this boost would actually look like.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/26/the-cost-of-childcare-is-enough-to-give-anyone-a-tantrum">Continue reading...</a>

He recalled a walk last summer past London’s Royal Court, traditionally seen as the country’s leading home for new plays, and where, at the beginning of the 1970s, Hare made his name. Indeed, until <em>The Vertical Hour</em> in 2008, it produced several of his plays.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/26/best-musicals-equal-of-great-plays-why-the-snobbery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There isn’t a single shade of pink that works for every style and every occasion, but there is an easy fix…</p><p>My long-held goal to discover the perfect pink lipstick has been disappointing. Not because there aren’t great pink lipsticks around. On the contrary, there are loads. But I have come to the realisation that there isn’t “The One”. Because one that is perfect today isn’t necessarily perfect tomorrow. There are so many variations on shades: reddish pink, purply pink, orangy pink, pale pink, fuchsia pink… you get the gist. You also have different textures and finishes. So depending on the occasion, the outfit and the look you are going for, you will probably need a different kind of pink. Long story short, don’t waste time seeking the perfect pink. Instead, start building a perfect pink-lip wardrobe – that way you won’t be disappointed.</p><p><strong>1.

<p>Claims of sexual harassment and poor facilities accompany questions over Isha Johansen, who says she did all she could as the country’s FA head</p><p>For Bilkisu Kandeh-Turay, representing her country should have been the pinnacle of her career. Yet, despite the arrival of Isha Johansen as the first female president of the Sierra Leone Football Association in 2013, it had turned into a nightmare. “We didn’t get kits, proper food, medical facilities, transport … nothing,” Kandeh-Turay says. “I started raising these concerns and spoke with some FA officials. They said they were planning to do something, but they didn’t.”</p><p>The talented striker, who went on to captain the under-20s team, was 17 in 2017 when she complained to the senior women’s team coach, Abdulai Bah, about the poor conditions. Kandeh-Turay alleges that he responded by sending her pictures of his penis and pornographic videos, as well as “asking me for sex every day” over the next few months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/26/ive-seen-hell-the-allegations-rocking-womens-football-in-sierra-leone">Continue reading...</a>

The anger on the streets sparked by raising the retirement age to 64 is the latest manifestation of dissatisfaction with the presidency<p>France’s relationship with monarchy has rarely run smooth. The guillotining of Louis XVI and his queen, Marie Antoinette, in 1793 was an early attempt at levelling up. Emperors, more kings and assorted republics followed. In 1962, Charles de Gaulle created an elected presidency with regal powers. To his many critics, Emmanuel Macron, the incumbent, behaves like a latterday Sun King – <em>le Roi Soleil</em> – in the style of Louis XIV.</p><p>It may have been the prospect of Macron hosting a sumptuous banquet for King Charles at the Sun King’s Palace of Versailles this week that finally prompted France’s embarrassing, last-minute decision to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/24/king-charles-visit-to-france-postponed-amid-protests" title="">postpone</a> the British monarch’s state visit. After weeks of furious, nationwide protests against Macron’s drive to raise the state pension age to save money, the optics would have been truly terrible.

The force’s leadership must act on the findings of Louise Casey’s review and rebuild its trust with the public<p>Professionalism, integrity, courage, compassion. These are the values that the Metropolitan police say underpin their work to keep Londoners safe. They claim that their vision is to be the most trusted police force in the world.</p><p>Those lofty statements appear ludicrous when set against the findings of Louise Casey’s independent review into behaviour and culture at the Met, published last week. She was commissioned to undertake the review in the wake of the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving Met firearms officer, who used his warrant card as a tool to commit his abhorrent crimes. Her findings are shocking and unequivocal, yet unsurprising to anyone who has followed scandal after scandal in recent years. Almost 25 years on from the landmark Macpherson report that judged that the Met was institutionally racist, Casey is clear that it remains so and that it is also institutionally misogynistic and homophobic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/26/the-observer-view-on-the-serial-failures-of-the-metropolitan-police">Continue reading...</a>

## The Conservative Party After Brexit by Tim Bale review – why conservatism turned into chaos

<p>The politics professor deftly chronicles the errors and ideologies that have brought the post-Brexit Conservative party to the brink of ungovernability</p><p>Napoleon was history on a horse. Since the Brexit referendum, Britain has been history in a clown car. We are now on our fifth prime minister in the six tumultuous years since that fateful vote. Some describe this revolving door of chaos as the “Italianisation” of our politics. Many have marvelled at how a country that used to have an international reputation as boringly predictable has so often resembled a banana republic with crap weather. And these years of almost unremitting mayhem have been unleashed by the Conservatives, a party that traditionally marketed itself as made up of hard-headed realists who could be relied on to provide stable, credible and professional government.</p><p>A lot has been written about what the Brexit misadventure has inflicted upon our country. Here, Tim Bale, one of the very best of our political historians, examines what it has done to the Conservative party. He contends persuasively that the Brexit virus has transformed the Tories from a mainstream party of the centre-right into an unstable amalgam of radical rightwing populists, hyper-libertarians and market fundamentalists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/26/the-conservative-party-after-brexit-by-tim-bale-review-why-conservatism-turned-into-chaos">Continue reading...</a>

The people of Britain deserve nothing less than that every town should have its own repertory theatre<p>May I, as a fellow actor and admirer of Derek Jacobi, add a word to his valued concerns (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/18/derek-jacobi-the-sound-and-magic-of-voice-disappearing-from-theatre" title="">Today’s actors have lost art of vocal technique, says Jacobi</a>”, News)? Here in Britain, we have had, for four centuries, the greatest of creativity in drama and theatre performance since the days of Aristophanes and Sophocles in ancient Athens. Since few politicians have a clue about this – more than 80% of professional performers being unemployed through lack of performance space – and most people are deprived of the opportunities to see live works by anyone from Shakespeare to aspiring young dramatists today, should we not now ensure that the theatre has a place in each and every community, akin to the free lending libraries and the parks? Every town and city should have its own repertory theatre, playing classics and local work by young and older people, with residential companies working hand in hand with schools and other institutions. As Laurence Olivier said in his maiden speech in the House of Lords: “I believe in the theatre… as the first glamouriser of thought.”</p><p>Who would pay for all this?

That six-hour rural ride to an older Russia, and to the house her grandfather had built, returned Sablin to the magic of her past. “The house smelled of pine cones burning in the samovar and my aunty’s blintzes.”</p><p>Over the following decade, she returned to Alekhovschina every summer, entranced in particular by the children of families who lived there, who played in the same rivers and forests that she had done, like characters in a half-remembered fairytale. Sablin’s pictures from the village, collected in a new book, <em>Years </em><em>Like Water</em>, capture that return.

## Marmite to Muscadet: the dead yeast cells adding flavour to wines

<p>Lees, otherwise known as dead yeast cells or ‘sur lie’ and ‘sobre lías’, create a unique flavour in some wines – and champagnes. Here are some of the best wine this week<br /></p><p><strong>Château de la Petite Giraudière, Muscadet Sèvre et Maine Sur Lie, Loire, France 2021 (£8.25, <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/">The Co-op</a>) </strong>Dead yeast cells in wine. It doesn’t sound particularly appetising. Not even for those of us who count ourselves among the 50% of the population that love Marmite (which is famously made from the dead yeast cells, or lees, left over in beer production). I mean, by all means take the wine lees and turn them into a wine-based variation of our favourite savoury yeasty spread (Marwine? Now there’s an idea). But why make a big deal, as some producers do, of harnessing them in a drink that is supposed to be all about the flavour of grapes? The reason is that lees can play an important part in bringing creamier, weightier texture and more savoury, yeasty flavours to some white and sparkling wines. Indeed, sometimes the practice is crucial to a local style, such as the white wines of Muscadet on the Loire estuary in western France, where ageing on the lees or “sur lie” brings the subtle salty-yeasty dimension you find in brisk dry whites such as Château de la Petite Giraudière’s.</p><p><strong>Viña Lareira Albariño Sobre Lías, Rías Baixas, Spain 2021 (£12.99, <a href="https://www.waitrose.com/">Waitrose</a>) </strong>All wines will have lees leftover from the fermentation process. Some will naturally fall to the bottom of the fermentation vessel along with skin, stem, pips, and other particles, forming a mush known as the gross lees, which are generally separated from the wine immediately. Others, known to winemakers as the fine lees, will remain suspended for longer in the liquid, and, while many winemakers will filter them out, others will leave them in for days, weeks, months or even years depending on the style of wine they’re after. That might include a process known as bâtonnage, stirring the tank with a special baton to agitate the settled lees like tea leaves for extra enriching effect. Extended lees ageing is a common way for winemakers working with zesty, refreshing whites to add something a bit different to their range – in Spain, for example, you will often find producers making a “sobre lías” cuvee as a “step up” from their everyday bottling, as in the satisfyingly substantial but still citrus-fresh and succulently peachy Viña Lareira.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/26/marmite-to-muscadet-the-dead-yeast-cells-adding-flavour-to-wines">Continue reading...</a>

## There’s no greater feminist cause than the climate fight – and saving each other

<p>When my country, Pakistan, flooded last year, women faced particular suffering. That’s true around the world</p><p>Last summer, a third of Pakistan was underwater. My country, the fifth most populous in the world, was submerged. Two million homes were destroyed, thousands of acres of agricultural land were flooded and 90% of the crops in Sindh, a food belt, were damaged. Thousands of kilometres of roads were rendered unusable, a million livestock killed, hospitals and schools obliterated, and 30 to 50 million people – a number as large as the population of <strong> </strong>Canada or Spain<strong> –</strong> were displaced and dispossessed.</p><p>It was the climate crisis that brought this nightmare to Pakistan. Pakistan has the second largest number of glaciers after the Arctic poles and thanks to global heating, they are melting at unprecedented, unmanageable speeds. Glacial melt combined with another consequence of the Earth’s warming climate, erratic monsoon patterns, and together they created what was called a super-flood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/26/climate-change-crisis-women-feminism-pakistan-floods">Continue reading...</a>

## 111 by Modou, Glasgow: ‘A banging recipe for a great place’ – restaurant review

<p>The innovative menu at 111 by Modou in Glasgow is really amazing. The story of its chef is pretty amazing, too</p><p><strong><a href="https://111bymodou.co.uk/">111 by Modou</a>, 111 Cleveden Road, Kelvinside, Glasgow G12 0JU (0141 334 0111</strong><strong>). Total Trust menu (Sunday/Monday) £25, Explore menu (Thursday-Saturdau) £40, wines from £23</strong></p><p>There’s one thing guaranteed to make a great restaurant experience even better: a great story. Glasgow’s <a href="https://111bymodou.co.uk/" title="">111 by Modou</a> has a terrific story. When rabid right-wingers, sodden with rhetoric, are attempting to cast all immigrants as feckless spongers, it’s one that needs to be told. Senegalese-born Modou Diagne spent much of his childhood in Spain. When he was 18, he came alone to Glasgow in search of something better. He had just £200 and at first slept rough. Eventually he found sanctuary in a church and then got into a hostel. In 2014, after a year of applications, he landed a job as a kitchen porter at 111 by Nico in Kelvinside.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/26/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-111-by-modou-glasgow-a-banging-recipe-for-a-great-place">Continue reading...</a>

## A failed revolt and an ‘embarrassing’ display: the week that saw Boris Johnson’s downfall

<p>In a pivotal few days, the ex-PM, who had swept all before him in the 2019 election and ‘got Brexit done’, found himself  with few allies and his influence draining away</p><p>For more than three decades the prospect of Tory MPs rebelling over Europe struck fear into the hearts of Conservative prime ministers. And for good reason. The premierships of Margaret Thatcher, John Major, David Cameron and Theresa May were all scarred and ultimately destroyed by arguments over the UK’s involvement in the European project.</p><p>Last Wednesday, however, something changed. A key vote on the Northern Ireland protocol passed through the House of Commons with ease, as the threat of a large Tory backbench uprising melted away. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, was told by the Tory whips even before the vote took place that there was nothing serious to worry about. The debate preceding it had lacked the Tory rancour to which the House of Commons had long become accustomed when discussing European issues.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/26/a-failed-revolt-and-an-embarrassing-display-the-week-that-saw-boris-johnsons-downfall">Continue reading...</a>

The enthusiasm with which new pesticides were recieved now seems naive<p>‘In 10m homes throughout Britain this morning, householders will breakfast and then potter out into the garden,’ starts the <em>Observer</em>’s 4 July 1965 report on the contemporary gardening boom.
