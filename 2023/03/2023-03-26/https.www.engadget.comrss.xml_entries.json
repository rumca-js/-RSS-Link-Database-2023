As a result, the show\u2019s first three seasons will not be available to watch on Hulu as of later this year. Notably, the deal reportedly gives Disney the option to sell the linear TV rights for all five seasons of <em>Arrested Development</em>. That means the show could end up on network television, much like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-27-netflix-original-bojack-horseman-comedy-central.html\"><em><ins>BoJack Horseman</ins></em></a> did in 2018. Losing <em>Arrested Development </em>would have been a tough blow for Netflix. After Fox canceled the series in 2006, it found a home on the streaming service and was one of its early draws.

I always wanted to learn more about cybercrime, but I\u2019d never interacted with a convicted cyber offender. Here was my chance.</p><p>I did a quick Google search and found his personal website. I reached out, explained my interest in his story, and waited. By evening, I had an email from gollum@anglerphish.com. I was immediately suspicious, but it was a legit address of Brett Johnson, the man from the article.</p><p>After a few email exchanges, we got on a call. He was super friendly and had the voice of a radio DJ. I invited him to come speak to my class at DePaul.</p><p>\u201cI teach on Monday nights for the next eight weeks, so whatever works for you will work for me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow about I hop in my car and come visit your class this coming Monday?\u201d he said.</p><p>I was a little shocked\u2014Birmingham, Alabama was a long drive\u2014 but I immediately took him up on his offer.</p><p>Brett was born and raised in Hazard, Kentucky, \u201cone of these areas like the Florida Panhandle and parts of Louisiana, where if you\u2019re not fortunate enough to have a job, you may be involved in some sort of scam, hustle, fraud, whatever you want to call it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Maybe there was something in the water because his entire family engaged in fraud. Insurance fraud, document forgery, drug trafficking, mining illegal coal. You name it, Brett\u2019s family did it.</p><p>Young Brett was a natural liar. As he grew up, he participated in the family scams.</p><p>Eventually, he branched out on his own. His first scam: in 1994, he faked his own car accident. Second scam: eBay fraud.</p><p>He reached his peak in the mid-\u201990s, during the Beanie Baby heyday. The Royal Blue Peanut, essentially a cobalt stuffed elephant toy, sold for as much as $1,700. Only five hundred of the dolls were manufactured, making it one of the most valuable Beanie Babies.</p><p>Brett was trying to earn some extra money. A Beanie Baby scam seemed easy and quick.</p><p>He advertised on eBay that he was selling Royal Blue Peanut for $1,500. Except he was actually selling a gray Beanie Baby that he dipped in blue dye to <em>look </em>like Royal Blue Peanut for $1,500.</p><p>He accepted a bid and instructed the winner to send a US postal money order. \u201cIt protects us both,\u201d he said via email. \u201cAs soon as I get that and it clears, I\u2019ll send you your elephant.\u201d</p><p>The bidder sent Brett the money order; Brett cashed it and sent her his version of the blue Beanie Baby. The phone rang almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cThis is not what I ordered!\u201d yelled a voice on the other line.</p><p>Brett\u2019s response was swift. \u201cLady, you ordered a blue elephant. I sent you a blue-ish elephant.\u201d</p><p>Brett gave her the runaround for a few weeks until she finally disappeared.</p><p>This experience taught Brett two very important lessons about cybercrime:</p><ul><li><p>Delay the victim as long as possible.</p></li><li><p>Victims rarely report the crime and eventually go away.</p></li></ul><p>Brett continued to perfect his skills and graduated to selling pirated software. From pirated software, he moved to install mod chips (a small electronic device used to disable artificial restrictions of computers or entertainment devices) into gaming systems so owners could play the pirated games. Then he began installing mod chips in the cable boxes that would turn on all the pay-per-view on clients\u2019 TV channels for free. Then it was programming satellite DSS cards (the satellite DSS card allows access to tv channels).</p><p>He was getting requests for his cable boxes from customers all over the United States and Canada. He was on a roll. Finally, it occurred to him: Why even fulfill the cable box order? Just take the money and run. He knew that no customer would complain about losing money in an illegal transaction. He stole even more money with this updated version of his cable box scam but soon worried that he\u2019d get flagged for money laundering. He decided he needed a fake driver\u2019s license so he could open up a bank account and launder the money through cash taken out of the ATM.</p><p>He found a person online who sold fake licenses. He sent a picture, $200, and waited. He waited and waited. Then reality punched him in the face: He\u2019d been scammed. The nerve.</p><p>No one hates being deceived more than someone who deceives for a living. Brett was so frustrated he started ShadowCrew.com, an online forum where people could learn the ins and outs of cybercrime. <em>Forbes </em>called it \u201ca one-stop marketplace for identity theft.\u201d The ShadowCrew operated from August 2002 through November 2004, attracting as many as four thousand criminals or aspiring criminals. It\u2019s considered the forerunner of today\u2019s cybercrime forums and marketplaces; Brett is known as the Godfather of Cybercrime.</p><p>\u201cBefore ShadowCrew, the only avenue you had to commit online crime was a rolling chat board,\u201d he told my students. \u201cIt\u2019s called a IRC chat session and stands for Internet Relay Chat.\u201d The problem with these rolling chat screens was that you had no idea if you were talking to a cop or a crook. Either was possible.</p><p>ShadowCrew gave criminals a trust mechanism. It was a large communication channel where people in different time zones could reference conversations. \u201cBy looking at someone\u2019s screen name, you could tell if you could trust that person, if you could network with that person, or if you could learn from that person,\u201d he said. The screen name on the dark web became the criminal\u2019s brand name. They keep this brand name throughout their entire criminal tenure and it helps establish trust with others, so the screen name matters.</p><p>When Brett was in class, he showed my students how information ended up on the dark web. \u201cYou can find social security numbers, home addresses, driver\u2019s license numbers, credit card numbers on the dark web for $3,\u201d he explained. All the information is there, practically begging to be taken.</p><p>In 2004, authorities arrested twenty-eight men in six countries, claiming they had swapped 1.7 million stolen card numbers and caused $4.3 million in losses. But Brett escaped. He was placed on the Secret Service\u2019s Most Wanted list. After four months on the run, he was arrested.</p><p>Brett has been in and out of prison five times and spent 7.5 years in federal prison. Today he considers himself a reformed white-collar offender.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-fool-me-once-kelly-richmond-pope-harvard-business-review-press-143031129.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-fool-me-once-kelly-richmond-pope-harvard-business-review-press-143031129.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-26 14:30:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
