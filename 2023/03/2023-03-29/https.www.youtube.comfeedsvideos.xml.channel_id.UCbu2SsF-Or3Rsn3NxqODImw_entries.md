We take a look at the newest Tears of the Kingdom gameplay and discuss some things that are happening behind the scenes, as well as some possibilities you may have not considered with combat.

Things such as damage numbers for weapons, shields, and how they interact with each other, as well as some questions about the new Fuse that might get you theorizing more.  Bow and arrow's elemental usage may have changed in multiple ways, and the Ultrahand ability also has potential as a combat ability with what players were able to accomplish with Magnesis in Breath of the Wild.

Our hands-on preview showed that Tekken 8's gameplay mechanics look to open up a new layer of depth for the series' tried-and-true 3D fighting.

Tekken 7 is a pillar of the fighting game community for a reason. It's the most refined that the 3D fighter has ever been--and there's nothing quite like some good-ass Tekken. Even so, there's always room to evolve. After I got a few hours of hands-on time with a preview build of Tekken 8, it's clear how it can take the franchise in a bold new direction. That freshness is the core gameplay mechanics, specifically the Heat System and Special Style, as well as smaller changes that reward aggressive play.
