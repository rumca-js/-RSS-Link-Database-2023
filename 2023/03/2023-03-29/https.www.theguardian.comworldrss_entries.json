The body said \u201cfully credible\u201d UK government planning was found for only five of the 45 adaptation requirements examined.</p><p><em><strong>Paul O\u2019Grady </strong></em>| Paul O\u2019Grady, the beloved TV presenter and comedian who broke on to the scene with his drag act persona Lily Savage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/29/paul-ogrady-presenter-and-comedian-dies-aged-67\">has died at the age of 67</a>.
