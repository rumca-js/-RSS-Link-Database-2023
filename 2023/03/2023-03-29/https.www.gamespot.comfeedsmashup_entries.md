<p>Although the Witness and its Pyramid Fleet arrived in our Solar System and entered Earth's orbit in the Destiny 2: Lightfall campaign, the sudden importance placed on an object called the Veil meant the fight instead took place in a futuristic city on Neptune. Lightfall has received criticism for its vague storytelling; despite nearing the end of the Light and Darkness saga, it left the Veil, the Witness's motives, and the metaphysical kaleidoscope portal on the Traveler shrouded in mystery.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie took the unusual step of promising more details on the Veil will be revealed as part of a mission during Season of Deep that will be available to all Lightfall owners, but for now, we're left with many questions. However, several other story threads found through post-campaign quests provide further context and interesting new story threads. Here are some key details we've learned after wrapping up Lightfall's campaign.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The Vex Network has its secrets</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Players last ventured into the Vex Network with the help of Misraaks during Season of the Splicer to end the Endless Night in the Last City. Now, we once again hop into the Vex Network because of its connection to the CloudArk, which holds together Neomuna and where the Neomuni have uploaded their consciousnesses while in a cryogenic state.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfalls-best-story-happens-after-the-campaign-heres-everything-weve-learned/1100-6512811/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Unreal Editor for Fortnite is finally here. And while over time this will change Fortnite into something that is so far beyond the Fortnite that we know today, nothing really has changed <em>just yet.</em> The beginning of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-creative-2-0-and-uefn-everything-you-need-to-know/1100-6512614/">Creative 2.0</a> is just a nicer version of Creative 1.0, if we're being honest. The future is extremely exciting, but it's going to take a while for folks to take full advantage of the UEFN.</p><p dir="ltr">While we wait for that future to arrive, the talk of the town has been two attempts to use UEFN to recreate Fortnite's Battle Royale island as it existed in Chapter 1 Season 3. Longtime Fortnite players have been in a tizzy over these, excited to usher in a new era of Old Fortnite. That new era will never actually happen, though, because the game was worse in every way and can't actually be fully restored anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">The first of these retro maps, Atlas Creative's Atlas OG Battle Royale, was a disastrous janky mess when it went live alongside the debut of Creative 2.0--though the Atlas folks have stabilized the map pretty well now. The second, Reboot Royale, launched a few days later and looks much nicer, but significant sacrifices were made to keep the map under the memory limit. But these are the first-ever attempts to build maps on this scale in Fortnite Creative, so some amount of jank is to be expected.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fans-are-nostalgic-for-when-the-game-was-clearly-worse/1100-6512814/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Mike Flanagan Reportedly Pitches Clayface Movie To DC, Claims News Is "Speculative"

<p>Horror writer and director Mike Flanagan and his Intrepid Pictures partner Trevor Macy had a meeting with DC James Gunn and Peter Safran and pitched a Clayface solo movie for DC Studios, <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/03/clayface-movie-mike-flanagan-warner-bros-1235312906/">Deadline</a> reports. However, Flanagan came forward on Twitter and addressed the rumors, saying they were speculative.</p><p>"The news today is entirely speculative," the director <a href="https://twitter.com/flanaganfilm/status/1641164300525113344">tweeted</a>. "When or if something like that ever becomes real, I promise I'll tell you guys."</p><p>In January, DC Studios co-head James Gunn explained that there would be two types of DC movies going forward. One is the DC Universe proper featuring films like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-to-direct-superman-legacy-for-warner-bros/1100-6512389/">Superman Legacy</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-announces-new-batman-movie-the-brave-and-the-bold/1100-6511018/">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a>. The other is DC Elseworlds, which will feature the Joker solo movie and the upcoming sequel, as well as Matt Reeves' The Batman. You would think a Clayface movie would be looped into the latter. However, Flanagan pitched it as part of DC's Universe's Chapter 1, aptly called Gods and Monsters.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mike-flanagan-reportedly-pitches-clayface-movie-to-dc-claims-news-is-speculative/1100-6512812/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## WoW: Wrath Of The Lich King Classic Bug That Went Unnoticed For 14 Years Finally Fixed

<p>One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a>: Wrath of the Lich King Classic's most powerful weapons has been more powerful than intended for 14 years, all thanks to a simple typo that went unnoticed by both Blizzard and players back when the weapon first debuted back in 2009.</p><p dir="ltr">The weapon in question is the Legendary healing mace <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/item=46017/valanyr-hammer-of-ancient-kings'">Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings</a>, which can be acquired by gathering fragments from the expansion's iconic Ulduar raid and completing subsequent quests. What makes the weapon so powerful is its special effect tailor made for healers. When using Val'anyr, heals have a chance to activate a shield on their respective targets that can absorb up to 15% of the amount healed. Ulduar released back in 2009 originally, and arrived in Wrath of the Lich King Classic on January 19, 2023.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">TODAY was HILARIOUS this is literally the funniest thing to have in QA. A war room going down where we're trying to hackerman out solutions only for the solution to be... a single fucking 0 tacked to a script causing things to break.

The shield granted by the weapon was always intended to cap out at 20,000, but an extra "0" in the weapon's spell script actually made that amount 200,000. That's a big difference.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-wrath-of-the-lich-king-classic-bug-that-went-unnoticed-for-14-years-finally-fixed/1100-6512809/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Mandalorian Season 3, Episode 5 Easter Eggs: 6 Things You Missed In Chapter 21: The Pirate

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4117703-themandalorianchapter21eastereggs.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The plot is really starting to ramp up on Season 3 of The Mandalorian. Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff) has managed to ingratiate herself pretty well with Din Djarin's Children of the Watch. Nevarro and Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) are once again under attack, this time by pirates, and a New Republic pilot wants to help--but the Republic itself doesn't. And Djarin himself (Pedro Pascal) and his cult-ish Mando pals seem very much like they're ready for more action after the battle with the lizard bird last week.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: This article contains major spoilers for the March 29 episode of The Mandalorian, Chapter 21: The Pirate.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Remember in the Season 3 premiere when a few pirate thugs threatened Greef Karga and Mando, and then Mando had to kill all but one of them before sending the last one away with a warning for the pirate king Gorian Shard? Well, that creepy seaweed man has brought his big ship to Nevarro and has the planet under siege.</p><p dir="ltr">Karga manages to get off a message to the New Republic pilot Carson Teva, who has popped up several previous times on The Mandalorian. Teva wants the Republic to intervene, but they won't--and so he tells Djarin and the other Mandalorians about the situation in hopes that <em>they'll </em>deal with it. Inspired by an impassioned speech from Paz Vizsla and Karga's promise of land on Nevarro, the Children of the Watch embrace the chance to flex their muscle against the pirate king.</p><p dir="ltr">While Season 3 of The Mandalorian has certainly not thrown around references to other Star Wars things as often as past seasons did, we've still got a healthy collection of nods to not just the greater Star Wars universe but also to our own. You can check out this week's selection of Easter eggs below.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Greef Karga loads up an astromech droid with a distress message like Princess Leia did</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4117740-themandalorianchapter21eastereggsastromechmessage.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It's an iconic shot from the original Star Wars film: Princess Leia leaning over R2-D2 after recording her message asking for help from Obi-Wan. Near the beginning of this episode, we get an odd visual reference to that moment with Greef Karga leaning over another astromech droid in identical fashion to <em>start</em> recording his message of distress for Carson Teva.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Zeb from Rebels</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4117742-themandalorianeastereggschapter21zebfromrebels.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>When Teva receives the message at whatever remote New Republic base he's living on, we see him chatting with a large CGI alien guy--this is Zeb (Steve Blum), one of the main characters from the Star Wars animated series Rebels. He doesn't get to actually do anything here, but the fact that they did the work to animate him should give Rebels fans hope that he'll appear elsewhere in this show or the upcoming Ahsoka series in the future.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Cameos by Deborah Chow, Dave Filoni and Rick Famuyiwa</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4117746-themandalorianeastereggschapter21deborahchowdavefilonirickfamuyiwa.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>In that very same scene, we have blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos by three major real-world power players behind Star Wars television: Dave Filoni, showrunner for The Clone Wars, Rebels, and The Bad Batch animated series; Deborah Chow, showrunner and director of the Obi-Wan series; and Rick Famuyiwa, producer and director on The Mandalorian. The three of them are hanging out on the opposite end of the bar from Teva and are very easy to miss--the shot above with them out of focus in the foreground is our clearest shot of them during this scene.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Tim Meadows</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4117748-themandalorianeastereggschapter21timmeadows.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>When Teva travels to Coruscant in person to convince the Republic to help Nevarro (there's no way this was actually faster than calling), the person he hits up is a colonel played by the ever delightful comedian and SNL alum Tim Meadows.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Carson Teva knew R5-D4 from the Rebellion</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4117749-themandalorianchapter21eastereggsr5andteva.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">When Teva flies to the Mandalorian covert to ask them to help Nevarro, Din Djarin wonders how he found them. "Someone I served with in the Rebellion is amongst your ranks," Teva says, before R5-D4 announces himself as the spy. While we have no idea about the specifics that Teva is referring to in this timeline, this is a clear nod to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mandalorian-just-salvaged-one-of-the-original-star-wars-droids/1100-6512142/">R5's obscure history</a> in the old defunct Expanded Universe. After the incident with R2 and the Jawas in the old continuity, R5-D4 worked as a spy for a Republic intelligence officer on Tatooine for years.</p><p dir="ltr">That officer wasn't a character in a story, though, but rather the in-universe author of a bunch of Star Wars Role Playing Game sourcebooks. Believe it or not, those sourcebooks actually were canon and helped establish a lot of baseline aspects of the Star Wars universe.</p><p dir="ltr"><span> </span></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Echoes of the Super Star Destroyer crashing in Return of the Jedi</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4117747-themandalorianeastereggschapter21crashingship.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>At the end of this episode's big battle between Gorian Shard's pirates and the Mandalorians, Din Djarin and Bo-Katan take out the engines on Shard's large flagship, sending it toward the ground in flames just like the Super Star Destroyer plummeted into the Death Star during the battle at the end of Return of the Jedi. But this isn't just a visual reference. This episode of The Mandalorian also borrows the sound of the Super Star Destroyer falling--a tone that gradually increases in pitch as the ship approaches the surface.</p></h3></p><br />

## The Worst Video Game Protagonists Of All Time

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115241-5512976936-ss_04.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There have been loads of great protagonists in video games over the years, from the exuberant Mario to the wise-cracking Dante, but there have also been plenty of… not so great video game protagonists. For decades, we've seen games practically ruined because the main character was either incapable of shutting up or incapable of not dying, and some of them have stuck with us as much as our favorite protagonists have. The worst video game protagonists have come in all shapes and sizes, but share one thing: our desire to never have to play as them in another game as long as we live.</p><p>For this list, we opted to stay away from silent first-person game protagonists, as their lack of direct characterization very rarely gets in the way of enjoying the rest of the game. Most of the characters on this list are <em>very </em>loud, and we almost never want to hear what they have to say, or scream, or sing. In fact, there are a few times we'd rather play as the antagonist, just so we could deliver the protagonist a swift, violent death. We can deal with the consequences of that.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sergey Nechaev - Atomic Heart</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115242-atomicheartworstprotagonists.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Crispy critters, Sergey Nechaev--also known as P-3--stars as the reluctant hero of Atomic Heart, and he sure doesn't hide his dissatisfaction with… everyone and everything. One of the biggest jerks we've ever encountered in a game, and that includes antagonists, Sergey is so unlikeable that dying in Atomic Heart is almost soothing. Incapable of saying anything nice to anyone and very capable of berating those around him for literally no reason, Sergey has basically no admirable qualities other than being pretty good at shooting robots in the face. If his incredibly powerful glove was a little less nice, it would intentionally let Sergey fry himself in a laser field or blow himself up with a bomb. He would deserve it, and more.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Lo Wang - Shadow Warrior</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115245-shadowwarrior3worstprotagonists.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, less is more. No one ever told that to Shadow Warrior protagonist Lo Wang, who cannot shut up for more than three seconds without needing to say <em>something</em> irritating. Whether it be making internet-era jokes that were stale a decade ago or rapping the entire opening to "Rapper's Delight" for no reason, Lo Wang has a way of getting on your nerves. His goofiness and apparent ineptitude are supposed to be part of his charm, but he still has to be an otherwise likable character for that to work. Look at Chai from Hi-Fi Rush, who is a complete doofus and yet doesn't feel the need to always say what pops into his head. At least everyone around Lo Wang seems to be just as irritated with him as we are.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Aiden Pearce - Watch Dogs</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115246-watchdogsworstprotagonists.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Prior to launch, Ubisoft had hyped Watch Dogs' Aiden Pearce up as a man "shaped by violence" and "obsessed with surveillance." What he actually turned out to be was a protagonist with the emotional depth of a piece of toast. Aiden Pearce never seems to actually get upset, or angry, or happy--you just assume he is supposed to be these things when the time calls for it. And despite referring to himself as a "changed man" in the game's final moments, we're hard-pressed to find any way Aiden changed at <em>all </em>over the course of the game's story. The good news is that Watch Dogs 2 delivered much better in the character department with Marcus, and the open-ended nature of Watch Dogs Legion at least gave a better reason for why your hero didn't have much in the way of personality.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Shadow the Hedgehog - Sonic series</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115541-shadowthehedgehogworstprotagonists.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Sonic the Hedgehog was the cool, edgy video game hero for older kids who had grown out of playing "baby" games like… the universally acclaimed Mario series. But that wasn't intense enough for Sega, and we eventually were gifted--or had forced upon us--a Shadow the Hedgehog game. Not only is this third-person shooting platformer a terrible game in its own right, it also happens to have one of the worst characters in a franchise with a whole lot of bad characters. This is a 9-year-old on a two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew's idea of what a cool hedgehog would be, which has to include a gun and jet-black fur. All Shadow is missing is a Juul and a pair of JNCOs to truly complete his look.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>William James Carter - The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115542-thebureauworstprotagonists.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Cold-War-era The Bureau: XCOM Declassified could have been a great spin-off for the turn-based strategy franchise, building on its sci-fi mythos within a completely different genre. It didn't work out all that well, however, and one reason for that is protagonist William James Carter. Written with the characterization of a department store mannequin and with the stiff voice acting to match, Carter doesn't feel like a hero. In fact, he doesn't really feel like much of anything, and when I was given the choice to shoot him in the face and play as someone else for the last section of the game, I did not hesitate.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Postal Dude - Postal series</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115543-postaldudeworstprotagonists.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Sure, perhaps Postal Dude wouldn't make this list if it were 2003. But it's not 2003, and being deliberately offensive and peeing on everything isn't exactly hilarious now--you have to be able to pee on something with some <em>subtlety</em>. You have to hand it to Running With Scissors, in a way, for refusing to change the character despite the series' reputation going further south over the years. But that respect only gets you so far when you still have to play something as mind-numbingly awful as a Postal game. At the very least, you can have Zack Ward voice the character in Postal 4, so you can pretend it's Scut Farkus causing all the chaos.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Richard Marcinko - Rogue Warrior</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115544-roguewarriorworstprotagonists.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Richard "Dick" Marcinko has the distinction of being the only character on this list who is based on a real person. The real Marcinko was a Navy Seal who later found success as an author and radio host, but this character in the abysmal Rogue Warrior is a complete monster with a mouth that would make Eric Cartman gasp. You cannot go more than a few seconds in Rogue Warrior without Marcinko saying something unpublishable, often while actively murdering someone. The only redeeming quality of the character is that he is voiced by Mickey Rourke, who raps an incredible (and bad) song over the closing credits.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bubsy - Hell itself</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115574-bubsygross.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Bubsy games have never really been that good--the more recent ones and the abysmal Bubsy 3D would probably love to be called "not that good," as it is far nicer than what most people would say. The titular hero is not helping with this track record, as he's among the most annoying platforming protagonists of all time. His one-liners are grating after only hearing them a few times, and he lacks the charm of Mario or the coolness of Genesis-era Sonic. What we're left with is a bobcat who we would like to call Animal Control on, because he has become a nuisance to everyone he comes in contact with.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Gex - Gex series</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115576-gexworstprotagonists.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of terrible one-liners, Gex has to be the absolute king. The character hasn't gotten a new game in many years, mercifully, but his constant quips were among the worst of all time. Why can't we make our way through a platforming level with having to know why you shouldn't eat seafood at Edward James' Olmos' house? Why do we have to know about the time you played charades with Michael Keaton? Why do we need to know about Judge Reinhold's costume parties? I'm pretty sure I made all of those up, but the terrifying thing about Gex is that they might actually be real.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Duke Nukem - Duke Nukem series</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115581-dukenukemworstprotagonists.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Duke Nukem's character design--big muscles, sunglasses, and a permanent smirk--may have been cool in the '90s, but they have not aged well, nor have his lines about "balls of steel" and pointless profanity. Sure, they make for some funny soundboard prank calls, but playing a Duke Nukem game these days is a lot like listening to nu metal. You don't really want anyone else to know, and though it might be a guilty pleasure, even you can admit that it's pretty embarrassing. And also like nu metal, we wouldn't be surprised to see Fred Durst make an appearance at just about any time in a Duke Nukem game.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sir Arthur - Ghosts 'n Goblins</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4115583-sirarthurworstprotagonists.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Sir Arthur isn't annoying, rude, or outdated. That's not why he made this list--he made this list because he has got to be the weakest video game protagonist of all time. Play almost any other action-platformer, and you can take a few hits before you die. In Ghosts 'n Goblins, however, you are the least formidable hero alive--or dead. Get hit once, and Arthur loses his armor. At that point, you have to run through the level in your underwear. Don't worry, however, because the game is so frustratingly hard that you're almost certain to die just a minute or two later. Can't someone give Arthur a set of armor that actually works? Please?</p></h3></p><br />

<p>The PC version of The Last of Us Part 1 has been criticized for its litany of glitches, but one of the funniest ones seen so far is where the characters are dripping wet for no apparent reason in cutscenes.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/125a3gd/pc_weird_new_glitches_the_characters_get_wet/">shown on Reddit</a>, there's a cutscene involving Joel, Ellie, Marlene, and Tess early in the game. At the start, they're dry and having a conversation about smuggling weapons when all of a sudden they all appear soaked and dripping with water. In the Reddit thread, no one seems to know what's causing this glitch, but at least it's an entertaining one that doesn't adversely affect the game's performance.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">this is one of the funniest bugs i've ever seen: The Last of Us (PC port) characters "get wet during a cutscene for no reason" 💦😓<a href="https://t.co/tlI4F51a0q">https://t.co/tlI4F51a0q</a> <a href="https://t.co/suq5aD2FOq">pic.twitter.com/suq5aD2FOq</a></p>  — Dan Nguyen (@dancow) <a href="https://twitter.com/dancow/status/1641097731157499905?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">March 29, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Naughty Dog issued a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1-pc-and-steam-deck-port-is-getting-torn-apart/1100-6512788/">statement regarding the performance issues</a>.

Here is everything already announced for the big update, plus some potential leaks for new operators in Season 3.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Call of Duty Season 3 start times</h2><p dir="ltr">Based on the number of days left in the battle pass, Season 3 should arrive on or around Wednesday, April 12. These seasonal refreshes usually go live at around 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 5 PM BST.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What to expect from Season 3</h2><p dir="ltr">A brand-new season of Call of Duty generally brings a new 100-tier battle pass to grind for new weapons and cosmetics.

However, while the coffee shop Cafe Leblanc features as a location in the The Phantom X, a screenshot posted to the Persona subreddit indicates that it's run by an unidentified woman, not Sojiro. That's an odd choice, to say the least.</p><p dir="ltr">As some fans argue in the thread, Sojiro does tell Joker in Persona 5 that he'd like to sell the shop and do something else. However, this might also be a hint that the spin-off takes place in an alternate timeline, a story trope that's been used in the series before.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-persona-5-spin-off-is-missing-a-beloved-character-for-unclear-reasons/1100-6512801/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> is known for its extravagant events, so you can always anticipate having some fun new challenges to take on when one rolls around. In the current <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-spring-breakout-event-2023-challenges-rewards-and-new-skins/1100-6512769/">Spring Breakout event</a>, that means plenty of Easter-themed challenges, including one that is an in-game Easter egg hunt. If you're wondering where you can find the best spot to collect laid eggs, we'll fill you in here.</p><h2>Where to find laid eggs in Fortnite</h2><p>Here's the good news--laid eggs can be found all over the map anywhere there are chickens roaming about. That means you're almost guaranteed to stumble across laid eggs as you play normally, especially if you spend a decent amount of time in more rural parts of the map. However, there is a specific place you may want to visit if your goal is to collect the eggs super fast.</p><p>There are a lot of chickens roaming around in and around <strong>Frenzy Fields</strong> in the southern portion of the map. If you wander around the farm for a bit, you're bound to find a dozen eggs or more--so long as you can defend the area from other egg-seeking opponents.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-where-to-find-laid-eggs-during-spring-breakout-event/1100-6512795/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Activision Blizzard And NetEase Breakup Came After Bobby Kotick Felt "Threatened" - Report

<p dir="ltr">According to a recent report, the split between Activision Blizzard and NetEase was in part due to ABK's CEO Bobby Kotick feeling "threatened."</p><p dir="ltr">A recent report from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/technology/activision-netease-china-breakup.html">New York Times</a> has detailed what supposedly happened between Activision Blizzard and NetEase leading up to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-makes-a-major-change-to-its-biggest-games-in-china/1100-6509239/">announcement of the two parting ways</a>. According to the report, a call took place in October between Activision Blizzard and NetEase to discuss the future of their 14-year partnership, but both apparently left with "drastically different interpretations of what had been said," according to four people close to the situation, and based on a document the NYT had seen.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, in January World of Warcraft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chinese-wow-servers-shut-down-after-14-years-following-expiration-of-netease-agreement/1100-6510829/">became unavailable in China</a> due to the two not being able to make an agreement. The report noted that tensions had been building between the two companies before the contract renewals, with NetEase executives believing that Kotick had made "unreasonable demands" over the years. In 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-gets-100-million-to-make-non-destiny-games/1100-6459380/">NetEase invested $100 million into Bungie to make non-Destiny games</a>, which Kotick apparently felt unhappy with as Bungie was behind schedule on making Destiny content.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-and-netease-breakup-came-after-bobby-kotick-felt-threatened/1100-6512792/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## House Of The Dragon Season 2 Will Reportedly Be Shorter

<p dir="ltr">HBO might be aiming for a shorter second season of House of the Dragon than the 10-episode run of the first. That will reportedly fit the overall vision for the series, with the show's creative team supposedly plotting out Season 3 already.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://deadline.com/2023/03/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-count-season-3-greenlight-season-4-hbo-1235312044/">Deadline</a> says that, originally, the sophomore season of House of the Dragon was supposed to be 10 episodes. But that apparently changed to eight after showrunner Ryan Condal and author George R.R. Martin convened to chart out the stories and battles for each season.</p><p dir="ltr">That means HBO could greenlight Season 3 soon to start the ball rolling on casting and a production plan, per Deadline. It's undecided for how long House of the Dragon will ultimately run, with the report adding that Condal and Martin continue seesawing between three or four seasons.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-will-reportedly-be-shorter/1100-6512791/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## One Destiny 2 Player Has Managed To Solo The Nezarec Raid Boss Fight

<p>Destiny 2 raids are generally one of the toughest PvE activities in the game, as they usually require tight teamwork, coordination, and plenty of firepower, especially when you reach the final boss. At least that's the experience for most players, as one Guardian has managed to defeat the final god of pain himself, Nezarec, without any help from his fireteam.</p><p>The Snazzy Rock took on the former Disciple of The Witness all by his lonesome, using key Exotics such as Eriana's Vow and Sunbracer Gauntlets as part of his strategy. The Exotic hand cannon was useful for landing massive critical hit damage on Nezarec, while the Sunbracer Gauntlets synergized well with a Warlock Solar build that allowed Snazzy Rock to do some crowd control between damage phases.</p><p>A grenade launcher with a blinding effect was the other key part of this puzzle and helped keep enemies at bay as Snazzy Rock ran around the stage. The Root of Nightmates raid is considered to be one of the easier Destiny 2 raids, but it's still impressive that it took a month for a single player to earn this accomplishment.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-destiny-2-player-has-managed-to-solo-the-nezarec-raid-boss-fight/1100-6512790/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Much like its predecessor, the Sega Genesis Mini 2 is a stellar mini console. Due to its exclusivity to Japan, the Genesis Mini 2 has somewhat flown under the radar since launching last fall. Sega fans who are interested in the console should definitely take a look at Amazon today. The retailer is selling the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4D19JJ4?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sega Genesis Mini 2 for $88.19</a></strong> (plus $22.30 shipping), which is the lowest price we've seen. The shipping cost is high because you're importing from Japan.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4D19JJ4?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div><p>It's worth noting that Sega only manufactured 10% of the stock versus the original Genesis Mini. Though it's a bit surprising to see it available again months after launch, we wouldn't be shocked if the console becomes hard to find for a reasonable price soon.</p><p>The Sega Genesis Mini is loaded with 61 Sega games, including both Genesis and Sega CD titles. Some of the standouts: Sonic the Hedgehog CD, Sonic 3D Blast, The Revenge of Shinobi, Earthworm Jim 2, Golden Axe 2, Shining Force CD, and Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-genesis-mini-2-is-discounted-at-amazon-for-a-limited-time/1100-6506652/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Last of Us Part 1 PC And Steam Deck Port Is Getting Torn Apart

<p dir="ltr">The Last of Us Part 1 has just launched on PC, but players are incredibly unhappy with the port, with reviews on Steam sitting at "mostly negative" at the time of writing.</p><p dir="ltr">Naughty Dog's remake of the 2013 classic coming to PC has been quite the anticipated release, but so far it hasn't gone down well. The game just launched yesterday, March 28, after having been delayed by just under a month <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1s-pc-release-gets-a-short-delay/1100-6511155/">back in February</a>.

That's in large part because the port isn't running well for a number of players, with some experiencing frequent crashes, framerate issues, and the game taking a long time to build shaders on the initial startup. On top of that, the game isn't playing well on Steam Deck, though it isn't verified just yet. Naughty Dog has acknowledge the issues since the game launched, and promised to address them in upcoming patches.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us Part I PC players: we've heard your concerns, and our team is actively investigating multiple issues you've reported. <br />We will continue to update you, but our team is prioritizing updates and will address issues in upcoming patches.</p>  — Naughty Dog (@Naughty_Dog) <a href="https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1640844498535329792?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">March 28, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"The Last of Us Part I PC players: we've heard your concerns, and our team is actively investigating multiple issues you've reported," wrote Naughty Dog on Twitter.

<p>Forspoken will receive its first story DLC next month in the form of a prequel to the main game. In Tanta We Trust will be released on May 26 and is set 25 years prior to the events of Forspoken, detailing one of the key battles in the game. As Frey continues to research how to stop the Break once and for all in Athia, she finds herself transported to the Purge of the Rheddig, the legendary battle that was briefly spoken of in the game and had massive consequences for everyone involved in it.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Get ready to dive into Athia’s past and discover how the magic-wielding Tantas lost what they once were.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Forspoken?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#Forspoken</a>: In Tanta We Trust is out on May 26th for PS5 and PC. <a href="https://t.co/ZdSLsUHvfX">pic.twitter.com/ZdSLsUHvfX</a></p>  — Square Enix (@SquareEnix) <a href="https://twitter.com/SquareEnix/status/1641066471861387264?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">March 29, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p> </p><p>Within the lore of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forspoken/">Forspoken</a>, the Purge of the Rheddig is regarded as the final battle that eventually corrupted Athia's protectors, the Tantas.

For the expansion, Square Enix says that Frey will be accompanied by Tanta Cinta and she'll unlock a new set of magical abilities that allows her to use powerful attack combos against the invading Rheddig forces.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forspoken-story-dlc-in-tanta-we-trust-launches-in-may/1100-6512787/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Bobby Kotick had some harsh words for Sony in a new email to Activision Blizzard employees, where he serves as CEO. He pushed back against the PlayStation-maker's worry that Microsoft would kneecap Call of Duty on their platforms and argued Sony doesn't even really care about the FPS franchise. It just wants to block the deal, he said.</p><p dir="ltr">This all comes in response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-worries-that-microsoft-could-intentionally-make-call-of-duty-worse-on-playstation/1100-6512164/">Sony expressing concerns to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority that Microsoft could intentionally make Call of Duty worse on PlayStation</a>. Kotick addressed this head-on in his "March Update" email posted on <a href="https://activisionblizzard.substack.com/p/microsoft-deal-update-march">Substack</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"We all know our passionate players would be the first to hold Microsoft accountable for keeping its promises of content and quality parity," Kotick wrote. "And, all of us who work so hard to deliver the best games in our industry care too deeply about our players to ever launch sub-par versions of our games. Sony has even admitted that they aren't actually concerned about a Call of Duty agreement--they would just like to prevent our merger from happening."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-would-never-launch-sub-par-versions-of-call-of-duty-on-playstation-says-bobby-kotick/1100-6512786/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Tekken 8 Hands-on Preview Shows Evolved Core Fighting Systems That Bring The Heat

<p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-8/">Tekken 8</a> was revealed, my first thought was, "What could Bandai Namco possibly do to make another Tekken feel new?" That's not an indictment of the series, but rather a testament to how great Tekken 7 has been for the past eight years (or six years if we're talking about its console release). <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-7/">Tekken 7</a> is a pillar of the fighting game community for a reason; it's the most refined the 3D fighter has ever been, and there's just nothing quite like <em>some good-ass Tekken</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Even so, there's always room to evolve, and after getting a few hours of hands-on time with a preview build of Tekken 8, it became immediately clear how it can take the franchise in a bold new direction. It still has its diverse set of characters, each with their own unique fighting style and deep moveset, and it's even prettier thanks to improved visual fidelity and eye-catching flourishes that are made possible by the latest generation of consoles. That freshness I'm talking about, however, lies primarily in the core gameplay mechanics, specifically the Heat system and Special Style, as well as smaller changes that reward aggressive play.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Turning Up the Heat (System)</h2><p dir="ltr">The Heat system represents a fundamental change to Tekken's gameplay. It's a brand-new gameplay mechanic for every fighter on the Tekken 8 roster that, at any point, once per round, allows you to activate Heat to access new attacks, open opportunities for sick combos, and enhance your character's core moveset. Think of it as another meter that can create an advantage for you by allowing you to be more offensive in your approach; however, the intricacies of using the Heat system effectively is where the game gets more technical.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-8-hands-on-preview-shows-evolved-core-fighting-systems-that-bring-the-heat/1100-6512772/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
