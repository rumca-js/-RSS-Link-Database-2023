Bow and arrow's elemental usage may have changed in multiple ways, and the Ultrahand ability also has potential as a combat ability with what players were able to accomplish with Magnesis in Breath of the Wild. \n\n#tearsofthekingdom #zelda #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7vFv30Z9nM", "date_published": "2023-03-29 23:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "April PS Plus Games Announced | GameSpot News", "description": "Sackboy: A Big Adventure, Meet Your Maker, and Tails of Iron are coming to PS Plus in April, The Last of Us Part 1 is having issues on PC, and Atlas Fallen gets delayed.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tJfxfpDh_0", "date_published": "2023-03-29 22:08:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "TEKKEN 8 - Ling Xiaoyu Gameplay Reveal Trailer", "description": "She'll put you back in your place with a smile.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYVWfdlWa0", "date_published": "2023-03-29 13:13:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Tekken 8 Evolves Core Fighting Systems To Bring The Heat Preview", "description": "Our hands-on preview showed that Tekken 8's gameplay mechanics look to open up a new layer of depth for the series' tried-and-true 3D fighting.\n\nTekken 7 is a pillar of the fighting game community for a reason. It's the most refined that the 3D fighter has ever been--and there's nothing quite like some good-ass Tekken. Even so, there's always room to evolve. After I got a few hours of hands-on time with a preview build of Tekken 8, it's clear how it can take the franchise in a bold new direction. That freshness is the core gameplay mechanics, specifically the Heat System and Special Style, as well as smaller changes that reward aggressive play.\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Intro\n00:38 - Heat System\n03:10 - Offense\n04:37 - Special Style\n\n #Tekken8 #Tekken #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhrcoZsL1y4", "date_published": "2023-03-29 13:00:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Street Fighter 6 Cammy vs  Manon Official Developer Match Gameplay", "description": "Cammy and Manon dance across the stage in battle in this special developer match in Street Fighter 6. \n\n#streetfighter6 #cammy #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvmdw-sqfEA", "date_published": "2023-03-29 00:41:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
