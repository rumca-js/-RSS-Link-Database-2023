Kian and Ajay here from Vocode\u2013an open source library for building LLM applications you can talk to. Vocode makes it easy to take any text-based LLM and make it voice-based. Our repo is at <a href=\"https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python\">https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python</a> and our docs are at <a href=\"https://docs.vocode.dev\">https://docs.vocode.dev</a>.<p>Building realtime voice apps with LLMs is powerful but hard. You have to orchestrate the speech recognition, LLM, and speech synthesis in real-time (all async)\u2013while handling the complexity of conversation (like understanding when someone is finished speaking or handling interruptions).<p>Our library is easy to get up and running\u2013you can set up a conversation in <15 lines of code. Check out our Gen Z GPT hotline demo: <a href=\"https://replit.com/@vocode/Gen-Z-Phone\">https://replit.com/@vocode/Gen-Z-Phone</a> (try it out at +1-650-729-9536).<p>It all started with our PrankGPT project that we built for fun (quick demo at <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/0d0d68f1a62f409eb5ae24521293d2dc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/0d0d68f1a62f409eb5ae24521293d2dc</a>). We realized how powerful voice + LLMs are but that it was hard to build.<p>Once we got everything working, it was really cool and useful. Talking to LLMs is better than all the voice AI experiences we\u2019ve had before. And, we imagined a host of cool applications that people can build on top of that.<p>So, we decided to build a developer tool to make it easy. Our library is open source and gives you everything you need in a single place.<p>We give you a bunch of integrations out-of-the-box to speech recognition/synthesis providers and let you swap them out easily. We have platform support across web and telephony (via Twilio), with mobile coming soon. We also provide abstractions for streaming conversation (this is good for realtime apps like phone calls) and for command-based/turn-based applications (like voice-based chess). And, we provide customizability around how the conversation is done\u2014things like how to know when someone is finished speaking, changing emotion, sending filler audio if there are delays, etc.<p>In terms of \u201chow do you make money\u201d \u2013 we have a hosted version that we\u2019re going to charge for (though right now you can get it for free! <a href=\"https://app.vocode.dev\">https://app.vocode.dev</a>) and we're also going to build enterprise products in the future.<p>We\u2019d love for you to try it out and give us some feedback! And, if you have any demos you'd like to see \u2013 let us know and we\u2019ll take a crack at building them. We\u2019re curious about your experiences using or building voice AI, what features or use cases you\u2019d love to see, and any other ideas you have to share!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35358873\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35358873</a></p>\n<p>Points: 20</p>\n<p># Comments: 13</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35358873", "date_published": "2023-03-29 15:43:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Mirrorful \u2013 A developer-first way to implement designs faster", "description": "<p>Hey HN! Mirrorful (<a href=\"https://www.mirrorful.com/\">https://www.mirrorful.com/</a>) is an open-source developer framework that helps front-end engineers manage their design systems. We\u2019ve been building Mirrorful with the open-source community (<a href=\"https://github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful\">https://github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful</a>) and wanted to share our beta with you. Check out our online demo to get the idea: <a href=\"https://app.mirrorful.com/\">https://app.mirrorful.com/</a>.<p>Design systems can be thought of as the \u201cbuilding blocks of your app\u201d which makes me think of Lego bricks. Mirrorful helps you manage your codebase\u2019s Lego bricks and ensure that they are consistent across all of your apps and platforms.<p>We saw as product engineers how hard it is to get code to match Figma mock ups. High-quality design is a competitive advantage, so getting your UI pixel perfect can matter a lot, but is time-consuming and tedious.<p>When we worked for large public companies, we saw that good component libraries help, but engineers are often still dealing with tweaking small design decisions. There are a lot of inefficiencies. We also worked at a small startup and saw what it was like to not have a design system. No design system led to copy pasta code, and days of back-and-forth on simple things like \u201cwhat hex should i be using for the hover state?\u201d<p>Design systems are tricky to get right. Picking an out-of-the-box solution is easy to begin with, but one day you\u2019ll be cursing yourself due to lack of flexibility (we did!). On the other hand, creating a design system from scratch is super time-consuming even for the best frontend engineers. Mirrorful is our way out of this dilemma.<p>Mirrorful is completely open-source and written in Typescript. We\u2019re starting with basic design elements\u2014commonly called \u201cdesign tokens\u201d \u2014 such as colors, typography, and shadows, but have plans to expand our scope into more complex components.<p>As frontend engineers ourselves, we wanted a tool that lives in code but is visual. It had to be super easy to set up, but also prepare you for scale so you and/or your team don\u2019t end up copy-pasting everywhere. We decided to make it an NPM package (<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/mirrorful\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/mirrorful</a>) that runs a localhost editor and exports out your design tokens into any configuration you want: .js, .ts, .css, .scss, .json. It\u2019s lightweight with no design system lock-in.<p>Our product is completely self-serve: just install our NPM package. If you run Mirrorful locally, a visual dashboard will pop up at localhost:5050 that lets you manage your theme and export various configuration files directly into code.<p>Pricing is similar to other open-source companies\u2014we charge for cloud-hosted features and for premium components.<p>We\u2019ve built open-source/open-core projects before and love interacting with contributors from all over the world. If anyone has any opinions on what we\u2019re building, we\u2019re all ears. Check us out at mirrorful.com and at github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful and give it a shot!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35358535\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35358535</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful", "date_published": "2023-03-29 15:19:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "F2-NeRF: Fast Neural Radiance Field Training with Free Camera Trajectories", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://totoro97.github.io/projects/f2-nerf/\">https://totoro97.github.io/projects/f2-nerf/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35358360\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35358360</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://totoro97.github.io/projects/f2-nerf/", "date_published": "2023-03-29 15:08:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Effing-mad, an effect library for Rust", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/rosefromthedead/effing-mad\">https://github.com/rosefromthedead/effing-mad</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35358336\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35358336</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://github.com/rosefromthedead/effing-mad", "date_published": "2023-03-29 15:06:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "$335,000 Pay for \u2018AI Whisperer\u2019 Jobs Appears in Red-Hot Market", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-29/ai-chatgpt-related-prompt-engineer-jobs-pay-up-to-335-000\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-29/ai-chatgpt-related-prompt-engineer-jobs-pay-up-to-335-000</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35357978\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35357978</a></p>\n<p>Points: 35</p>\n<p># Comments: 30</p>", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-29/ai-chatgpt-related-prompt-engineer-jobs-pay-up-to-335-000", "date_published": "2023-03-29 14:41:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Ask HN: AI-generated spam pull requests?", "description": "<p>Are you seeing pull requests in open source projects that are clearly AI-generated?<p>We recently had someone open a pull request to our open source project and the code and the explanation of the code was clearly AI generated.
