<p>Let's be honest: you were probably curious about <em>Sackboy: A Big Adventure</em> when it launched alongside the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html">PlayStation 5</a>, but not so much that you were willing to buy that instead of <em>Demon's Souls</em> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html"><em>Miles Morales</em></a>. Thankfully, you no longer have to pay extra to indulge that curiosity. Sony has made the LittleBigPlanet spinoff (also available on PS4) free to all PlayStation Plus members between April 4th and May 1st.</p><p><em>Sackboy</em> is decidedly different than the core franchise. Where Little Big Planet is a 3D-enhanced side-scroller that revolves more around environment interaction and creativity, this game is a 3D platformer that revolves around its namesake hero's acrobatics. They all share a relatively uncommon co-op mechanic, though. Up to four players can tackle stages together, and some segments require teamwork to move forward. This may be an ideal game to play with your kids.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You have options if <em>Sackboy</em> doesn't strike your fancy. The newly launched build-and-raid game <em>Meet Your Maker</em> is also available for free on PS Plus this April, as is the hand-drawn RPG <em>Tails of Iron</em>. Both freebies are available for PS4 and PS5.</p><p>These new offerings won't make you regret a PS Plus Extra or Premium subscription. If you pay for those tiers, you recently received <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-march-include-tchia-and-the-ps5-uncharted-collection-184523537.html">high-profile games</a> like <em>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection</em> and <em>Tchia</em>. Still, it's nice to know that you can add one more marquee title to your library with very little effort.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ps5-launch-title-sackboy-is-free-on-playstation-plus-in-april-211530313.html?src=rss

## Renewable power generation overtook coal in the US last year

<p>Renewables are already producing more energy than fossil fuels <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-renewables-overtake-fossil-fuels-ember-agora-energiewende-111045685.html">in Europe</a>, and now the US is approaching that milestone. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55960">determined</a> that renewable power generation overtook coal in 2022, with 4,090 million megawatt-hours coming from solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal technology. These green sources leapt past nuclear in 2021, but widened the gap last year. They have about 21 percent share combined.</p><p>The shift came through the combination of increasing renewable capacity and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-01-coal-decline-leads-to-drop-in-us-energy-production.html">coal's years-long decline</a>. Wind was the dominant source of clean electricity, with the capacity jumping from 133 gigawatts in 2021 to 141 gigawatts a year later. Hydro was second, followed by utility-level solar, biomass and geothermal. Coal dropped to 20 percent share due to both the closure of some plants and the reduced use of others. Nuclear has remained relatively steady, but the shutdown of Michigan's Palisades powerplant saw it dip to 19 percent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It might not surprise you to hear which states dominated certain renewable energy sources. Sunny California was the leader in solar power generation with 26 percent of the output, while Texas had a similar slice of wind generation. Texas also has the largest shares of coal and natural gas, although its lead in those areas is only slight.</p><p>Renewables weren't the top power source in 2022 — that distinction went to natural gas, which claimed a 39 percent share. However, it's evident that clean tech has a firm foothold in the US despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-trump-coal-friendly-climate-rules-134057000.html">attempts to undermine it</a> through regulation. We'd expect the trends to continue, too. President Biden's administration has heavily promoted renewable electricity, including the approval of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-approves-vineyard-offshore-wind-130441299.html">first large offshore wind farm</a> in the country, while the EIA expects coal use to shrink to 17 percent. Natural gas may retain a comfortable lead, but it now has a new chief rival.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/renewable-power-generation-overtook-coal-in-the-us-last-year-200907783.html?src=rss

## Lamborghini's plug-in hybrid supercar runs for a cool six miles in electric-only mode

<p>Luxury sports cars aren’t exactly known for being eco-conscious, but Lamborghini just announced the company’s first plug-in hybrid supercar. The Lamborghini Revuelto, which translates to “scrambled,” should satisfy anyone’s need for speed, so long as they don’t look too hard at the battery life.</p><p>In other words, engaging this vehicle in all-electric mode won’t get you very far, just 6.2 miles from a full charge. That is likely not enough juice to get you to the grocer and back, but this is a hybrid vehicle not exactly intended for all-electric usage. With that said, the combustion engine charges the rather minuscule 3.8kWh battery on its own in just six minutes via regenerative braking on the front wheels, the company <a href="https://media.lamborghini.com/english/latest-news/all/lamborghini-revuelto--the-first-super-sports-v12-hybrid-hpev/s/a6dcb265-98ec-4a32-8969-2c9b761901c1"><ins>announced in a press release.</ins></a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Battery life isn’t the main reason people buy luxury sports cars (it probably doesn't crack the top ten) so the engine here is designed for power, acceleration and max speeds. The relatively light engine (480 pounds) pumps out 814 horsepower at a blistering 9,250 rpm. This is a Lamborghini through and through, with a multitude of air intake ducts located throughout to increase airflow for the engine, resulting in a power level of 126 hp per liter. The company says this is the “highest output in the history of Lamborghini’s 12-cylinder engines.”</p><p>The design is heavily influenced by aerospace engineering, with sculpted surfaces, pointed lines and hexagonal exhausts. Lamborghini also took design cues from its own past, like the vertically opening scissor doors from 1970s Countach models and the floating blade on the rear fender often associated with the Diablo line.</p><figure><img alt="The tech-forward interior of the Lamborghini Revuelto." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/7481e170-ce5e-11ed-9afb-148372df430c" style="height: 892; width: 1586;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lamborghini </div></figure><p>Of course, the interior is outfitted with all kinds of tech-forward components, like a 12.3-inch digital cockpit with a large center display, an equally large 9-inch passenger-side display and plenty of affiliated infotainment options. This is also the first Lamborghini ever with an advanced driver-assist system. Finally, there is an associated smartphone and smartwatch app that monitors aspects of the car’s status, such as fuel level, battery, range and GPS location. This app even performs basic tasks remotely, like activating the horn, lights and locks.</p><p>This is the first step in Lamborghini and parent company Volkswagen's plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lamborghini-will-go-fully-electric-in-the-second-part-of-the-decade-114537409.html"><ins>release an all-electric luxury vehicle by 2030.</ins></a> However, the brand hopes to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lamborghini-synthetic-fuels-2030s-193441991.html"><ins>continue making combustion engines</ins></a> into the 2030s that run on synthetic fuel. The Lamborghini Revuelto ships later this year at the eye-watering price of $542,165, <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/cars-concepts/lamborghini-revuelto-brands-first-plug-hybrid-model"><ins>as reported by Automotive News Europe</ins></a> (requires a free sign-up to read.)</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lamborghinis-plug-in-hybrid-supercar-runs-for-a-cool-six-miles-in-electric-only-mode-183728414.html?src=rss

<p>Apple has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjMvMDMvYXBwbGVzLXdvcmxkd2lkZS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLWNvbmZlcmVuY2UtcmV0dXJucy1qdW5lLTUvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMjQzZmNkNy03ZjExLTRmZTctYjk5Zi1iMTQzZjQxZjRmYTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcC7561WFWN5vV2XKJY_TXSbKph7wJpFc1iukqokI1Ki&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2023%2F03%2Fapples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-june-5%2F">set the dates</a> for WWDC 2023. The company's developer conference will run between June 5th and June 9th. It's still in an online format despite the pandemic fading into the background, but there will be a "special experience" at Apple Park on the 5th for developers and students. The company isn't saying much about what to expect (does the graphic hint at a lens?), but this may be one of Apple's most important events in recent years.</p><p>Rumors have swirled that Apple will finally debut its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-wwdc-2023-announcement-221042779.html">mixed reality headset</a> at WWDC 2023. The device, potentially called Reality Pro or Reality One, is believed to be a stand-alone device with an M2 chip, dual 4K displays, advanced body tracking and controller-free input — you'd use hand gestures and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-reality-pro-headset-ar-apps-development-171437870.html">Siri commands</a>. While the hardware may be aimed at developers and professionals (with a possible $3,000 price tag), it could include health features, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-headset-full-body-renders-facetime-202004300.html">full-body avatars in FaceTime calls</a> and wearable versions of many iPhone and iPad experiences. It might not ship until later in the year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other announcements at WWDC 2023 may be more pedestrian. It's virtually certain that you'll see previews of iOS 17, macOS 14 and watchOS 10, among other platform updates. There may be service updates, too. While we wouldn't count on updates to Apple's existing hardware lineup, we wouldn't rule out introductions for some of the first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-could-release-an-m3-powered-imac-as-early-as-the-second-half-of-2023-175959648.html">M3-based Macs</a>. The company did unveil the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-hands-on-192857444.html">MacBook Air M2</a> at last year's conference, after all.</p><p>If history is any indication, you should see beta versions of operating system updates soon after WWDC. Finished versions should arrive in the fall. As with past conferences, most of what you'll see is a sneak peek of what's coming in the months ahead.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-wwdc-2023-begins-june-5th-171718339.html?src=rss

## Apple's M2 Pro Mac mini is back to a record-low price at Amazon

<p>Apple's latest Mac mini remains a hot item, but you can still find some savings. Amazon is once more selling the M2 Pro Mac mini at a best-ever price <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1EZXNrdG9wLUNvbXB1dGVyLTEwJUUyJTgwJTkxY29yZS1FdGhlcm5ldC9kcC9CMEJTSEZTNlhYLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXFoLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyN2VhZWMxOC0wNzQ2LTRlOTMtYjc0Ny04NmFiMzI2NGE3OWUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV9wqu5TwXhx6uIiX4U3EQ3DOEigDcvtYmwQMuI14ZpZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Desktop-Computer-10%25E2%2580%2591core-Ethernet%2Fdp%2FB0BSHFS6XX%2F%3Fth%3D1">of $1,249</a>, or $50 off. That's a modest discount, but the tiny-but-powerful desktop has rarely been discounted in any form at Amazon. You can roll the savings into a mouse, keyboard or other must-have peripherals.</p><p></p><p>The M2 Pro edition of the Mac mini is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-mini-review-m2-pro-2023-140052205.html">great machine</a> that fills a typically vacant spot in Apple's lineup — it's a powerful but relatively affordable "headless" desktop. The system is quick enough to handle serious media editing and multitasking duties, but still gives you the freedom to choose your own monitor. Throw in the abundance of ports and virtually silent operation (even under stress) and this may be the your ideal machine if you want some flexibility in your setup.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This high-end Mac mini is still expensive, and you won't find front-facing ports or an SD card reader like you get on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-studio-review-m1-ultra-desktop-130044054.html">Mac Studio</a>. And for many, this may be overkill — the standard M2 is often enough for everyday use while costing hundreds of dollars less. If you crave performance or extra ports, though, the M2 Pro version is a fine computer that won't use much space on your desk.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-m2-pro-mac-mini-is-back-to-a-record-low-price-at-amazon-154839163.html?src=rss

Once I started playing the game, I saw it was using 102 percent of the Steam Deck's VRAM. Dropping all graphics settings to low got me under 100 percent, so crashes will probably be less frequent going forward.

<p>Old-school tech giant HP has just announced a refresh of its Color LaserJet printer line with an eye toward reducing both energy consumption and physical waste. The company promises that these printers reduce energy consumption by up to 27 percent, while the plastic packaging components have been reduced by 78 percent.</p><p>The decrease in energy usage is thanks to the company’s proprietary TerraJet laser toner, which HP says is designed to offer maximum sustainability. The new HP TerraJet cartridges that accompany these printers offer a lower carbon footprint than predecessors but allow for a 20 percent increase in printable colors. HP also says these printers have been redesigned for speed, so expect a 25 percent uptick in tempo when making prints.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These printers fall into two categories. The HP Color LaserJet 4200/4300 is designed for small businesses and remote workers. They offer a compact design (though not as small as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-20-hp-smallest-laser-printer-laserjet-m15-m28.html">some HP laser printers</a>),  two-sided color printing, two-sided color scanning, HP Wolf Security tools preconfigured out of the box and the HP Smart Admin Dashboard for making adjustments on-the-fly.</p><p>The HP Color LaserJet Enterprise 5000/6000 series, on the other hand, is for busy office environments with massive daily printing needs. To that end, you can actually perform some light editing to printable documents right from the device itself, without a PC. The touchscreen and analog controls let you highlight, redact, and markup, and HP says these printers offer the “fastest A4 laserjet speeds” around.</p><figure><img alt="HP 5000 series enterprise printer" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/81164c20-cd85-11ed-9bda-6df1e5131654" style="height: 2805; width: 3300;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HP</div></figure><p>These enterprise-focused printers also include built-in HP Wolf Security protocols and an upgraded document digitization toolset that automatically reduces misfeeds, resulting in greater accuracy when performing large batch scans.</p><p>HP says the 4200/4300 launches on April 1st in North America with global availability by the summer, with prices for the most expensive configuration maxing out at $700. The 5000/6000 enterprise printers also launch on April 1st in North America, with a phased global rollout starting in Asia throughout the month. These printers start at around $1,050.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/eco-friendly-hp-laser-printer-line-promises-to-reduce-energy-use-by-30-percent-153532920.html?src=rss

## Kia's EV9 electric SUV will offer Level 3 autonomy and a 336-mile range

<p>Kia is finally <a href="https://www.kiamedia.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/20108/kia-ev9-reshapes-suv-user-experience-with-superior-design-and-technology">sharing</a> some specs for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kias-ev9-electric-suv-features-three-rows-of-seats-and-a-striking-design-070933286.html">EV9 electric SUV</a>, and they may be good news for families planning road trips. The three-row EV will now include Level 3 self-driving (that is, the car drives itself in some situations but may need you to take over) in some countries when you spring for the GT-line trim. The planned Highway Driving Pilot will use LiDAR and other sensors to let you “take a break” from driving, where conditions allow.</p><p>The EV9 might also deliver more range than you'd expect for an SUV this size. Kia claims the RWD Long Range model with a 99.8kWh battery will offer up to 336 miles of range, based on WLTP testing. We'd expect a more conservative estimate from the US' Environmental Protection Agency, but that's still a very healthy figure for this vehicle class. There will also be an AWD variant with the same battery as well as 76.1kWh RWD Standard Range base configuration. The 800V charging architecture should give the EV about 149 miles of range in 15 minutes, and vehicle-to-load tech lets you power camping gear and laptops.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6e0aad13c9c646ca905465bea2b4192c"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Performance can be relatively brisk depending on the model. The RWD Long Range with a 150kW motor will be the slowest-accelerating model with a 0-62MPH time of 9.4 seconds, but the Standard Range edition with a 160kW motor will manage that run in 8.2 seconds. Opt for the AWD model and you'll get a dual-motor 283kW powerplant that can normally hit 62MPH in six seconds (more on that in a moment).</p><p>Like it or not, Kia is joining the ranks of automakers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benzs-next-generation-car-os-is-built-around-paid-software-bundles-223739063.html">locking car features behind digital purchases</a>. You'll need to buy items from the company's Connect Store to enhance the pattern lighting on the grille, and even to add a &quot;Boost&quot; that delivers extra torque for a 0-62MPH dash in 5.3 seconds. Yes, you'll have to pay for features your EV9 can technically handle. You will get a number of driver aids and conveniences, including hands-off parking and navigation-based &quot;Smart Cruise Control.&quot; This will be the first Kia to support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-digital-car-keys-share-with-android-pixel-162505575.html">ultra-wide band digital keys</a>, so you won't have to take out your conventional key to step inside.</p><p>Kia hasn't yet divulged pricing for the EV9. The machine will go on sale in some countries sometime in the second half of the year, with South Korean pre-orders starting this spring. It's safe to presume the SUV will sell for more than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-2023-ev6-price-release-date-192954791.html">EV6 crossover</a>. Not that this will necessarily be a problem for the brand. There are few three-row electric SUVs, and those that exist (such as the Tesla Model X) are likely more expensive.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/kias-ev9-electric-suv-will-offer-level-3-autonomy-and-a-336-mile-range-141506186.html?src=rss

## Sony's 12-megapixel full-frame ZV-E1 is a low-light vlogging beast

<p>Sony has unveiled its latest, and by far greatest vlogging camera to date, the full-frame ZV-E1.  Equipped with the same backside-illuminated (BSI) 12-megapixel sensor as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7s-iii-mirrorless-camera-review-140041536.html">A7S III</a>, it promises excellent low-light performance, 4K at up to 120p and a host of new AI features like auto framing. The $2,200 price tag also makes it enticing for vloggers as it offers features found on the $3,500 A7S III for considerably less money.</p><p>Key among those are the excellent video specs. The full-frame sensor lets you significantly blur the background so subjects stand out more than with cameras using smaller APS-C or Micro Four Thirds sensors. And like the A7S III, the ZV-E1 gives you 4K at 24/30/60/120 fps, using a full-pixel readout with no binning in all modes. It also offers capture in easy-to-edit All-I modes with data rates up to 600Mbps.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Sony's 12-megapixel full-frame ZV-E1 is a low-light vlogging beast" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/471ac1b0-ce1e-11ed-bada-e4ce3e14b53b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>10-bit 4:2:2 recording is available with S-Log-3/S-Gamut3.Cine log modes, delivering up to 15 stops of dynamic range, Sony claims.  And the 12-megapixel BSI sensor has an ISO range up to 409,600 expanded (80-102400 in normal modes), the best high ISO performance in the Alpha series. That opens up a lot of interesting creative opportunities, as you can shoot in near pitch-black conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>The ZV-E1 is Sony's first full-frame camera with a vlogging-style body, so it lacks the large grip and generous controls seen on other A-series models. In exchange, it's much smaller and lighter than those models, weighing in at just 483 grams, compared to 699 grams for the A7S III. It's even lighter (and smaller) than the A7C, but uses the same Z-batteries as larger Sony models, letting you capture up to 570 shots or record 4K 60p video for 95 minutes (however, 4K 60p is temperature-limited to approximately 30 minutes).</p><figure><img alt="Sony's 12-megapixel full-frame ZV-E1 is a low-light vlogging beast" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/9b0cc700-ce1e-11ed-bd33-0c309b573694" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>It has a single rear dial, with the front dial replaced by a motor zoom control. There are just a few other controls (three programmable buttons, a Fn button and Sony's usual D-Pad), along with a Still/Movie/S&amp;Q switch, product showcase button, and background defocus button. It also has a tally light that can be seen from the front and top.</p><p>For other settings, and functions like focus, you have to use the touchscreen. Luckily it's a fully articulating display that allows easy self-shooting or high/low angle framing. Sony has also adopted the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7r-v-review-awesome-images-improved-video-unbeatable-autofocus-150058082.html">A7R V</a>'s relatively intuitive menu system that places common settings on one screen and makes it relatively easy to find more advanced functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Also missing is an electronic viewfinder, so the only way to see your subject is via the touchscreen or an external monitor. We've seen the same thing on all its other ZV-series vlogging cameras so it's no surprise, but it's a bit jarring to see such a high-spec camera without an EVF.</p><figure><img alt="Sony's 12-megapixel full-frame ZV-E1 is a low-light vlogging beast" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/ec9a4f70-ce1e-11ed-b763-ab76140dd342" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Otherwise, though, ZV-E1 actually adds some features not found on other Sony cameras. To start with, it offers 5-axis in-body stabilization, with a new &quot;Active&quot; optical mode that's supposed to boost shake reduction while walking. And if that's not enough, the &quot;Dynamic Active&quot; mode adds extra smoothing for rapid movements in exchange for some extra cropping. &quot;Combined with a wide-angle lens, hand-held shooting is possible even in fast walking scenes that would otherwise be difficult without the use of a gimbal,&quot; Sony claims.</p><p>Another new feature is the AI-based auto framing mode that should be incredibly handy for solo creators. Using subject recognition tech, it automatically crops the frame to keep the subject in a prominent position, even though the camera may be fixed on a tripod. Using the feature, you can select a small, medium or large crop, have it track you quickly or slowly, auto start based on subject recognition or subject selection, and switch between the cropped and full angle after 15 or 30 seconds. It can even record two types of images at once, capturing the full image to an HDMI output and the cropped version to an internal memory card.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Sony's 12-megapixel full-frame ZV-E1 is a low-light vlogging beast" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/31f1c670-ce1f-11ed-bfbd-0bfbd040c985" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Other AI tricks including a framing stabilizer that uses subject recognition tech to crop in to the subject and keeps them stable when you're walking beside them. &quot;Multiple face recognition&quot; automatically reduces bokeh when a second face is detected so both subjects stay in focus. And as with other Sony vlogging models, it has a bokeh switch that automatically defocuses the background, along with a &quot;product showcase&quot; button that lets the camera instantly focus on an object put in front of the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>As with other recent Sony models, the ZV-E1 has a variety of subject recognition modes besides humans, including animal, bird, car/train, airplane and insect. It includes the focus breathing compensation feature first seen on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-mirrorless-camera-review-163026066.html">A7 IV</a> that digitally compensates for any zooming when the focus changes from one subject to another. It also offers the focus map and AF assist seen on recent models, along with adjustments for the AF transition speed.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Sony's 12-megapixel full-frame ZV-E1 is a low-light vlogging beast" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/863f8050-ce1f-11ed-bf17-c47b6ec8cd24" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>On the audio front, the ZV-E1 has a built-in 3-capsule mic that can change directionality depending on the situation. For instance, if a human subject is recognized, the mic direction changes to &quot;front,&quot; but if there's no subject it defaults to &quot;all directions.&quot; It comes with a windscreen, and if you'd rather using your own mic, there's a 3.5mm headphone jack and digital audio interface on the hotshoe.&nbsp;</p><p>Other features include UVC/UAC webcam capability, with support for up to 4K 30p video, besting most other Sony models. It also comes with a headphone port, a single SD UHS-II card slot, a microHDMI output and USB-C. Finally, it's a decent photo camera as well, shooting 12-megapixel RAW photos at up to 10fps — but there's no mechanical shutter, of course.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned, the ZV-E1 is priced at $2,200 for the body only, or $2,500 in a kit with the SEL 28-60mm zoom. It goes on pre-order tomorrow, with shipping set to start in early April — stay tuned for a full review.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sonys-12-megapixel-full-frame-zv-e1-is-a-low-light-vlogging-beast-140009036.html?src=rss

## Tech leaders and AI experts demand a six-month pause on 'out-of-control' AI experiments

<p>An <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">open letter</a> signed by tech leaders and prominent AI researchers has called for AI labs and companies to "immediately pause" their work. Signatories like Steve Wozniak and Elon Musk agree risks warrant a minimum six month break from producing technology beyond GPT-4 to enjoy existing AI systems, allow people to adjust and ensure they are benefiting everyone. The letter adds that care and forethought are necessary to ensure the safety of AI systems — but are being ignored.</p><p>The reference to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-just-released-gpt-4-a-multi-modal-generative-ai-172326765.html"> GPT-4</a>, a model by OpenAI that can respond with text to written or visual messages, comes as companies race to build complex chat systems that utilize the technology.

<p>Nintendo faces a major challenge following up on one of the best games of the last decade, <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. Yesterday, the company showed off 10 minutes of gameplay from its sequel, <em>Tears of the Kingdom.</em> Its producer, Eiji Aonuma, showed off many familiar game mechanics augmented with special elevator stones to fast track you to floating islands, new fusion weapons and even fusion vehicles, like boats and hovercraft – not to mention the already teased drone style aircraft. <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> launches on May 12th.

It was just over a year ago when former Disney CEO Bob Chapek tapped company veteran Mike White to lead the team in finding interactive ways to tell Disney's stories using new technologies – which fortunately meant the metaverse and not NFTs. As <em>The Journal</em> notes, Bob Iger, who returned as CEO to replace Chapek in November 2022, showed he also sees a future in the metaverse when he joined the board of an animated avatar startup. The metaverse team could simply be one of the first teams impacted by Disney's significant restructuring efforts.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-reportedly-shuts-down-its-metaverse-division-103151157.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/djis-goggles-integra-has-an-integrated-battery-for-improved-ergonomics-130036871.html">DJI's Goggles Integra has an integrated battery for improved ergonomics</a></h2><h3>It also unveiled the RC Motion 2 with an upgraded joystick.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/djis-goggles-integra-has-an-integrated-battery-for-improved-ergonomics-130036871.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/f70e1440-ce1a-11ed-be77-9c579487158b" style="height: 386; width: 675;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure></a><p>One of the biggest criticisms of DJI's otherwise excellent Avata first-person view (FPV) drone was around the Goggles 2, which lacked comfort and tethered you to a battery.

## Logitech's Zone Learn headset for kids has swappable ear pads and wires

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitechs-introduces-line-of-gender-inclusive-gaming-accessories-090711002.html">Logitech</a> has launched a kid-friendly version of its Zone headset called <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9d8b417f-05d3-461d-8465-21e1a10e527d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Logitech&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5ZDhiNDE3Zi0wNWQzLTQ2MWQtODQ2NS0yMWUxYTEwZTUyN2QiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubG9naXRlY2guY29tL2VuLXVzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2VkdWNhdGlvbi9oZWFkc2V0cy96b25lLWxlYXJuLWhlYWRzZXQuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDlkMTM0ZGQtYjEyNC00NjI5LTg5NWEtZTFlYjlkZmRhN2ViIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdvZfUyW5otT4a4i3MQp8NFj06Vr4JBqIZXmGzXol0nl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Feducation%2Fheadsets%2Fzone-learn-headset.html">Zone Learn</a>, specifically designed for their educational needs. While it was created to be durable like many other devices for children — it's even supposed to be "chew-resistant" — the company also made it easy to replace the parts that typically give out or get damaged for headsets first. Specifically, Logitech made it possible to swap its ear pads and cables, not just so schools can replace them if they get frayed or destroyed, but also so that they can choose between over-ear and on-ear pads, as well as between 3.5 mm aux, USB-A and USB-C cables, depending on what they need.&nbsp;</p><p>The over-ear option offers more noise isolation, while on-ear provides more environmental awareness. Meanwhile, the cable options will allow educators to use the headset with different types of devices. Logitech says Zone Learn's audio drivers are tuned for voice clarity rather than for music, since it's optimized for lessons that involve speaking, such as for students learning a new language. It's also equipped with a boom mic that has a 120-degree swivel for lessons that require students to interact with the class.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zone Learn will be available around the world this spring for prices starting at $35. Logitech will also release a package with an over-ear pad model, a 3.5mm aux and a USB-C cable in the early summer for $40.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/logitechs-zone-learn-headset-for-kids-has-swappable-ear-pads-and-wires-105559525.html?src=rss

The company has now added extreme heat alerts to that list. Googling details on the event will return everything from the predicted start and end dates of the heatwave to medical issues to be aware of during it and how to mitigate their impacts. The company is partnering with the Global Heat Health Information Network (GHHIN) to ensure that the information provided is both accurate and applicable.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="a screenshot of Google EIE showing the city-wide tree canopy coverage in Lisbon Spain." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/e0f7c250-cd98-11ed-bcef-9e9b8c261a85" style="height: 1220; width: 2328;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>It's a lot easier to keep the citizenry comfortable in hot weather if the cities themselves aren't sweltering, but our love affair with urban concrete has not been amenable to that goal.

## Lucid Motors is laying off 1,300 workers to reduce expenses

<p>By the end of this week, 1,300 people who work for Lucid Motors will have known that they're going to lose their jobs. The luxury electric vehicle maker has <a href="https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/d33b60f2-a9f1-4b71-81cf-2457f00aff9c">notified</a> (PDF) the US Securities and Exchange Commission in a filing that it's reducing its current workforce by approximately 18 percent. Lucid said it's cutting jobs to reduce operating expenses &quot;in response to evolving business needs and productivity improvements&quot; and that it intends to complete this restructuring plan by the end of the second quarter this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson told employees in a memo that the job cuts will affect both employees and contractors. In the US, nearly every division will be hit by reductions, and some executives are even included in the list of personnel the company is laying off. The EV-maker implemented other cost-cutting measures, such as reviewing its non-critical spending, after announcing its <a href="https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lucid-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-financial">2022 earnings results</a> in February. But apparently, those measures weren't enough for the company to achieve its objectives.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Lucid experienced a sharp increase in revenue year-over-year — it had only just started the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-pure-touring-trim-video-140048588.html">Air sedan's</a> production in late 2021 — it still <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/22/lucid-lcid-earnings-q4-2022.html">fell short of analyst forecasts</a>. In addition, although its production goal (14,000 EVs) for 2023 is double <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-q4-manufacturing-production-target-151031522.html">last year's figures</a>, it's much lower than the 21,000 units experts had expected. As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/lucid-expects-make-least-10000-electric-cars-2023-2023-02-22/"><em>Reuters</em></a> previously reported, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-implements-huge-us-price-cuts-across-its-lineup-083211088.html">price cuts by Tesla</a> and the availability of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kias-ev-6-is-a-phenomenal-family-car-050118560.html">affordable EVs</a> from traditional automakers had lessened demand for vehicles from startups like Lucid. Rivian, another EV startup, is similarly affected and announced that it was going to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-layoffs-184047174.html">reduce its workforce</a> by six percent in February.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucid said in its filing that the layoffs will cost the company $24 million to $30 million, which will be spent on severance payments, company-paid health insurance and stock-based compensation for the affected workers. Despite its cost-cutting measures, Lucid still intends to expand globally and to continue developing more models, including the three-row <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-gravity-ev-suv-reservation-date-200050593.html">Gravity electric SUV</a> that it plans to release in 2024.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lucid-motors-is-laying-off-1300-workers-to-reduce-expenses-090908953.html?src=rss

<p>Lenovo carved out a niche with its Legion line of gaming smartphones featuring impressive specs and gimmicks like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-phone-gen-3-y90-154523661.html">SSD RAID storage</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-phone-gen-3-y90-154523661.html">pop-out cameras</a>. Now, the company is exiting the gaming phone business completely, it told <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lenovo-legion-phone-shutdown-3306942/"><em>Android Authority</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Lenovo is discontinuing its Android-based Legion mobile gaming phones as part of a wider business transformation and gaming portfolio consolidation. As a leader in gaming devices and solutions, Lenovo is committed to advancing the gaming category across form factors, as well as focusing on where it can bring the most value to the global gaming community,&quot; a spokesperson said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Lenovo's gaming smartphone woes likely sprung from the fact that it failed to establish the Legion brand outside of China. It poached a number of employees from the ASUS ROG team at the beginning, so it was clearly committed to mobile gaming early on. Its last Legion-branded phone was the slightly lower-end <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-y70-vr700-134254379.html">Y70</a> announced last August, but the final flagship Y90 was released over a year ago in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-phone-gen-3-y90-154523661.html">February 2022</a>.</p><p>With Lenovo out, that leaves just ASUS with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-6-diablo-immortal-edition-pricing-availability-171543660.html">ROG gaming smartphone lineup</a>, along with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nubia-red-magic-6-pro-165hz-display-internal-fan-18gb-ram-071339839.html">Nubia Red Magic</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-03-xiaomi-black-shark-3-pro-gaming-phone.html">Xiaomi's Black Shark</a> — though the latter recently <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3206586/china-gaming-phone-maker-black-shark-lays-hundreds-workers-and-fails-pay-full-severance-according">laid off</a> a large chunk of its workforce.

<p>A federal judge has ruled that Google violated a court order requiring it to preserve employee chat messages relevant to Epic's antitrust case, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-28/google-flouted-order-to-save-evidence-antitrust-case-judge-says?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/28/google-not-preserving-chats-in-epic-case-merits-sanctions-judge-says-.html?__source=sharebar|twitter&amp;par=sharebar"><em>CNBC</em></a>. San Francisco US District Judge James Donato said the tech giant &quot;adopted a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy for keeping messages, at the expense of its preservation duties,&quot; and must be sanctioned for its actions. Donato has yet to decide on what sanctions and penalties Google should face, but he ordered the company to cover Epic's attorney's fees related to this particular issue.</p><p>Donato said in his decision that Google gave almost 360 employees the complete freedom to decide whether or not to preserve chat histories. In a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doj-accuses-google-deleting-chat-evidence-antitrust-lawsuit-055524776.html">separate filing by the Department of Justice</a> over the same complaint,  the agency explained that the tech giant's internal chatroom, which is used to discuss &quot;substantive and sensitive business,&quot; is set to delete chat messages within 24 hours by default. The agency expected Google to change its chat history setting in 2019 when it &quot;reasonably anticipated [the] litigation,&quot; but it still allegedly left the decision to individual employees.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Epic Games, to support its case, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/27/epic-games-produces-documents-in-antitrust-case-showing-googlers-avoiding-its-litigation-hold/">submitted exhibits</a> to show how Google employees tend to switch off chat history. In one example from 2021, Google CEO Sundar Pichai allegedly wrote: &quot;...also can we change the setting of this group to history off.&quot; He attempted to delete that message a few seconds later, according to the filing. Google employees also reportedly switch off chat histories when discussing topics, such as revenue sharing and mobile app distribution agreements, as well as a project that involves changing commission rates for Google Play.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement, a Google spokesperson said the company has worked with Epic and investigators over the years and has handed over millions of documents: &quot;Our teams have conscientiously worked, for years, to respond to Epic and the state AGs’ discovery requests and we have produced over three million documents, including thousands of chats. We'll continue to show the court how choice, security, and openness are built into Android and Google Play,&quot; they said.&nbsp;</p><p>The judge will hold further proceedings to finalize the sanctions Google must face. Donato said he'd like to see the evidence available &quot;at the end of fact discovery,&quot; so that Epic would be better positioned to &quot;tell the Court what might have been lost in the Chat communications.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-found-to-have-violated-order-to-save-chat-evidence-in-epic-antitrust-case-052711779.html?src=rss
