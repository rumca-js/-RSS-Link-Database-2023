Firefox, Edge, and others have long included an official way of displaying webpages as basic, easy-to-read text and and images, but not Chrome. Unless you were willing to dig into its flag settings to activate a hidden Reader Mode, you had to accept exactly what websites served you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/chromebook-updates-2023/&amp;xcust=2-1-1676214-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent announcement of a forthcoming Reading Mode</a>, Chrome finally is joining the party. Well. Kind of. As you might have guessed from the wording, Reading Mode is not quite like other browsers&rsquo; Reader Mode.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new feature is a customizable sidebar and part of Chrome&rsquo;s updates geared at education. Launching in version 114 for Chrome and ChromeOS, the sidebar loads a second copy of the open page that lets users strip away distracting elements. You can kill images and video as well as adjust other visual elements like typeface, font size and spacing, and the colors of the text and background.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 640px;\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"360\" id=\"video-1676214-1\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"640\"><source src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/1980-GDU-Roadmap-ReadingMode-AV.mp4?_=1\" type=\"video/mp4\" /><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/1980-GDU-Roadmap-ReadingMode-AV.mp4&amp;xcust=2-1-1676214-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/1980-GDU-Roadmap-ReadingMode-AV.mp4</a></video></div>\n</div><figcaption>Google&rsquo;s video demonstration of how Reading Mode will work.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But unlike a traditional Reader mode, the sidebar does not spans the full width of a page, as it does in Edge or Firefox&rsquo;s reader modes. As an education tool, this difference may be more functional&mdash;reading from the pared down version of the page while still seeing its original form could help with processing the information&mdash;but for those seeking a simplified, more book-like experience, Reading Mode is still not quite the desired feature. In fact, this mode stems from Chrome&rsquo;s Read Anywhere mode, which first appeared last year, rather than the hidden Reader Mode. The latter, which launched in 2019, is still considered experimental. With the upcoming release of this new Reading Mode, it could remain in in purgatory for awhile longer (if not forever).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading Mode begins its rollout in Chrome 114 on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule&amp;xcust=2-1-1676214-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">May 24, 2023</a>.

Ray tracing is a physics-based model that calculates the way individual rays of light move through space and bounce off multiple objects, giving more realistic illumination and reflections. Path tracing, while technically a synonym for the same process, refers to a more processor-friendly way to optimize all of that math, collapsing multiple rays into a less processor-intensive idealized path. That said, it&rsquo;s also more resource-intensive in practice, as path tracing also requires accurately simulating <em>all</em> light sources in a game, rather than picking and choosing select lighting features (such as shadows and reflections) like you do with standard ray traced games.

Enpass is a straightforward solution to help individuals improve their password hygiene and secure their most sensitive data even if they don&rsquo;t have a high degree of technical know-how.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"enpass-getting-started\">Enpass: Getting started</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enpass is offered as a desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux and a mobile companion app for Android and iOS. Once you download the desktop app, onboarding with Enpass is simple. You&rsquo;re prompted to register a new account and then to create a master password. Once that&rsquo;s done, Enpass launches a quick setup tab that lets you install its browser plugin, enable touch ID access, check for compromised passwords, and other options with a simple toggle. After that, you can import your passwords from your browser, a CSV file, or directly from more than a dozen other password managers.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html\">best password managers</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a password manager, and product recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Enpass allows you to store login credentials, credit card information, personal ID data, licenses, passports, and more in your vault and keeps everything organized in an intuitively labeled category menu. A search bar across the top of the interface helps with locating specific entries, which can be made more searchable via tags and sub-tags. Enpass automatically creates a primary vault when you set up your account, but you can create additional vaults to more cleanly separate work from personal logins, for example.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Enpass\" class=\"wp-image-1663544\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Enpass-entry.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Desktop users can use all Enpass&rsquo; features and syncing capabilities for free.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"enpass-features\">Enpass: Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve populated your vault, Enpass can audit all your entries for compromised, weak, identical, or breached passwords. Any offenders can be replaced using Enpass&rsquo; password generator. By default, it creates passphrases rather than random character strings; phrases can be from two to 15 words&mdash;the default is six&mdash;and can include uppercase letters and digits and separate each word with a hyphen. Enpass also supports random-character-string passwords&mdash;you just toggle off the &ldquo;pronounceable&rdquo; option&mdash;of up to 32 characters. You choose what type of characters to use and how many of each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Enpass desktop app stores and syncs your data, capturing and replaying login credentials are handled by its browser extension. Rather than dropping down from your browser&rsquo;s toolbar like other password extensions, it displays as a separate window that floats over the page. The extension can display all your vault entries and when you click on one, it will fill in the relevant information on a page. Like the desktop app, the browser extension has its own search bar for quickly locating items. When you log in to a site for the first time, the plugin will capture your username and password. You can edit the entry and apply tags right from the extension.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"enpass-security\">Enpass: Security</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike most other password managers, Enpass doesn&rsquo;t upload your data to its servers. It&rsquo;s stored locally on your device. To sync your data across multiple devices, you need to either connect your Enpass account with a cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive or set up Wi-Fi sync to keep your Enpass data up to date across devices on the same wireless network. Neither option is turnkey, and both require searching through Enpass&rsquo; support pages for instruction. That extra work may be a turnoff for some users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enpass encrypts your data with 256-bit AES and SQLCipher to better protect against brute-force and side-channel attacks. It does not, however, use multi-factor authentication. The company explains on its website that if you choose to store your data offsite with a cloud service like Google Drive or One Drive, you are already enabling multi-factor security: Your data is secured by your Enpass master password and your cloud-account credentials, plus any additional authentication your cloud provider requires such as one-time codes, biometric identification, or an app-specific password. In this scenario, Enpass argues, anyone trying to steal your passwords would have to get through three layers of authentication. It does support the use of Keyfiles, though, which can be required in combination with your master password to decrypt your Enpass data. Here again, users will need to search instructions for setting up a Keyfile in Enpass support documentation.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Enpass\" class=\"wp-image-1663543\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Enpass-Sharing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Enpass allows you to share items but you must create a personal preshared key to secure each one.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"enpass-sharing\">Enpass: Sharing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can share passwords and other entries from the desktop app but doing so surfaces a warning that items shared outside Enpass aren&rsquo;t encrypted. To secure them, you have to define a pre-shared key&mdash;essentially a password you create to share with the recipient of the item before you share the item itself&mdash;in Enpass&rsquo; advanced settings. In addition to this ad-hoc encryption, you can toggle off fields in the item you don&rsquo;t want to share. Once you&rsquo;re ready to share, you send the item via email or copy it to the clipboard to share a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Password inheritance isn&rsquo;t currently supported. Inheritance features, which are included with some other password managers including Keeper and LastPass, allow designated individuals to access your passwords and sensitive data in the event of your death. Given that Enpass is designed to primarily work offline, it&rsquo;s not surprising it doesn&rsquo;t support this capability. However, it&rsquo;s worth considering if you need to designate a custodian for your data after you&rsquo;re gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"enpass-the-plans\">Enpass: The plans</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enpass is free to use on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You get access to all the desktop app&rsquo;s features and unlimited syncing across desktop devices. You can sync up to 10 items in a single vault with mobile devices.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Enpass\" class=\"wp-image-1663545\" height=\"662\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Enpass-extension.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Enpass&rsquo; browser extension captures and replays your passwords on secure sites.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To do any more than that you&rsquo;ll need a paid plan. The Individual plan costs $23.99 per year and removes all entry, syncing, and vault limits. It also provides security alerts for website breaches and will identify any accounts in your vault that support two-factor identification. The Family plan extends the same features to up to six users for $47.99 a year. You can also purchase a permanent lifetime license for an individual for a flat fee of $99.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-use-enpass-password-manager\">Should you use Enpass password manager?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re new to password managers or just want a solution that&rsquo;s not overly complex, Enpass is worth the investment. Although it lacks the advanced capabilities found in some of our top picks, it provides all the foundational password management features you need to secure and safely use your sensitive data in an exceptionally easy-to-use app.</p>\n\nPersonal Software, Security</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1663518/enpass-password-manager-review.html", "date_published": "2023-03-29 14:54:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Sony\u2019s \u2018The Last of Us\u2019 PC port is an utter disaster at launch", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Sony&rsquo;s <em>The Last of Us </em>franchise was briefly riding high in the early part of the year.

But the story-heavy zombie shooter seems to have missed a step in its PC debut, as players decry that the PC port suffers from an all-too-familiar array of performance issues. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"The Last of Us Part 1 Steam reviews \" class=\"wp-image-1675743\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tlou-steam-reviews.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=916\" width=\"916\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Valve </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The day after its official release, the game is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/&amp;xcust=2-3-1675637-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">sitting at a &ldquo;Mostly Negative&rdquo; user rating on Steam</a>. Despite the port&rsquo;s purported PC enhancements, like an unlocked framerate, ultrawide resolutions, and support for AMD&rsquo;s FSR 2 upscaling, players are complaining of horrible performance, frequent bugs, freezes, and crashes to the desktop. Some players are seeing the game gobble up an incredible 11GB of video RAM even at a relatively tame 1080p resolution. That&rsquo;s the kind of memory usage that would choke an RTX 3070.

It&rsquo;s a little light on storage, but that&rsquo;s not a major deal-breaker for a Chromebook, as they&rsquo;re firmly cloud-centric machines. That configuration means it should be plenty powerful enough for day-to-day tasks like checking e-mail, browsing the web, watching Netflix, and so on, as well as running Android apps. The 14-inch touch display has a resolution of 1920&times;1200 and a maximum brightness level of 340 nits. You should expect a decent picture for sure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a good deal, so long as you&rsquo;re not married to the Windows operating system.

For many people, such news may signal ample reason for an accelerated death of the HDD&mdash;at least for consumer use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With solid-state drives both <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1664694/its-a-great-time-to-upgrade-your-ssd.html\">having fallen in price</a> and gradually increased in available capacities, they&rsquo;ve become all but ubiquitous in laptops and dominant in desktop PC builds. In fact, I myself often <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html\">recommend an SSD</a> to friends building computers over a hard disk drive. But I&rsquo;d never take that advice myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, even with this data casting a cloud of gloom over the viability of hard disk drives, it&rsquo;s going to be a long time coming before I give up my army of spinning platters. (OK, maybe more like small platoon.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? First, the report (as picked up by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blocksandfiles.com/2023/03/16/failed-disk-drives-fail-after-just-under-3-years-in-use-says-data-recovery-biz/&amp;xcust=2-1-1671102-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blocks and Files</a> and then <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/report-most-hdds-die-after-almost-3-years-newer-models-are-less-reliable&amp;xcust=2-1-1671102-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extreme Tech</a>) comes from a Los-Angeles based data recovery service&rsquo;s look at failed hard drives sent in by clients&mdash;but a relatively small number, as compared to cloud storage provider Backblaze&rsquo;s statistics about its massive collection of disk drives. More importantly, Secure Data Recovery&rsquo;s results look solely at failed drives, while Backblaze&rsquo;s data covers all of its working drives, which have longer service lives on average. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the takeaway here is that if your drive is going to fail, it&rsquo;s most likely going to do so within three years, not necessarily that all HDDs will fail within three years.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Secure Data Recovery hard drive failure stats\" class=\"wp-image-1671105\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/data.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Data on hard drive failure from Secure Data Recovery.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Secure Data Recovery </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Secure Data Recovery also shows that the issue with newer drives relates to modern <em>technology</em> in hard drives rather than the actual age of the drive. HDDs that use shingled magnetic recording (SMR) appear more susceptible to problems than drives based on conventional magnetic recording (CMR). Given that most hard disk drive enthusiasts avoid SMR drives for NAS and servers, due to slower read and write speeds in situations with continuous use, that already improves the odds of avoiding premature data death. And for folks who pop in just a single hard drive into a machine, buying a CMR drive is still easily done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I haven&rsquo;t written off hard-disk drives just yet, as old and decrepit they may seem. You shouldn&rsquo;t, either. Especially since SSDs still can&rsquo;t match their capacities nor cost per terabyte: a 4TB HDD<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=4tb+hard+disk+drive&amp;sprefix=4tb+hard+disk+%2Caps%2C134&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_14&amp;xcust=2-1-1671102-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"> is only about $70</a> while a 4TB SDD <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=4tb+ssd&amp;crid=2IHWLFJQS5SE&amp;sprefix=4tb+ss%2Caps%2C135&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;xcust=2-1-1671102-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">starts at around $225</a>. Put another way, I could get a 14TB HDD for the same cost as a 4TB SSD. That makes a set of HDDs incredibly economical, whether for a NAS or server, or even just cold storage for your PC. Why spend major bucks for those drives if you don&rsquo;t need to?</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"best-external-hard-drive-for-backups\">\n\t\t\t\t\tBest External hard drive for backups\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"wd-my-passport-5tb\">WD My Passport 5TB</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"WD My Passport 5TB\" class=\"product-widget__image\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41FUR9vWdlL.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/412338/wd-my-passport-4tb-review-a-good-budget-choice-thats-just-a-little-slow.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The main reason for my seemingly contradictory advice about HDDs vs. SSDs when talking to friends and family is that most people these days use just a single drive in their primary PC. And, for such a situation, an SSD is the better choice&mdash;you get faster boot times, quicker game loads, and all-around snappier responsiveness when on the computer. But you know what I also recommend when my friends are buying those new laptops, desktop PCs, and build components? To figure out a good backup solution for that one lone drive because drive death is inevitable. The question is not if, but when it&rsquo;ll fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know the easiest (not to mention cheapest) solution? Usually, it&rsquo;s a good old trusty HDD in the form of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html\">an external backup drive</a>. Honestly, the major point for all of us out of this study&mdash;not that HDDs are unreliable and should be avoided&mdash;is that no drive is safe from the Grim Reaper.

(We&rsquo;ve also chosen to stick with the &ldquo;first draft&rdquo; of Bard results; it can offer alternate explanations, but we&rsquo;re not sure how many users will seek them out.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, we have a winner for best AI chatbot!

It measures 5 x 2.67 x 1.73 inches to the V2 Pro&rsquo;s 5 x 2.86 x 1.68, so it&rsquo;s comparatively taller and narrower, but still decently proportioned for a mid-sized mouse. This means you get a little extra pointer precision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On balance the new improved shape is also eminently more comfortable and ergonomic. Razer says it has been designed with the help of esports players, and I&rsquo;d have to agree that it looks perfectly tailored to the esports athlete&rsquo;s hand.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro\" class=\"wp-image-1663634\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DeathAdder-V3-Pro-271__H_R2.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>You get an assortment of grips in the box to further personalize the V3 Pro.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Razer</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It features a tight, right-hand curve that meanders down the left-hand side, curling your palm into its fold. The top hump that was located centrally in the V2 Pro, is now taller for better palm support, and has been moved forward and more to the left, such that it now sits beneath the base of your index finger. A gentle gradient falls away from it to the right, ensuring your index finger is always at the highest point ready to fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro moves like an absolute ninja across your mouse mat or tabletop.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"razer-deathadder-v3-pro-buttons\">Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro buttons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The V3 Pro&rsquo;s button selection is simpler than the V2&rsquo;s. All up you get five buttons instead of seven, including two main clicks, two buttons on the left-hand side and a single click for the mouse wheel. There&rsquo;s no DPI up/down buttons behind the mouse wheel, or storage alcove for the dongle on the underside like we saw in the V2 Pro. The unibody shell is now a split key cover. Is this a great loss? Not really!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, elite gamers have been demanding lighter, simpler designs for some time now and this is exactly what Razer has given us here. It&rsquo;s the kind of simplicity we&rsquo;re seeing in near rivals too, like the Logitech G X Pro Superlight. Plus, without extra buttons on top to worry about, there&rsquo;s no reason to stress about incorporating commands into your game that you never get around to using anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"logitech-g-pro-x-superlight\">Logitech G Pro X Superlight</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Logitech G Pro X Superlight\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"7560\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Lead.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"10081\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1475704/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/pro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-005878.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1663595-5-1474582-17250&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$159.99 at  Logitech G</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a little worried by that and thinking I <em>do</em> use my DPI button a lot right about now, that&rsquo;s all well and good&mdash;you still can. It&rsquo;s located on the underside, and doubles as a power button. It&rsquo;s very small but switches you through your five DPI settings with just soft presses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A decent contingent of 100 percent PTFE feet also line the underside, including around the sensor, so the V3 Pro moves like an absolute ninja across your mouse mat or tabletop.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro \" class=\"wp-image-1663637\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230318_081435.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro&rsquo;s DPI button is located on its underside.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"razer-deathadder-v3-pro-connectivity\">Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro connectivity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both wired and wireless connectivity options are available, so you can either tether the V3 Pro to a desktop or take it on the road for your next competitive match. Wireless connectivity comes courtesy of a tiny and unobtrusive USB adapter, which provides a low-latency 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The V3 also comes with a bunch of useful accessories, which for my white review unit, were also conveniently colored a matching white. They include: a handy USB dongle adapter and very flexible shoelace-like Razer Speedflex USB-A to USB-C cable, which doubles as both the wired adapter and a charger. The V3 Pro provides approximately 90 hours of battery life once fully charged and requires roughly four hours to charge to full capacity. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"razer-deathadder-v3-pro-performance\">Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro performance </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro has a sensor worthy of serious respect. It&rsquo;s a Razer Focus Pro 30K Optical Sensor, which has a maximum resolution of 30,000 DPI, maximum speed of 750 IPS (inches per second) and acceleration of 70G.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, it didn&rsquo;t take me long to realize I was in the presence of sensor royalty[&mdash;it just felt so smooth, quick and responsive in my playtesting. <em>In Counter Strike: Global Offensive</em>, for example, panning my crosshairs while strafing was so effortless that I found I could hit targets with minimal concentration and in a relaxed state of mind&mdash;which had carry-on benefits to my overall performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching up DPIs didn&rsquo;t change that feeling, I found I could land my crosshairs on targets without over spinning or being too far off kilter&mdash;just faster than before, which is exactly what I was hoping for in a mouse of this caliber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sensor&rsquo;s default polling rate is 1,000Hz, and quite frankly to me this default setting hits a performance peak that&rsquo;s already pretty impressive. Imagine, then, my surprise to learn the V3 Pro is also capable of hyper polling up to whopping 4,000Hz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that you&rsquo;ll need to purchase a Razer HyperPolling dongle for an extra $29.99. While we would have preferred it to have been included in the box, the very fact this upgrade is available is a big win for anyone who purchases the V3 Pro and wants to take the plunge to fine-tune their mouse&rsquo;s performance even further. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer HyperPolling dongle\" class=\"wp-image-1663659\" height=\"759\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RZR_Hyperpooling_Wireless_Dongle_2022_Render03.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The V3 Pro&rsquo;s 1,000Hz polling rate is upgradeable to 4,000Hz by purchasing a $29.99 Razer HyperPolling dongle.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Razer</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>On to evaluating the buttons, and I was also well impressed by their speed. Razer has upgraded to Gen 3 Optical Switches, which in our review of the Razer Naga V2 Pro, felt a bit stiff and tight, but much to my delight, the same switches were perfectly soft and clicky in the V3 Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They registered clicks cleanly even while jitter clicking&mdash;which was particularly noticeable when I was laying down rounds with the <em>Counter Strike</em> AUG, which is best used with a clicky finger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scoping with the AWP was also noticeably faster than I&rsquo;ve experienced with other mice, allowing me to get the edge on foes in hard-to-see corner positions, and better still, when I was surprised at close range by players with more rapidly firing weapons and I had to react quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned before, thanks to its ultra-lightweight body the V3 Pro is also incredibly quick off the mark. It felt so weightless that at times it was almost like I was moving a tiny cardboard box around. Consequently, I never experienced any hand or arm soreness. I was also delighted to see that my V3 Pro tracked flawlessly on my glass coffee table, which I made every use of for some laid-back couch gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"razer-deathadder-v3-pro-software\">Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro software</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Razer&rsquo;s Synapse software is a detailed app that lets you take advantage of every extra technology the V3 Pro&rsquo;s sensor has to offer. To that end, I had lots of fun tinkering with features like &ldquo;Asymmetric Cut-off distance,&rdquo; which allowed me to set my lift-off and landing distance to one of 26 granular levels of adjustment&mdash;far more than the three I&rsquo;m used to in rivals.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro\" class=\"wp-image-1663654\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Asymmetric-lift-off.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Razer&rsquo;s Synapse software app lets you set the V3 Pro&rsquo;s lift-off and landing distance to one of 26 granular distances.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also easily assign your buttons, set up your preferred DPI settings, and save your onboard memory profiles in the Razer Synapse app, which is very straightforward and easy to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"should-you-buy-the-razer-deathadder-v3-pro\">Should you buy the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Summarizing my thoughts about the V3 isn&rsquo;t hard. In short, it&rsquo;s brilliant, living up to every bit of hype when it comes to speed and responsiveness. Its ultra-light weight makes it an absolute pleasure to use all day long, too. Admittedly, at $149,99 it&rsquo;s not cheap, but that&rsquo;s roughly what the best competitive mice cost these days. Near rival the Logitech G Pro X Superlight, for instance, is a little more expensive at $159.99. Even without the $29.99 HyperPolling dongle, with the V3 Pro you&rsquo;re getting a top-notch device that will serve you extremely well when the heat is on. </p>\n\nGaming, Mice</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1663595/razer-deathadder-v3-pro-gaming-mouse-review.html", "date_published": "2023-03-29 10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Get a special discount on more than 100 hours of CompTIA certification training", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>For many people, being tech-savvy or invested in cybersecurity means simply having a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">password manager</a>.
