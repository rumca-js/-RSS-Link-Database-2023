  <p id="K2DWEq"><em>Fortnite’s</em> Discover tab, which lets you pick from Epic Games-made modes like Battle Royale or experiences from non-Epic creators, now show how many players are currently participating in any given experience. The change was officially rolled out <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1641179628638449665">on Wednesday</a>, and it could be an important tool for creators to benchmark their work against Epic’s official modes.</p>
<p id="lHUcoq">You can see the player counts in the game’s Discover tab, which represent the global number of players in-match at any given time, Epic spokesperson Dan Walsh tells <em>The Verge</em>. Based on what I saw, it’s overwhelmingly clear that Epic’s Battle Royale and Zero Build (the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/15/23024470/fortnite-zero-build-mode-player-return-twitch-the-fierce-diva-sypherpk">no-building Battle Royale introduced last year</a>) are <em>dramatically</em> more popular than any experiences made by non-Epic...</p>

  <p id="nePsli">If you’re one of the people brave enough to use Google Fi with an iPhone, your experience is about to get a lot better, as Google announced on Wednesday that you can finally use 5G instead of being stuck with LTE (<a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/03/29/google-fi-5g-iphone-official/">via <em>9to5Google</em></a>).</p>

(Though Fi’s 5G support <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/02/17/google-fi-5g-iphone-ios-16-4/">was spotted during the 16.4 beta process</a>.) You also have to have an iPhone 12 or newer, since older iPhones don’t support 5G. Turning it on after you’ve updated your phone is simple, though: go to Settings &gt; Cellular Data Options &gt; Voice and Data, then select “5G Auto.” Just like that, you’ll have access to T-Mobile’s 5G network.</p>

  <p id="Uw3MJd">On Wednesday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) came out in opposition to a bipartisan effort to ban TikTok, condemning Republicans and Democrats for a move he said could chill First Amendment-protected speech.</p>
<p id="KsDksJ">“I hope saner minds will reflect on which is more dangerous: videos of teenagers dancing, or the precedent of the US government banning speech,” Paul said on the Senate floor Wednesday.</p>
<p id="W5a4OC">Paul’s remarks followed an attempt by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) to ban TikTok nationwide on the Senate floor Wednesday. Earlier this year, Hawley, a long-time China hawk, introduced the No TikTok on United States Devices Act, a bill that would direct the president to ban use of the app on US devices, including those belonging to consumers.</p>

Kazutaka Kodaka loves detective stories and is best known for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16368706/danganronpa-v3-ps-vita-ps4-pc">the dark adventure series <em>Danganronpa</em></a>. But for his studio’s next project, <em>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code</em>, he decided to take things in a slightly different direction. “Mystery games tend to be dull because it’s mostly reading text,” Kodaka says. “But for this we created a world where you can solve various kinds of mysteries and roam around freely.”</p>

Earlier this week, tweet replies stopped showing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23660291/twitter-replies-update-confusing">who the user was actually replying to</a>, which made them look like <a href="https://twitter.com/TristanACooper/status/1640768187389149196">vague subtweets</a> or random missives with no context. But on Wednesday morning, tweets once again included details about who is replying to whom on the web.</p>
<p id="0PTRle">It’s unclear if the original shift was a bug or an intentional change. When we asked Twitter to clarify, its press email auto-replied with a poop emoji. Personally, I think it was just a bug given that tweet embeds and tweets on TweetDeck still showed reply information even when tweets on <a href="http://Twitter.com">Twitter.com</a> did not. Unfortunately, on iOS, replies still <em>don’t</em> show who people are replying to, but fingers crossed that changes...</p>

  <p id="lwb48y">Whether there are actually aliens hiding somewhere in Searchlight Pictures’ <em>Asteroid City </em>from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2015/9/8/9279983/wes-anderson-supercut-supercut">director Wes Anderson</a> is up for debate. What’s quite clear, though, is that the movie’s playing to all of Anderson’s strengths and going to give all of his fans exactly what they showed up for.</p>
<p id="aU610O">Set in a fictional American town during the mid-1950s, <em>Asteroid City </em>tells the story of a beleaguered widower (Jason Schwartzman) who’s busy schlepping his four children across the country to see their grandfather (Tom Hanks) when their car suddenly breaks down. Inconvenienced as everyone is by having to stop in Asteroid City while their car is fixed, the fact that an annual junior stargazer competition is on delights the widower’s son Woodrow (Jake...</p>

  <p id="NkV8t5">Have you looked at your email inbox lately? Here’s a suggestion: don’t. I can tell you what it looks like without even seeing it. For starters, there’s a big red badge on your email app icon with a five-digit number that you ignore a hundred times a day. It’s stuffed full of promotional emails, spam, newsletters you don’t read, and a sprinkling of bills and credit card notices. Maybe there are a couple of legitimate messages from acquaintances or your parenting group buried in there somewhere, but the prospect of locating and responding to them is too daunting, so you ignore them forever. </p>

<p id="JeyHSH">The obvious competitor for the Flow is DJI’s $159 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/22/23366496/dji-osmo-mobile-6-smartphone-gimbal-features-price-release-date">Osmo Mobile 6</a> lineup of smartphone gimbals. And on paper at least, Insta360 has made a decent effort to match DJI’s features spec for spec. DJI includes a tripod in the box with the Osmo Mobile 6, so Insta360 has built one into the Flow. DJI has its ActiveTrack 5.0 automatic subject tracking feature; Insta360 has Deep Track 3.0. The Flow even has a built-in 215mm (8.5-inch) selfie...</p>

After an exhaustive search via <a href="https://soundlogo.wikimedia.org/">“Sound of All Human Knowledge” contest</a>, Wikimedia thinks it <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2023/03/28/wikipedias-new-sound-logo-winner/">found an audio clip representing its mission</a>.</p>

  <p id="oW6HZ2"><em>Star Wars</em> actor Mark Hamill has lent his voice to a Ukrainian air raid app to warn citizens of incoming attacks during the ongoing conflict with Russia. “Attention.

When the threat has passed, Hamill signs off with “The alert is over. May the Force be with you.” </p>
<p id="c6fT4p">Invoking his beloved Luke Skywalker character, some of the lines contain recognizable quotes from the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise like “Don’t be careless. Your overconfidence is your weakness.” You can hear a few lines in the following video starting around 56 seconds in:</p>
