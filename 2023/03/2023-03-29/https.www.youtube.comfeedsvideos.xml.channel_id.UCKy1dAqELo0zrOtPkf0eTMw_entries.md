The High Table's obsession with rules and consequences forms the backbone of the John Wick franchise. Stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, and director Chad Stahelski discuss how the characters navigate these laws, and how the ways they break those rules ramp up the tension in Chapter 4.

Unreal Engine 5 has been in the news a lot lately, between tech demos, the Metahuman Animator stage presentation, and even Fortnite's recent 5.1 udpdate. But how do the Unreal Engine 3 and Unreal Engine 4 games stack up against their demos? We made this comparison so you could decide for yourself.

At the State of Unreal 2023 talk at GDC, Unreal Engine 5.2 was detailed, along with a demonstration from Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 showing impressive facial capture technology. But Unreal Engine Demos have always been impressive for their time, so here's hoping the Unreal Engine 5 games that eventually release will impress just as much.

Evil doesn’t span eternity without a little help. 

In this modern monster tale of Dracula’s loyal servant, Nicholas Hoult (Mad Max: Fury Road, X-Men franchise) stars as Renfield, the tortured aide to history’s most narcissistic boss, Dracula (Oscar® winner Nicolas Cage).  Renfield is forced to procure his master’s prey and do his every bidding, no matter how debased. But now, after centuries of servitude, Renfield is ready to see if there’s a life outside the shadow of The Prince of Darkness.  If only he can figure out how to end his codependency.

Renfield is directed by Chris McKay (The Tomorrow War, The LEGO Batman Movie) from a screenplay by Ryan Ridley (Ghosted series, Rick & Morty series), based on an original idea by The Walking Dead and Invincible creator Robert Kirkman.

The film co-stars Awkwafina (The Farewell, Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings), Ben Schwartz (Sonic, The Afterparty) and Adrian Martinez (The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Focus) and Emmy winner and Oscar® nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo (House of Saddam, House of Sand and Fog).

Renfield is produced by Skybound Entertainment partners Robert Kirkman and David Alpert (The Walking Dead, Invincible), co-presidents Bryan Furst (Daybreakers) and Sean Furst (Daybreakers) and by Chris McKay. McKay’s producing partner Samantha Nisenboim (co-producer, The Tomorrow War) will executive produce.
