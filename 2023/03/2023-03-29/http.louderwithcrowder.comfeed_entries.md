She seems like a sweet old lady... who somehow wandered onto hunting grounds. But someone needs to get these clicks. Why not me? If this was my grandma who did this, I'd expect you to have a few laughs too. (shout out to <a href="https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2022/12/04/woman-tries-to-feed-decoy-ducks-snaps-on-hunters-when-she-realizes-theyre-fake/" target="_blank">Whiskey Riff</a>)</p><p>MeMaw thought she was feeding <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/taliban-duck-boat" target="_blank">ducks</a>. The hunters who put the DECOYS in the water thought they were obvious enough decoys that the woman wouldn't try feeding them. See, when hunters hunt ducks, they use decoys to lure real ducks into the line of fire. The only thing these decoys lured was a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/molotov-cocktail-ukrainian-grandma" target="_blank">sweet old lady</a>... who stopped being sweet once she found out she was feeding dummy ducks.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@kyledixon25/video/7035670975119363375" class="tiktok-embed"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kyledixon25?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@kyledixon25">@kyledixon25</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7035670826326428462?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Kyle Dixon">♬ original sound - Kyle Dixon</a> </section> </blockquote> </div><p>The hunters tried to explain to MeMaw that the ducks weren't real and that she had managed to wander into the middle of a duck hunt. MeMaw screamed, "You spend all that money just to murder a duck that never did anything to you?"</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="597ab" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32250257&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The Ducks Bros answered with the only logical response: "We eat them. They're delicious."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="c7398" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32250259&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>That's when MeMaw started to go Mecha-Karen on the Duck Bros</p><p>MECHA-MEMAW: Buy it at Wegmans!</p><p>DUCK BRO #2: Or, I could just do this.</p><p>MECHA-MEMAW:  Because you're a murderer, that's why!<br /></p><p>Funny thing about the ducks on sale at Wegmans? They stop being alive before they are packed up and put on sale at Wegmans. To quote one of the greatest philosophers of this or any other generation, Uncle Ted Nugent, you can't grill it until you kill it.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="4b754" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32250262&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>At least for Mecha-MeMaw Karen, she most likely does not know what a TikTok is. I would hope any grandkids or great-grandkids would have the sense not to show her the video or tell her that the internet is having a laugh at her expense. They should stay quiet sucking on the butterscotch candy she gave them out of her purse, and let her tell her story about how she confronted these mean hunters.</p><p>To the hunters, thank you for remembering to do it for the content. I hope the real ducks were as easily fooled by the decoys. And that you also have a turkey and a chicken in the cooler with some cooking twine and a vivid imagination.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Ukrainian App Features Mark Hamill Saying 'May The Force Be With You' To Warn About Air Raids. Yes, Really.

It is 100% real. </p><p>Apparently, developers in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/biden-tanks-escalate" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> built an air raid alert app that works faster than the old fashioned sirens. I guess they had time to, since the war's been going on for over a year. But for the English-language version of the alert, they got Mark Hamill, the voice of Luke Skywalker. </p><p>In the alert, Hamill says,<em> "Attention, air raid alert. Proceed to the nearest shelter. Don't be careless. Your overconfidence is your weakness." </em> </p><p>It concludes with, <em>"The air raid alert is over. May the force be with you." </em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cSo, developers in Ukraine built an air raid alert app that\u2019s faster than the traditional sirens. They got Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) to voice the English-language version. It\u2019s been downloaded more than 11 million times. https://t.co/26g0faoeTZ\u201d</div> — Britton Williams (@Britton Williams)

<p>Remember that this is a very, very serious war and we need to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/zelensky-americans-support-ukraine" target="_blank">send billions and billions of dollars to Ukraine</a> to keep it funded. </p><p>Ukrainians can also have it set in their native language, of course. And that version isn't Luke Skywalker. But Ukrainians apparently love the Hamill version. Twenty-four-year old Bohdan Zvonyk told <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-star-wars-luke-hamill-app-08ec03bf1a2c9c0378857090079f00f9" target="_blank">Associated Press</a> he chose the Hamill version because he loves Star Wars and wants to improve his English: <em>"Besides, we could use a little bit of the power that Hamill wishes us.”</em></p><p>Ajax Systems, co-developer of the app, wants people outside of Ukraine to also download it to "get a taste of the angst heaped on Ukrainians by nerve-shredding alarms and airborne death and destruction." And totally not because it's their app they stand to profit off of. No, it's definitely all about the plight of the Ukrainians. </p><p>The app has reportedly been downloaded more than 14 million times, so Hamill's voice seems to be a huge success. If it brings some joy to the Ukrainian people, great. They've got enough on their plates as is, so anything that can help lighten their struggle is a good thing in my book. Even if it I initially couldn't believe it <em>wasn't</em> satire. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## 'It's a soul issue': Crowder gets blunt explaining difference between Uvalde and Nashville police responses

Specifically, how the Nashville Police Department compares to the response of the Uvalde Police last year. You know, when the cops waited around for over an hour and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/uvalde-hand-sanitizer" target="_blank">stopped to get hand sanitizer</a> before entering the classroom where children were being murdered. That one. </p><p>From yesterday's bodycam footage, it's clear that the Nashville police had an absolutely incredible response. Crowder highlighted Nashville's response time of 14 minutes. It took ten minutes for officers to arrive, and three minutes to kill the shooter. But he also explained the response time doesn't tell the whole story. So he played a side-by-side comparison of the bodycam footage from Nashville and Uvalde. </p><p>Gerald noted they actually had to fast-forward the Uvalde footage because it was so incredibly slow. Crowder then explained the main difference between the two: the Nashville police understood and accepted that their job is to die, if it comes down to it. The Uvalde police did not. The Nashville police ran towards the sound of the gunfire without hesitation. The Uvalde police were scared to enter the classroom, even as they could hear the screams of the children inside. </p><p>Gerald and Steven also pointed out that, although three minutes is phenomenal, it's not as good as zero minutes. Which would be the response time if there were armed guards at every school. And if teachers have their own firearms they responsibly use, they should be able to carry those firearms on school grounds. </p><p>There was a whole lot more to this segment, including the problem a loooot of conservatives are missing with calling this shooting a "hate crime". Plus, the horrible <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-bill-read" target="_blank">TikTok bill</a> that would basically be an online Patriot Act. So be sure to catch the whole show, completely uncensored, exclusively on Rumble. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

## Watch: Joy Reid does a journalism, asks Nancy Pelosi how to stop Americans from voting based on their religion

As you can expect, there was so. Much. Journalisming. If one can even categorize Joy Reid as a journalist. </p><p>Reid asked Pelosi, <em>"Give some advice to those who are frustrated by our politics now, about how you can start to get people to vote not on how politics will impact your religion, but how it will impact your life. You’re a religious person ...”</em></p><p>Nancy <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-priests-excorcism" target="_blank">Pelosi is Catholic</a>, though she has been <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-chronicle-pope" target="_blank">denied Holy Communion</a> by her local Bishop due to her rabid support for dismembering babies in the womb. Which is very much a grave sin. However, Pelosi seems to think religion shouldn't impact people's voting patterns - at least according to her rambling response to Reid's question. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cReid, holding the powerful accountable: "Give some advice to those who are frustrated by our politics now, about how you can start to get people to vote not on how politics will impact your religion, but how it will impact your life.

<p><em>"When President Kennedy was running for President, he went to Houston and spoke to all these ministers there. And the question is, 'what religion do you believe in?' Of course as a Catholic, that was not going to be popular. And he said, 'It's not important what religion I believe in. What's important is what America I believe in.' And that's what we have to be thinking in terms of." </em></p><p>Yeeaaaahhh...no. Religion absolutely has to inform political decisions, especially those that involve the genocide of unborn babies. Thanks though. </p><p>Pelosi then directed the conversation towards how some Trump supporters are patriotic, but others are racist bigots. She then somehow she got to the influence of money in politics. Neither of which have to do with Reid's original question, but I think we got the idea. Pelosi, and many other Democrats it seems, doesn't think religion should have any bearing on how you vote. Which is just not correct. If you are a professing Christian who values human life, that's a belief that should go all the way to the ballot box. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Criminal who attempted to murder Rand Paul Staffer was out of jail less than a day before the attack

Which makes sense, since it's D.C. </p><p>Paul released a statement about the incident, saying, <em>"This past weekend a member of my staff was brutally attacked in broad daylight in Washington, D.C. I ask you to join Kelley and me in praying for a speedy and complete recovery, and thanking the first responders, hospital staff, and police for their diligent actions. We are relieved to hear the suspect has been arrested. At this time we would ask for privacy so everyone can focus on healing and recovery.”</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The suspect has since been identified as Glynn Neal. Neal was previously sentenced to 12 years and four months in jail on charges of “compelling an individual to live a life of prostitution without his or her consent” and “threat to kidnap to injure a person."

## Watch: Fashion brand pays Dylan Mulvaney to model women's clothing because nothing belongs to females anymore

Yippee. </p><p>Mulvaney posted this latest life update in a TikTok of course. Mulvaney explained, <em>"It all started with the first day of spring. I am at Kate Spade New York to find the perfect spring outfit!" </em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cDylan Mulvaney is now the newest face of Kate Spade New York.\u201d</div> — Catch Up (@Catch Up)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpNetwork/status/1640952458871721985">1680068528</a>
</blockquote>

<p><em>"Kate Spade New York is a staple in my wardrobe,"</em> Mulvaney explained as Mulvaney grabbed a tiny white purse off the shelf. Mulvaney then tried on a bright pink dress and pair of white heels to complete the look. The TikTok on Mulavney's page is captioned,<em> "Celebrating the first day of spring with Kate Spade #KateSpadeNYPartner" </em>and is marked as a paid partnership. So yes, it appears that Kate Spade is paying Mulvaney to promote their clothing. For women. </p><p>I grow tired of pointing out the replacement of females with biological males in essentially all aspects of life now. But it is important to note. It's also quite bothersome how Mulvaney and other, ahem , trans "women" tend to portray females as the absolute worst stereotypes of women. </p><p>For example, take Dylan's TikTok from waaay back on Day 1 of "girlhood". Mulvaney said, <em>"Day 1 of being a girl, and I have already cried three times, I wrote a scathing email that I did not send, I ordered dresses online that I couldn't afford, and then when someone asked me how I was, I said, 'I'm fine,' but I wasn't fine. How'd I do ladies, good?"</em><br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</small>
</p>
<p><br /></p><p>So, according to Mulvaney, being a woman means you have to be emotionally unstable, passive aggressive, financially irresponsible, and lie about your emotions. Not exactly what being a woman is really all about. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## "Your refusal to do your job is revolting": Ted Cruz goes berserker mode all over Biden's failed DHS Secretary

The border was the first thing Biden f*cked up, almost starting the day after he was sworn in. Not only is our southern border still in crisis, but it keeps getting crisisier. A point Sen. Ted Cruz attempted to make to Biden's failed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.</p><p>Cruz going Wolvie-beserk style is the best Cruz. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Holy Shit <a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tedcruz</a> just went OFF <a href="https://t.co/R4XTq8Ox8T">pic.twitter.com/R4XTq8Ox8T</a><br />— Old Row (@OldRowOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/OldRowOfficial/status/1640782670891196430?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><br /></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Really, Twitter? <a href="https://t.co/4Q7voXr3WA">https://t.co/4Q7voXr3WA</a> <a href="https://t.co/YGS541qp5I">pic.twitter.com/YGS541qp5I</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1641047634046595072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The bit about the bracelets is my favorite:<br /></p><p>"Mr. Secretary, you have just testified to the American people that you are incompetent at your job. Because I have been to the southern border, and if you go to the southern border, along the southern border you see thousands of these wristbands. Because the illegal immigrants wear them. The drug cartels, every color corresponds to how many thousands of dollars they owe the cartels. You have turned these cartels into multi-billion dollars criminal organizations."</p><p>Mayorkas is a man who feels <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/border-wall-mayorkas-fox-news" target="_blank">illegal immigration is one of our proudest traditions</a>, and who would <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/doocy-mayorkas-horse-whip" target="_blank">rather throw his own men under the bus than admit he fell for disinformation</a> being pedaled by radical progressives and the media (but I repeat myself).

## Democrat spox calls for "transphobes" to be murdered hours after trans shooter murdered Christian schoolchildren

But when you look at the media reaction to the transgender Nashville shooter, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nashville-shooter-media-response" target="_blank">no one should be surprised</a>. Though for funsies, imagine the media reaction if a Kari Lake spokeswoman tweeted something similar if the <em>shooter</em> was Christian.</p><p>Because hours after a transgender shooter who goes by he/him pronouns shot up a Christian school and murdered Christian nine-year-olds, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/katie-hobbs-uber-driver" target="_blank">Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs'</a> press secretary Josselyn Berry tweeted this.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>I suppose -- for "independent" "fact" checking sake -- we should allow that the press secretary of a United States Governor had no idea that a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nashville-police-bodycam-footage" target="_blank">transgender shooter (he/him) shot up a Christian school</a> less than twelve hours before said press secretary decided to tweet this out of the blue. And that the Democrat press secretary of a Democrat governor wasn't celebrating people presumed to have a different political opinion than her had their children murdered. </p><p>She was <em>only</em> fantasizing about people who have a different political opinion than her being murdered. She believes it's a-ok for minors to be chemically castrated and/or have their genitals mutilated.  Anyone who disagrees is a -phobe.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
