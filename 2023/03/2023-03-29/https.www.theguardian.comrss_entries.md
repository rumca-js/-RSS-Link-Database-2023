<p>The worker-formed Mazrouah FC in Doha offers hope and direction to players far from home – and even a potential route into the professional game</p><p>“Maintain your dignity, maintain your confidence, maintain your belief.” Robert Otiato has been training his Mazrouah FC players for the last two hours and, before everyone heads into the night, it is time for some final words. They have run themselves into the hard, pebbly ground but Otiato has a habit of making them feel 10 feet tall and every face in a tight-knit circle is fixed in his direction. “Your talent will open doors for you,” he tells them. “There is a vision. There is a future.”</p><p>It has not always been easy to see one here, in a bleak and dusty expanse north-west of Doha. Life can be harsh for the workers whose accommodation sits 100 yards behind the pitch, and to which most of Otiato’s team return after the session. It feels a long way from their homes in different parts of Africa; they are in Qatar to earn some money but, in their limited downtime, there are few ways to occupy body and mind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/29/your-talent-will-open-doors-club-qatar-african-players-dream-mazrouah-fc">Continue reading...</a>

Author, poet and scholar of Russian literature whose greatest success came with his controversial 1981 novel The White Hotel<p>The greatest notoriety – and critical and sales success – enjoyed by the writer DM Thomas, who has died aged 88, came with his controversial novel The White Hotel (1981), inspired by his readings of Sigmund Freud and by Anatoly Kuznetsov’s Holocaust novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/06/five-of-the-best-books-about-russia-and-ukraine" title="">Babi Yar</a>. Thomas’s novel combined these two influences in a driving, non-naturalistic plot centred on Lisa Erdman, a fictional patient of Freud’s, who progresses through sexual obsession to being shot down by Nazis in a ravine outside Kyiv.</p><p>The sex and violence were described in lingering, some said lubricious, detail. Although the novel was variously hailed – by Graham Greene and Time magazine, among others – as a powerful new departure in fiction, and an insight into the dark heart of the 20th century, it was attacked by some as pornographic and misogynistic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/29/dm-thomas-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A policy built on the deliberate aim of making Britain inhospitable to refugees will only make the system less effective</p><p>Hotel accommodation is expensive and inefficient as a system for managing migration flows to the UK. Alternative facilities might be somewhat cheaper – the Home Office puts the cost of hotel rooms at £6m a day – but that is not the only reason why Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, on Wednesday announced a plan to house migrants on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/28/home-office-planning-to-house-asylum-seekers-on-disused-cruise-ships" title="">barges and military bases</a>.</p><p>There is special political urgency conjured by the word hotel, which has associations of leisure and luxury.

<p>The global response to an escalating water crisis is belated and inadequate. But last week’s UN conference was an important marker</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/24/united-nations-water-conference-new-york-pledges" title="">more than 700 pledges</a> that emerged from the UN water conference, which concluded last weekend, were an insufficient response to the worsening global water crisis. But the scientific panel that the UN has committed to create, along with a new water envoy, should help bring greater clarity and raise awareness of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/23/water-un-conference-climate-crisis-disasters" title="">multiplying risks</a>. These include sea level rises, floods, droughts and other extreme weather caused by global heating, and the lack of access of about 2 billion people to clean drinking water. The trouble is that the commitments made by attenders – who included very few world leaders – are voluntary and unenforceable. Given the broken climate pledges of the past, there is every reason to worry that the promises will not be kept.</p><p>Many participants in the three days of talks in New York were angered by the prominent role played by corporations, including manufacturers who are heavy users of water, and the lack of representation of grassroots organisations from the poorer countries that are the worst affected. As with recent reports of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/27/fossil-fuel-firms-us-universities-colonize-academia" title="">influence of oil companies in US universities</a>, there are growing concerns about the ways in which businesses are seeking to shape environmental legislation, and public understanding of the threats, to promote their own short-term economic interests.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-a-water-crisis-targets-need-to-be-binding">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Deputy prime minister shreds what remains of his reputation during what is likely his last ever PMQs</p><p>No more Mr Nice Guy. Rishi Sunak has always been keen to project himself as a thoroughly decent bloke. The sort of man even his opponents can trust. Someone who keeps his word. But bit by bit that mask is peeling off. On Wednesday he revealed himself to be an out and out sadist. How else can you explain the decision to leave Dominic ‘Psycho’ Raab in post as his deputy and then skip off to Betty Boothroyd’s funeral, leaving Psycho to step up for prime minister’s questions?</p><p>For months now, Psycho has cut a lonely, dejected figure on the government frontbench. Even he has come to realise his political career is as good as over.

A largely popular, relentless election-winning machine has already survived the unionist mud-slinging on the NHS (where, despite the challenges of Tory austerity and Covid, waiting times are much better than in the rest of the UK) and corruption, where the badly managed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/04/nicola-sturgeon-rejects-cronyism-accusation-over-ferries-contract" title="">ferry contracts</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/13/police-investigate-snp-over-independence-campaign-cash-claims" title="">party funds</a> issue have been blown out of all proportion (and pale into insignificance compared with the UK government’s corruption and incompetence, which attract far fewer column inches).</p><p>Limited progress on, for example, child poverty has to be seen against the backdrop of a much worse situation elsewhere in the UK. The SNP government has largely played a terrible hand pretty well to mitigate most of the evils sent from Westminster, and has been rewarded with victory after victory at the ballot box.

<p>This Netflix series from Instagram star Celeste Barber is absorbing, amusing, no-nonsense TV. It’s the perfect way to unwind</p><p>There have been few better satirists of the Instagram age than Celeste Barber. In 2015, the Australian actor began recreating posts by the platform’s stars, mimicking the showy-offy poses of Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski et al but replacing their sultry pouts, glossy manes and pert figures with her own unkempt hair and relatably droopy curves. In doing so, Barber skewered this supposedly aspirational imagery: instead of being cool and candid, these pictures were blatantly ridiculous. It was a cathartic act of bubble-bursting that bordered on public service.</p><p>The parodies sent Barber into A-list territory herself, at least where social media is concerned: she now has 9.5 million followers on Instagram. All the while, the 40-year-old has been working steadily in Australian TV – including a supporting role in the brilliant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/25/the-letdown-review-an-affecting-portrait-of-motherhood-with-spoonfuls-of-comedy">motherhood comedy The Letdown</a>.

## Germany fans seek new ‘summer fairytale’ but need a team to believe in | Jonathan Liew

<p>The Euro 2024 hosts have work to do if they are to unite the nation as they did even in glorious failure at 2006 World Cup</p><p>“Bring on the new Sommermärchen,” read a banner that was unfurled at the Rhein-Energie Stadion just before kick-off on Tuesday night. Almost two decades on, it’s hard to overstate what a cherished place the 2006 World Cup still holds in Germany’s collective memory. The “summer fairytale”, they call it: a summer of golden memories and national euphoria, of street parties on scorching evenings, a summer that has spawned films and books and songs, despite ending in the semi-finals for the hosts.<br /><br />“All the streets were full, everything with German flags, public viewing was practically invented,” remembered Matthias Ginter last week. Ginter was a 12-year-old boy in the summer of 2006 and is now a 29-year-old defender in the squad that will be expected to recreate the Sommermärchen in 2024. And ever since Germany was awarded the right <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/27/var-used-champions-league-next-season-euro-2020-uefa-europa-league">to host next year’s European Championship</a> the tournament has been imbued with an almost alchemic power: a chance to unite and dream and make magic again.</p><p>For the players, still bruised after last year’s Qatar World Cup and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/01/costa-rica-germany-world-cup-group-e-match-report">its road of many miseries</a>, a Euros on home soil offers a clear redemptive arc. Twelve fixtures separate Hansi Flick’s side from the opening game in Munich in June 2024. All are friendlies, which is less than ideal. No host nation has won a World Cup or European Championship on home soil since France in 1998, and perhaps the lack of competitive practice is one reason. The indeterminate 2-0 win over Peru last Saturday was one example: friendlies may show you how bad you are, but they won’t necessarily show how good you are.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/29/germany-euro-2024-hansi-flick-world-cup-2006">Continue reading...</a>

The paper vocally backed the campaign against slavery in the British empire – going so far as to encourage readers to sign petitions to this effect. But its stance on the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act insisted on the “justice” of a £20m payment to enslavers – which would be worth billions today – as well as the requirement that enslaved Africans served additional years in bondage as apprentices to their erstwhile owners.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/29/from-the-archive-the-19th-century-guardian-views-on-slavery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester’s liberal establishment backed the abolition of British slavery – but their wealth depended on the labour of enslaved Africans in the United States</p><p>In the 19th century, Manchester was the global centre of cotton manufacturing. Within 50 miles of the city centre – across Lancashire, Derbyshire, and Cheshire – there were almost 2,500 mills employing more than 400,000 people. Visitors to the world’s first industrial city were awestruck: when the French diplomat and historian Alexis de Tocqueville came to the city in 1835, he wrote of “a thousand noises” rising from Manchester’s “damp, dark labyrinth”, of “the crunching wheels of machines, the shriek of steam from the boilers, [and] the regular beat of looms”.</p><p>The city known as “Cottonopolis” clothed the world, but it was dependent on “King Cotton”: in a 1,000-mile belt from the east coast to eastern Texas, millions of enslaved African Americans were forced each day to the hellish work of planting, growing and picking that crop. Propelled by Eli Whitney’s gins (that is, “engines”), which allowed for the rapid separation of the fibre from the seed, the American south had cornered the Atlantic market. By 1860, it was supplying about 80% of the raw cotton that Britain imported.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/29/the-manchester-guardian-the-limits-of-liberalism-in-the-kingdom-of-cotton">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Despite an uptick in sports movies, the days of Bull Durham, The Natural and Moneyball are long behind us</p><p>The crack of the bat. The roar of the crowd. The green grass and the brown dirt. These are the sights and sounds that bring joy to baseball fans every April, both in person and on the silver screen. Historically, baseball films are released in the spring to coincide with Opening Day, when even the most deadened fanbase can spare a smidge of romance and optimism. The Bad News Bears, Major League, Field of Dreams, Fever Pitch and 42 were all released in April. This year, there are none to be found, and that’s not a scheduling accident. A baseball film hasn’t had a significant theatrical release – in any month, let alone April – since 2016, when Richard Linklater’s Everybody Wants Some!! landed with a thud at the box office.</p><p>It’s a strange phenomenon since movies about other sports are thriving. In March and April, no fewer than four basketball films will be released (Champions, Air, Somewhere in Queens, Sweetwater). Already this year there have been hit movies about the NFL (80 for Brady) and boxing (Creed III). Other 2023 films will tackle wrestling (The Iron Claw), tennis (Challengers), and soccer (Next Goal Wins). The only baseball film on the calendar is The Hill, a faith-friendly true story of a disabled minor leaguer in the 1970s, but it lacks any major stars and is being released in the doldrums of August.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/29/baseball-movies-moneyball-bull-durham">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘In Yoruba culture, these giant otherwordly figures represent the return of deceased ancestors. Photographing them in port towns north of Newcastle was quite surreal’</p><p>My parents were part of a group of Nigerians who came to study in the UK. They met and married here and I was born in London; then they moved back to Nigeria with me when I was a year or two old. Growing up, I was surrounded by Yoruba culture and inspired by a lot of the local artwork my dad collected and put on the walls.</p><p>Returning to London as a teenager, I felt like an alien. Everything looked foreign and I struggled to understand people’s points of reference. I spent many years after university working in the pharmaceutical industry before moving back to my first love: art. I made a living for a while as a commercial photographer, but it took me some years to start focusing on the more personal work that really fulfils me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/29/yoruban-masqueraders-newcastle-asikos-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

## France captain Kylian Mbappé is leading an exciting new generation

<p>Didier Deschamps has taken France to two straight World Cup finals. Given their talent, expect them to excel at Euro 2024</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_?lang=en">Eric Devin</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>It seems like only yesterday that Kylian Mbappé was a fresh-faced teenager, his knee slides propelling Monaco to the Ligue 1 title and a place in the Champions League semi-finals. He is now 24, a Paris Saint-Germain player and the captain of France. Is this a new era for Didier Deschamps’ side or is it just a reminder of how quickly time moves as one ages? On the evidence of France’s two wins in the international break – 4-0 over the Netherlands and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/27/republic-ireland-france-euro-2024-qualifier-match-report">1-0 over the Republic of Ireland</a> in Euro 2024 qualifying – the evidence points to the former.</p><p>The current France side bear little resemblance to the one that became world champions in 2018 and, after a raft of international retirements (Raphäel Varane, Steve Mandanda, Karim Benzema, the captain Hugo Lloris), one can even make the case that they have little in common with the team that lost the World Cup final in December – save Mbappé, the evergreen Antoine Griezmann and Olivier Giroud. Some of this is circumstantial, with injuries waylaying the careers of the erstwhile midfield linchpins Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kanté, as well as the defender Presnel Kimpembe. But, more than ever, an incredible generation of footballers is coalescing around Mbappé, who looks very happy to take on the mantle of captain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/29/france-captain-kylian-mbappe-didier-deschamps-world-cup-euro-2024">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Unpleasant to look at, with a chatbot-level script and phoned-in voiceovers, film-makers can’t get away with shovelling out this kind of thing</p><p>You may find yourself, as Talking Heads might have said, watching this animated feature about dead yet ambulatory mummified ancient Egyptians capering about some weird version of London. And you may ask yourself, not only how did you get here when the oracle warned you not to go, but what did you do in a past life to deserve this?</p><p>You may also ask yourself all sorts of questions about the simple logic of this very poorly written and ill-considered film. Such as: why do the mummy characters look like regular humans most of the time except in certain kinds of light which make them look like trick-or-treaters wearing bad skeleton makeup? How did they magically get back from our world to their underworld land of the mummy dead at the end of the film with such ease, given it was supposed to be so challenging in the first act? Why does the villain – a crazed museum curator named Lord Carnaby (Hugh Bonneville) – have such a weird obsession with his mother (Celia Imrie, who like Bonneville is turning a cheap voiceover trick presumably for the money)? How did the heroine, a mummy princess named Nefer (Eleanor Tomlinson), who apparently aspires to be an undead Ariana Grande with a bobbed hairstyle, suddenly learn to sing Walk Like an Egyptian? And why doesn’t she find the lyrics offensive, being a real Egyptian?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/29/mummies-review-nonsense-kiddie-flick-should-be-avoided-like-a-plague-of-locusts">Continue reading...</a>

## Top 10 stories about wolves

<p>Writers including Angela Carter, Karen Russell and Jiang Rong have looked into the eyes of an animal that roams widely through our stories and stalks our collective imagination </p><p>Is it because wolves are one of the most widely distributed land mammals on earth – from tideline to tundra, desert to grassland – that they also roam so widely through our stories? Or is it because of what we share as apex predators, both of us known to wander away from our families when we are young, mate for life, raise young collaboratively and, as Plato pointed out, sometimes kill our own kind? To consider a wolf is to grapple with an animal that conjures both the familiar – our dogs; ourselves – and the foreign. The wolf will not be tamed, but neither is it likely to hunt us. The animal looms far larger in our psyches than we likely do in its. But what exactly is the animal we have created in our stories and our minds? “Between the wolf in the tall grass and the wolf in the tall story there is a shimmering go-between,” wrote Vladimir Nabokov. “That go-between, that prism, is the art of literature.”</p><p>From fable to fairytale to wilderness adventure novel, the wolf has very often been cast as antagonist; a spectre of danger and the unknown. The very mention of “howling in the distance” has, like the creaking door, become a sort of atmospheric shorthand for looming threat or eerie uncertainty. There is also, though, a well of wolf stories that nod to the trope of evil wolf before subverting it. Having written my first book, Wolfish, about the solo journey of one famous Oregon wolf alongside my own coming-of-age departure from home, I am fascinated by the biological reality of wolves, but also in dissecting what I have come to think of as the “cultural taxidermy” of our lupine symbols.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/29/top-10-stories-about-wolves-wolfish-erica-berry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Soup made with stinging nettles? You’d better believe it: this is a tried-and-tested spring classic – but make sure you have some rubber gloves to hand</p><p>The first time I made nettle soup, it was edible, but underwhelming, leading me to the conclusion that, though I was glad one <em>could</em> eat one of the <a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/stinging-nettle">few edible wild foods in abundance locally</a>, I wouldn’t be rushing to repeat the experience while I could still afford to buy greens. Yet the enthusiasm of others for this stinging weed unsettled me: could it be that I, rather than the poor old nettle, was at fault?</p><p>Reader, it seems it could. Having given the soup a second, third and sixth and seventh chance this week, I must concede that my fellow food writers are not, as I’d cynically assumed, lying through their teeth when they liken the stuff to spinach. The notorious nettle has a similarly iron-rich, slightly minerally flavour – indeed, as one of the first plants to emerge after the winter, it was <a href="http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/nettlesoup.htm">much prized as a tonic by our forerunners on these islands</a>, held to purify the blood and ensure good health in the months ahead. Not only are nettles a <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/herb/stinging-nettle">decent source of vitamins and minerals</a>, they’re also surprisingly tasty. You just have to know how to handle them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/29/how-to-make-the-perfect-nettle-soup-recipe-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A compelling account of ageism and misogyny that overemphasises feminism’s generational divide</p><p>In the US comic Amy Schumer’s sketch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDz2kcjWpOs" title="">Last Fuckable Day</a>, Schumer is out walking when she comes across a picnic. There, three actors – Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tina Fey and Patricia Arquette – are celebrating Louis-Dreyfus’s last day of being “believably fuckable” in the eyes of the entertainment industry. “If you shoot a sex scene the night before your birthday everyone’s, like, ‘Hurry up, hurry up, we’ve got to get it before midnight’ because they think your vagina is going to turn into a hermit crab’,” Fey tells Schumer.</p><p>I kept thinking of this while reading Hags, Victoria Smith’s account of the way older women are treated by a society that deems them unsightly and past their sell-by date. In discussing the precedents and structures behind this unholy collision of ageism and misogyny, the book draws on Snow White, the Malleus Maleficarum (a German treatise on witchcraft), Fatal Attraction (featuring Glenn Close’s fabled “bunny boiler”) plus the work of feminist theorists and campaigners such as Andrea Dworkin, Adrienne Rich and Gloria Steinem. From “Karens” (the entitled middle-aged complainers demanding to see the manager) to witches (read: sexless, embittered, ugly), Smith examines the thriving stereotypes used to sideline and vilify older women, often by young people who call themselves feminists. She recalls the <a href="https://condenaststore.com/featured/no-one-is-a-bigger-feminist-john-mcnamee.html" title="">New Yorker cartoon</a> depicting a Puritan delivering a speech as a woman is about to be burned as a witch. “Let me start by saying no one is a bigger feminist than me,” he says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/29/hags-the-demonisation-of-middle-aged-women-by-victoria-smith-review">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up here</a></strong></li></ul><p>When my launch-day Nintendo Switch arrived in March 2017, I was on maternity leave with my then three-month-old baby – which meant that, for the first time in my adult life, I was able to enjoy a new video games console without worrying about what I was going to write about it. And with it arrived The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which casually redrew the blueprint of open-world games, replacing repetitive missions and box-ticking busywork with a genuine sense of wonder and discovery. I played almost nothing but Breath of the Wild for an entire year – and yet, ever since Nintendo announced the sequel in 2019, I’ve been feeling oddly flat about it. We’ve known so little about it, beyond teaser-trailer glimpses. Is it going to be more of the same?</p><p>Admittedly, more of the same wouldn’t be so bad: we’re talking about one of the best games ever made here. But then Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, played 10 minutes’ worth of Tears of the Kingdom <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6qna-ZCbxA">in a video presentation yesterday</a> – and now I’m sold. It <em>is </em>more of the same, in that it looks identical to Breath of the Wild’s toned-down watercolour style, features the same stirring orchestral exploration-music, and it’s set in the same kingdom of Hyrule. But this time around, Nintendo’s designers want us to get creative with it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/29/weve-just-seen-tears-of-the-kingdom-gameplay-for-the-first-time-and-the-skys-the-limit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author’s compelling second novel sees an actor return to the birthplace of her ancestors, only to discover the pieces of herself that were missing</p><p>Isabella Hammad’s 2019 debut novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/20/the-parisian-isabella-hammad-review" title="">The Parisian</a>, was roundly praised for its scale and humanity and won the Betty Trask prize. On the face of it, her second novel contrasts strongly with her first. The Parisian is a historical epic with a questing, romantic male protagonist; Enter Ghost is set in the modern day, and focuses on Sonia Nasir, a 35-year-old actor, who is arguably in stasis. Yet Hammad’s second novel is unmistakably the first book’s direct descendant: a story of Palestine, driven by questions of identity and belonging.</p><p>It begins with Sonia’s arrival at an airport. She is questioned and strip-searched, and finally allowed through immigration to see the sign: Welcome to Israel. She is visiting her sister, Haneen, in Haifa, but immediately takes a taxi to Akka, determined to “see something beautiful first”. Standing on the clifftop, watching the bathers below, she is as disconnected from the bright-blue sea as the trauma of being strip-searched, and imagines herself falling to the rocks below, “smashed in an instant and bloody on the rock”. She speaks English to the Palestinian taxi driver – “I resisted the idea of being bonded to this person” – and it’s with this refusal of her presence that Sonia, ghostlike, arrives in the land of her ancestors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/29/enter-ghost-by-isabella-hammad-review-hamlet-in-palestine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Beyond the talent-show ballads and mass-market fluff that dominated the early 2000s was a wave of brilliant leftfield pop, with debauched lyrics sung over ‘crunchy and horrible’ music</p><p>In 1997, while the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/spicegirls">Spice Girls</a> were busy filming their debut cinematic opus Spice World, songwriting and production duo Richard “Biff” Stannard and Matt Rowe were sat in Abbey Road studios in London twiddling their thumbs. In need of ideas for the band’s second album, but with the group themselves away on set, they started to venture outside the world of pure pop. “I’m a massive New Order fan and there’s a frog [sound] on their Low-Life album and I remember thinking: ‘I really want to put frogs on this song’,” Stannard told me when I interviewed him for my book <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/reach-for-the-stars-9781788707244">Reach for the Stars</a>, an oral history of 00s pop. Sure enough, odd ribbit sounds are peppered throughout the verses of the band’s disco-tinged <a href="https://youtu.be/WVQ1ZaLmfJ8">Never Give Up On the Good Times</a>.</p><p>While Posh, Sporty, Scary, Baby and Ginger were generally involved in their songwriting, and worked in a small creative bubble, the boom that the Spice Girls instigated in UK pop meant that for a while there wasn’t generally much scope to deviate from the era’s dominant sounds: saccharine pastiche (Steps, S Club 7) and clean-cut pop-R&amp;B (Five, Blue). Songwriting teams would often be writing to suit the tastes of powerful A&amp;Rs keen to keep things decidedly mass-market. “We would basically be writing for Simon Cowell rather than the particular artist,” former Westlife and Shayne Ward songwriter Savan Kotecha told me. “He had a very specific pop taste.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/29/frog-sounds-and-electropunk-freakouts-why-00s-pop-was-odder-than-the-x-factor">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This entertaining documentary looks at how teachers Rita and Jerry Alter walked into a museum and left with a rolled-up Willem de Kooning now worth $160m</p><p>It was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/16/arizona-museum-de-kooning-painting-theft-1985">brazen case of daylight robbery</a>. In 1985, a couple walked into an art gallery on the campus of the University of Arizona and left 15 minutes later with a rolled-up Willem de Kooning shoved up the man’s jacket. In 2017, the painting was finally recovered – not by the FBI, but by a trio of house clearance guys in New Mexico. It had been hanging for 30 years on the bedroom wall of retired teachers Rita and Jerry Alter.</p><p>How an ordinary couple like the Alters pulled off one of the biggest art heists of the 20th century is told in this mostly entertaining documentary. You can imagine the story being turned into a podcast and it’s perhaps stretched a little thin for a full-length documentary. (Did we really need an interview with the couple’s nephew’s son?) The weak link is the film’s dramatisation of the theft: a tongue-in-cheek pastiche that feels a bit glib as questions about the Alters’ motivations deepen and darken. Still, the film offers a fascinating glimpse into the mystery of other people, especially other people’s marriages. Friends and family still look dazed that the Alters – Rita and Jerry! – were behind the theft.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/29/the-thief-collector-review-the-ordinary-married-couple-behind-a-massive-art-heist">Continue reading...</a>

## Manga-nifique! How France became obsessed with Japanese anime

<p>In the 1970s, giant robot cartoons sparked a love affair with French fans (including Emmanuel Macron) – now the country is the world’s largest manga importer, and home to a new Murakami film</p><p>You might say that Vincent van Gogh was one of the first Japanese pop-culture <em>otaku</em> (geeks) in Europe. With the 19th-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japonisme">japonisme</a> craze in full swing, he coveted <em>ukiyo-e</em> woodblock prints like modern-day collectors hoard rare manga. Japanese art deeply influenced his work, from his flattening of perspective to his bold lines. He went to the south of France hoping to encounter the same radiant nature and spiritual freshness that figured in his east-Asian fantasia. Upon seeing Katsushika Hokusai’<em>s </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa">The Great Wave Off Kanagawa</a><em> –</em> a supposed inspiration for his own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night">The Starry Night</a> – he raved to his brother Theo in a letter: “The waves are <em>claws</em>, the boat is caught in them, you can feel it.”</p><p>The new animation Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman, by France-based animator Pierre Földes, shows that the French love affair with Japanese visual arts is still throbbing. Anime and manga are a worldwide cultural force but nowhere more so than France – an unbelievable 55% of comics sold there in 2021 were manga, according to consumer research body GfK. A beguiling mashup of six Haruki Murakami short stories set in the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman emerged foremost from Földes’s own first contact with Japanese literature as a teenager. “I loved the fact the style of storytelling was so different to the west,” says the director. “It’s more contemporary, less structured. Here, everything is very structured, with a beginning and end. The story goes from here to there, through different moments of emotion. I’m not so much into that.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/29/france-manga-anime-murakami-macron">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I spent my adult life pushing away my sense of enchantment. Illness taught me how much I needed it</p><p>For the first two months of this year, I was ill. I don’t mean the kind of ill that you can soldier on through, sniffing as you go. I mean properly, cancel-everything-and-take-to-your-bed ill. I was not sure when I would feel well again, and that was a problem because I had a book that was about to be published – a book about rekindling awe, wonder and fascination. I could barely stand up, let alone hold a thought in my head. Those soft emotions felt very far away.</p><p>But in my experience, Enchantment, my new book, always was intended for dark times, rather than easy ones. It emerged from the depths of the pandemic, when successive lockdowns had left me so burnt out that I felt as though I’d ground to a halt. Time looped and skipped, and my mind seemed unable to rest on the most simple activities, like holding a conversation or filling out a form. Worst of all, I lost my ability to read for pleasure. My solace and retreat, the place I turn to when I want to escape into the world of stories and ideas, was gone. It was as though desire itself had left me. I wondered if I’d ever be able to find it again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/29/katherine-may-i-was-a-tiny-speck-in-a-vast-universe-enchantment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A revisionist history that adds stability, contentment and women’s rights to the familiar picture of authoritarianism</p><p>By 1988, the average East German drank 142 litres of beer a year, double the intake of the average West German. The obvious explanation is they drank to escape the unbearable awfulness of being in the German Democratic Republic, with its omnipresent Stasi, clown-car Trabants, travel restrictions, gerontocratic rulers, grim Baltic holidays and laughable elections.</p><p>Not so, argues East German-born historian Katja Hoyer. Most East Germans drank not to forget their worries but because they had so little to worry about. She writes: “for those who wanted a quiet life with the small comforts of home it was a stable place with few concerns or worries”. By the late 1980s, true, the level of surveillance carried out by the Stasi was at an all-time high, but often it did little with the information gathered. In this, it was arguably less intrusive, certainly less effective, than today’s data-plundering techno-giants.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/29/beyond-the-wall-by-katja-hoyer-review-overturning-cliches-of-east-germany">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This depressing, mundane adaptation takes Octavia Butler’s groundbreaking 1972 novel and turns its time-travelling depictions of slavery into something woeful. What a letdown</p><p>Adapting a beloved literary classic is a daunting task, but the team behind Kindred, based on Octavia Butler’s 1972 novel – and its time-travelling exploration of slavery – is a promising one. The series is developed by the acclaimed playwright, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/us-news-blog/2012/oct/02/how-to-win-macarthur-award">MacArthur-certified genius</a>, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, with a pilot directed by buzzy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/04/zola-review-aziah-wells-trip-florida-pole-dancing-seductive-comedy-thriller">Zola</a> director Janicza Bravo. Its young star, Mallori Johnson, comes with Julliard school of performing arts’ stamp of approval. Those classy credentials are clear in the pilot where a tense family dinner at a restaurant and subsequent “meet cute” with a charming waiter are scintillatingly written and performed. But as the show dives into its central concept, it becomes increasingly insubstantial, with an accelerating brutality that feels hollow and gratuitous.</p><p>Where the novel had its protagonist Dana bouncing between 1976 and the antebellum south, the television adaptation specifies the present as 2016. We follow an aspiring Black soap opera writer who uses her inheritance to move to suburban LA, complete with McMansion and uppity white micro-aggression-heavy neighbours. She has a budding relationship with aspiring musician Kevin, which is complicated when Dana finds herself transported back to early 19th century Maryland every time her ancestor Rufus’s life is in danger – and she has to save his life in order to secure her bloodline.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/29/kindred-review-a-reductive-hollow-view-of-black-trauma">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Echoing the work of Adam Curtis, film-maker Sierra Pettengill curates archive footage from riot-torn 60s America to create an unsettling picture of the authorities’ response</p><p>As if in a seance or hypnotic trance, Sierra Pettengill conjures the ambient voices of the riot-torn United States in the 1960s, traumatised by the uproar in Watts, Chicago, Newark and Detroit. She curates archive TV discussion show clips and newsreel footage of the times, including some quite extraordinary contemporary reports about the “Riotsville” imitation towns that the US army built to practise anti-riot techniques. These were complete with audience bleachers in which an invited crowd of military brass could approvingly watch a full-scale re-enactment of the Watts riot – a bizarre theatrical fantasy in which the disorder was swiftly and efficiently brought under control. (Jesse Moss and Tony Gerber’s 2008 film<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Battle_Rattle"> Full Battle Rattle</a> discussed the fake Iraqi town built in the Mojave Desert for very similar reasons.)</p><p>Pettengill also shows us TV reports on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/us-civil-rights-report-kerner-commission">Lyndon B Johnson’s Kerner commission</a> which was tasked with looking into the causes of the riots, but whose findings resulted chiefly in increased federal funding for the police. The authorities were obsessed with the largely illusory threats of “snipers”, whose supposed presence justified police and army intrusions and attacks on private property. She shows us earnest but intensely angry discussion shows aired by PBL, the Public Broadcast Laboratory (a precursor to PBS) which ventilated the rage felt by African Americans over civil rights, and was shut down when its sponsor, the Ford Foundation, withdrew funding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/29/riotsville-usa-review-disquieting-study-of-police-tactics-to-deal-with-social-unrest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kampala’s wildly innovative underground music scene has become a home for queer east Africans. A proposed law change not only endangers them, but an entire cultural movement</p><p>Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni, in his 38th year of increasingly authoritarian rule, has declared that his people will never embrace homosexuality and that the west’s “deviations” are not to be normalised. Instead, Ugandan MPs have approved an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/ugandan-mps-pass-bill-imposing-death-penalty-homosexuality">anti-LGBTQ+ bill</a> which recommends heavy sentences – including the death penalty – for acts of homosexuality in a country where it is already illegal. It awaits the president’s signature to become law.</p><p>The 2023 anti-homosexuality bill criminalises those touching another person “with the intention of committing the act of homosexuality” and any person who identifies as “a lesbian, gay, transgender, a queer” with up to 10 years in prison. Up to five years in prison is deemed adequate for the vague act of “promotion of homosexuality”. Only two out of 389 MPs voted against the bill, which has been broadly welcomed across Ugandan society.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/29/ugandan-musicians-fear-anti-gay-law">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Charlotte Hornets have struggled to achieve on-court success under the Hall of Famer.

This comes four years after he sold a slice of the franchise to a group led by the venture capitalist Gabe Plotkin – the Michael Jordan of short-selling, according to some. It’s unclear whether Jordan is trying to bring in investment, or whether he wants to cash out of the league entirely. In the latter case, his take would be an 80% slice of a pie valued at more than $1bn. As investments go, it’s nothing but net.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/29/michael-jordans-big-score-why-his-nba-ownership-tenure-is-far-from-a-failure">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The forward talks about his love for animals, his new charity and how he deals with the highs and lows of being a footballer</p><p>“Some of my teammates call me Donkey.” A grin creeps across Kai Havertz’s face. “It’s not because of my football,” the Chelsea forward adds, as if he needed to. Instead, he says, it is something deeper. “From day one, I felt a special relationship with donkeys. It’s a very calm animal: maybe I personalised myself in them because I’m calm too. They chill all day, don’t do much, just want to live their life. I loved them always. And when I lost, I would go to the sanctuary. You look at the animals, see something human in them. It was a kind of recovery, a place I felt peace.”</p><p>It is a cold, wet morning in Wimbledon and Havertz is talking about football and life, the game and everything that goes with it, including politics, money and war. In a clear, calm tone, he talks about change at Chelsea and throughout football: of players, coaches, staff, even owners. In himself, too. About scoring the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/29/manchester-city-chelsea-champions-league-final-match-report-kai-havertz" title="">winner in the Champions League final</a>, the release and responsibility, and the dreams players pursue and the pressure that pursues them, exposed early.

<p>There appears to be no rush to dismantle and repurpose the venues despite lavish pre-tournament assurances on legacy</p><p>The workers’ accommodation next to Ahmad bin Ali Stadium is at least two thirds empty now. Those who remain can make the short walk from the central block to the mess room, where food and drink are available. The other two structures have virtually been hollowed out since the World Cup: one of the alleys between them is all but blocked by a pile of bedframes and mattresses, of which there are plenty because the inhabitants lived four to a room. Presumably someone, at some point, will arrive to clear up the extensive clutter; further behind is a spread of binbags and other trash. An employee estimates 100 men remain: they are contracted to the two firms who built the venue and, while the showpiece event is long gone, there is still work to be done here.</p><p>Exactly how much remains to be seen. These workers appear to be carrying out routine maintenance but, according to Qatar’s post-tournament legacy plan for the site, Ahmad bin Ali Stadium will soon be scaled back from its present 45,000 capacity to a more manageable 20,000. The removed seats in its upper tier will be donated to venues domestically and “nations in need of sporting infrastructure”; a newly compact arena will be neatly sized for domestic and continental games played by the local club, Al Rayyan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/29/broken-promises-the-future-of-qatar-world-cup-stadiums-still-up-in-air">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An impressive and enchantingly strange novel plays with genre, identity and politics in an alternate America</p><p>Celebrated for her novels, her art installations and her musical collaborations with David Bowie, Tom Waits and Tony Visconti, the artist known as X was, until her death in 1996, one of the more enigmatic cultural figures of the 20th century. She always refused to confirm her place or date of birth, and after she took the pseudonym “X” in 1982, it was never clear which if any of her previous identities – Dorothy Eagle, Clyde Hill, Caroline Walker, Bee Converse – corresponded to her actual name. This is a biography drawing on X’s archives and a range of interviews with the people closest to her, joining the dots about her background and exploring her difficult relationship with contemporary America. And it is, like X herself, entirely a work of fiction.</p><p>Catherine Lacey, the author of this haunting, genre-bending novel, has form investigating characters with mysterious identities. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/22/pew-by-catherine-lacey-review-a-foreboding-fable" title="">Her previous book, Pew</a>, was<em> </em>a gothic fable set in America’s Bible belt, narrated by an unnamed protagonist whose race, gender and age are never established.

<p>The internet is now one big harassment machine – and fans can easily become unhealthily fanatical</p><p>So this is embarrassing to admit, but, when I was a tween, I was obsessed with Bush. THE BAND! THE BAND! I adored the lead singer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/04/gavin-rossdale-embarrassing-moment-the-gross-spectre-of-my-crumbling-marriage">Gavin Rossdale</a>, and I assumed that one day the stars would align and I would marry him. (The stars made me gay instead.) I spent hours on the dial-up internet inhaling Bush-related content and I harboured a grudge against Gwen Stefani, because she was with Gavin, living my dream. What I didn’t do, however, was send Stefani any online threats. Mainly because 1) that would be unhinged; and 2) the internet was very slow and it wasn’t easy to instantly harass people online.</p><p>Fast-forward a million years and the internet is now one big harassment machine. Fans, tweenage and older, can become unhealthy fanatics very easily. See, for example, the drama between the fanbases of the model Hailey Bieber and the singer Selena Gomez. This saga is too inane to properly explain, but, in brief, the two women have been pitted against each other by their fans because they each dated Justin Bieber (to whom the model is now married). This fake feud was amplified when Gomez joined TikTok, because social media algorithms love pushing divisive content that drives engagement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/29/what-is-behind-the-hounding-of-hailey-bieber-toxic-fandom-and-divisive-algorithms">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At two wildlife centres in the Madre de Dios region, the victims of illegal mining activities embark on a long journey of rehabilitation</p><p>“She used to fight every time I tried to feed her, but she recognises it’s me now,” says Cinthia Pariguana-Garriazo, a veterinary nurse at <a href="https://www.taricayaecoreserve.org/">Taricaya eco reserve</a>. It is 6am, and she is coaxing a squealing baby spider monkey called Rain into accepting breakfast – a syringe filled with liquefied fruit and medicine.</p><p>Rain is fed every four hours and requires regular physical contact with Pariguana-Garriazo, her primary carer. Over the next few months, she will be gradually introduced to solid food and to other spider monkeys and her contact with humans will dwindle. From there, it’s a long process of rehabilitation before her release back into the wild. Juveniles can expect to stay at Taricaya for at least three years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/29/peru-amazon-illegal-mining-deforestation-monkey-sanctuaries-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This funny, friendly series about a machine that reveals people’s true life potential will charm you into deep thinking. It’s like Ted Lasso, with the softest of fantasy twists</p><p>What if a tiger came to tea? What if you won a ticket to a magical chocolate factory? What if an owl was afraid of the dark? What if a machine suddenly appeared in the grocery store of a small unassuming town overnight that was able, for $2 and your social security number and fingerprints, to tell you your true life potential?</p><p>As irresistible premises go, that of The Big Door Prize is a great one. Adapted from MO Walsh’s 2020 novel, the 10-part series uses the (largely unexplained) existence of the machine to explore that ever-fascinating question of whether there is such a thing as too much knowledge, and how much truth humanity can bear. Is the machine a liberation or an electronic Pandora’s box?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/29/the-big-door-prize-review-chris-odowds-comic-timing-is-immaculate-in-this-beautifully-light-sci-fi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Artificial lawns are more popular than ever – but they are also an environmental nightmare. Will the campaign to stop them be successful?</p><p>My lawn is a disaster. To be honest, it’s not really a lawn at all. Any green is mostly moss, the rest is mud. More no man’s land than bowling green. The reasons for this are: small London garden (I know I am lucky to have one); not a lot of sun (stolen by the neighbour’s overhanging apple tree); two footballing boys (even though, now banned for life, they have to go to the park). And possibly also inexpertise on the part of the groundsman, though he has tried – I’ve turfed, and seeded, aerated, watered, fed, scarified, sung to it. I’m about ready to give up.</p><p>There is an obvious solution: artificial grass. Beautifully, uniformly verdant all year round, low maintenance, no mowing required, no mower required, no watering, no mud. I might even let the boys back on to it. Or not.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/29/it-would-survive-nuclear-armageddon-the-rise-and-fall-of-plastic-lawns">Continue reading...</a>
