I finished my PhD in law<strong> </strong>in 2016 and was ready to begin a life of service in education and research, working in the subject I cared passionately about. But several things quickly became clear. There was the increasing <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/10899/Precarious-work-in-higher-education-May-20/pdf/ucu_he-precarity-report_may20.pdf\">precarity of university labour</a>: one-third of academics are on fixed-term contracts, 41% are on hourly paid contracts and there are still 29 institutions employing at least five academic staff on zero-hours contract.

It was, he admits, both \u201ca bruising start to the day\u201d and a tricky question to answer. \u201cMaintaining a healthy weight\u201d, for the co-founder of Leon restaurants turned food campaigner, \u201chas always been a struggle\u201d. And Dimbleby isn\u2019t the only one. In fact, he says, 28% of us are clinically obese, which is startling when you compare that with just 1% of the population in 1950, an age when the planet too was in far better nick. It isn\u2019t that we\u2019re greedy, but we are not entirely blameless either. In Dimbleby\u2019s words, it would be wrong to say that we \u201care powerless in the jaws of the machine\u201d, but, as he shows, the machine is a formidable creation of supermarkets, food giants and fast-food chains. Ravenous, which is co-written by Dimbleby\u2019s wife, the journalist Jemima Lewis, is a highly readable account of what needs to happen in order for us to both save the planet and fit into those old jeans again.</p><p>Part of the problem is that the enemy is invisible. Most of us don\u2019t even realise our eating habits are largely informed by a dystopian system we can\u2019t see \u2013 one that produces, processes, markets and sells the food we eat. On a train heading for London, Dimbleby buys a \u201chandmade\u201d egg sandwich and turns it over to see that it contains 32 ingredients, including things most of us will have never heard of. When did you last put \u201cdiacetyl tartaric acid\u201d in your shopping basket? Even natural-sounding ingredients, such as rapeseed oil, are often highly processed. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.c3health.org/blog/is-ultra-processed-food-why-are-we-eating-so-much/\" title=\"\">highly processed foods make up 57% of our diet</a>, a higher proportion than any other European country. The consequences are stark. Studies have shown, Dimbleby writes, that a \u201c10% increase in the proportion of ultra-processed foods in a person\u2019s diet is correlated with a 12% increase in cancers, a 21% increase in depressive symptoms, and a 12% increase in cardiovascular disease risk\u201d. In a sense, it\u2019s simple \u2013 these foods contain more of the things that cause us harm, such as sugars and fats. But it\u2019s these very things, combined in a complicated way, that create \u201cmoreishness\u201d \u2013 those crisps in your cupboard are designed so that you just can\u2019t stop.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/15/ravenous-by-henry-dimbleby-review-rage-against-the-food-machine\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/15/ravenous-by-henry-dimbleby-review-rage-against-the-food-machine", "date_published": "2023-03-15 11:00:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Spin | Why Temba Bavuma\u2019s second century matters, for himself and South Africa", "description": "<p>Bavuma had become a walking metaphor for his country\u2019s failures before change in coach and promotion to captain </p><p>He got there with a lofted cover drive.

female friendship, fame and identity, this coming-of-age tale follows two young women in 1960s New York</p><p>Seventeen-year-old Mae is an excellent listener. In almost every other respect, the narrator of Nicole Flattery\u2019s debut novel is a mess: she\u2019s dropped out of school; she\u2019s ignoring her mother; her nascent encounters with the adult world are bleak enough to give Holden Caulfield a run for his money. Chaos swirls around her, but she manages, somehow, to hold herself still at the centre of it: saying little, giving nothing away, but paying close attention. And it\u2019s this capacity to listen \u2013 to receive rather than to transmit; to locate herself in the audience, rather than to launch herself on to the stage \u2013 that allows her to step into a role as a vital but invisible cog in what would become a world-famous machine.</p><p>Nothing Special is set in the grubby avant garde of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol</a>\u2019s Factory studio, which, in 1966, when the story kicks off, was establishing itself as an artistic and cultural force to be reckoned with. On the face of it, Flattery\u2019s choice of time and place is unexpected: she\u2019s strongly associated with the new wave of Irish literature, while Warhol and his Factory are as American, in their way, as apple pie. But those who\u2019ve read her acclaimed 2019 collection, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/19/show-them-good-time-nicole-flattery-review\" title=\"\">Show Them a Good Time</a>, will realise at once that while the physical landscape of Nothing Special \u2013 the diners and department stores and \u201cpeople disappearing into subway stations\u201d \u2013 is quintessentially New York, the emotional terrain is all Flattery\u2019s own. Mae and her new friend, fellow Factory worker Shelley, are cut from precisely the same cloth as the jaded, affectless women who populated Flattery\u2019s short stories: they\u2019re perceptive about the limits placed on female experience, but too disillusioned to do anything other than accommodate them; they yearn for significance but can find no way of attaining it. Mae and Shelley are charged with answering the Factory\u2019s famous silver telephone, but the callers never ask for them.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/15/nothing-special-by-nicole-flattery-review-inside-warhols-factory\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/15/nothing-special-by-nicole-flattery-review-inside-warhols-factory", "date_published": "2023-03-15 09:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "US allergy season starting earlier due to global temperature rising, scientists say", "description": "<p>Trend sees higher pollen levels and worsened allergy and asthma symptoms, though reduction in carbon emissions could reverse it</p><p>As the global temperature has increased in recent years due to climate change, allergy season in the US is starting earlier and the amount of pollen during such periods has increased, leading to worse allergy and asthma symptoms for some \u2013 and new symptoms altogether for others, according to scientists.</p><p>That trend is projected to increase as average temperatures continue to rise, but could be reversed if humans are able to reduce carbon emissions, allergists say.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/15/allergy-season-starting-earlier-global-heating-climate-change\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/15/allergy-season-starting-earlier-global-heating-climate-change", "date_published": "2023-03-15 09:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "What Jeremy Hunt\u2019s U-turn on energy bills support means for you", "description": "<p>From how much households could be paying to what prompted the rethink</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/15/jeremy-hunt-makes-u-turn-on-planned-cut-to-energy-bills-support\">Hunt makes U-turn on planned cut to energy bills support</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/mar/15/government-extends-energy-bill-suppport-three-months-budget-for-growth-silicon-valley-bank-markets-business-live\">Business live updates: energy bills support extended</a></li></ul><p>Jeremy Hunt has confirmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/mar/03/uk-suppliers-expect-government-u-turn-on-planned-cut-to-energy-bill-support\">a widely trailed U-turn</a> on his plan announced last autumn to make the government\u2019s energy support for households less generous.
