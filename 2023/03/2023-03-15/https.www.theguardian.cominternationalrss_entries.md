<p>In a sombre video statement, Israel’s president Isaac Herzog warned that those who believe Israel is far from a civil war have 'no clue'. His speech follows weeks of intense protests across Israel against a controversial legal package proposed by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government which would give greater power to the legislature over the judiciary. Critics fear the changes will endanger the country's democracy. 'A civil war is a red line. I won't let that happen, at any cost and in every way,' said Herzog, adding that the country had a 'historic' opportunity to reach a constitutional settlement which is 'balanced and smart'.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/15/israeli-president-civil-war-is-within-touching-distance">Israeli president: civil war is ‘within touching distance’</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2023/mar/15/israels-president-warns-of-civil-war-amid-disputes-over-controversial-judicial-reforms-video">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on BBC independence: compromised at the top | Editorial

<p>Evidence of capitulation to political pressure shows how vulnerable the national broadcaster has become</p><p>Governments and oppositions have always complained that the BBC is too generous to the other side. In the past, that charge has not been sustainable for long enough to think the corporation is systemically failing at impartiality. Its news output is generally fair and balanced, especially when compared with the frothy partisanship in many newspapers. It is not an organ of state propaganda. That independence is maintained by regulation and internal rules, but neither of those mechanisms is sufficient without a wider political culture that values the BBC on its own terms and does not seek to undermine it.</p><p>The current Conservative government is unreliable on that score. Evidence of capitulation to political pressure, reported this week by the Guardian, demonstrates the hazard. Senior editors discouraged the corporation’s news outlets from using the word “lockdown” to describe social restrictions at the start of the pandemic, at Downing Street’s behest. Alternative terms were used instead on the BBC website. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/14/bbc-editors-asked-journalists-to-avoid-using-lockdown-at-start-of-pandemic" title="">Leaked messages</a> show editors passing on one government request that the newsrooms “turn up the scepticism” about Labour’s pandemic response. Others urged generous interpretation of comments by Boris Johnson comparing Ukraine’s resistance to Russian invasion to Brexit, and congratulated staff for avoiding a story about Mr Johnson’s alleged affair with Jennifer Arcuri.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/15/the-guardian-view-on-bbc-independence-compromised-at-the-top">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Echoing his tactics in 2016, Trump will accuse Florida governor of going easy on child abuse images cases while a federal prosecutor</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed">Sign up to receive First Thing – our daily briefing by email</a></strong></li></ul><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. He did it in 2016, and now he’s preparing to do it again next year, if not sooner. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has plans to crush the campaigns of every other Republican that runs for president in 2024, particularly <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, the Florida governor viewed as the second-most popular man in the GOP after the former president. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/15/trump-opposition-file-desantis-00087081?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=12069c7e-e346-405c-ad2c-71cb1a62e514&amp;nlid=630318">According to Politico</a>, Trump has a big pile of opposition research to deploy against him, and among its most potent allegations will be accusations that during his time as a federal prosecutor, DeSantis went easy in child pornography cases.
