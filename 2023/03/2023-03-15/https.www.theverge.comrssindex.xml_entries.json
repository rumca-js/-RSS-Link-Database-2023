Called Genpop Interactive, the studio\u2019s ambitious goal is to \u201cdrive forward the next-gen of music, fashion, and gaming culture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Inweny\">To start, the studio \u2014 which currently has a headcount of more than 25 developers \u2014 will be making a \u201cthird person shooter with novel movement and combat mechanics.\u201d The studio\u2019s first round of investors includes Ed Fries, co-creator of the original Xbox, and Japanese entertainment firm Good Smile Company. There aren\u2019t really any other details, but in a statement, BloodPop said that the goal is to move beyond gaming and tap into broader pop culture:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"kF7WkL\">A...</p></blockquote>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23637598/bloodpop-game-studio-genpop-interactive\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23637598/bloodpop-game-studio-genpop-interactive", "date_published": "2023-03-15 11:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "title": "Samsung\u2019s midrange A-series phones get a Galaxy S23 facelift", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"The Galaxy A34 in lime (left) and A54 in purple (right).\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FdYlehGL6tniCtzErImuUN8j1Y0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72076022/236567_Galaxy_A54_and_A34_JPorter_0002.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption><em>The Samsung Galaxy A34 (left) and A54 (right).</em> | Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"pR3tii\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy A34 and A54 are the latest additions to its popular midrange A-series. Although both phones offer a number of upgrades over last year\u2019s models, the most striking thing for me is how much they both look like this year\u2019s Galaxy S23 and S23 Plus. </p>\n<p id=\"UfOAxV\">The camera bumps of the A33 and A53 are gone, leaving three simple camera lenses per phone in their wake. It makes both look more premium to me, and Samsung is promising flagship-level support periods of up to four generations of major Android updates and five years of security patches.</p>\n<p id=\"p37HzC\">The Galaxy A54 will go on sale on April 6th in the US starting at $449.99 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage.
