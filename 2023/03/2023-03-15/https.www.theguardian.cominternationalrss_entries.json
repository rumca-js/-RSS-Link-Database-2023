His speech follows weeks of intense protests across Israel against a controversial legal package proposed by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government which would give greater power to the legislature over the judiciary. Critics fear the changes will endanger the country's democracy. 'A civil war is a red line. I won't let that happen, at any cost and in every way,' said Herzog, adding that the country had a 'historic' opportunity to reach a constitutional settlement which is 'balanced and smart'.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/15/israeli-president-civil-war-is-within-touching-distance\">Israeli president: civil war is \u2018within touching distance\u2019</a></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2023/mar/15/israels-president-warns-of-civil-war-amid-disputes-over-controversial-judicial-reforms-video\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2023/mar/15/israels-president-warns-of-civil-war-amid-disputes-over-controversial-judicial-reforms-video", "date_published": "2023-03-15 22:39:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018Redefining Australian baseball\u2019: World Baseball Classic run ends with defeat to Cuba", "description": "<ul><li>Dave Nilsson\u2019s team bow out after 4-3 quarter-final defeat in Tokyo</li><li>Australia threaten to get back on terms late but Cuba hold firm</li></ul><p>Australia\u2019s baseball adventure in Japan is over \u2013 but, to the very end, the national team players proved they can slug it out with the best in the world.</p><p>That was the message from manager Dave Nilsson after his team of battlers finally ran out of surprises at the Tokyo Dome on Wednesday night, succumbing 4-3 to one of the sport\u2019s powerhouse nations Cuba in the quarter-finals of the World Baseball Classic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/16/redefining-australian-baseball-world-baseball-classic-run-ends-with-defeat-to-cuba\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/16/redefining-australian-baseball-world-baseball-classic-run-ends-with-defeat-to-cuba", "date_published": "2023-03-15 22:29:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Eric Garcetti confirmed as India ambassador after contentious 20-month fight", "description": "<p>Former Los Angeles mayor takes high-profile diplomatic post after weathering doubts about his truthfulness in a sexual harassment scandal</p><p>Eric Garcetti, the former mayor of Los Angeles, was confirmed on Wednesday as the nation\u2019s next ambassador to India, 20 months after he was first nominated by Joe Biden and after weathering doubts about his truthfulness in a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-india-los-angeles-chuck-grassley-dfefd15c6e8a199fb9246df8a6ef5d0a\">sexual harassment scandal</a> involving a top adviser during his time at City Hall.</p><p>The 52-42 vote in a divided Senate gave the administration a long-sought victory in filling one of the country\u2019s highest profile diplomatic posts.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/15/eric-garcetti-confirmed-india-ambassador-contentious-20-month-fight\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/15/eric-garcetti-confirmed-india-ambassador-contentious-20-month-fight", "date_published": "2023-03-15 20:06:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "The Guardian view on BBC independence: compromised at the top | Editorial", "description": "<p>Evidence of capitulation to political pressure shows how vulnerable the national broadcaster has become</p><p>Governments and oppositions have always complained that the BBC is too generous to the other side.
