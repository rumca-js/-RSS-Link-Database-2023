## Shazam! Fury of the Gods Review

Shazam! Fury of the Gods reviewed by Tom Jorgensen.

This sequel is a breezy, often funny second outing for Billy Batson and his family of young heroes. Each of the villainous Atlassian Daughters brings something unique to the screen (to the plot’s mixed benefit) and Helen Mirren’s performance stands out, but it’s disappointing that the distinctive heart of the first film takes a back seat to that expanded scope. The lack of focus on its lead character works against Fury of the Gods throughout, but it’s a testament to the strong foundation this movie’s built on that the assembled ensemble is able to share some of that burden.

Destiny 2: Lightfall reviewed by Travis Northup on Xbox Series X/S & PC, also available on PlayStation.

Lightfall is a disappointing expansion with a campaign that falls flat on its face, an underwhelming new destination, and only a few new standout activities to take on. But Strand and the new Tormentor enemy are great additions to the sandbox, and some of the endgame activities, including the raid, are a blast. No doubt Lightfall’s shortcomings are made more painful by immediately following The Witch Queen and its strong post-launch updates.

## Shazam Doesn’t Need Black Adam, But Black Adam Needed Shazam

Shazam is back! (Or should we say “Shazam! is back?”) Zachary Levi returns in the DC Comics film sequel along with Asher Angel in Shazam: Fury of the Gods.” The trailer for Shazam 2  shows that Shazam: Fury of the Gods might bring more of that fun energy from the first Shazam movie. 

DC and Warner Bros might have a problem on their hands though following “Fury of the Gods.” Shazam has an arch foe, you may remember him from another recent Warner Brothers release, and long story short: Shazam vs Black Adam may never happen in a movie about Shazam. Dwayne Johnson pushed to separate the two characters, and there aren’t any Shazam 2 spoilers here, but his character will not be making a Shazam 2 cameo…or any Black Adam appearances in general. Black Adam (2022) will not be continued, and with that shuts down any possibility of Black Adam (Dwayne Johnson) anytime soon. 

Black Adam (DCEU) may have needed Shazam, as much as Dwayne Johnson might have thought otherwise, to hit stronger, with the Black Adam DC film suffering from various issues we’ll lay out. But the Shazam movies don’t actually need what the Black Adam film provided with The Rock, as much fun as a Black Adam Superman fight may have been. Alas, Black Adam vs Superman will probably never happen, at least with The Rock Black Adam version. But don’t worry about Shazam, he doesn’t need the Dwayne Johnson Black Adam to make his movies work.
