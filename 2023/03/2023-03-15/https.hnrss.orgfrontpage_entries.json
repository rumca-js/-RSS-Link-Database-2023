href=\"https://getpropify.com\">https://getpropify.com</a>), an API aggregator for residential property management. We abstract over archaic APIs and merge them into a single modern API for the real estate industry, giving companies access to multiple property management systems (PMSs) via a REST API.  Think merge.dev or Plaid for real estate.<p>Property managers nowadays use software to operate residential rental properties. Our customers are not these property managers directly, but companies who provide services to both property managers and renters. Our customers are solving problems around resident screening, security, parking, maintenance, etc., which property managers typically outsource.<p>Compared to most other industries in 2023, property management still runs on old tech with bad/wrong/absent API documentation. Creating and maintaining integrations with these systems is incredibly painful (1999 called and wants to tell you about its cool new SOAP technology!)<p>As an example of what we\u2019re solving for, one prospective customer told us they regularly get 503 (service unavailable) errors from one of these PMSs at the beginning of each month because the system can\u2019t process rent payments and other requests at the same time. We address challenges like this using an exponential backoff retry strategy.<p>We abstract over all these APIs to give our customers software they can reasonably use. Our goal is to eliminate old tech, poor docs, and unreliable infra for our customers so they can focus on delivering value instead of fighting with integrations.<p>We offer a tested RESTful API with accurate documentation and modern architecture that we can scale. In addition, we want to make the developer experience as good as possible with things like webhooks, SDKs, websockets, and even a GraphQL API (coming later this year).<p>Before Propify, we built a rent payment app to bridge the technology gap between renters and landlords. Then we encountered the pain of PMS integrations and decided to pivot and solve that problem instead.<p>dang suggested that we include a product demo or video but since our core product is an API, there\u2019s not that much to show\u2014sorry! But our docs are here: <a href=\"https://docs.getpropify.com/\">https://docs.getpropify.com/</a>, and if you\u2019re working/interested in this space and have your own credentials for one of our supported integrations, we\u2019ll be happy to get you a sandbox account and a demo.<p>This industry has been stagnant because of the barrier to entry for integrating with these vital PM systems. Our goal is to unlock innovation by pulling real estate tech into the modern world. Ultimately, developer experience is incredibly important to us, and we are always looking for areas where we can improve. We welcome your feedback, questions, and comments!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170955\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170955</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170955", "date_published": "2023-03-15 16:40:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Epic Games to Pay $245M for Tricking Users into Making Unwanted Charges", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-finalizes-order-requiring-fortnite-maker-epic-games-pay-245-million-tricking-users-making\">https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-finalizes-order-requiring-fortnite-maker-epic-games-pay-245-million-tricking-users-making</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170944\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170944</a></p>\n<p>Points: 35</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "link": "https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-finalizes-order-requiring-fortnite-maker-epic-games-pay-245-million-tricking-users-making", "date_published": "2023-03-15 16:39:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "DreamWorks releases OpenMoonRay source code", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/dreamworksanimation/openmoonray\">https://github.com/dreamworksanimation/openmoonray</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170928\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170928</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://github.com/dreamworksanimation/openmoonray", "date_published": "2023-03-15 16:38:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "The American Diet Has a Sandwich Problem", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sandwich-american-diet-unhealthy-489a1d59\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/sandwich-american-diet-unhealthy-489a1d59</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170897\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170897</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 44</p>", "link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sandwich-american-diet-unhealthy-489a1d59", "date_published": "2023-03-15 16:37:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Mr. Graph \u2013 A graph definition and execution library for Python", "description": "<p>What:<p>Mr. Graph is a python library designed to make composing graphs of sync and async functions easy! Use google style docstrings to automagically create dataclasses and chain together function calls into graphs.<p>Why:<p>I like the design of Dagster, but not the latency. For apps and systems engineering, sometimes I want to compose a graph out of regular python functions. I don;t need all the heavy machinery that comes with a full workflow engine.<p>Current features:<p>- Use with either async or sync functions<p>- Uses google style doc strings to name return values.<p>- Creates dataclasses for each function's output.<p>- Can infer pipelines from input and output signatures<p>- All directed acyclic graph layouts supported. linear, fan-in, fan- out.<p>Future Features:<p>- Better examples for use with async calls (like LLMs)<p>- Splitting dataclasses, better error handling, logging improvements.<p>This is under active development.

We just launched the ability for companies to import data from their customer\u2019s data warehouse or database, and we wanted to share a little bit more about it with the community.<p>If you just want to see how it works, here\u2019s a demo of the product that Conor recorded: https://www.loom.com/share/4724fb62583e41a9ba1a636fc8ea92f1.<p>Quick background on us: we help companies integrate with their customer\u2019s data warehouse or database. We\u2019ve been busy helping companies export data to their customers \u2013 we\u2019re currently syncing over 40bn rows per month on behalf of companies. But folks kept on asking us if we could help them import data from their customers too. They wanted the ability to offer a 1st-party reverse ETL to their customers, similar to the 1st-party ETL capability we already helped them offer. So we built that product, and here we are.<p>Why would people want to import data? There are actually plenty of use-cases here. Imagine a usage-based billing company that needs to get a daily pull from its customers of all the billing events that happened, so that they can generate relevant invoices. Or a fraud detection company who needs to get the latest transaction data from its customers so it can appropriately mark fraudulent ones.<p>There\u2019s no great way to import customer data currently. Typically, people solve this one of two ways today. One is they import data via CSV. This works well enough, but it requires ongoing work on the part of the customer: they need to put a CSV together, and upload it to the right place on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. This is painful and time-consuming, especially for data that needs to be continuously imported. Another one is companies make the customer write custom code to feed data to their API. This requires the customer to do a bunch of solutions engineering work just to get started using the product \u2013 which is a suboptimal onboarding experience.<p>So instead, we let the customer connect their database or data warehouse and we pull data directly from there, on an ongoing basis. They select which tables to import (and potentially map some columns to required fields), and that\u2019s it. The setup only takes 5 minutes, and requires no ongoing work. We feel like that\u2019s the kind of experience every company should provide when onboarding a new customer.<p>Importing all this data continuously is non-trivial, but thankfully we can actually reuse 95% of the infrastructure we built for data exports. It turns out our core transfer logic remains pretty much exactly the same, and all we had to do was ship new CRUD endpoints in our API layer to let users configure their source/destination. As a brief reminder about our stack, we run a GoLang backend and Typescript/React frontend on k8s.<p>In terms of technical design, the most challenging decisions we have to make are around making database\u2019s type-systems play nicely with each other (kind of an evergreen problem really). For imports, we allow the data recipient to specify whether they want to receive this data as JSON blob, or as a nicely typed table. If they choose the latter, they specify exactly which columns they\u2019re expecting, as well as what type guarantees those should uphold. We\u2019re also working on the ability to feed that data directly into an API endpoint, and adding post-ingestion validation logic.<p>We\u2019ve mentioned this before but it bears worth repeating. We know that security and privacy are paramount here. We're SOC 2 Type II certified, and we go through annual white-box pentests to make sure that all our code is up to snuff. We never store any of the data anywhere on our servers. Finally, we offer on-prem deployments, so data never even has to touch our servers if our customers don't want it to.<p>We\u2019re really stoked to be sharing this with the community. We\u2019ll be hanging out here for most of the day, but you can also reach us at hn (at) prequel.co if you have any questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170410\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170410</a></p>\n<p>Points: 19</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35170410", "date_published": "2023-03-15 16:04:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Linux desktop leaders unite behind Flathub app store.

We\u2019re Caleb and Josh, the founders of BuildFlow (<a href=\"https://www.buildflow.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.buildflow.dev</a>). We provide an open source framework for building your entire data pipeline quickly using Python. You can think of us as an easy alternative to Apache Beam or Google Cloud Dataflow.<p>The problem we're trying to solve is simple: building data pipelines can be a real pain. You often need to deal with complex frameworks, manage external cloud resources, and wire everything together into a single deployment (you\u2019re probably drowning in Yaml by this point in the dev cycle). This can be a burden on both data scientists and engineering teams.<p>Data pipelines is a broad term, but we generally mean any kind of processing that happens outside of the user facing path. This can be things like: processing file uploads, syncing data to a data warehouse, or ingesting data from IoT devices.<p>BuildFlow, our open-source framework, lets you build a data pipeline by simply attaching a decorator to a Python function. All you need to do is describe where your input is coming from and where your output should be written, and BuildFlow handles the rest. No configuration outside of the code is required. See our docs for some examples: <a href=\"https://www.buildflow.dev/docs/intro\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.buildflow.dev/docs/intro</a>.<p>When you attach the decorator to your function, the BuildFlow runtime creates your referenced cloud resources, spins up replicas of your processor, and wires up everything needed to efficiently scale out the reads from your source and then writes to your sink. This lets you focus on writing logic as opposed to interacting with your external dependencies.<p>BuildFlow aims to hide as much complexity as possible in the sources / sinks so that your processing logic can remain simple. The framework provides generic I/O connectors for popular cloud services and storage systems, in addition to \"use case driven\u201d I/O connectors that chain together multiple I/O steps required by common use cases. An example \u201cuse case driven\u201d source that chains together GCS pubsub notifications & fetching GCS blobs can be seen here: <a href=\"https://www.buildflow.dev/docs/io-connectors/gcs_notifications\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.buildflow.dev/docs/io-connectors/gcs_notificatio...</a><p>BuildFlow was inspired by our time at Verily (Google Life Sciences) where we designed an internal platform to help data scientists build and deploy ML infra / data pipelines using Apache Beam. Using a complex framework was a burden on our data science team because they had to learn a whole new paradigm to write their Python code in, and our engineering team was left with the operational load of helping folks learn Apache Beam while also managing / deploying production pipelines. From this pain, BuildFlow was born.<p>Our design is based around two observations we made from that experience:<p>(1) The hardest thing to get right is I/O. Efficiently fanning out I/O to workers, concurrently reading / processing input data, catching schema mismatches before runtime, and configuring cloud resources is where most of the pain is. BuildFlow attempts to abstract away all of these bits.<p>(2) Most use cases are large scale but not (overly) complex. Existing frameworks give you scalability and a complicated programming model that supports every use case under the sun. BuildFlow provides the same scalability but focuses on common use cases so that the API can remain lightweight & easy to use.<p>BuildFlow is open source, but we offer a managed cloud offering that allows you to easily deploy your pipelines to the cloud. We provide a CLI that deploys your pipeline to a managed kubernetes cluster, and you can optionally opt in to letting us manage your resources / terraform as well. Ultimately this will feed into our VS Code Extension which will allow users to visually build their data pipelines directly from VS Code (see <a href=\"https://launchflow.com\">https://launchflow.com</a> for a preview). The extension will be free to use and will come packaged with a bunch of nice-to-haves (code generation, fuzzing, tracing, and arcade games (yep!) just to name a few in the works).<p>Our managed offering is still in private beta but we\u2019re hoping to release our CLI in the next couple weeks. Pricing for this service is still being ironed out but we expect it to be based on usage.<p>We\u2019d love for you to try BuildFlow and would love any feedback. You can get started right away by installing the python package: pip install buildflow. Check out our docs (<a href=\"https://buildflow.dev/docs/intro\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://buildflow.dev/docs/intro</a>) and GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow\">https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow</a>) to see examples on how to use the API.<p>This project is very new, so we\u2019d love to gather some specific feedback from you, the community. How do you feel about a framework managing your cloud resources? We\u2019re considering adding a module that would let BuildFlow create / manage your terraform for you (terraform state would be dumped to disk). What are some common I/O operations you find yourself rewriting? What are some operational tasks that require you to leave your code editor? We\u2019d like to bring as many tasks into BuildFlow and our VSCode extension so you can avoid context switches.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35169256\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35169256</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35169256", "date_published": "2023-03-15 14:55:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Responsible AI Challenge", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launches-responsible-ai-challenge/\">https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launches-responsible-ai-challenge/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35169072\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35169072</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "link": "https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launches-responsible-ai-challenge/", "date_published": "2023-03-15 14:45:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "How Silicon Valley Bank Avoided Oversight", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-silicon-valley-bank-avoided-oversight-fdic-systemic-risk-midsize-greg-becker-dodd-frank-reporting-lobbying-5b3ff837\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-silicon-valley-bank-avoided-oversight-fdic-systemic-risk-midsize-greg-becker-dodd-frank-reporting-lobbying-5b3ff837</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35168808\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35168808</a></p>\n<p>Points: 28</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-silicon-valley-bank-avoided-oversight-fdic-systemic-risk-midsize-greg-becker-dodd-frank-reporting-lobbying-5b3ff837", "date_published": "2023-03-15 14:28:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Why Apple and the Carriers Want Your Old iPhone", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apple-and-the-carriers-want-your-old-iphone-4279cc8d\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apple-and-the-carriers-want-your-old-iphone-4279cc8d</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35168717\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35168717</a></p>\n<p>Points: 24</p>\n<p># Comments: 15</p>", "link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apple-and-the-carriers-want-your-old-iphone-4279cc8d", "date_published": "2023-03-15 14:21:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Modern Font Stacks", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://modernfontstacks.com/\">https://modernfontstacks.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35168652\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35168652</a></p>\n<p>Points: 71</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>", "link": "https://modernfontstacks.com/", "date_published": "2023-03-15 14:16:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Ask HN: What books helped you in your entrepreneurship journey?", "description": "<p>Leaving aside the fact that nothing can beat actual experience.

At MixRank, we get to work with distributed systems, databases, data science, and big data. No meetings, no bureaucracy, no office, no time tracking\u2014 just challenging technical problems you can put your full focus into.<p>MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Security.<p>Team is 32 full-time, full-remote from 15+ countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.<p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it\u2019s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.<p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.<p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets\u2014 at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.<p>--<p>Junior Software Engineer<p>We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects.
