<p>Clean Energy Charging is <em>not </em>a conspiracy to reduce the speed or efficiency of charging when you plug in your iPhone. It is a harbinger of how most future electronics will consume power.</p><h2><strong>What is Clean Energy Charging?</strong></h2>
<p>Announced with iOS 16 and introduced in the US last fall, Clean Energy Charging selectively charges your device when lower carbon-emission electricity is available. In some regions, this might be during the daytime when solar and renewable energy production peak, but in most cases, it will be at night.</p><p>To support the feature, your iPhone gets a forecast of carbon emissions on your local energy grid. It then charges the device when the cleanest energy is available.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3690908/apples-clean-energy-charging-is-the-future-of-electronics.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>The US government, worried about the continuing growth of cybercrime, ransomware, and countries including Russia, Iran, and North Korea hacking into government and private networks, is in the middle of drastically changing its cybersecurity strategy. No longer will it rely largely on prodding businesses and tech companies to voluntarily take basic security measures such as patching vulnerable systems to keep them updated.</p><p>Instead, it now wants to establish baseline security requirements for businesses and tech companies and to fine those that don’t comply.</p><p>It’s not just companies that use the systems who might eventually need to abide by the regulations. Companies that make and sell them, such as Microsoft, Apple, and others could be held accountable as well. Early indications are that the feds already have Microsoft in their crosshairs — they’ve warned the company that, at the moment, it doesn’t appear to be up to the task.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3690592/feds-to-microsoft-clean-up-your-security-act-or-else.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
