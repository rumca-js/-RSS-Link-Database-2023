The timing of this video is alarmingly close to one of Marsh's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jeffrey-marsh-children-tiktoker" target="_blank">most vocal critics</a> - a Muslim woman who dared criticize some of Marsh's more questionable internet behaviors, such as targeting children and advertising a private Patreon - being<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shumirun-nessa-jeffrey-marsh-dox" target="_blank"> doxed and having threats</a> made against her children. So, this "thank you" seems a <em>tad</em> insensitive...</p><p>Marsh began the video by smiling into the camera, saying, <em>"Thank you. Thank you for being a trans ally. Thank you for your big heart, t</em><em>hank you for your love, thank you for your support."  </em><span></span></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p><em>"You might have noticed it's, uhh, things are a little hairy on the LGBTQ front with hate and hateful people, and thank you."</em></p><p>I must point out that it doesn't seem Marsh is referring to the people who threatened an innocent woman's children for speaking out against a certain narrative when they say, "hateful people". Carry on. </p><p><em>"You are such a beautiful - we need you right now. Just plain as that." </em></p><p>Marsh went on to explain how another "creator" friend of theirs said it's very hard to be "different" these days. Marsh said, <em>"Thank you for knowing what it feels like to be different. And for seeing people like us. From my big, wide, emotional heart thank you. Thank you for being a good person, for seeing people who might be different than you, and for loving people, and seeing their humanity, and being a support." </em></p><p>I don't really think this issue has anything to do with being "different" or not seeing the humanity of people. I'm fairly certain it has to do with people who target children on the internet and dox and threaten anyone who suggests such behavior may be a tad weird. That's not "different," it's...wrong. Plain and simple. </p><p><p>

## 'They Have Awakened A Sleeping Giant': James O'Keefe Is Back With A Brand New Company And It Looks Epic

In case you forgot, O'Keefe was ousted from his own company, Project Veritas, and the circumstances were more than a little shady. From a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-donor-project-veritas" target="_blank">donor denying the claims</a> made by the board to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-project-veritas" target="_blank">texts about potential raises</a> after O'Keefe's ouster, this whole debacle reeked. </p><p>But O'Keefe isn't one to go down without a fight. That's kinda his whole thing. Today, he released a video announcing his new venture, <a href="https://www.okeefemediagroup.com/" target="_blank">O'Keefe Media Group</a>. In true James O'Keefe fashion, the video featured strobe lights, a dramatic voiceover, and choreography. He is so back. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p><em>"The irony of the ACORN story is that it took a 25-year-old with a hidden camera a few days to do what billion-dollar networks and journalists could not do in a decade." </em></p><p><em>"I spent 14 years creating the most effective, nonprofit newsroom this country has ever seen [...] I have been defamed, arrested, raided, and ultimately removed from the organization I spent so much time developing the credibility of." </em></p><p>This next part is where it gets <em>really </em>interesting. The timing of O'Keefe's removal was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-board-directors" target="_blank">suspiciously close </a>to one of his biggest exposés ever, that of a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/big-pharma-director-bananas" target="_blank">certain extremely powerful pharmaceutical company</a>. He seemed to suggest that this timing was no coincidence: <em>"I always knew they would try to ruin the reputations of those who expose them - the pharma giants, the three-letter government agencies, and those who I thought I could trust."  </em>Hmm...</p><p>So it seems O'Keefe left Project Veritas with more than a few valued employees. And he noted that he is going to "build an army of investigators, and exposers" alongside a "small tight-knit group of the most elite journalists in the world". It's great to see him rebound from the ouster so quickly, and I am all for citizen journalism instead of mega-corporation talking heads. The conservative movement desperately needs that - perhaps now more than ever. </p>

## LOL: TikToker Claims DeSantis Would Be Triggered By Toy Store, Accidentally Exposes CRT In Children's Books

They've moved on from claiming he's a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-history-class" target="_blank">racist</a> who wants to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/desantis-woke-busters" target="_blank">raise the next generation of Hitler youth</a> to...American Girl dolls. </p><p>Let me explain - though it probably still won't make much sense. This TikTok person decided to go to an American Girl Doll store and point out all the things that would, apparently,<em> "send Ron DeSantis into a coma instantly"</em>. Because I'm sure Ron DeSantis invests a lot of time and energy into policing the American Girl Doll store's selection of products. </p><p><em>"The first [thing] is guaranteed healthcare for all, including those with different abilities,"</em> the TikToker said as she filmed a doll in a wheelchair. I had no idea Ron DeSantis had such vitriol for wheelchairs. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>"<em>Next is cultural, racial, and ethnic diversity as part of being an American [...] non white-washed American history." </em> The chick then showed off some books about two of the American Girl Dolls - Addy, a black girl who endures slavery, and Kaya, a Native American girl. (I actually had Kaya myself when I was little, though my dog chewed off one of her feet, rendering her permanently "differently abled," as this TikToker would say.) </p><p>It's important to note that in his 2022 election, Ron DeSantis flipped Miami-Dade county red and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/florida-governor-results?icid=election_statenav" target="_blank">won</a> 58% of the Latino vote across the state. Which doesn't exactly scream "racist bigot" to me, but what do I know. I'm no expert. Or in this case, TikToker in an American Girl Doll store. <span></span></p><p>The Tiktoker did, however, come across one book that DeSantis probably would ban in Florida schools - and for good reason. The book is titled "Race and Inclusion" and includes sections on white supremacy and "micro-aggressions". The portion on white supremacy reads, <em>"Now, White supremacy also means there's a system in place [where] White people control society, make the rules for others, and [...] White people benefit the most from that power."  </em>The portion on Micro-aggressions has a "white privilege checklist" for children to check their own white privilege.</p><p>So yes, it's possible DeSantis <em>would</em> ban that book in the interest of preventing white five-year-olds from hating themselves because of the color of their skin. One point for the TikToker. And thanks to this video, parents now know what to look out for at this store. So it's a win-win, really. </p>

## "Since Friday my intention was...": Aaron Rodgers makes long-awaited announcement about his football playing future

As were fans in both the respective divisions. Rodgers broke his silence (after whatever a darkness retreat is) and announced on the Pat McAfee Show that he wants to play for the New York Jets.</p><p>He WANTS to play. The two teams aren't there yet. Money and whatnot.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">"Since Friday my intention was to play for the New York Jets.. it's the compensation that's holding things up" ~ <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronRodgers12?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AaronRodgers12</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMSLive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PMSLive</a> <a href="https://t.co/p7i0QBo2qQ">pic.twitter.com/p7i0QBo2qQ</a><br />— Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) <a href="https://twitter.com/PatMcAfeeShow/status/1636058029308403716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>It's going to be interesting. New York media market is the epitome of woke, lefitst, media journactivism. Where a lot of sports reporters barely understand sports let alone care about them. Aaron Rodgers is notorious for having a handful of slightly to-the-right opinions and those reporters have a seething hatred toward people like that. Rodgers <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aaron-rodgers-stooge-moped-floor" target="_blank">thinks Fauci sucks</a>. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aaron-rodgers-joe-biden" target="_blank">He's not a fan of Biden</a>. Worst of all, he hates the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aaron-rodgers-empathy" target="_blank">fear porn</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aaron-rodgers-question" target="_blank">narratives</a> created by the media. Rodgers' first press conference for the Jets? He'll maybe get two questions about sports. And one of those will be about Zach Wilson's mom.</p><p>But most important is football. While the Bills fan in me can't in good conscience root for the Jets, one of my best buddies has been a long-suffering fan. The Jets are notorious for drafting rookie quarterbacks, throwing them to the wolves in their rookie season, then undermining them and wondering why they suck so hard. Until they get traded to a new team. Shout out to Geno Smith.</p><p>If the plan is to sign Rodgers, who only has two years left in him, and have a rookie training under him the entire time for the future, it might work. I'll still look forward to having Josh Allen both throw and run it down their throats twice a year. I also know a lot of miserable Jets fans. If Rodgers gives them a reason to be less miserable, that's okay.</p><p><p>

## Breaking: Ron DeSantis lands his first GOP congressional endorsement for President even though he's not running (yet)

We all assume he is running. Many of us want him to run. He's doing everything one would do if they are planning to run. But as of right now, he's a mere Florida Man with a book <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/biden-sinful-team-desantis" target="_blank">and a stellar conservative record</a>. He also now has his first congressional endorsement for president, and it's a doozy.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/masks-chip-roy" target="_blank">Texas Congressman Chip Roy</a>. Fresh off of being one of the rabble-rousers <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-gaetz-chip-roy-speaker" target="_blank">who shoved Kevin McCarthy's head in the toilet until he agreed to a list of well-needed reforms</a>, the congressman is all in on America's Governor. Why?

Adding, "I believe it’s time for a new generation of leadership. It’s time for younger, but proven, leadership to offer America eight solid years of transformational change.”</p><p>As of this writing, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/donald-trump-charlie-crist" target="_blank">Ron DeSantis' biggest rival for the Republican nomination</a> has yet to take to social media to call Rep. Roy a RINO globalist who is part of the establishment.</p><p>My gut feeling as a former member of the evil consultant class? An endorsement like this doesn't go out unless is a part of a planned rollout. I would be shocked if a congressman with the stature of Chip Roy in the conservative movement, who is a formal congressional colleague of DeSantis', would make a presidential endorsement today without knowing something.</p><p>Anything can change before the eventual announcement speech in Jacksonville (DUUUUUUVAL). I still have ten bucks that say this is the unofficial announcement that DeSantis is all-in for 2024.</p><p><p>

## San Francisco demands black residents get $5 million each in reparations, yet no one knows how to pay for it

That's correct - the city currently overrun by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-mental-breakdown" target="_blank">needles</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-police-36-hours" target="_blank">crime</a> is considering reparations for its citizens. The plan would award every black resident $ 5 million, wipe their personal debt, guarantee $97,000 in income for 250 years, and create $1 homes. The only problem? No one knows how to pay for it. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>But that didn't stop residents from emotionally expressing just how needed this plan is. One person sang a verse from the 1964 Civil Rights anthem, "A Change is Gonna Come."  Sergeant Yulanda Williams, president of the police association Officers for Justice, said, <em>"My dad always taught me never to beg. And I am not begging you today. It is time for you to do the right thing and provide us with reparations: make us whole." </em></p><p>Tinisch Hollins, vice-chair of the African American Reparations Advisory Committee,<em> "I don’t need to impress upon you the fact that we are setting a national precedent here in San Francisco. </em><em>What we are asking for and what we’re demanding for is a real commitment to what we need to move things forward." </em></p><p>So this is a plan they think should be adopted <em>nationwide</em>. Wonderful. To be eligible for the $5 million + benefits, a resident must be over 18 and "have identified as black/African American on public documents for at least 10 years". I really don't know what it means to identify as black, but that seems like a loophole that could cause some problems down the line. Oh, and of all the eleven members of the board, only one of them is black. And they were unanimously supportive of the plan last night. </p><p>It'll be interesting to see how this plays out, but my guess is, they won't be able to scrape up $5 million for each and every resident. Just a hunch. </p>

If you think I'm exaggerating - <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mexico-philadelphia-ad" target="_blank">Mexico used images from Philadelphia</a> in an anti-drug ad. Yes, Mexico. The country essentially run by cartels. </p><p>Unfortunately, the culture of crime is rapidly spreading to the younger generations. Last month, eight minors between the ages of 11 and 14  brutally beat a 33-year-old white woman. According to CBS News, the woman was initially knocked to the ground, and the suspects proceeded to stomp and kick her until she went unconscious. She suffered injuries to her head, face, and body. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The suspects have been charged with criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, robbery, and related crimes. Their names have not been made public due to their ages, and police are still working to identify one other suspect. </p><p>The woman was apparently walking to a hair appointment when the kids attacked her unprovoked. After she was unconscious, one of the suspects went through her pockets. She's been in Philadelphia for six years but now wants to move: <em>"</em><em>It's tough for sure. </em><em>I love Philly but I don't even want to walk down the street anymore." </em> Her father said she is "beyond traumatized" by the attack. </p><p>He also had a message for the parents of the suspects: <em>"How in the world do you raise somebody to behave like that? I hope you expect better from your children in the future because on this pathway they are going nowhere. They will be a complete waste to society, their lives will have been wasted and it will be a loss for everyone."</em></p><p>From <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adriana-kuch-school-superintendent-blames" target="_blank">severe bullying</a> in schools to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chick-fil-a-bans-16" target="_blank">getting kicked out of Chick-fil-a</a>...it seems like the younger generations are either forgetting how to behave, or they're simply not being taught. Whether it's a failure of parents, schools, or both, it's hard to tell. But there's a definite shift going on, and if we don't address it soon, who knows what will happen when these kids grow up. </p>

If local businesses were going to insist on violating local codes and regulations -- in this case, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/florida-investigates-lewd-performance" target="_blank">the ones about not exposing children to sex shows</a> -- the state was going to strip those businesses of their liquor licenses. The Hyatt Regency f*cked around anyway with the sexually explicit revue titled "A Drag Queen Christmas." They found out.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bizpacreview.com/2023/03/15/desantis-strips-hyatt-regency-miamis-liquor-license-for-allowing-children-at-drag-queen-show-1340919/" target="_blank">a statement released by the governor’s office</a>, the DeSantis administration announced on Tuesday that it will revoke the Hyatt Regency Miami’s alcohol license.</p><p>"The Department is revoking the venue’s license for the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. Sexually explicit content is not appropriate to display to children and doing so violates Florida law. Governor DeSantis stands up for the innocence of children in the classroom and throughout Florida.”</p><p>We covered the outrage over the sexually explicit show <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/florida-family-friendly" target="_blank">here on the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website</a>. The star performer was "Screwdolph," who guides Santa's slay with his nipples. To drive the point home to the children in attendance, they changed the words of a popular children's song. And I quote, "<em>SCREWdolph with your nipples so bright, w</em><em>on't you guide my sleigh tonight?"</em></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">JUST IN: Children are in attendance of an Orlando drag show where performers are sexually dancing to the song 'Screwdolph' <a href="https://t.co/JCBFQRjhkp">pic.twitter.com/JCBFQRjhkp</a><br />— Florida’s Voice (@FLVoiceNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/FLVoiceNews/status/1608284707887669251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Also at this sexually explicit show, there was...honestly, I don't know what's going on here.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">A drag queen “gives birth” in a bizarre explicit performance during a “family-friendly” Drag Queen Christmas event in Orlando, Florida.

Or even an R-rated movie. One could argue that the parents should be the ones held responsible. I'd be curious to hear what those parents felt about SCREWdolph's nipples taught their little children about tolerance and inclusion.</p><p>But local ordinances are local ordinances. Not unlike if a bar served a minor alcohol and lost their license, serving minors sexual deviancy is cause for the same in Florida.</p><p><p>

## Joe Biden claims a child wrote him a letter about the gender wage gap, but there's cause for doubt

And it's unbelievably cringey. </p><p>Yesterday, the POTUS account tweeted out a photo of a letter supposedly sent by a child. The letter read,<em> "Dear Presitent Biden: I just wanted to tell something not fair to ladies. Men are getting more money</em><em> then girls. I think you should fix this since your the Presitent. Even I'm a child and I think we should do something. From: Charlotte." </em></p><p>Ah, yes. As we know, all children proclaim "I'm a child".

And totally not written by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/karine-jean-pierre-florida-history" target="_blank">Karine Jean-Pierre</a> five minutes before the tweet went up. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p><em>"Charlotte, I couldn't agree more.

That whole "women make $0.79 for every dollar a man makes"...not true. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2019/06/06/dispelling-myths-about-the-gender-pay-gap/?sh=c5451d546fac" target="_blank">Forbes</a>, <em>"When comparing two people in the same profession, with the same seniority, working the same number of hours, and so forth, women earn $0.98 for every dollar that a man earns." </em>And it's not even clear if those two pennies are actually due to gender discrimination, or due to how aggressively each woman negotiates, any side income they may or may not have, how important a salary was to her during the hiring process, etc. </p><p>And even <em>then</em>, women tend to be represented less than men in higher-paying careers anyway. Due to <em>personal choice. </em>AKA, more women want to be preschool teachers than engineers. And there's nothing wrong with that. </p><p>Maybe Charlotte really did write this letter...as her parents hovered over her shoulder, if not literally guided the pencil in her hand. Either way, she (and her parents) could probably use some economics lessons. </p><p><p>

## Dove battles weight-inclusive "doctor" over worst woke attack on Brendan Fraiser for not actually being morbidly obese

But there are those who are accusing him of culturally appropriating their high blood pressure, clogged arteries, and lack of self-control.</p><p>In <em>The Whale</em>, Fraiser plays a reclusive, morbidly obese English teacher that attempts to reconnect with his teenage daughter. The rub is the actor isn't <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fat-man-compared-women" target="_blank">morbidly obese</a> in real life.

It's important to get all the buzzwords in.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Once again, just a reminder that the Whale was written by, directed by, and produced by 4 thin white rich able bodied cisgender men.

## TikTok blonde nails why putting your pronouns on your resume disqualifies you for most employers

To illustrate why here is some random blonde doing a TikTok from her car explaining it to everyone like they are five years old. </p><p>I don't know who she is or if she qualifies as a verified human resources expert. But a) she makes a lot of sense, and b) she's cute.

Everything in the office is going to have to cater to you: your feelings, your needs, and your emotions. So everyone around you is not going to be themselves and [will have to] walk on eggshells.

</p><p>Our blonde friend is referencing a CNBC article stating resumes <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/02/resumes-including-they/them-pronouns-are-more-likely-to-be-overlooked.html">including ‘they/them’ pronouns are more likely to be overlooked</a>. In the corporate world, they aren't praised as they are in the media. Elon Musk, the CEO of Twitter and Tesla, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-pronouns-fauci" target="_blank">says of they/thems</a>, "forcing your pronouns upon others when they didn’t ask, and implicitly ostracizing those who don’t, is neither good nor kind to anyone.</p><p>Noted pronoun expert --- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grammar-lesson-british-dude" target="_blank">um, this guy</a> -- says when you declare your pronouns, "you are not telling me how to address you. You are not telling me how you like to be spoken to. What you're telling me is how I must think about you and how I must speak to everyone else in the world when I refer to you."</p><p>I liken it to email addresses. When I was doing the hiring, if you're email address was something like xxxNikki69420xxx@yahoo.com, it led me to assume you are not a mature or responsible enough person to work in an office. If I was choosing between someone who felt it necessary to declare their pronouns and someone who didn't think doing so was necessary, I'd assume the pronoun declarer is an insufferable leftist twat who will make everyone around them miserable. Regardless of if they are a they or a them. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/frog-pronouns-gop" target="_blank">Or a frogself</a>.</p><p>Stick with bragging on your Excel skills. It's a more hireable trait.</p><p><p>
