<p>You can add Duolingo to the growing list of companies jumping on the generative AI craze. On Wednesday, the company announced <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/"><ins>Duolingo Max</ins></a>, a new, more expensive subscription tier that comes with access to a pair of GPT-4 features. The first of those, “Explain My Answer,” allows you to ask Duo, a chatbot named after the company’s owl mascot, to spell out why your answer to a question was right or wrong, with the option to ask for additional clarification if you need more help.</p><p>The second feature, Roleplay, allows you to practice the skills you’ve learned through Duolingo in a handful of scenarios. For example, one session tasks you with ordering food and drinks at a Parisian cafe. Duolingo says no two conversations will be exactly the same, even when you rehearse a situation more than once, and users can earn experience points by completing the practice sessions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Most people don’t have access to a one-on-one human tutor, but I believe AI will allow us to eventually recreate the experience of a human tutor and scale it to everyone in the world,” said Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn. “I’m so excited to share these incredible new features with millions of Duolingo learners.”</p><p>Duolingo has been working on Duolingo Max since 2022, as part of a partnership that saw OpenAI grant the company access to its new GPT-4 model before this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-just-released-gpt-4-a-multi-modal-generative-ai-172326765.html"><ins>week’s announcement</ins></a>. Thankfully, Duolingo is aware enough to admit GPT-4’s language skills <a href="https://twitter.com/Confessant/status/1635699468531281920?s=20"><ins>are far from perfect</ins></a>. “We’ve spent months collaborating closely with OpenAI to test and train this technology, and will continue doing so until the mistakes are nearly nonexistent,” the company notes, adding users can report an incorrect AI response by long pressing on a message. Users can also evaluate a Explain My Answer session by offering a thumbs up or down emoji after they’re done with one.</p><p>Starting today, Duolingo Max is available to English-speaking iOS users learning Spanish and French. In the US, the service will cost $30 per month or $168 annually. It comes with all the features that are part of Duolingo's existing Super subscription, including unlimited hearts and no ads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/duolingos-max-plan-offers-ai-tutoring-for-30-per-month-203625446.html?src=rss

It's expected to take just 20 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 80 percent, too. While there are clearly faster and longer-ranged EVs, VW's offering is more capable than alternatives like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-28-minis-2020-cooper-se-zips-around-town-powered-by-electrons.html">Mini Cooper SE</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Volkswagen ID. 2all concept EV interior" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/d475da40-c365-11ed-bebf-91bf411c881a" style="height: 1280; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volkswagen</div></figure><p>And like many EVs, the switch away from combustion power allows for considerably more interior space.

<p>Sling TV is preparing for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/march-madness-streaming-guide-163042028.html">March Madness</a> with several new features that make it easier to keep tabs on the tournament.

Sling calls the feature “Side View,” and you can activate it by clicking a button labeled, “Browse your computer while watching video” in the top-right corner of the Sling player in desktop browsers. You can then move the resulting pop-out window around the screen, and it will remain on top of any other active apps or web pages.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sling also added an iOS widget displaying a custom channel list. For example, you can create a widget showing only the channels broadcasting March Madness (ESPN for the women’s tournament; TBS, TNT and truTV for men’s), providing a home screen shortcut to the action. It’s available in two-row and four-row sizes, and you can create widget stacks with different channel collections for each.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshot of a Sling TV app home screen, showing a dedicated row of " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/11b4de60-c366-11ed-b4b9-3f7c51e2b59e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sling</div></figure><p>Finally, Sling has updated its in-app guide.

(However, Sling adds the caveat that the feature “may not be available on all devices.”)</p><p>Watching games on Sling requires a Sling Orange (including both men’s and women’s tournaments) or Sling Blue (men’s only) subscription. Although you may see sign-up perks for first-time customers, the standard cost is $40 per month for each package after a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sling-tv-is-getting-another-price-hike-051610504.html">price hike</a> last year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sling-tv-adds-picture-in-picture-in-time-for-march-madness-193349012.html?src=rss

## The 'BlackBerry' trailer looks funnier than you'd expect

<p>When we learned that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blackberry-movie-104051122.html">a BlackBerry movie was in the works </a>last year, we had no idea it would be something close to a comedy. But judging from the the trailer released today, it's aiming to be a far lighter story than other recent films about tech, like <em>The Social Network</em> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-23-steve-jobs-film-accuracy.html"><em>Steve Jobs</em></a>. The <em>BlackBerry </em>movie stars Jay Baruchel (<em>How to Train Your Dragon, Goon</em>) and <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's</em> Glenn Howerton as Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, the former co-CEOs of the Canadian firm Research in Motion. They're not exactly household names, but they both played a huge role in the history of mobile communications. Without the BlackBerry's success, the iPhone may have never happened.</p><div id="9698da6155f74e9ab21cdacc44e536a5"></div><p>Judging from the trailer, the film will cover everything from the origins of BlackBerry as a crazy idea between a few college students (director Matt Johnson also co-stars as RIM co-founder Douglas Fregin), to its ignominious end as it failed to keep up with the iPhone and Android smartphones. It's a classic innovator's dilemma tale: RIM revolutionized the way we communicated by tapping into early cellular networks, but it failed to see the potential of touchscreen smartphones that didn't need physical keyboards.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>BlackBerry</em> is based on the 2015 book <em>Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry</em>, which was written by <em>Globe and Mail</em> reporters Jacquie McNish and Sean Silcoff.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/blackberry-movie-trailer-jay-baruchel-191747935.html?src=rss

A decade later, the service appears to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-drone-deliveries-faa-restrictions-205756349.html">no closer to reality</a> than it was in 2018. However, some drone startups have had more success. Among those is Zipline, which says it’s on track to complete about 1 million deliveries by the end of the year. By 2025, the company expects to operate more flights than most airlines, a feat it intends to accomplish thanks to its next-generation drone, the <a href="https://legacy.flyzipline.com/press/zipline-unveils-new-autonomous-system-capable-of-quiet-fast-and-precise-home-delivery">Platform 2 or P2 Zip</a>.</p><div id="c181e87a691545d58310559956069abc"></div><p>Zipline’s latest drone consists of two autonomous vehicles that will work in unison with one another to deliver packages that weigh up to 8 pounds. The first is a UAV that can complete a 10-mile flight in about 10 minutes. When it arrives at its destination, P2 Zip will hover about 300 feet off the ground and deploy its sidekick, an adorable “fully autonomous delivery droid.” The latter descends from its counterpart using a tether – the company is called Zipline for a reason – and gently drops off your package. According to Zipline, P2 Zip is nearly silent in flight, producing a sound the company claims is similar to rustling leaves in the wind, and precise enough, thanks to its droid companion, to deliver packages to areas as small as patio tables and front steps. Zipline CEO Keller Rinaudo Cliffton told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/15/zipline-unveils-p2-delivery-drones-that-dock-and-recharge-autonomously.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> P2 Zip may even put an end to porch pirates since the drone is fast enough to enable on-demand delivery.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A rendering of a P2 Zip docking station. The dock looks like a lamp post with a chute for the droid to enter a building.

The drone’s charging station looks like something from science fiction. It features a chute for the delivery droid to enter the building the station is attached to, and what looks like a net to catch one of the drones if they fall. The company told <em>CNBC</em> setting up a P2 Zip dock takes about as much time as installing an electric vehicle charger. It envisions restaurants and hospitals installing the dock to enable the fast delivery of food and prescriptions.</p><p>Zipline already has a few customers eager to test the P2 Zip, including restaurant chain Sweetgreen, Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City, Michigan Medicine and Multicare Healthcare in Washington State. Before those companies gain access to the drone sometime next year, the startup plans to conduct more than 10,000 test flights with about 100 aircraft.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/next-generation-zipline-p2-zip-drone-comes-with-an-adorable-droid-sidekick-183238257.html?src=rss

## MIT’s new modular lunar robot has ‘worms’ for arms

<p>MIT engineers have designed a walking lunar robot cleverly inspired by the animal kingdom. The “mix-and-match” system is made of worm-like robotic limbs astronauts could configure into various “species” of robots resembling spiders, elephants, goats and oxen. The team <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/mixed-robot-kit-lunar-exploration-0314">won</a> the Best Paper Award last week at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Aerospace Conference.</p><p>WORMS (Walking Oligomeric Robotic Mobility System) is one team’s vision of a future where astronauts living on a moon base delegate activities to robotic minions. However, to avoid “a zoo of machines” with various robots for every task imaginable, the modular WORMS would allow astronauts to swap out limbs, bases and appendages for the task at hand. For example, they could snap together a spider bot to crawl inside hazardous lava tubes to drill for frozen water or assemble an elephant-like pack robot to haul heavy equipment. They could even make a goat / ox combination to transport solar panels. And when they finish the task, they can disassemble it and return it to storage until it’s needed for something else.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The system includes a worm-like appendage, which can snap together with a chassis through a twist-and-lock mechanism. Wok-shaped “shoes” can then snap onto the appendage’s other end. Finally, a small tool allows astronauts to release the block’s spring-loaded pins when it’s time to disassemble. The team has already developed a six-legged prototype, about the size of a go-cart, using software that coordinates multiple worm limbs. They’ve successfully demonstrated assembly, disassembly and navigation in a recent field test.</p><p>“Astronauts could go into the shed, pick the WORMS they need, along with the right shoes, body, sensors and tools, and they could snap everything together, then disassemble it to make a new one,” said George Lordos, Ph.D. candidate and graduate instructor at MIT’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. “The design is flexible, sustainable and cost-effective.”</p><figure><img alt="Rendering of a six-footed (spider-like) robot prototype." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/1b31a490-c358-11ed-8bfe-590a7bb9803c" style="height: 1044; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MIT</div></figure><p>The team spawned the idea in 2022 as their answer to NASA’s Breakthrough, Innovative and Game-changing (BIG) Idea Challenge, an annual competition for university students to conjure innovative ideas. In that year’s edition, NASA challenged students to develop robots to move across extreme terrain without wheels. The MIT team focused on a lunar robot that could navigate the moon’s South Pole, which some suspect could <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasas-first-lunar-rover-will-scour-the-moons-south-pole-for-water-in-2023-160022034-170003713.html">include frozen water</a> — essential for astronauts’ long-term survival — but also complex terrain with thick dust, rocky slopes and lava tubes.</p><p>As the students brainstormed solutions, they drew inspiration from the animal kingdom. “As we were thinking of these animal inspirations, we realized that one of the simplest animals, the worm, makes similar movements as an arm, or a leg, or a backbone, or a tail,” says deputy team leader and AeroAstro graduate student Michael Brown. “And then the lightbulb went off: We could build all these animal-inspired robots using worm-like appendages.”</p><p>Although each WORMS appendage weighs about 20 pounds on Earth, they would be only about three pounds in the moon’s atmosphere, making it easy for astronauts to assemble, disassemble and reassemble them like a high-tech Lego set. The team is already working on a second-generation model with longer and slightly heavier appendages, with an eye on heavy-equipment hauling bots.</p><p>“There are many buzz words that are used to describe effective systems for future space exploration: modular, reconfigurable, adaptable, flexible, cross-cutting, et cetera,” said Kevin Kempton, an engineer at NASA’s Langley Research Center and judge of the 2022 BIG Idea Challenge. “The MIT WORMS concept incorporates all these qualities and more.”</p><div id="04e05db0a75848fe8dcf272e1449b11e"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mits-new-modular-lunar-robot-has-worms-for-arms-175146649.html?src=rss

## Samsung explains its 'fake' Moon photos

<p>Samsung is hoping to talk its way out of a controversy over its camera processing technology. The company has shared an <a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/how-samsung-galaxy-cameras-combine-super-resolution-technologies-with-ai-technology-to-produce-high-quality-images-of-the-moon/">explanation</a> of the Moon photo detection system it has used since the Galaxy S21. If you have Scene Optimizer turned on, AI detects when you're taking a clear photo of the Moon at 25X zoom or above. The tech lowers the brightness, captures multiple frames (to produce a bright, low-noise picture) and uses a neural network to enhance the detail using a high-resolution reference image for comparison.</p><p>You can turn Scene Optimizer off. Samsung also notes that this won't work if you either take a snapshot of the obscured Moon or use an image that clearly wasn't taken on Earth. The Moon is tidally locked to the planet, so you'll always see the same lunar surface unless you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yusaku-maezawa-open-invite-to-the-moon-043940638.html">go to space</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Samsung Scene Optimizer used with existing image of the Moon" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/d4acf1d0-c34f-11ed-bfef-d9f18e5fe84b" style="height: 468; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The defense comes after Reddit user Breakphotos <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/11nzrb0/samsung_space_zoom_moon_shots_are_fake_and_here/">alleged</a> that Samsung was faking Moon images by adding detail that wasn't present in the raw scene. To make the case, Breakphotos even snapped pictures of blurry, low-resolution images on a computer screen — there's no info the phone could recover from the shot. Even with blown-out exposure, the device appeared to add info that simply wasn't there.</p><p>This isn't an outright fake. Samsung is using the actual shot as a baseline. However, its algorithms are clearly going to an extreme by producing photos that don't represent what you get through the lens. The company appears to be aware of this, too, as it says it's refining Scene Optimizer to &quot;reduce any potential confusion&quot; between taking photos of the actual Moon and mere images of it.</p><p>This isn't the first time a phone manufacturer has received criticism for manipulating photo output, of course. Some brands have had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-25-xiaomi-mi-9-review.html">beauty modes</a> that mask perceived body and skin imperfections to create unrealistic portraits. However, Samsung is effectively claiming its phones can take technically impossible photos — you may buy a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-specs-price-photo-and-video-take-center-stage-140034341.html">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> under the misguided impression that someone's sharp, crisp lunar image reflects what the phone can physically produce.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-explains-its-fake-moon-photos-170233896.html?src=rss

<p>LinkedIn is the latest platform to hop on the generative AI bandwagon. The company is adding AI-powered “writing suggestions” and job descriptions to its service as it looks for new ways to infuse AI into its platform.</p><p>The writing suggestions are meant to make it easier to fill out key profile fields that LinkedIn says can otherwise feel “daunting” to complete: the “about” and “headline” sections near the top of each profile. Now, with the new “enhance” tool,  LinkedIn Premium subscribers can generate descriptions based on their experience.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company says the tool, which uses the same OpenAI models that power ChatGPT, is meant to preserve “your unique voice and style” and will draw from your job experience and skills, as well as LinkedIn’s own “insights” into what makes a good profile. In an example of a completed “about” section provided by LinkedIn, the tool generated a first-person summary of an individual’s job experience that reads almost like the beginning of a cover letter.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/ae8b6100-c2c1-11ed-b8fd-7c5226f3adc6" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LinkedIn</div></figure><p>LinkedIn also says it’s starting to test AI-written job descriptions. In those cases, hiring managers will simply need to fill out the job title, company name and a few other basic details, and LinkedIn will create a detailed draft of a relevant job description.</p><p>Of note, the company is positioning its AI writing features as more of a starting point than a final product. In both cases, LinkedIn says that users should review and edit the AI-generated text to check for accuracy. But the company says that both could be a major time saver for members who want to offload some of the more tedious writing tasks associated with LinkedIn.</p><p>These writing tools aren’t LinkedIn’s first foray into generative AI.

## How to organize all of your tabs on Chrome and other browsers

<p>We’ve all been there. Maybe you were neck-deep in a work project, or you hopped too far down a Wikipedia rabbit hole, but at a certain point you looked up and realized you were drowning in a mess of browser tabs, with no clear way to put them all in order.</p><p>Thankfully, there’s a variety of features you can use to tidy up your browsing space. We’ve broken down the most helpful tab management tips and tricks for the four <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide">most popular browsers</a> (Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox), from lesser-known built-in tools to some useful add-ons from third parties.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>How to organize tabs in Chrome</h2><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting the " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/15601060-bf66-11ed-befb-4ddd8adbc19d" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Google Chrome is by far the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share">most popular</a> web browser in the world, but some of its built-in tab management tools may not be immediately apparent to some users. One trick is to use “<a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/manage-tabs-with-google-chrome/">tab groups</a>,” which lets you cluster multiple tabs into groups that you can label and color-code. This makes it easier to distinguish between different topics, or simply separate work-related pages from the rest. Clicking a group’s label will collapse or expand all tabs within.</p><p>You can create a group or add tabs to an existing group by right-clicking on the one you want to move, selecting “Add tab to group,” then choosing where you want the tab to go. Alternatively, you can just click and drag a tab in or out of a group to add or remove it. All of this still works if you’ve selected multiple tabs simultaneously (which you can do by holding Ctrl on Windows, or Cmd on macOS, as you click).</p><p>If you right-click on a group’s label, you can change the name and color, ungroup all the tabs contained within it, close the group entirely or move it into a new window. You can also do the last of those by simply dragging the group label out of its current window. If you close a tab group accidentally, note that you can restore it from Chrome’s three-dot menu, hovering over History, finding the group’s name and clicking “Restore group”.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting the tab search feature built into Google Chrome." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/4f009100-bf66-11ed-9cd7-64aadd7482c9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Regardless of whether you use tab groups, you can quickly search through all of your open tabs by using the “Search tabs” button. This is the downward-facing arrow in the top right corner of your window. You can also pull this up by hitting Ctrl + Shift + A on Windows, or Cmd + Shift + A on macOS. This will show you a tidy vertical list of all your open tabs, plus a handful that you’ve recently closed. You can close tabs directly from here as well, and the menu will break out any open tabs that are currently playing audio or video. You can also search through your open tabs directly from Chrome’s address bar. Just type “@tabs”, then hit the space bar or Tab to initiate it.</p><p>If you like to order your tabs by putting them in distinct windows, you can give each a custom name for better organization. If you have a bunch of work-related tabs in one window, for instance, you could call that one “Work”. To do this, pull up the window you want to name, right-click the empty space next to the new tab (or “+”) icon and select “Name window.”</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting how to give custom names to browser windows in Google Chrome." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/750c6770-bf66-11ed-9fff-014f5ff96154" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>From that same menu, you can also select “Bookmark all tabs” to bookmark all of your open tabs and put them in a particular folder. Hitting Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D will bring you to this same function.</p><p>Tab management isn’t as big of a hindrance on smartphones, where you might only look at one tab at a time. Still, we’ll note that Chrome lets you create tab groups on Android by tapping the square “Switch tabs” button, then holding and dragging a particular tab over to whatever other tab you want to group it with.</p><p>That feature isn’t available on iPhones and iPads, but you can still search through open tabs by hitting the same Switch tabs button, then selecting the Search icon in the top left corner. You can also bookmark one or more open tabs from the Switch tabs menu, after pressing and holding an open tab. For multiple tabs, press Edit, then Select Tabs, check off the tabs you want to bookmark, then hit Add To… &gt; Add to Bookmarks.</p><h2><strong>How to organize tabs in </strong>Edge</h2><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting the tab groups feature on Microsoft Edge." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/dd569ac0-bf76-11ed-bd5b-dbbf9d735054" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Microsoft Edge is built on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-15-microsoft-chromium-edge-launch-window-mac.html">same codebase</a> as Chrome, so it shouldn’t be a surprise to hear that its tab management features are similar to those found in Google’s browser. It, too, has a tab grouping feature, which works in effectively the same way: Just right-click on one or more tabs and select “Add tab(s) to group.” As with Chrome, you can give each group a custom name and color, and you can quickly collapse or expand the tabs within each group by clicking its label.</p><p>Also like Chrome, hitting Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + A will pull up a tab search menu, which vertically lists your current and recently closed tabs and distinguishes any media-playing tabs. The “@tabs” address bar shortcut mentioned above won’t work here, but you can still assign custom names to windows.</p><p>Another way to access some of Edge’s tab-related tools is through the dedicated “tab actions” icon in the top left corner. To make this visible, click on Edge’s three-dot menu button, then go to Settings &gt; Appearance &gt; Customize toolbar, then activate the “Show tab actions menu” toggle. Here, you can pull up the tab search menu, a list of recently closed tabs, and a list of Edge tabs you have open on other devices.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting the vertical tabs mode in Microsoft Edge." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/06225480-bf77-11ed-ab57-68d82f760428" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>The tab actions menu also lets you turn on Edge’s “vertical tabs” mode. This moves your tabs from their usual spot above the address bar to the left side of the window. This view won’t be everyone’s favorite, but the wider space can make it easier to identify which tabs you have open. If you prefer to keep the tab actions button hidden, you can swap between the standard and vertical tabs views on Windows by pressing Ctrl + Shift + , (Comma).</p><p>Like other browsers, Edge also lets you save tabs as bookmarks (or “favorites”). But we’ll also give a quick mention to the browser’s “<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9lZGdlL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2NvbGxlY3Rpb25zP2Zvcm09TVQwMEQ4IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5YTI2N2MwOS0zZjAyLTQ2YzctYjdhZi01ZjliYWVkNTNjYTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd1yQ4m3iqmlow25sXy1K05oRGpORXZyF_GX0UBhBfuO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fedge%2Ffeatures%2Fcollections%3Fform%3DMT00D8">Collections</a>” tool, which you can access by pressing Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Y or hitting the icon in the top right corner that looks like two squares and a plus sign. This is more of a native web clipper than a full tab manager, but if you want to stash web pages alongside images, text notes and the like, you can hit “+ Add current page” within a given Collection to add your current tab to it. On macOS, you can also right click a tab to add all open tabs to a Collection at once.</p><h2><strong>How to organize tabs in </strong>Safari</h2><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting how to create tab groups in Safari." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/561d6900-bf6a-11ed-bfcf-a313114b3a8e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Like Chrome and Edge, Apple’s Safari browser allows you to organize tabs into distinct groups. There are a few ways to set this up. For one, you can click the downward-facing arrow in the top left of the Toolbar. From here, click New Empty Tab Group, or select New Tab Group with # Tabs to put all the open tabs in your window into their own group. (The “#” is just whatever number of tabs you have open.) You’ll be prompted to give each group a custom name. You can find these same options under the File menu or by two-finger clicking any open tab.</p><p>Click the Show Sidebar button in the top right corner to view, rename, delete and rearrange your tab groups as needed. If you two-finger click a tab group’s name in the Sidebar and select Copy Links, you’ll make a neatly formatted list of all the links within that group, which you can paste into a doc or chat. The icon at the top of the Sidebar that looks like two overlapping squares with a plus symbol gives you another way to create a new tab group. You can also open the Sidebar by going to File &gt; Show Sidebar or pressing Cmd + Shift + L on your keyboard.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting how to see tabs and tab groups in a vertical view in Safari's Sidebar panel." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/7dae31c0-bf6a-11ed-9ffe-67b4403f6fd2" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>To add a new tab to a group, two-finger click the tab, select Move to Tab Group, then choose where you want it to go. If the Sidebar is open, you can also drag a tab into a group directly. To quickly swap between groups, click on your current group’s name in the top left corner, then select the group you want from the resulting dropdown menu. These tab collections will sync across multiple Apple devices if they’re connected to the same iCloud account.</p><p>The Sidebar can work <em>somewhat</em> like the vertical tabs view that’s available in Edge. If you hover over “# Tabs” at the top of the Sidebar or the name of any tab group, you’ll see a rightward-facing arrow. Click that, and you’ll see a vertical list of all the tabs nested within. You can access similar views for your bookmarks or Reading List at the bottom of the Sidebar. Safari doesn’t let you hide the horizontal tab bar like Edge, however.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting the Arrange Tabs By shortcut in Safari." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/a7c5f380-bf6a-11ed-aeeb-6bcaef364fc8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Annoyingly, Safari doesn’t allow you to select and drag multiple tabs at once from the tab bar, so separating a chunk of tabs into separate windows can feel clunky. You can easily sort your tabs, however, by two-finger clicking one (or opening the Window menu), then choosing Arrange Tabs By. From here, you can reorganize all your current tabs by their page title or website.</p><p>To more comfortably see what tabs you have open, click the Tab Overview icon, which looks like two overlapping squares in the top right corner. This presents all your tabs in a grid as large thumbnails, which can make it easier to find a particular page. You can also get to this page by selecting View &gt; Show Tab Overview, pressing Cmd + Shift + \ on your keyboard, or two-finger clicking on a tab group in the Sidebar.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting the Tab Overview screen and tab search function in Safari." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/bf055630-bf6a-11ed-b65d-c3173923cec3" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>In the top right corner of this Tab Overview screen is a search bar. This function is also available on iPhones and iPads. The downside is this search will be limited to just the tabs in your current group, not those in separate tab groups or windows. Simply typing a keyword in the address bar will usually suggest a few relevant tabs you have open, too, but this isn’t comprehensive.</p><p>For sites you plan to revisit regularly, you can bookmark a tab by hitting Cmd + D, or going to Bookmarks &gt; Add Bookmark. To bookmark multiple open tabs, select Bookmarks &gt; Add Bookmarks for These # Tabs.</p><p>Many of these tricks are also available on Safari for iPhone and iPad. To create a tab group on an iPhone, hit the Tab Overview button, touch and hold a tab, then choose Move to Tab Group. Alternatively, just long-press the address bar while viewing a web page. To look through your tab groups or add all your open tabs to a group by tapping the downward-facing arrow at the bottom of the Tab Overview screen (or top right on an iPad).</p><h2><strong>How to organize tabs in </strong>Firefox</h2><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting the tab search tool in Mozilla Firefox." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/388531e0-bf77-11ed-9cfb-4e0e20bf1b78" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Mozilla’s Firefox isn’t as popular as it used to be, but it remains worthwhile if you care strongly about data privacy, customization and independence from the usual tech giants. That said, its <em>native </em>tab management tools aren’t as robust as those in Chrome, Edge or Safari. There are many extensions you can add to close the gap – we’ve noted a few below – but by default, there’s no tab grouping feature, custom window names or vertical tabs mode.</p><p>You can still see a tidy list of each window’s tabs, however, by clicking the “List all tabs” button, which is the downward-facing arrow in the top right corner. Above that list you can also access a tab search function. If that’s too cumbersome, typing a relevant keyword in the address bar will display any corresponding open tabs at the bottom of the dropdown list that pops up. Alternatively, you can put a % symbol before or after a keyword search in the address bar to limit your search to just your currently active tabs.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting how to quickly bookmark all active tabs in Mozilla Firefox." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/7b2fe2f0-bf78-11ed-bfe7-b3ea1d30ad1b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>As with most browsers, Firefox lets you pin tabs, create bookmarks, close several tabs at once and drag multiple tabs into new windows simultaneously. To put all your current tabs into a bookmark folder, right-click on any tab, choose “Select All Tabs,” right-click again and choose “Bookmark Tabs.”</p><p>To open all bookmarked tabs in a folder, go to your bookmarks menu or bookmarks toolbar (depending on where it’s saved), right-click, then select “Open All Bookmarks.” If you want to search for a specific bookmark, put a * symbol before or after a keyword query in the address bar to limit a search to solely your bookmarks.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting the bookmarks tags menu in Mozilla Firefox." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/5c062240-bf78-11ed-8ffd-aaef2795060b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>For a little extra organization, note that Firefox also lets you assign <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/categorizing-bookmarks-make-them-easy-to-find">custom tags</a> to your bookmarks. You can add these in the menu that pops up whenever you click the star icon for a specific web page, or by clicking Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + O to bring up your full bookmarks library then adding tags as needed. You can also get to the latter by hitting the three-line menu button on the right side, then selecting Bookmarks &gt; Manage Bookmarks.</p><p>After setting this up, you can look for a bookmark just by typing out the tag(s) in the address bar. You can also make it so a search in the address bar only pulls from bookmarks you’ve tagged by adding a + symbol.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting the Firefox View page on Mozilla Firefox." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/3d97c250-bf78-11ed-b7f7-07c501361cea" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>You can see a clean-looking list of several recently closed tabs on the <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-set-tab-pickup-firefox-view">Firefox View</a> page. To access this, just click the little Firefox logo pinned in the top left corner. It’s still possible to reopen your last closed tab with the usual Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T shortcut as well.</p><p>Finally, we’ll also make note of Firefox’s “<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers">Containers</a>” feature. This is aimed more at privacy than reducing tab clutter: The idea is to separate your browser cookies between distinct clusters of tabs, so you can log into multiple accounts for one website in the same window, or make it so a site can’t see any information about tabs outside of its specific container. Using containers distinguishes your tabs by different color codes, though, which gives it a modicum of organizational value.</p><p>You’ll need to <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers">install this as an extension</a> on macOS, but once it’s set, you can add one or more tabs to a container by right-clicking it, selecting “Open in New Container Tab,” then choosing the container you want. There are four presets by default; to create a new container, click the three-line menu button and select Settings. Then, look for the Tabs submenu, click the “Settings…” button next to “Enable Container Tabs,” click “Add New Container,” then choose the name, color and icon you want.</p><h2>Third-party tab extensions</h2><figure><img alt="A screenshot depicting the tab management browser extension OneTab." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/25caecb0-bf78-11ed-8be7-e76a8d3ed660" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>All of these built-in browser tools should make navigating tab hell a little more manageable, but if you’re still not quite getting what you need, there are tons of third-party extensions and add-ons that can help. Perhaps the most popular is <a href="https://www.one-tab.com/">OneTab</a>, which is available for Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Safari. This adds a little icon by your address bar that, when pressed, quickly collapses all open, non-pinned tabs in your window into an orderly list of links on a separate page. From there, you can then open and delete tabs individually or all at once, drag them into different groups of links you’ve previously OneTab’d, or turn a list of links into one shareable URL. There are other add-ons along these lines, but OneTab is clean, fast and dead simple to use. Plus, it can help make your browser a bit less of a memory hog.</p><p><a href="https://tab-session-manager.sienori.com/">Tab Session Manager</a> for Firefox, Chrome and Edge works similarly. It saves all of your open tabs at once, regardless of whether they’re in different windows. It doesn’t close your tabs; instead they’re displayed as a vertical list in a dropdown menu. You can add tags to specific clusters of tabs, sync “sessions” between devices, and search for tabs right from its menu. You can also access tabs from windows you’ve closed.</p><p>Firefox users can particularly benefit from tab managing add-ons. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/">Tree Style Tab</a>, for instance, adds a detailed vertical tabs view, while <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/window-titler/">Window Titler</a> lets you add custom tags to windows. And <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-tab-groups/">Simple Tab Groups</a> may not be quite as intuitive as the built-in tab grouping tools built into Chrome, Edge or Safari, but it still provides that sort of functionality in Firefox.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-organize-browser-tabs-150011935.html?src=rss

## FBI says Americans lost $10.3 billion to internet scammers in 2022

<p>If you know someone who fell for an online scam last year, you're far from alone. The FBI <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2022_IC3Report.pdf">reports</a> that Americans submitting incidents to the agency lost $10.3 billion to internet scams in 2022, a steep jump from $6.9 billion in 2021. While there were fewer complaints (800,944), certain ripoffs were still very problematic. Investment scams were the most common and costliest schemes. Related fraud losses jumped from nearly $1.5 billion in 2021 to $3.3 billion, and most of that value came from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/treasury-department-crypto-scams-crackdown-140424883.html">cryptocurrency scams</a> — losses surged from $907 million to almost $2.6 billion in 2022.</p><p>There were some bright spots. While investment scams were the on the rise, ransomware complaints fell sharply. There were just 2,385 complaints about these digital extortion attempts versus 3,729 the year before, and they led to a relatively modest $34.3 million in losses. And while phishing was the most prevalent scam type with over 300,000 complaints, the damages were limited to $52.1 million.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The FBI warns that its figures don't represent the entirety of online scams in the US. Not everyone who was the victim of a ransomware attack reported it to the bureau, Executive Assistant Director Timothy Langan says. However, he says the reports help law enforcement spot trends and otherwise deal with threats. The Investigators have better sense of what they need to address, even if they don't have the full picture.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fbi-says-americans-lost-10-billion-to-scammers-in-2022-144514762.html?src=rss

<p>Meta has announced another expansive round of layoffs to cut costs. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the company is letting go of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zuckerberg-touts-year-of-efficiency-as-meta-lays-off-an-additional-10000-workers-131957819.html">another 10,000 workers</a> and closing &quot;around 5,000 additional open roles that we haven’t yet hired.&quot; This follows layoffs of around 11,000 employees last year. The company is reducing the size of its recruiting team and will inform affected employees later today.

## NASA picks Axiom Space for its third astronaut mission to the ISS

<p>NASA has <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-axiom-space-for-third-private-astronaut-station-mission">chosen Axiom Space's proposal</a> yet again for the third private astronaut mission to the International Space Station. The two parties have already signed a mission order, and they're hoping to launch sometime in November 2023 and beyond from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. A more specific date will be announced later, since it will depend on the timing of other flights to the ISS, as well as on in-orbit activity planning.&nbsp;</p><p>Before Axiom Mission 3 launches, Axiom Mission 2 will have to head to the space station first. It's also a crew mission that's operated by the company, and it's expected to launch in the second quarter of 2023. As you can guess from its name, it's not the company's first astronaut mission to the orbiting lab: NASA also picked it for the first commercially operated crewed flight to the station. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/axiom-space-ax-1-launch-153106831.html">Axiom Mission 1</a> launched in April 2022 and was docked with the ISS for 15 days.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the moment, Ax-3 is still in its very early stages. The private space company will still have to submit four proposed crew members and two back up crew to the agency for review, with the mission commander being a flown NASA astronaut. (Ax-2, for instance, was headed by retired NASA astronaut Peggy Annette Whitson.) Under the parties' agreement, NASA may ask the commander to perform certain tasks or science experiments while onboard. Meanwhile, Axiom Space astronauts will be able to use NASA cargo and other in-orbit resources for daily use.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to choosing Axiom Space for these private launches, NASA also picked the company to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-axiom-space-first-artemis-moonwalk-spacesuits-091951395.html">develop  the moonwalking</a> spacesuit for its Artemis program. The agency will unveil the suit today in an event, which will be livestreams on <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/live/">NASA's website</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nasa-axiom-space-third-astronaut-mission-iss-105544749.html?src=rss

<p>For decades, car makers have positioned all of their instrumentation below the steering wheel, resulting in drivers needing to subtly take their eyes off the road to see their speed and associated gas levels. However, with its new <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0410802EN/the-bmw-panoramic-vision:-new-head-up-display-across-the-entire-width-of-the-windscreen-will-be-in-series-production-in-2025">'Panoramic Vision' display</a>, BMW is looking to bring that important data up to eye level. The company has announced a heads-up display that spans the entire width of the windscreen to give drivers and passengers all the information they need without having to take eyes off the road.</p><p>As the driver, you can choose what you want to see across the Panoramic Vision display, with options including speed, time, and current song playing. The display uses bright crisp lights to display information clearly against a dark background.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ada790309230411fbfc6cb9f02c7361c"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>BMW first alluded to a new heads-up display when it announced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bmw-i-vision-dee-concept-digitizes-the-driving-experience-unveiling-first-look-ces2023-041555994.html">i Vision Dee</a> concept at CES 2023 back in January. However, in that iteration, the information appeared digitally right onto the windshield. In contrast, the Panoramic Vision display is a raised lip built-in across the bottom of the windshield.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no word yet if any of the other features shown in the i Vision Dee will make their way to production anytime soon. These included interactive communication in which BMW stated, &quot;a natural and emotional relationship between human and machine is developed,&quot; and animated facial expressions.&nbsp;</p><p>The Panoramic Vision display will begin rolling out in the first NEUE KLASSE (or New Class) models — BMW's range of battery and e-motor vehicles — from 2025. According to BMW, additional features of the BMW iDrive will be included in the NEUE KLASSE. However, we'll likely have to wait until the IAA Mobility 2023 in Munich this September to learn more.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bmws-new-panoramic-vision-will-put-a-full-width-display-on-ev-windscreens-103515430.html?src=rss

<p>BMW has <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/united-kingdom/article/detail/T0410882EN_GB/digital-dynamic-and-now-also-fully-electric-the-bmw-5-series-enters-a-new-era">revealed</a> more details about its EV release plans, with the highlight being the arrival of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bmw-all-electric-5-series-7-series-x1-vehicles-091504834.html">the i5 Sedan</a> in in October 2023 alongside the next-gen gas-powered 5 Series. The company also plans to unveil the iX2 SUV sometime this year and an i5 touring EV in 2024. It's all part of a plan to have battery EVs (BEVs) &quot;in virtually every major segment of its business,&quot; the company said in a <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0410918EN/bmw-group-expects-profitable-growth-in-2023-%E2%80%93-through-dynamic-bev-ramp-up-and-high-end-premium-segment?language=en">look ahead to 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Much as it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bmw-i7-xdrive60-electric-sedan-132756927.html">did with the i7</a>, BMW will effectively release its new 5 Series cars, including the electric i5 version, at the same time. &quot;The flexible powertrain architecture means the new BMW 5 Series Sedan can be offered in all-electric and plug-in hybrid variants as well as powered by highly efficient petrol and diesel engines with 48V mild hybrid technology,&quot; it wrote.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Noting that its all-electric i4 M50 was its best-selling M vehicle last year, BMW said it will release an M performance version of the i5, too. It'll also add a touring i5 in 2024. &quot;The BMW 5 Series Touring is very popular, particularly in Europe,&quot; said BMW chairman Oliver Zipse. &quot;From spring 2024 it will also come in an all-electric version, giving us a truly unique selling point in this segment.&quot;</p><p>The other notable addition next year will be the iX2 crossover SUV, likely based on the upcoming X2 ICE model and a successor to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bmw-ix-ev-first-drive-video-193002612.html">$83,200 iX</a>. The latter model was perhaps most famous for its weird grille, but offered some solid features including a 321 mile EPA range.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, BMW <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rolls-royce-electric-vehicle-spectre-2030-145128453.html">confirmed</a> that both Rolls-Royce and Mini would be going fully electric by 2030. In the nearer term, it said that &quot;in 2024, at least one in five of the company’s new cars will have a fully-electric drive train; by 2025; every fourth new vehicle delivered should be a BEV and, by 2026, around one in three.&quot;  It expects to sell two million EVs by 2025, and deliver 10 million to customers in 2030.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bmw-confirms-the-i5-sedan-will-be-its-first-all-electric-5-series-vehicle-094954587.html?src=rss

## Samsung’s Galaxy A54 has a bright 1,000-nit display and looks more like a flagship phone

<p>It’s that quiet moment between Samsung launching its Galaxy S flagships and its, well, <em>other</em> flagships that just happen to fold. The perfect time, then, to update its midrange A series and add to the chaos. We’re going to focus on the Galaxy A54, but Samsung will also launch a similar, cheaper device, the Galaxy A34, in other regions like the UK.</p><p>While no major shakeups are coming from the Galaxy A53 to the A54, there are some notable changes, including a redesign more closely aligned to the premium Galaxy S family, with metal detail on the cameras, which now jut out from the back independently of each other.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Samsung Galaxy A53 hands-on" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/37668ee6-c30e-11ed-bbbf-7301a6a29301" style="height: 1333; width: 2000;" /><figcaption>Looks familiar, right?</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>The display is now slightly smaller at 6.4 inches (the predecessor had a 6.5-inch screen), but it keeps the same 2,400 x 1,080 resolution. This year, however, Samsung has boosted the maximum brightness to 1,000 nits. That should be noticeable in sunlight and the company is going further, adding Vision Booster to enhance visibility when your environment is a little too bright. The screen also reaches up to 120Hz, though the variable refresh rate helps to keep battery life in check. It’s another gorgeous screen from Samsung, which continues to shrink the gap between flagship and mid-range. It’s only the bezels that kinda give the game away here.</p><p>Samsung has also upgraded the A54’s processor, running on the 5nm octa-core Exynos 1380 – the company’s latest in-house chip. Samsung claims that this should offer 20 percent performance improvement on CPU tasks, and 26 percent improvement when it comes to GPU tasks. While it was hard to push the phone to its limits during hands-on time, we’re hoping the A54 is a little more capable than last year’s A53. Samsung has kept the battery the same size as last year, which is a good sign: two-day battery life was one of the stronger points when we reviewed the device.</p><figure><img alt="Samsung Galaxy A54" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/dbaf9870-c30e-11ed-bdff-6e2f2377cb24" style="height: 1333; width: 2000;" /><figcaption>The Galaxy A34 (left) has a few differences to the pricier Galaxy A54 (right).</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>When it comes to imaging, It’s another triple-camera array for this year’s A-series. There’s a 50-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization and an f/1.8 lens, which is flanked by a 12MP ultra-wide camera, and a 5MP macro camera. Samsung has also kept the 32-megapixel selfie camera for the 2023 refresh. The company says the changes to the camera system include larger pixels (more detail, less noise) and enhanced optical stabilization, from 0.95 degrees of stability up to 1.5 degrees – that’s a notable improvement, especially if you’re capturing a lot of video. Samsung has also embedded Snapchat filters into the native camera app, which you can see in the main image at the top of this story. It'll sync with your Snapchat account, giving you easy access to filters across all the cameras.</p><p>In the US, the Galaxy A54 arrives in two glossy color options: black and violet. Elsewhere, you’ll be able to choose white and lime colorways. A few of our images include the Galaxy A34, which has a notch selfie camera, a slightly larger screen and a hypnotic, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-04-samsung-galaxy-s10-review-with-camera-samples-fingerprint.html">familiar</a>, pearlescent finish, which I think is actually nicer than the more expensive A54. However, only the A54 is heading to the US, which will be available to preorder on March 30th before launching on April 6th for $450 – the same price as last year’s model.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-a54-galaxy-a34-hands-on-pricing-release-date-090009335.html?src=rss

## Kia's EV9 electric SUV features three rows of seats and a striking design

<p>Kia is giving us our <a href="https://www.kiapressoffice.com/en-gb/releases/1543">first look</a> at the interior and exterior of its striking mid-size EV9 SUV, while saving key specs like the battery size and powertrain for the official debut early next month. The market-ready version hews closely to the original EV9 concept we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-ev9-suv-release-date-152842660.html">first saw in November 2021</a>, albeit with the blockiness toned down. Still, much like the EV6, it's a dramatic and interesting design.</p><p>The upcoming model has triangular windows in the rear quarter panel much like the EV6, but otherwise appears to draw inspiration from boxy SUVs like older Range Rovers. Kia said it's &quot;formed from a polygonal design language&quot; that uses &quot;triangular fender structures and highly pronounced geometric wheel arches combine with the fuselage body.&quot; Despite all the lines and edges, though, Kia says the EV9 is still highly aerodynamic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Kia unveils the EV9 electric SUV with three rows of seats" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/cfc0c0a0-c2f7-11ed-ac8d-c25f2d06b177" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kia</div></figure><p>It offers three rows of seats and thus becomes one of the first EVs to slot into the popular mid-size SUV category. That means it'll be taking on ICE vehicles like Kia's own Telluride, the Toyota Highlander, Ford Explorer and other models. The boxiness and squared off rear end means it should offer good headroom.</p><p>One fun touch is that the middle row uses swivelling captain's chairs, so they can flip around to face the rear seats, Orient Express-style. It'll be sold in 6- and 7-passenger configurations, depending on whether the rear seats are buckets or a bench.</p><figure><img alt="Kia unveils the EV9 electric SUV with three rows of seats" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/eb2c8ef0-c2f7-11ed-b6ef-8aa0aac884df" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kia</div></figure><p>Up front, Kia has ditched the concept's massive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-concept-ev9-electric-suv-221504011.html">wraparound display</a> in favor of two 12.3-inch screens for the gauge cluster and infotainment system. The number of physical buttons has been reduced and touch-sensitive dash controls added. The interior uses mesh and other materials designed to further boost the feeling of spaciousness.</p><p>Other details including infotainment system features are being kept under wraps until the vehicle's official reveal in early April. We do know that it will be built using the EV6's E-GMP platform, but Kia has yet to say anything about the EV9's power, battery size, range and price. With the EV6 starting at $45,000 or so, the EV9 is likely to be considerably north of that — but as we've seen with Kia, it's likely to be affordable for its category.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Kia unveils the EV9 electric SUV with three rows of seats" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/fda14a30-c2f7-11ed-99fe-ccfffdf34456" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kia</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/kias-ev9-electric-suv-features-three-rows-of-seats-and-a-striking-design-070933286.html?src=rss

<p>Volkswagen pinned its future on electric vehicles and announced its plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-17-volkswagen-new-electric-cars.html">put 30 new EVs</a> on the road shortly after its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-22-volkswagen-emissions-scandal-cost-18-billion.html">$18.2 billion emissions scandal</a>. Now, the automaker has revealed that it plans to spend $193 billion on different areas of its electrification efforts over the next five years. According to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy8xNC9idXNpbmVzcy92b2xrc3dhZ2VuLWVsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGVzLWJhdHRlcmllcy1pbnZlc3RtZW50Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImYwZTdmMWFjLTE0NTEtNGVhMi05ZjZhLWUwZjRhNjlmZmYzMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAe_Sjh6zdeoZ83L_bMNRr_IgTqDWs99KUqECOQ8ZkT2S&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F03%2F14%2Fbusiness%2Fvolkswagen-electric-vehicles-batteries-investment.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, Volkswagen chief executive Oliver Blume said at a press event that two-thirds of that budget will go towards manufacturing batteries, developing software and sourcing critical and raw materials for its vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p>Blume's revelation comes after the automaker's announcements that its subsidiary PowerCo will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-will-build-its-first-north-american-ev-battery-plant-in-canada-172720275.html">build its first</a> North American battery cell factory in Canada and that it will build electric pickups and SUVs in South Carolina. The company is already producing its ID.4 electric vehicles in the US after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-id-4-production-chattanooga-183004034.html">repurposing</a> its Chattanooga, Tennessee factory in 2022. But Volkswagen's electrification efforts are still behind its biggest competitors', and it's aiming to establish a stronger foothold in North America, as well to become more competitive in China. The company considers those regions as its two most important markets — ones it will have to conquer if it wants to reach its goals. Volkswagen previously said that it wants electric vehicles to account for about 55 percent of its sales in the US by 2030.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For now, the automaker will continue making gas vehicles while it's working to expand its EV offerings with more models, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-battery-electric-vehicle-205040665.html">affordable ones</a> that cost around $26,000. Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen’s chief financial and operating officer, talked about the path the company has to take going forward, though: "We must transform ourselves into a technology and mobility services group. We need to focus on our platforms, such as our hardware for battery-powered electric vehicles, a unified software stack, batteries, mobility, autonomous driving."</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-invest-193-billion-electrification-053333309.html?src=rss
