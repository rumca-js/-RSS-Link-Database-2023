After a long, looooooong development cycle Intel has finally launched their lineup of Sapphire Rapids Xeon Server CPUs. But AMD already has some incredible chips in their Epyc Genoa lineup, which boast up to 96 cores on the highend. How is Intel supposed to compete when they have fewer cores and are running on last gen’s architecture? Accelerators. They hope.
