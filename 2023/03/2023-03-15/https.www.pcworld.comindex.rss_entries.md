## Minecraft is coming to Chromebooks, but it’s tricky to know if yours will work

<p>Microsoft and Mojang are bringing <em>Minecraft</em> to Chromebooks, specifically the Bedrock Edition. Unfortunately, you&rsquo;ll need a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html">rather modern Chromebook</a> to play it, and what <em>that</em> means is going to baffle a number of frustrated parents.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-launching-chromebook&amp;xcust=2-1-1660233-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Mojang said that it doesn&rsquo;t have a release date for the full version of the Minecraft Bedrock Edition on ChromeOS, though the company plans to release updates as close to the timing of other platforms as possible. That means that the version for Chromebooks will include the Trails and Tails update, with its ability to ride camels and other features. Technically, what&rsquo;s being released is an &ldquo;Early Access&rdquo; edition.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Early Access,&rdquo; though, means bugs. Mojang isn&rsquo;t promising that the version of the game released for Chromebooks won&rsquo;t have its own unique glitches, though it&rsquo;s trying to work with early adopters to nail them down before the game&rsquo;s actual release.</p>



<p>Like <em>Skyrim, Minecraft </em>has long been a staple on various gaming platforms, including PCs, consoles and even a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423518/minecraft-pocket-edition-now-lets-windows-10-ios-and-android-gamers-play-together.html">version for mobile devices</a>. However, the game&rsquo;s absence on Chromebooks was a notable gap in its availability. Users will be able to simply visit the Google Play Store and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&amp;pli=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1660233-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">search for the game</a>. (The Chrome OS version will be sold separately, Mojang says.) Once downloaded, players can sign in with their Microsoft account or create a new one.</p>



<p>The catch, if there is one, is that you&rsquo;ll need a fairly modern Chromebook. Today, &ldquo;modern&rdquo; means anything from an Intel Celeron 4500 on up, as defined by Mojang. That&rsquo;s unfortunate, given that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1377179/black-friday-chromebook-deals-what-to-expect-2.html">last year&rsquo;s Black Friday Chromebook deals</a> covered Celeron N4020 and N4120 Chromebooks on the low end &mdash; about $150 or so. Midrange Chromebooks included Pentium Silver N6000s or even Core i3s. </p>



<h2 id="the-minimum-specifications-to-play-minecraft-on-a-chromebook">The minimum specifications to play Minecraft on a Chromebook</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Operating System</strong>: ChromeOS 111</li><li><strong>System Architecture</strong>: 64-bit (x86_64, arm64-v8a)</li><li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Celeron N4500, Intel i3-7130U, Mediatek MT8183, Qualcomm SC7180 or better</li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: 4 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: Minimum of 1 GB game installation, maps, and other files</li></ul>



<p>One big problem? It&rsquo;s not really obvious what&rsquo;s &ldquo;better&rdquo; than the Celeron N4500 that matches the minimum specification. Intel <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/212326/intel-celeron-processor-n4500-4m-cache-up-to-2-80-ghz.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1660233-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">notes</a> that the N4500 was launched in early 2021, so chances are that if you have a Chromebook bought within the last year or so your <em>Minecraft</em> game is covered. But <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1069728/so-long-celeron-pack-it-in-pentium-intel-drops-budget-cpu-labels.html">Intel&rsquo;s decision to <em>drop</em> the Intel Celeron name</a> in 2022, and replace it with just a generic &ldquo;Intel Processor&rdquo; brand, could lead to confusion. </p>



<p>In fact, Intel&rsquo;s scattershot approach to Chromebook naming scheme is going to be thrust into a rather harsh spotlight. Today, Chromebooks are built around the Celeron brand (N3000, N4000, and so on), the Celeron 6000 brand, Pentium Silver brand, the Intel Processor brand, as well as the Core m3 and Core i3 processors. What&rsquo;s better? What qualifies as a <em>Minecraft</em>-capable processor? Why aren&rsquo;t AMD A-series processors included?</p>



<p>For that matter, parents may need to figure out if their MediaTek or Qualcomm processor qualifies, too &mdash; or, if it doesn&rsquo;t, what Chromebook they need to buy instead. Add to this Mojang&rsquo;s qualification that the game&rsquo;s requirements may change over time, and both kids and their parents may be frustrated by how this all plays out during these early days for <em>Minecraft</em> on Chromebooks. </p>

## Don’t use autofill on your password manager—especially if it’s Bitwarden

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Password managers have long offered autofill&mdash;the ability for the service or app to automatically fill in login forms with your user ID and password on saved websites. But the feature carries risk, and for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394731/bitwarden-password-manager-review.html">popular service Bitwarden</a>, the danger is high enough that you should avoid autofill all together.</p>



<p>Generally, security experts advise turning off the most proactive version of autofill, where your credentials automatically get filled in on saved sites. If a website is compromised, a malicious actor can capture your login info before you visually confirm the page looks normal.</p>



<p>But as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://flashpoint.io/blog/bitwarden-password-pilfering/&amp;xcust=2-1-1656351-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">security firm Flashpoint.io detailed in a blog post</a> last week, Bitwarden&rsquo;s autofill has a deeper vulnerability than other services. On websites that use iframes&mdash;where a page loads HTML elements from a different webpage&mdash;login forms hosted on an external website are still filled in with the saved site&rsquo;s user ID and password info. If any of those external HTML elements become compromised (like advertising, a known vector for exploits), the result could be stolen login data.</p>



<p>This permissiveness isn&rsquo;t by accident, but design: In the company&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://cdn.bitwarden.net/misc/Bitwarden%20Security%20Assessment%20Report.pdf&amp;xcust=2-1-1656351-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">documentation about the issue</a>, which was published in late 2018, Bitwarden states that its goal is to encourage better adaption to a password manager. The company gives the example of iCloud as a major website that still uses iframes to connect to apple.com for login.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1656356" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-4.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>iCloud&rsquo;s login page uses iframes to enable login through apple.com&mdash;and Bitwarden cites this as one reason for its lax policy on autofill.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This vulnerability exists whether you have Bitwarden preemptively fill out login forms or you manually trigger autofill; Flashpoint&rsquo;s testing showed that either usage of autofill carries the same risk. Bitwarden also doesn&rsquo;t warn users when they&rsquo;re filling out a form hosted on a different page or site, and gives a free pass to subdomains of a website, too. Meanwhile, other password managers look like safer options, as they remain stricter with their autofill policies. During Flashpoint&rsquo;s spot check of rivals, they only autofilled for the site saved in the vault entry, or at least flashed a warning if an iframe pulled in an external form.</p>



<p>As a password manager user, you can take two major steps to protect yourself from this kind of vulnerability. (And no, the answer isn&rsquo;t to never use a password manager.)</p>



<ul><li>Leave preemptive autofill off. Good services and apps have this disabled by default&mdash;leave it that way for better security.</li><li>Use a service or app that won&rsquo;t autofill forms hosted on external sites, or at the very least, will warn you that you&rsquo;re about to do so.</li></ul>



<p>If you decide to stick with Bitwarden, which is an otherwise reliable service and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">our favorite free password manager</a>, you should also leave off preemptive autofill. But you should take this precaution as well:</p>



<ul><li>Only use manually triggered autofill on sites you can reasonably trust. For example, Apple should have the resources to guard against compromised HTML elements. (If they fail to protect users against this kind of exploit, everyone&rsquo;s in far bigger trouble.)</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Good passwords to use - tips for creating strong passwords" class="wp-image-1441241" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Good-passwords-to-use.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Strong passwords are key for online security&mdash;as is use of a unique one for each site.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Unfortunately, Bitwarden users don&rsquo;t seem able to bypass this autofill issue when copy and pasting login info from the password manager into a form. If an externally hosted form is compromised, it&rsquo;s compromised. So regardless of how you input your login details, you won&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s an internally or externally hosted form&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the issue.</p>

<p>As for official websites that are compromised, nothing can yet protect against that situation. That&rsquo;s why random passwords for each and every site, service, and app are so important&mdash;they keep the damage limited to that one place. And like it or not, the best way to keep track of tens (if not hundreds) of credentials is a password manager. Choose (and use) one judiciously, and you should avoid most trouble.</p>

## Nvidia crushes CPU-gobbling bug with new GeForce driver
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1659646/nvidia-driver-fixes-cpu-woes-and-other-issues.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1659646/nvidia-driver-fixes-cpu-woes-and-other-issues.html)

<p>Typically new graphics drivers are supposed to make your computer go, in the parlance of the common man, <em>faster</em>. But anyone who&rsquo;s been a PC gamer long enough knows this isn&rsquo;t always so. Take the last Game Ready Driver from Nvidia, which had the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1532492/nvidia-confirms-latest-gpu-driver-is-causing-cpu-spikes.html">unintended effect of spiking some users&rsquo; CPUs</a> even after they&rsquo;d closed their games. According to Nvidia representatives, the issue has been patched out in the latest version of the driver, which you can download now. We&rsquo;re already seeing it automatically offered via GeForce Experience.</p>



<p>For the sake of reference, the problem driver was 531.18, released on February 28th, which got an initial hotfix in version 531.26 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1532492/nvidia-confirms-latest-gpu-driver-is-causing-cpu-spikes.html">a week later</a>. The latest update is version <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/200217/en-us/&amp;xcust=2-1-1659646-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">531.29</a>, which takes things a step further by fixing two more recently-discovered glitches: stability issues on some laptops with older GTX graphics cards, and stability for Adobe software from the initial February update. (And since Creative Suite programs aren&rsquo;t the most stable tools at the best of times, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s much appreciated.)</p>



<p>Anything that even marginally slows down your computer tends to get the attention of PC gamers, but this sort of hiccup in gradual driver improvements isn&rsquo;t unusual. AMD recently had a much bigger if less widespread issue, when drivers for its new RX 7900 series of cards <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1529986/rare-amd-radeon-driver-bug-corrupt-windows-fix.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">started blowing up whole Windows installations</a>. Thankfully that, too, was resolved. </p>

<p>Huzzah! It&rsquo;s a momentous occasion! For the first time since the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/447786/microsoft-sole-windows-rt-tablet-vendor-as-dells-xps-10-is-unavailable.html">disastrous Windows RT days</a>, Dell has rejoined the Windows on Arm party. The laptop manufacturer recently unveiled its first <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8200811-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/lp/qualcomm-snapdragon&amp;sid=2-1-1659515-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">laptop with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 processor</a>, and at just $499 it won&rsquo;t break the bank. </p>



<p>Laptops with power-efficient Arm processors tend to have stellar battery life and lightweight, fanless builds. They&rsquo;re designed for people who are always on-the-go. The new <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8200811-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/inspiron-14-laptop/spd/inspiron-14-3420-laptop&amp;sid=2-1-1659515-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Dell Inspiron 14</a> takes much of the same design cues as other Snapdragon-powered laptops. It&rsquo;s thin, fanless, and&mdash;based on the specs and price&mdash;likely a good budget laptop all around.</p>

<p>The Inspiron 14 comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage.

The 14-inch display has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and an aspect ratio of 16:9. The manufacturer even included a spiffy 1080p webcam, which is perfect for videoconferencing calls. The port selection is solid, too. You&rsquo;re getting two USB Type-C ports, one USB Type-A, a microSD card reader, and a headphone jack.</p>

<p>With over two decades of experience under its belt, HostGator has become a household name in the web hosting industry, especially in the Shared Hosting area. HostGator&rsquo;s uptime is unmatched, and the service offers decent features at an affordable price across its various plans. However, the company isn&rsquo;t as transparent about its fees as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1468898/bluehost-web-hosting-review.html">Bluehost</a> or InMotion Hosting.</p>



<h2 id="hostgator-pricing">HostGator: Pricing</h2>



<p>HostGator offers various hosting plans with different features and pricing options to suit various needs and budgets. Like its competitors, it offers a large discount for your first-time payment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the biggest annoyances about how HostGator handles this compared to Bluehost or InMotion Hosting is that it hides the renewal fee. Where the competition is explicit about their pricing on their respective plan pages, HostGator doesn&rsquo;t show the renewal fee until you&rsquo;re at checkout&mdash;and it&rsquo;s in very tiny print.</p>



<p>Regardless of this major flaw, HostGator&rsquo;s pricing is still competitive. It doesn&rsquo;t offer discounts for its one-month and six-month offerings for the Shared Hosting plans, but you can get a nice discount ranging from 60 percent to 73 percent for the one-year and three-year offerings.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of HostGator&rsquo;s pricing and subscription tiers for the Shared Hosting package.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HostGator shared hosting plans" class="wp-image-1533149" height="507" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HostGator-shared-hosting-plans.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="940" /><figcaption>You have to commit to a 12-month or 36-month contract to get an introductory discount on any of HostGator&rsquo;s three Shared Hosting tiers, but the savings is significant.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>



<p>HostGator also offers a Dedicated Server package for those running small- to medium-sized business. The prices are much more expensive than the Shared Hosting plans, but the performance makes it worth it. There are also more flexible subscription plans for Dedicated Server subscribers. These prices are just a starting point, but they can change a bit depending on which operating system and hard drive type you select.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HostGator Dedicated Server plans" class="wp-image-1533155" height="735" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HostGator-dedicated-server-plans.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="961" /><figcaption>Small- to medium -sized businesses will want to consider the Dedicated Server packages.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>



<p>HostGator&rsquo;s Shared Hosting prices are pretty standard, while their Dedicated Server packages may be seen as a bit pricier than the competition&mdash;though it does offer more subscription plans to meet various needs.</p>



<h2 id="hostgator-setup">HostGator: Setup</h2>



<p>HostGator&rsquo;s setup process is about as easy as it gets. HostGator offers a user-friendly control panel that makes it easy to manage your website and hosting account.</p>



<p>In the control panel, or cPanel, you&rsquo;ll find a range of tools and features that you can use to manage your website. These include tools for creating email accounts, installing apps like WordPress, and managing your website&rsquo;s files and databases.</p>



<p>One of the great things about HostGator is that it offers a free website builder that you can use to create your site without any coding experience. This builder is a drag-and-drop tool that makes it easy to create professional-looking websites with little to no experience.</p>



<p>Customer support is always quick to assist you, whether you call or use the live chat service. If you prefer to figure things out yourself, HostGator has some helpful content on getting started, as well as a complete knowledge base that covers any other issues you may be facing. It also offers a decent library of video tutorials, though that hasn&rsquo;t been active for over a year.</p>



<h2 id="hostgator-features">HostGator: Features</h2>



<p>HostGator offers a competitive feature set across even its most basic plans. Regardless of your experience level and needs, HostGator likely has what you need for a reasonable price. Depending on which plan you subscribe to, you can expect things like unmetered bandwidth, free SSL certificates, domain transfers, and more.</p>



<p>As with its pricing pages, though, HostGator makes it difficult to understand what you <em>really</em> get. For example, notice how in the &ldquo;Top features&rdquo; tab on the plan comparison page, it shows the Hatchling Plan as offering &ldquo;Chat Only&rdquo; support. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HostGator Top Features" class="wp-image-1533158" height="741" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hostgators-top-features-tab.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>



<p>But if you switch to the &ldquo;Support&rdquo; tab on the same page, which gives more details about the support the plans offer, it states that you get 24/7 live chat and phone support across each plan, including the Hatchling Plan.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HostGator Support tab" class="wp-image-1533161" height="741" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hostgators-support-tab.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>



<p>These conflicts make things a bit confusing for potential customers, and could dissuade them from using the service all together. But, if you&rsquo;re not deterred by the inconsistencies on the official site, here&rsquo;s what HostGator claims comes with each plan.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Hatchling</strong></td><td><strong>Baby</strong></td><td><strong>Business</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Websites</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>Unlimited</td></tr><tr><td>Parked Domains</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td></tr><tr><td>Subdomains</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td></tr><tr><td>FTP Accounts</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td></tr><tr><td>Bandwidth</td><td>Unmetered</td><td>Unmetered</td><td>Unmetered</td></tr><tr><td>Disk space</td><td>10GB</td><td>40GB</td><td>Unlimited</td></tr><tr><td>Dedicated IP Address</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Available</td></tr><tr><td>MySQL Transfer % Script Transfer</td><td>Available</td><td>Available</td><td>Available</td></tr><tr><td>Email Accounts</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td></tr><tr><td>Cloudflare CDN</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Available</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>These are the features you can expect with each of HostGator&rsquo;s Shared Hosting plans.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each plan also comes with a free domain for the first year, but only if you subscribe to 12 months or more. The Baby plan comes with a $500 Google Ad spend match credit and $100 Microsoft Advertising credit, which is a fantastic deal if you&rsquo;re looking to get the word out about your new site.</p>



<p>Overall, HostGator provides decent features, especially with its Business plan. Hopefully the website will be updated to make things a bit easier to understand what&rsquo;s offered, and at what price.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>HostGator offers a competitive feature set across even its most basic plans. Regardless of your experience level and needs, HostGator likely has what you need for a reasonable price.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="hostgator-backup-and-security">HostGator: Backup and security</h2>



<p>HostGator offers a few options that ensure the safety of your website and its data. One of the primary backup options they provide is CodeGuard, a cloud-based backup solution that takes daily automatic backups of your website&rsquo;s data. CodeGuard also offers features like website monitoring, malware detection, and easy restore options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This feature is essential for businesses, but it&rsquo;s not free. You&rsquo;ll need to fork out between $2.75 to $8.33 per month, depending on which CodeGaurd plan you go with. If this is a bit out of your budget, HostGator also provides weekly backup options for its customers, but this isn&rsquo;t recommended for businesses. These backups are stored on a separate server, which provides added security to your website&rsquo;s data, but it only keeps one backup. Once a new backup is made, the old one is deleted.</p>



<p>HostGator also offers SiteLock, a powerful security tool that helps protect your website from malware and other cyber threats. SiteLock performs daily scans of your website and alerts you in case of any security issues. It also provides a firewall and other security features to prevent attacks on your website. Like the backup offerings, SiteLock isn&rsquo;t free, and you can expect to pay between $5.99 to $24.99 per month, depending on the plan you go with.</p>



<h2 id="hostgator-reliability">HostGator: Reliability</h2>



<p>HostGator guarantees a 99.9 percent uptime for its hosting services, which means that your website will be up and running almost all the time. This level of uptime is essential for businesses or individuals who rely on their website for generating leads, sales, or revenue. Downtime = money lost.</p>



<p>HostGator has multiple data centers located around the U.S., which helps ensure that your website&rsquo;s data is stored securely and that your website is easily accessible to visitors from different regions.</p>



<p>We ran a website hosted by HostGator for roughly 15 months and experienced no major outages and very little downtime. As you would expect running a website on a shared server, there were moments where the site would run slow when we had large spikes of traffic, but this issue can be fixed by using a dedicated server. Overall, HostGator provided a reliable web hosting service with high uptime.</p>



<h2 id="hostgator-customer-support">HostGator: Customer support</h2>



<p>HostGator offers customer support through various channels, including phone, email, and live chat. Its customer support team is available 24/7, which means that you can get help with any issues or questions you may have at any time. If you need immediate help, the live chat service is the way to go.</p>



<p>Confusingly, as mentioned above, it was unclear if phone support was available for Hatchling Plan subscribers, as there is conflicting content on the site. We reached out to Support for confirmation, and they confirmed that phone support is available for all plans.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HostGator phone support" class="wp-image-1533177" height="524" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Phone-support-for-Hatchling-confirmed.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1004" /><figcaption>Confirmation that phone support is available at all levels of Shared Hosting.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>



<p>HostGator also offers a ticketing system where you can submit a support request, and the support team will get back to you within 24 to 48 hours. This ticketing system is helpful for non-urgent issues or if you prefer to communicate via email.</p>



<p>Finally, HostGator provides a fruitful knowledge base with detailed articles and tutorials on various topics related to web hosting. This knowledge base is accessible through the website and can help you troubleshoot common issues or learn more about web hosting.</p>



<p>Overall, HostGator offers comprehensive customer support through various channels, is quick to reply, and is always helpful in providing support, regardless of what you may be struggling with.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-use-hostgator-web-hosting">Should you use HostGator web hosting?</h2>



<p>HostGator is a great choice for hosting your website, offering a range of hosting plans with different pricing options to suit various needs and budgets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pricing is competitive, with discounts available for one-year and three-year offerings. However, one major flaw is that HostGator hides the renewal fee until checkout, unlike its competitors who display it transparently on their pricing pages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HostGator&rsquo;s setup process is user-friendly, with a free website builder, cPanel, and a range of tools and features to manage your website. It offers 24/7 live chat and phone support, with helpful content on getting started and a complete knowledge base that covers any issues you may face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HostGator also offers a competitive feature set, but its presentation of features can be confusing for potential customers. Despite this, HostGator remains a solid choice for those looking for reliable web hosting.</p>

<p>Are you in the market for a ton of M.2 SSD storage, and you don&rsquo;t particularly need it to be so fast that it requires <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504081/gigabytes-newest-ssd-has-a-heatsink-with-its-own-zip-code.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a passive cooler the size of a building</a>? Then let your fingers do the walking over to Amazon, where a third-gen SK Hynix Gold P31 SSD, packing an impressive two terabytes of storage, is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099RHVB42&amp;xcust=2-1-1659401-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">on sale for just $119.99</a>. That&rsquo;s almost $90 off its regular price, a savings of 42 percent. </p>



<p>Third-gen PCIe drives are a little behind the times, now that 4th-gen drives are ubiquitous and insanely fast (and expensive) 5th-gen drives are just starting to appear on the market. But SK Hynix&rsquo;s P31 Gold series is among the best-reviewed options for its category, with high speed and great reliability thanks to its 128-layer NAND storage setup. This would be a fantastic boot or bulk storage drive in any gaming PC. You can read the full PCWorld review, wherein this SSD wins an Editor&rsquo;s Choice, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393364/sk-hynix-gold-p31-ssd-review-the-first-128-layer-nand-drive.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>. </p>



<p>The older-spec&rsquo;d SSD means that in addition to saving money, you can easily use the drive on older PC motherboards and laptops (as long as they can accommodate an 80mm-long M.2 drive). Amazon also has less dramatic discounts on the 1TB (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DKB5LWY&amp;xcust=2-1-1659401-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$108</a>) and 500GB (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DK2FB7G&amp;xcust=2-1-1659401-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$66</a>) versions of this drive, but at this price point there&rsquo;s really no reason not to go for the full 2TB model. </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve never tried Epic&rsquo;s smash hit battle royale for yourself, you might have a few ideas about <em>Fortnite</em>. Such as &ldquo;it&rsquo;s that game that all the kids played on their phones before it got kicked off the App Store,&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s that game that has more crossovers than Funko Pops.&rdquo; Or maybe even &ldquo;it&rsquo;s that free-to-play trash that&rsquo;s everything wrong with PC gaming.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;d be right on two of these points. <em>Fortnite </em>is indeed so ubiquitous that it&rsquo;s shown up in everything from <em>Avengers </em>movies to congressional hearings. But if you&rsquo;ve been avoiding it for that or any other reason, I&rsquo;m here as an old and crusty PC gamer to say: give it a chance. You might be surprised at just how good it is, and how worthy of your attention.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Fortnite </em>is a technical beast&nbsp;</h2>



<p>First of all, <em>Fortnite </em>is a technical heavyweight that can push your custom-built gaming PC to the limit. Or at least, it can be. That might be a surprise to you &mdash; after all, <em>Fortnite</em> is a game so flexible that it runs on phones, and its cartoony graphical style isn&rsquo;t really what comes to mind when you think about hardware-intensive titles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But keep in mind that <em>Fortnite </em>is developed and published by Epic. Epic, the creator and maintainer of the Unreal engine, which is the go-to tool for just about anyone who wants high-end graphics without coding everything by hand. And <em>Fortnite</em>, as the company&rsquo;s most popular user-facing product, is often the test bed for the latest and greatest in graphical fidelity.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Ray tracing? <em>Fortnite </em>does that. Temporal super resolution? <em>Fortnite </em>does that, too. Nanite virtualized geometry? I honestly don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s game tech or something you can do in the engineering deck of the USS Enterprise, but <em>Fortnite</em> does it. <em>Fortnite </em>is also constantly updated with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393484/fortnite-flips-rtx-on-september-17-ray-tracing-dlss-and-nvidia-reflex.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">compatibility for Nvidia DLSS</a>, so you can give all this eye candy a try even if you&rsquo;re not rocking the latest hardware.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Fortnite </em>recently got <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.fortnite.com/news/drop-into-the-next-generation-of-fortnite-battle-royale-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-1&amp;xcust=2-1-1657300-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a pretty massive Unreal 5-powered visual overhaul</a> that made even some long-time players balk, as their framerates dipped before they had to make adjustments. Oh, and yes, if you&rsquo;re all about testing and tweaking, <em>Fortnite </em>will give you your framerate without needing an external tool. On my 1440p ultrawide, even with an RTX 3070, I have to push things firmly on the low side of medium to hit 120 frames per second.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Fortnite real-time ray tracing demo" class="wp-image-1657540" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fortnite-unreal-engine-5-1-screenshot-2-1920x1080-4a60783b91fa.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Epic</p></div>



<p>My PC can&rsquo;t handle the highest settings at full resolution, but when I scale it down mercifully to 1080p, it still dips into the teens. Rest assured, no matter how much money you&rsquo;ve put into your gaming hardware, this free game can give it a workout.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Fortnite </em>is always changing&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As a live service game, <em>Fortnite </em>lives and dies on novelty. And Epic delivers it, to a slavish degree (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://kotaku.com/report-fortnite-developers-are-severely-overworked-1834243520#:~:text=Crunch%20is%20a%20widespread%20disease,on%20an%20over%2Dambitious%20timeline.&amp;xcust=2-1-1657300-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">possibly in a very literal sense</a>). Every few weeks the battle royale map will get some kind of major shakeup, and the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Seasons&rdquo; introduce whole new areas and game elements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take the latest season, which just started &mdash; and now&rsquo;s an excellent time to check it out, while everyone is adapting to all the new elements. Chapter 4, Season 2 dropped a clearly <em>Cyberpunk</em>-inspired near-future city on the map, complete with tweaker cars and <em>Akira </em>bikes, giant grind rails a la <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/30/22255318/cyberpunk-2077-genre-xenophobia-orientalism&amp;xcust=2-1-1657300-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">problematic Asian exoticism</a>, just like a real cyberpunk game!&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Big or small, each refresh brings different weapons and traversal tools into rotation. You might log in one day to find that everyone&rsquo;s firing kamehameha blasts from <em>DragonBall Z</em>, or zipping around the map with grappling hooks. The last season had a gun that shot holographic swords which exploded on impact, as well as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2aTuxBwoKo&amp;xcust=2-1-1657300-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a <em>Clash of the Titans</em>-style robot bird</a> that you could manually fly around and scout for enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not just tools for fighting other players. The map is littered with colorful NPCs, some of which will sell you rare items, some of which will join you as an AI mercenary. And each season usually has at least one big boss surprise, sometimes a licensed character like Darth Vader (who drops his lightsaber for you to use if you can beat him), and sometimes an original quest.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Previous seasons have featured James Bond-style supervillain hideouts and surprisingly deep stories, told in the form of achievement hunts that happen around and during the 100-person primary battle royale mode. Some of these merely advance the story of <em>Fortnite </em>itself (which is both shockingly complex and entirely forgettable), while others get you unique rewards, like a skin for Geralt of <em>The Witcher</em> fame.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The point is, there&rsquo;s always something new to try. Even if you&rsquo;re not a fan of whatever pop culture tie-in the game is pushing this month, odds are pretty good you&rsquo;ll find a weapon or a special item that really clicks with your playstyle. And then lament its loss when it disappears in a month or two&hellip;but by then you&rsquo;ll have a new one to play with, and so on. </p>



<h2><em>Fortnite </em>is how a live service game should be&nbsp;</h2>



<p>&ldquo;Live service&rdquo; is fast becoming an obscene term in the gaming world. For example, when <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-gameplay-state-of-play&amp;xcust=2-1-1657300-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">preview footage of the new <em>Suicide Squad </em>game</a> resembled the loot and stat grind of live service games that have come before, like Square Enix&rsquo;s <em>Avengers </em>and <em>Destiny</em>, there was a collective groan heard through both the media and gamers alike. The market is saturated with games that want you to play them religiously to unlock every new bit of content, and we&rsquo;re sick of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Fortnite</em> is, perhaps, the one exception. There&rsquo;s a reason it remains as popular today as when the battle royale mode that would define it was introduced six years ago. And that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a live service done right. Not only is the content fresh and ever-evolving, but the free-to-play aspect is also handled with shocking tact and fairness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <em>Fortnite</em>, it&rsquo;s impossible to pay for a strategic advantage in the main game. Every player starts out every round with nothing, dropped onto a spot of the map of their choosing, and must find weapons, healing, and tools to get to the end of the round. You can&rsquo;t pay for any kind of edge, even if you drop a thousand bucks into the latest battle pass to zoom to the ending on the first day. In the parlance of online multiplayer, there is absolutely no pay to win.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Fortnite kid laroi" class="wp-image-1657467" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fortnite-store-kid-laroi.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, I have no idea what the hell this is. But I also don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m old, or because someone paid Epic for a bad commercial. That you have to pay for.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Epic</p></div>



<p>Which is not to say that <em>Fortnite&rsquo;s </em>free-to-play model doesn&rsquo;t have its fair share of BS. The skins are, frankly, ridiculously expensive. A basic outfit on top of one of the default models costs eight bucks, and you&rsquo;re looking at $15-25 if you want one of those really elaborate skins or a licensed character like Goku and all the trimmings. That&rsquo;s mentioning nothing about the frequent appearances of blatant marketing ploys &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know who &ldquo;Kid Laroi&rdquo; is, but I know Epic&rsquo;s getting a lot of money to put him in the Fortnite store so that kids can <em>give Epic even more money</em> to look like him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all that is, frankly, old man gamer talk. What&rsquo;s so well-implemented about <em>Fortnite&rsquo;s </em>free-to-play model is its Battle Pass. &ldquo;Battle Pass&rdquo; is another phrase that&rsquo;s been demonized as it&rsquo;s been overused in live service games, but <em>Fortnite&rsquo;s</em> is amazingly generous in context. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.fortnite.com/battle-pass&amp;xcust=2-1-1657300-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">For under $10</a> (translated into the game&rsquo;s proprietary V-Bucks currency) you get approximately 100 levels to unlock, each one coming with a cosmetic goodie. Each Battle Pass includes a handful of skins, some of which are pretty darn good in terms of design or fun factor, even if they do skew towards the game&rsquo;s teenage primary player base.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Fortnite skin cat on motorcycle" class="wp-image-1657457" height="559" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fortnite-cat-motorcycle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>My favorite skin, this cat riding a junk robot complete with Clash of the Titans robo owl glider and custom emote, was all included in the $10 Battle Pass.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Epic</p></div>



<p>And here&rsquo;s the kicker: Going through the levels of the Battle Pass periodically gives you more V-Bucks. If you get to the end of the level progression, which is fairly easy over the course of a 10-12-week Season, you&rsquo;ve earned enough digital currency to buy <em>the next Season&rsquo;s Battle Pass.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So if you go through each Battle Pass as it&rsquo;s released, and resist the urge to blow your V-Bucks in the skin store, then you&rsquo;ll never have to pay any more money to get a shocking amount of cosmetic content for your <em>Fortnite</em> account. Alternately, if this Season&rsquo;s rewards don&rsquo;t look particularly enticing to you, you can skip it and wait for the next one &mdash; you&rsquo;ve lost nothing in terms of competitive advantage and you can still get even more freebies via the side-quests.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Fortnite v-bucks" class="wp-image-1657474" height="578" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/v-bucks-battle-pass.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Epic</p></div>



<p>This is how live service games should be monetized: No gameplay pressure to spend money, tons of rewards when you do, and the ability to roll over your winnings into the next promotional period. Developers hoping to ape <em>Fortnite</em>&lsquo;s success &mdash; you poor, poor fools &mdash; take note.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="fortnite-is-a-pretty-damn-good-game">Fortnite is a pretty damn good game&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Okay, this is probably the most subjective point I&rsquo;m going to make today. But <em>Fortnite</em>&lsquo;s core gameplay loop is, yes, a pretty good one. With the qualifier that the basic concept is blatantly stolen from <em>PlayerUnknown&rsquo;s Battlegrounds</em> (which itself is essentially a spruced-up version of the developer&rsquo;s custom game mod for <em>DayZ</em>, which is itself a game mod for <em>Arma 2</em>&hellip;to say nothing of the conceptual inspiration from Koushun Takami&rsquo;s original <em>Battle Royale </em>novel&hellip;wow this goes back a long way!), it&rsquo;s still a shockingly effective way to expand a multiplayer shooter to a huge scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last player standing nature of battle royale, the huge map that gradually shrinks as players eliminate each other, the varied methods for crossing terrain and hiding, engaging, or retreating, it all <em>works </em>so stupendously well. It&rsquo;s a great way to make a multiplayer game feel big, without resorting to the constant die, respawn, die again chaos of, say, <em>Battlefield&rsquo;s </em>40 vs. 40 mode.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Fortnite screenshot: hay stack sneaky" class="wp-image-1657530" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fortnite_blog_photography-blog_pic2-1600x900-775a0694cc0b0f854ef48399ebc33a2db0bac25c.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Epic</p></div>



<p>The combination of a huge map with varied terrain and a huge amount of weapons and tools means that there are almost always multiple ways to engage your enemies. Sneak around in hiding spots waiting for ambushes or long-range sniping. Load up on shotguns and SMGs and hire an AI companion to maximize your close-up offense. Go for exotic weapons and power-ups to get dramatic kills (and often blow yourself up by accident). Or simply stick to the classics, focusing on mobility and medium-range firepower to be an effective all-rounder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The structure of the battle royale setup has some distinct advantages. Since there&rsquo;s only one &ldquo;winner&rdquo; each round out of 90-100 players, a loss &mdash; which will happen more often than not &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t sting as much. Surviving past the initial 50 players is fairly easy, unless you intentionally seek out hot zones immediately, and getting in the top 25 isn&rsquo;t that hard once you get a handle on the game&rsquo;s core mechanics like traversal and healing. And all the while you&rsquo;re building up experience for new unlocks, especially if you&rsquo;re focusing on quests and achievements, which are many and varied.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And <em>Fortnite</em> has become much more accessible in the last year, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cbr.com/zero-build-mode-game-changer-fortnite/&amp;xcust=2-1-1657300-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thanks to &ldquo;Zero Build Mode.&rdquo;</a> This much-requested version of the game is identical to the battle royale that&rsquo;s been running for years, but removes the instant building mechanics, which are a stumbling block for some new players. (That&rsquo;s especially true of old, creaky gamers like me, who can&rsquo;t wrap their head around both <em>Minecraft</em>-style building and <em>PUBG</em>-style shooting at the same time.) I&rsquo;ve come to think of it as &ldquo;old people mode,&rdquo; and I play it almost exclusively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In short it&rsquo;s a damn good game, and only getting better as Epic continues to rely on it as the tentpole of the Epic Games Store. If you&rsquo;ve been ignoring it, you have plenty of reasons to give the free shooter a try. After all, 350 million players can&rsquo;t be wrong, even if most of them can&rsquo;t buy their own beer.&nbsp;</p>

## Just one thing keeps me from switching to a Chromebook

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Dear Chromebooks: I want to love you. I really do. I get along great with your corporate siblings, Chrome on Windows and Android on my phone. We can work all day together without any issues. I see and respect the work that you&rsquo;ve been doing on yourself for the last few years. Great job on the self-care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there&rsquo;s one thing that keeps coming between us, one thing that makes me keep coming back to your <em>Mean Girls</em> rival each and every time I try to switch to your simpler, (mostly) open source OS and your affordable hardware. It&rsquo;s not you, Chromebooks, it&rsquo;s Photoshop.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="a-string-of-failed-flings">A string of failed flings&nbsp;</h2>



<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Google&rsquo;s desktop operating system ever since it launched in one form or another, and I always seem to have at least one Chrome-powered laptop or tablet around to keep fresh on it. And for all that time, I&rsquo;ve been desperate to get Photoshop on it in some way, shape, or form. As a tech reporter and reviewer, I need a powerful image editor as part of my daily workflow, either for whipping up a quick header image (like the one you see at the top of this article) or for cleaning a bunch of review photos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I should point out that it&rsquo;s very specifically <em>Photoshop</em>, and not just, say, a competent image editor, that I crave. I&rsquo;ve been using Adobe&rsquo;s visual tools for over twenty years, ever since Desktop Publishing class in high school, and I&rsquo;m very fast and efficient with Photoshop&rsquo;s suite of editing tools in particular. Anyone who&rsquo;s memorized a complex set of keyboard shortcuts, only to find that they&rsquo;ve all moved around in a competing program, knows what I&rsquo;m talking about.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="web-based-wanderings">Web-based wanderings</h2>



<p>As for getting it on ChromeOS, this need has manifested in a few ways. The easiest and the one I tend to fall back on if put into a corner is sending in the clones. There are several web-based image editors that attempt to ape Photoshop&rsquo;s functionality to a greater or lesser extent and which work great as web apps on a Chromebook. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.photopea.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1654136-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">My go-to is Photopea</a>, which isn&rsquo;t shy at all about its aspirations of being a web-based Photoshop.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Photopea web-based image editor" class="wp-image-1654161" height="758" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/photopea.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>And don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Photopea is pretty much as good as it can be. While it lacks some of Photoshop&rsquo;s more powerful, CPU- and GPU-intensive tools, those aren&rsquo;t really necessary for my work. I&rsquo;d be happy to recommend it to anyone who needs a few tweaks on occasion, on just about any platform&mdash;it&rsquo;ll probably even work on a tablet if you&rsquo;re desperate. The ads are rather large and annoying, but you can get rid of them for a lot less than a Creative Suite subscription. </p>



<p>But being web-based, it still requires me to upload photos in a cumbersome file explorer, rather than grabbing them directly off the desktop or (even better) copy-and-pasting them into a canvas for instant satisfaction. Since it&rsquo;s also running in the Chrome browser, my beloved keyboard shortcuts have to be shared across both browser and image editor functions, causing even more headaches.&nbsp;I search on. </p>



<h2 id="emulation-frustration">Emulation frustration</h2>



<p>One of the other options I tried is running the Photoshop Windows program in an emulator. This might not be an option on some Chromebooks, particularly budget models and those based on ARM hardware, but anything rocking a Core i3 processor or similar should at least be able to try <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/432583/how-to-run-windows-software-in-linux-everything-you-need-to-know.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">running Windows apps using Chrome&rsquo;s Linux powers and WINE</a> or the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/410814/hands-on-using-crossover-android-to-run-windows-apps-on-a-chromebook.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Android-based CrossOver</a>.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s fine if you want, say, a basic text editor or an old copy of <em>Space Cadet Pinball</em>. But Photoshop is a beast of a desktop program, even when it&rsquo;s running natively. When you try this kind of workaround, headaches begin immediately. My go-to Photoshop version is Creative Suite 6, which is now over a decade old. I&rsquo;m using such dusty software because 1) it still has all the features I need and then some and 2) I&rsquo;m too cheap to pay every damn month for Creative Cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But getting CS6 to run in CrossOver is, if you will forgive the dense technical jargon of my profession, a <em>bugger</em>. I&rsquo;ve tried several times on Chromebooks that should be more than up to the task and something always seems to trip it up. On the rare occasions that I can get past Adobe&rsquo;s intentionally labyrinthine license verification process, the app just crashes.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Photoshop CS2 installation screen" class="wp-image-1654172" height="858" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3513222372.webp" width="1020" /><figcaption><p>Did you know you can download and run Adobe Creative Suite 2 for free, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://adobe-creative-suite-2-cs2.en.softonic.com/?ex=DINS-635.0&amp;xcust=2-1-1654136-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">more or less legally? </a>Not on ChromeOS, but still, pretty cool.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://adobe-creative-suite-2-cs2.en.softonic.com/?ex=DINS-635.0&amp;xcust=2-1-1654136-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Softonic</a></div>



<p>I have an even older version of Photoshop sitting around for emergencies, Creative Suite 2. (Because Adobe no longer operates the licensing servers for this software, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/adobe-releases-creative-suite-2-for-free/&amp;xcust=2-1-1654136-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can get a full, authentic copy of it</a> and run it without verification even if, <em>ahem</em>, you forgot where you put your receipt.) And CS2 <em>does </em>run in WINE on a Chromebook&hellip;but the nearly 20-year-old software assumes that you&rsquo;re using it on a CRT monitor with about as much resolution as an Apple Watch. As a result, the interface is so tiny that I couldn&rsquo;t use it even if I hadn&rsquo;t ruined my eyes with decades of video games.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Adobe Photoshop for iPad " class="wp-image-1654202" height="863" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/artboard_4create-open-psds.png.img_.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>&ldquo;Want real, powerful Photoshop for iPad? There&rsquo;s an app for that. Want it for ChromeOS or Android? Too friggin&rsquo; bad!&rdquo; -Adobe</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adobe</p></div>



<p>I&rsquo;ve even tried a less conventional alternative: Android. All new Chromebooks run Android apps from the Google Play Store and there are plenty of Photoshop apps for Android. Except, well, <em>Photoshop.</em> While <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/678517/how-to-get-photoshop-on-ipad.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">iPads get access to a sort-of full version of Photoshop</a> (mainly meant for use with an iPad Pro and an Apple Pencil), <a href="https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:2-1-1654136-1-0-0/destination:https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-touch/photoshop-touch-announcement.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Adobe gave up</a> trying to make a full version of its image editor for Android years ago and hasn&rsquo;t come back. Now all the apps named &ldquo;Photoshop&rdquo; in the Play Store are fiddly little nothings, more interested in filtering selfies than actually editing anything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact that Adobe makes Photoshop for a tablet, ostensibly a media consumption device, and not a full desktop operating system with more users than MacOS, makes me angry. Defeated again, I tried less savory options.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="land-of-the-linux-hippies">Land of the Linux hippies&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you make the mistake of letting an avid Linux user corner you, you&rsquo;ll discover that there are a wide variety of powerful image editors available outside the world of Windows and Mac. If you&rsquo;ve ever searched for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/551303/5-free-alternatives-to-photoshop-for-windows.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a Photoshop alternative that&rsquo;s less expensive than the average car payment</a>, you might have even heard of them. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gimp.org/&amp;xcust=2-1-1654136-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">GIMP</a>, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, is the go-to option and the Linux version can run on Chrome OS natively.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I found that GIMP&rsquo;s interface is as cumbersome as its name is distasteful. And that&rsquo;s saying something, given that Photoshop&rsquo;s interface isn&rsquo;t exactly user-friendly after 35 years of active development. There are options for making GIMP more accessible to long-time Photoshop junkies, but that&rsquo;s adding more and more steps between me and just being able to use a Chromebook as my main work machine.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="GIMP image editor" class="wp-image-1654195" height="666" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GIMP-image-editor.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Alas, every other Linux alternative I found ran into similar problems. Some were far too basic, being passion projects for Linux developers and fans more than true alternatives to commercial software. Some were too focused on photography, lacking the nitty-gritty raster editing I needed for fast header images. And some were just annoying, lacking specific tools that I&rsquo;d come to rely on or the option to adjust those oh-so-important keyboard shortcuts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point, I must confess, I&rsquo;m being fussy. If I really buckled down and broke my reliance on Photoshop, something that both I and Adobe desperately deserve, I&rsquo;d be in a much better position for it. I&rsquo;d be able to try out a host of free and cheap software, and I wouldn&rsquo;t find myself tied to both Photoshop and Windows hardware just to get through my average workday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I can&rsquo;t, so here I am, cutting myself off from a wonderful slice of the laptop market and coming back to Lenovo for a new Thinkpad every few years. Dammit.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="hope-on-the-horizon">Hope on the horizon</h2>



<p>There&rsquo;s some hope on the horizon. While still maddeningly refusing to make a version of full version of Photoshop for either the Play Store (Android) or the Chrome Web Store, Adobe <em>has </em>made one that can run in the browser. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/547474/adobe-photoshop-is-finally-available-on-the-web-and-on-chromebooks.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The web-based Photoshop</a> is still in beta a year and a half after being introduced and it&rsquo;s still locked behind an expensive monthly Creative Cloud subscription.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve tried the web version of Photoshop on Chromebooks. It runs into some of the same problems that Photopea does. It wants you to load images via Adobe&rsquo;s maddeningly slow online library system instead of simply grabbing them from a local file. And, while it&rsquo;s better than a basic free image editor, it&rsquo;s still missing some of the basic editor tools that even Photopea has nailed down by now.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Photoshop und Illustrator bekommen Web-Versionen." class="wp-image-990124" src="https://bilder.macwelt.de/4317803_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adobe</p></div>



<p>There are rumblings of Adobe <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/785453/web-based-photoshop-will-soon-be-free-for-everyone.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">making this web-based version of Photoshop free for everyone</a>. Those rumblings are going on a year old at this point, so I&rsquo;ve stopped holding my breath. I get the feeling that someone at Adobe got terrified of simply making something that millions of people want and can easily use, and retreated back into their comfy pillow fort made out of giant stacks of cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I suppose I could always wait for Google to make a Photoshop alternative, which would be an excellent addition to its Google Docs suite and run great on ChromeOS&hellip; but then I&rsquo;d just be <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338418/rip-stadia-google-gives-up-its-game-streaming-ghost.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">waiting for it to land in the Google Graveyard</a>. It&rsquo;s a cliche for a reason, after all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I&rsquo;m sorry, ChromeOS. You&rsquo;ve got a lovely, streamlined interface and some wonderful hardware (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431799/framework-laptop-chromebook-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">like that new Framwork Chromebook</a>) that can last for a full workday without breaking a sweat. But for this one failing&mdash;much more mine and Adobe&rsquo;s than yours&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d make a great team. In the meantime, I <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">wonder what the latest ThinkPads look like</a>&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
