## Karim Benzema seals inevitable Real Madrid win against limp Liverpool

<p></p><p>“On the good side of history,” said the banner stretching across the south end of the Santiago Bernabéu, yet this place built on epic tales did not need one here. Instead, Real Madrid reasserted their status with a calm authority, refusing to allow a rebellion, let alone a comeback. That is <em>their</em> thing, after all. That Liverpool are out of the Champions League is no surprise after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/21/liverpool-real-madrid-champions-league-last-16-match-report">5-2 defeat at Anfield</a>; what might be a surprise is that they never really looked like avoiding that fate, or inflicting any real suffering upon this stadium.</p><p>A game that needed lots of goals got just one, and it was Madrid’s. It was scored by Karim Benzema and although it ended this tie, the truth is it had already felt over. When Liverpool needed to go up through the gears they were unable to do so. They required three goals but had not managed a shot on target in the second half and so it ended.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/15/real-madrid-liverpool-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Zachary Levi returns as the hapless, self-involved crime-fighter in a zesty sequel that, though funny, doesn’t entirely shatter the superhero-movie template </p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/23/shazam-review-zachary-levi-dc-comics-universe">The first Shazam movie from 2019</a> was praised for its lighter, brighter worldview, its Gen-Z brio and for being generally unencumbered by the portentous and spurious gloom of earlier DC films. This is true of this sequel too, only it’s hard not to notice that it could simply be fitting into another boilerplate model (there’s a cheeky gag about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-avengers">The Avengers</a>). A group of superheroes, all with cartoony character traits and a sprinkling of funny lines, wind up battling an intergalactic invasive menace, culminating in the usual spectacular but unserious CGI urban apocalypse, with people saying things like: “This ends tonight!”</p><p>Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel, is the teen kid in Philadelphia living with foster parents and foster siblings, who with the cry of “Shazam!” has the ability to transform himself into a clean-cut but anxious superhero whose impostor syndrome worries are not helped by the fact that he often makes an awful mess of crime-fighting. He is played by Zachary Levi with the chiselled look of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/19/mad-men-at-15-how-the-genius-advertising-drama-foresaw-the-death-of-the-american-dream">Mad Men’s Don Draper</a>. With him is disabled friend Freddy Freeman, played by Jack Dylan Grazer, who like all the kids has a superhero alter ego: his is smirkingly self-aware Captain Everypower (Adam Brody). Interestingly, it is Freddy who appears almost always as his vulnerable non-superhero teen self and so upstages Billy/Shazam.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/15/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review-second-dose-of-dcs-imposter-syndrome-superhero">Continue reading...</a>

An abundance of quality, yes, but also a mental moxie that his teammates must find awe-inspiring.</p><p>Faced with uncertainty, with 262 alleged breaches of Football Association betting rules, with the prospect of an enforced absence during his peak, Toney continues to excel. A first-half tap-in was his 16th league goal of the campaign. An injury-time assist followed, substitute Yoane Wissa ensuring Brentford and Southampton were split.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/15/southampton-brentford-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Brighton edge past Crystal Palace thanks to Solly March’s early strike

<p>Beware the Ides of March. Solly March that is. On the eve of Gareth Southgate naming his England squad for the Euro 2024 qualifiers against Italy and Ukraine, the 28-year-old’s seventh goal of the season finally ended Brighton’s four-year wait for a victory against their bitter rivals that leaves Crystal Palace still winless in 2023 and hovering precariously close to the relegation zone.</p><p>From the moment that Patrick Vieira was forced to hand teenager Joe Whitworth his debut in goal, the Palace manager may have suspected it was not going to be his evening. But while Whitworth pulled off several excellent saves to keep the visitors in with a fighting chance until the end, there was no hiding the growing chasm between them and Roberto De Zerbi’s side, who now find themselves level on points with Liverpool in sixth place with a game in hand. Having spent 73 days in 12th spot but now only three points clear of the bottom three, Palace clearly have other concerns to deal with.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/15/brighton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ireland’s fly-half can make Six Nations history against England but his old Leinster teammate says he is already a great</p><p>At some stage on Saturday Johnny Sexton will gaze up at the posts at the Aviva Stadium and all will fall quiet. He will take his time but the outcome will be almost preordained. One more successful kick and Ireland’s fly-half will become the leading all-time Six Nations points-scorer. A little shuffle, a thump of his white-booted right foot and another slice of history will be secured.</p><p>The key to understanding what makes Sexton tick, though, is what happens next. There will be no grandstanding or outward gush of emotion at passing Ronan O’Gara’s old record of 557 points. Because what really drives him, even at the age of 37, is something subtly different “His drive is not for perfection, it’s for success,” says Gordon D’Arcy, his former Leinster and Ireland teammate. “It’s not always about excellence because everybody’s bar is different.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/15/gordon-darcy-johnny-sextons-rugby-iq-is-off-the-charts-and-sets-him-aside">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jeremy Hunt’s politics were made clear by his decision to prioritise motorists over nurses, doctors and teachers</p><p>Jeremy Hunt’s budget <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-jeremy-hunt-says-uk-will-avoid-recession-this-year" title="">speech</a> was revealing not for what he said but for what he did not say. Missing from his <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/spring-budget-2023-speech" title="">peroration</a> was that household income will fall by the largest amount over the next two years since records began. Or that house prices will fall by a tenth. The chancellor skated over these figures to paint a rosy picture of a nation that, since 2010, has been the envy of the developed world. With the economy shrinking this year, voters are entitled to ask what planet Mr Hunt is living on. If such a heavenly body existed, it would surely be called austerity.</p><p>Mr Hunt thinks that by cutting the state’s budget, debts and deficits, he will restore the economy’s competitiveness through reducing <a href="https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/OBR-EFO-March-2023_Web_Accessible.pdf" title="">wages, prices and public spending</a>. So unpopular is the policy that it dared not speak its name for the last five years. Yet the chancellor thinks the public are going to back the Tories because the books could be <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1142902/Web_accessible_Budget_2023.pdf" title="">balanced</a> in 2026. Voters are being asked to prioritise an abstract idea over their wage packets and weekly shops, when both are being squeezed. Good luck with that, as the <a href="https://sotn.newstatesman.com/2023/03/stop-boats-save-rishi-sunak" title="">pollsters</a> might say.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/15/the-guardian-view-on-a-tory-budget-austerity-by-another-name">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Un-retired jockey has intriguing Festival booking on Fury Road, reuniting him with former employer Michael O’Leary</p><p>Not too long after his sudden retirement from race-riding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/18/tiger-roll-gold-cup-jockey-davy-russell-retires-horse-racing">at Thurles in December</a>, Davy Russell agreed to an interview with Joe Molloy from the Irish radio station Newstalk. A good talker sitting down with an even better listener, it was always going to make for an interesting chat.

At 43 years of age and having already defied expectations by returning from a broken neck sustained in a heavy fall at Limerick three years ago, the impression given was that this weight room elder saw no point in pushing his luck.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/15/davy-russell-readies-two-live-tilts-adding-cheltenham-festival-win-tally-horse-racing">Continue reading...</a>

## Beware Hunt’s hype. There’s more poverty ahead and his budget did nothing to change that | Aditya Chakrabortty

<p>The statement will be remembered for the childcare pledge,  but there was nothing to meet the scale of Britain’s economic malaise</p><p>I have spent more than 25 years covering budgets, because someone had to, and have learned one golden rule: for all the huff and puff, the ready reckoners and those blessed fan charts, most of what’s said evaporates from the public consciousness by the weekend. Out of all Jeremy Hunt’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-key-points">promises today</a>, only one will linger in the electorate’s memory: providing working parents with 30 hours of free childcare during term time for their babies and toddlers.</p><p>Not that you’d know. The chancellor gave it only brief airtime and got far more excited at the idea of building “12 potential Canary Wharfs”. But that’s the only policy guaranteed to light up WhatsApp groups this evening and perhaps to be remembered by many voters at the ballot box. It is also, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, the measure that will do <a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/investments/2023/03/15/obr-says-childcare-budget-reforms-add-0-2-to-gdp/">most to boost the economy</a> – more than the much costlier giveaways to business. The pledge is shot through with more holes than Clint Eastwood’s cowboy hat, as we shall see, but it also contains important clues for how politics will play out between now and the next election.</p><p>Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist and senior economics commentator.

<p><strong>Belgrade theatre, Coventry<br /></strong>Mojisola Adebayo’s play connects Henrietta Lacks, whose cells were used in decades of vital scientific research, with the Black Lives Matter movement<br /></p><p>‘I am a farm,” says Henrietta Lacks in Mojisola Adebayo’s play about one of medical history’s most inconvenient truths. It is a twin statement of astonishment and outrage. Astonishment because the cells removed from Henrietta’s cancerous body in the early 1950s went on to be used in everything from chemotherapy to IVF, from a treatment for polio to the fight against Covid. Outrage because those cells were taken without her knowledge, let alone her approval – and certainly not to her financial benefit. She might have been a farm, but she was not the farmer.</p><p>The story was told brilliantly in 2013 by <a href="https://www.alledinburghtheatre.com/review-hela-summerhall-fringe/">Adura Onashile in HeLa</a>, a play that was equally disturbed by the exploitative treatment of this black patient by the white establishment. A decade later, Adebayo’s Family Tree is able to make connections to Black Lives Matter and the effect of the pandemic on black workers in the NHS. She also brings in the 19th-century gynaecological experiments on slave women by Dr James Marion Sims. A grim pattern emerges, even as Henrietta’s cells bring new life.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.belgrade.co.uk/events/family-tree/">Belgrade theatre, Coventry</a>, until 18 March, then touring until 17 June.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/15/family-tree-review-study-of-the-mother-of-modern-medicine-falls-between-poetry-and-play">Continue reading...</a>

## Paula Yates was the other Diana: hounded by the press for being herself | Zoe Williams

<p>A new documentary reveals how the tabloids turned on their one-time darling – for daring to be a woman who didn’t shun the spotlight</p><p>There’s a story about Paula Yates bumping into Diana, Princess of Wales that Yates’s friend Belinda Brewin recollects in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/13/paula-review-a-glorious-celebration-of-paula-yates-the-most-witty-flirty-woman-to-ever-grace-our-tvs">documentary Paula</a> this week. The People’s Princess turned to Little Miss Hypocrite (I’m selecting two of their tabloid epithets from a smörgåsbord) and said: “I love it when you’re on the front page of the papers because it means I’ve got the day off.” Yates was the Diana of the dark timeline: two epoch-making blondes, one bottle, the other natural; one bawdy, the other demure; one flirtatious, the other innocent; one outspoken, the other reserved; a classic whore and madonna dyad. Perhaps neither one would have been as relentlessly surveilled and scrutinised without the counterpoise of the other, but we can never know, because as a direct or indirect result of that surveillance and scrutiny, by the turn of the century both were dead.</p><p>Billed as a documentary about the rise and fall of Paula Yates, centred on her testimony to the journalist Martin Townsend, which has never been heard before, this is, as is so often the case with rise-and-fall narratives, really a story about the British media. Her life story – tragically cut short in 2000, three years after the death by suicide of Michael Hutchence – is typically characterised as a sad one, but at the end of Paula I didn’t feel sad, I felt really angry. This emotion is the only respectful homage to a woman who, with her charisma, biting wit, trashy innuendo – demonic, lithe, ferret-like – redrew the limits of what femininity was supposed to look like. She wouldn’t want you to pity her; she would want you to be furious.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.ie">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

Our daughter was born with a brain abnormality in her occipital lobe that left her with visuospatial deficits that affect her to this day, 30 years later. We feel lucky that her neurological condition was identified during the perinatal period, so we were able to access assessment and remediation from an early age.</p><p>Brain damage incurred during prenatal and early childhood development is often underestimated and can remain unrecognised until problems become apparent in adolescence or young adulthood.

Yes, he says, with the aid of a dusty old drum kit, 40 musicians – and a novelty animal costume</p><p>It started off, as many great creative undertakings do, as a joke. A few years ago, James Acaster’s parents gave him an ultimatum: collect your old dust-lagged drum kit from our house or we’ll throw it out. Not long before, Louis Theroux’s company had contacted the comedian to ask if he had any documentary ideas. Acaster, who spent his youth playing in bands before becoming a comedian, had a brainwave: how about, instead of a straight-faced doc, he made a mockumentary about himself pivoting “very pompously” from celebrated standup to Serious Musician?</p><p>The film would begin with the Kettering native swearing off comedy at his “last gig ever” before driving home to pick up his drums. Then he would start on his magnum opus, laying down some beats in the studio while staring down a gigantic cuddly alligator in a pink top hat (more on him later) as his worried manager, played by comedian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/17/standup-john-kearns-interview-the-varnishing-days">John Kearns</a>, looked on. Eventually, deciding his work wasn’t up to scratch, he would call in esteemed drummer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/seb-rochford">Seb Rochford</a> to play over the recording, allowing the comedian to pass it off as his own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/15/james-acaster-interview-experimental-music">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge</strong><br />The Austrian potter made a new life – and astonishing new work – in the UK after fleeing the Nazis. What a shame it must be seen behind glass</p><p>To look at a Lucie Rie ceramic is to see a new beginning; in every glaze, shape and incision is the search for a fresh perspective. Rie once said: “To make pottery is an adventure to me, every new work is a new beginning.” Over her 60-year career, Rie kept finding novel ways to experiment with aesthetics and form. That quote is the inspiration for the title of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/12/lucie-rie-the-adventure-of-pottery-kettles-yard-cambridge-review-peter-doig-courtauld-gallery-london">Lucie Rie: the Adventure of Pottery</a>, at Kettle’s Yard, and with more than 100 of Rie’s pieces it fully exemplifies how her commitment to beginnings ensured her body of work was always evolving.</p><p>Starting anew was not just a creative endeavour but a personal one. Rie had to begin again when she arrived in London in 1938 from Vienna, fleeing the Nazi persecution of the Jews. Despite being a successful ceramicist in Austria, the 36-year-old was unknown in Britain and her style differed from that of <a href="https://www.leachpottery.com/">Bernard Leach</a>, the main pottery tastemaker at the time. However, Rie was not an artist troubled by the presence of other skilled crafts people with different approaches. She positioned herself as student, absorbing their styles to see how they flourished under her own hand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/15/lucie-rie-the-adventure-of-pottery-review-kettles-yard-cambridge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Virginia Woolf to Primo Levi, authors are drawn to capturing  scientists’ obsessive quest for knowledge</p><p>Science, as much as art, is an act of imagination, the pursuit of something new. While novels about scientists often play with this likeness, there are also scientists who write with the ambition and empathy of novelists. Scientists in literature appear in all sorts of guises: as megalomaniacs, heroes, obsessives. It is this last figure – the obsessive – the character who will not stop – that interests me most.</p><p>I have always been drawn to quests. Quest stories range from the domestic – a mystery about a family secret, say – to the criminal, where a detective spends a lifetime brooding on an unsolvable case, to the existential. Existential quests extend across fiction and nonfiction, and again the scientist and novelist converge. Both are engaged in pattern-seeking and analogy-making, sifting experience and research in an attempt to piece together a convincing and original story about the world; to create something and at the same time to find something out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/15/top-10-visionary-books-about-scientists-martin-macinnes-in-ascension">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I met Michael on the streets of Portland, Oregon, and we would wander together. A year later, he wrote asking for cucumber, pancake mix and toilet rolls. When I went to his house, a stranger was living there’</p><p>Back when I was studying photography, it made me uncomfortable to take shots of strangers in the street. Without their permission, it seemed like I was stealing images of them. It’s important for me to build up relationships with those I photograph, and the first time it felt right for me was when I went to Russia for my graduation project. I didn’t speak the language so I carried a note in Russian that I showed people, asking if I could spend a night in their homes. I would be treated like part of the family which made it OK for me to take pictures. I later used a similar approach in the US and in Egypt, while a chance encounter with a woman called Agata in a Parisian strip bar <a href="https://www.magnumphotos.com/arts-culture/bieke-depoorter-every-time-i-photographed-agata-i-saw-someone-different/">led to a collaboration</a> that lasted five years.</p><p>This shot is of Michael, whom I met randomly on the streets of Portland, Oregon, in 2015. We started to talk and, when I asked where he lived, he invited me to his house. Inside, the walls were covered with images: photos, clippings from magazines, things he had written. It was a scene I couldn’t have invented or predicted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/15/portland-wanderer-oregon-missing-bieke-depoorters-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up here</a></strong></li></ul><p>You know a game is important when even the release of a short playable demo is the most exciting, talked about event of the week. I am of course referring to the Resident Evil 4 remake, a 20-minute slice of which was made available for free on PlayStation, Xbox and PC last Thursday. The response has been ecstatic, both from newcomers and veterans of the original 2005 version. Fans are already discovering hidden modes and weapons and even modding it. Expectations for the full release are high.</p><p>I reviewed the game 15 years ago, and I can say with confidence that what made Capcom’s horror sequel so special then still works in its favour years later, in our era of vast open-world adventures. And that is flow. For many years, game designers have sought to give players the experience of flow, as defined by the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who referred to it as becoming so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter. The activity, he noted, didn’t have to be mindless or repetitive – the flow state is about achieving a heightened level of skill and focus and, through the mastery of these elements, experiencing relaxation and happiness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/15/pushing-buttons-resident-evil-4-remake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The disdain shown to us by Queen Mary University of London inspired me to redouble my efforts on the picket lines.

<p>The Leon co-founder and campaigner points the finger at the forces that make modern diets so unhealthy</p><p>One morning as he was getting up, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/henry-dimbleby">Henry Dimbleby</a>’s daughter asked him if he’d always been quite so chubby. It was, he admits, both “a bruising start to the day” and a tricky question to answer. “Maintaining a healthy weight”, for the co-founder of Leon restaurants turned food campaigner, “has always been a struggle”. And Dimbleby isn’t the only one. In fact, he says, 28% of us are clinically obese, which is startling when you compare that with just 1% of the population in 1950, an age when the planet too was in far better nick. It isn’t that we’re greedy, but we are not entirely blameless either. In Dimbleby’s words, it would be wrong to say that we “are powerless in the jaws of the machine”, but, as he shows, the machine is a formidable creation of supermarkets, food giants and fast-food chains. Ravenous, which is co-written by Dimbleby’s wife, the journalist Jemima Lewis, is a highly readable account of what needs to happen in order for us to both save the planet and fit into those old jeans again.</p><p>Part of the problem is that the enemy is invisible. Most of us don’t even realise our eating habits are largely informed by a dystopian system we can’t see – one that produces, processes, markets and sells the food we eat. On a train heading for London, Dimbleby buys a “handmade” egg sandwich and turns it over to see that it contains 32 ingredients, including things most of us will have never heard of. When did you last put “diacetyl tartaric acid” in your shopping basket? Even natural-sounding ingredients, such as rapeseed oil, are often highly processed. In fact, <a href="https://www.c3health.org/blog/is-ultra-processed-food-why-are-we-eating-so-much/" title="">highly processed foods make up 57% of our diet</a>, a higher proportion than any other European country. The consequences are stark. Studies have shown, Dimbleby writes, that a “10% increase in the proportion of ultra-processed foods in a person’s diet is correlated with a 12% increase in cancers, a 21% increase in depressive symptoms, and a 12% increase in cardiovascular disease risk”. In a sense, it’s simple – these foods contain more of the things that cause us harm, such as sugars and fats. But it’s these very things, combined in a complicated way, that create “moreishness” – those crisps in your cupboard are designed so that you just can’t stop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/15/ravenous-by-henry-dimbleby-review-rage-against-the-food-machine">Continue reading...</a>

There is no stroke in cricket that better captures the artistry and grace of a batter in full flow than a flashing scythe through the offside. But add in a bent back knee, an arched torso, a flourish of the hands and the delicious parabola of a ball careening over the infield and what you’ve got now is a statement.</p><p>Temba Bavuma has been making statements ever since he first held a cricket bat in Langa, an underdeveloped area of Cape Town that was solely reserved for black Africans under apartheid. But he rarely uses words. Those rarely leave his mouth in anything other than a mumbled tone as they coalesce into a collection of media-trained athlete-speak.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/15/why-temba-bavumas-second-century-matters-for-himself-and-south-africa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An Oscar can only, officially, be sold for $1 – but that hasn’t stopped a small but lucrative black market. Where are all those that have disappeared?</p><p>In March 2000, three weeks before the 72nd Academy Awards, that year’s entire shipment of Oscars – 55 individually marked, 24-carat-gold-plated statuettes – mysteriously disappeared en route from the manufacturer in Chicago to Los Angeles. The story briefly became a showbiz sensation: the Academy set up a 24-hour tip line; the handling company offered a $50,000 reward; the FBI became involved. But the culprits were no master criminals: they turned out to be a couple of light-fingered but loose-tongued delivery workers, who had stumbled on the crate and thought they had struck gold. They were arrested within days and the show went on.</p><p>Had these thieves somehow been able to sell the Oscars on the open market, they might have been in for a shock. The going rate for 55 new Oscar statues is $55. Since 1951, all Academy Award winners must sign <a href="https://www.oscars.org/legal/regulations">an agreement</a> that they “shall not sell or otherwise dispose of the Oscar statuette, nor permit it to be sold or disposed of by operation of law, without first offering to sell it to the Academy for the sum of $1”. The rule also applies to anyone who receives or inherits someone else’s Oscar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/15/pssst-wanna-buy-an-oscar-the-mysterious-case-of-the-missing-academy-awards">Continue reading...</a>

## Nothing Special by Nicole Flattery review – inside Warhol’s Factory

<p>Exploring female friendship, fame and identity, this coming-of-age tale follows two young women in 1960s New York</p><p>Seventeen-year-old Mae is an excellent listener. In almost every other respect, the narrator of Nicole Flattery’s debut novel is a mess: she’s dropped out of school; she’s ignoring her mother; her nascent encounters with the adult world are bleak enough to give Holden Caulfield a run for his money. Chaos swirls around her, but she manages, somehow, to hold herself still at the centre of it: saying little, giving nothing away, but paying close attention. And it’s this capacity to listen – to receive rather than to transmit; to locate herself in the audience, rather than to launch herself on to the stage – that allows her to step into a role as a vital but invisible cog in what would become a world-famous machine.</p><p>Nothing Special is set in the grubby avant garde of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol" title="">Andy Warhol</a>’s Factory studio, which, in 1966, when the story kicks off, was establishing itself as an artistic and cultural force to be reckoned with. On the face of it, Flattery’s choice of time and place is unexpected: she’s strongly associated with the new wave of Irish literature, while Warhol and his Factory are as American, in their way, as apple pie. But those who’ve read her acclaimed 2019 collection, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/19/show-them-good-time-nicole-flattery-review" title="">Show Them a Good Time</a>, will realise at once that while the physical landscape of Nothing Special – the diners and department stores and “people disappearing into subway stations” – is quintessentially New York, the emotional terrain is all Flattery’s own. Mae and her new friend, fellow Factory worker Shelley, are cut from precisely the same cloth as the jaded, affectless women who populated Flattery’s short stories: they’re perceptive about the limits placed on female experience, but too disillusioned to do anything other than accommodate them; they yearn for significance but can find no way of attaining it. Mae and Shelley are charged with answering the Factory’s famous silver telephone, but the callers never ask for them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/15/nothing-special-by-nicole-flattery-review-inside-warhols-factory">Continue reading...</a>

## The post-Sturgeon SNP is washing its dirty linen in public. That could be the best thing for it | Lesley Riddock

<p>The combative contest means issues are being discussed, the independence debate has been normalised and possible leaders are being tested</p><p>The SNP leadership contest, between Kate Forbes, Humza Yousaf and Ash Regan, seems to prove why political parties should not wash their dirty linen in public. But when there’s nowhere else to do it, the public arena becomes the only location in town. And despite the rancour on display, maybe this long postponed outpouring of difference is no bad thing.</p><p>The airing of grievance can only be put off for so long by any governing party – especially one so large that eyebrows were raised this week when “only” 78,000 voting cards were <a href="https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/politics/snp-crisis-50000-members-desert-29436463">reportedly</a> dispatched – if true, this would be a 30% drop in SNP membership <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/party-membership-since-indyref/">since 2014</a>.

## The Marriage Question by Clare Carlisle review – the lives and loves of George Eliot

<p>A philosopher examines the meaning of relationships in the great novelist’s life and books</p><p>Mid-Victorian society never forgave George Eliot for setting up home in 1854 with a rackety married man, the journalist and scientist GH Lewes. Late-Victorian society, by contrast, could not forgive her for choosing to wed in church when, following Lewes’s death in 1878, she walked up the aisle with a much younger and duller man called John Cross. On the question of marriage, George Eliot could never seem to get it right.</p><p>In this thrilling book, the academic philosopher Clare Carlisle explores the novelist’s interrogation of “the double life”, meaning not only Eliot’s own 25 years of unsanctioned coupledom with Lewes, but also the difficult love relationships she unleashed on her heroines, including Maggie Tulliver in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/27/eliot-mill-floss-biography-tulliver">The Mill on the Floss</a> and Dorothea Brooke in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/10/100-best-novels-middlemarch-george-eliot">Middlemarch</a>. Carlisle, then, is less concerned with reheating the stale gossip that still gets Eliot’s biographers going – was Lewes unfaithful, why did Cross jump into the Grand Canal during their honeymoon, how come so many people developed a crush on a woman whom Henry James claimed look like a horse? – and instead takes a more soulful look at what “the marriage question” meant for the girl who had been born Mary Anne Evans in 1819.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/15/the-marriage-question-by-clare-carlisle-review-the-lives-and-loves-of-george-eliot">Continue reading...</a>

As I approached the door with his key in my pocket, a stranger asked me for some water.

In fact, one of the sharpest, most humbling lessons so far has been the dawning understanding that no one actually really knows what they are doing most of the time.</p><p>I suspect that before a baby arrives we all have some ideas about the sort of parents we are going to be, only to guiltily dispatch with those “principles” one by one as the child grows. This has never been more apparent to me than when thinking about screen time. How I laugh now at the sweet summer child who obnoxiously recommended the CBeebies Prom to my fellow National Childbirth Trust (NCT) mums, keen to stress that <em>of course </em>I turned his bouncer to face away from the screen. I’m surprised the poor baby didn’t get a crick in his neck from craning to see what was going on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/15/parents-screen-time-children-tv-cbeebies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer are powerfully matched as guilty lovers in an Edith Wharton adaptation that bears comparison with Hollywood’s golden age classics</p><p>Gorgeously rich and fluent, visually breathtaking and exquisitely refined, Martin Scorsese’s adaptation (with screenwriter Jay Cocks) of the 1920 novel by Edith Wharton looks even more magnificent than ever. I marvel, as always, at the mastery and audacity with which Scorsese followed up GoodFellas with this: a tragedy of manners set in New York society’s own belle époque of the 1870s, an age, not of innocence, but concealed guilt.</p><p>Newland Archer, played with amazing suavity by Daniel Day-Lewis, is a handsome, wealthy lawyer, about to make a socially brilliant marriage to the delicate, guileless and yet somehow knowing May (Winona Ryder). But as a lawyer and now family friend, Archer agrees to help May’s cousin Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of a lifetime), an exotically beautiful and unconventional woman who has effectively escaped back to America after a disastrous marriage to a cruel Polish count; she has perhaps been guilty of later indiscretions of her own in Europe before arriving in the United States. New York’s high society is uneasy at the scandal but just about able to accept Ellen on account of her blueblood American antecedents, and also as the victim of a foreigner’s cruelty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/15/the-age-of-innocence-review-scorsese-daniel-day-lewis-michelle-pfeiffer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She is back on our screens with Top Chef, but there is much more to the former supermodel than her successful TV career. She discusses scars, sexual assault, endometriosis – and the healing power of food</p><p>‘I wish I did more on purpose. I wish I could tell you that it was all premeditated and choreographed; it’s not.” Padma Lakshmi is talking to me by video call from her office in New York about what is now the 20th season of Top Chef, which she has been hosting since 2006. It’s like a cross between MasterChef and Bake Off, except with chefs, not regular people.

<p><strong>Bridge theatre, London<br /></strong>This immersive production of the New York musical has a bold design, superb singing and chemistry between its stars</p><p>Frank Loesser’s 1950 musical comedy about sin and romantic salvation might feel dated in its themes but Nicholas Hytner’s production is a feat of innovative staging. The Bridge’s auditorium has been radically rearranged for a promenading audience, with Bunny Christie’s mobile stage continually remaking itself, its platforms rising up to reveal New York City’s bars, clubs and street corners. This movement creates a distraction from the drama, to some degree, yet captures the spirit of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/15/i-wish-more-people-would-read-damon-runyon-short-stories">Damon Runyon</a>’s original story and the unceasing bustle of his “Runyonland”. It is a marvel to see worlds constructed before our eyes, accentuated by Paule Constable’s lighting design.</p><p>There is the option for some audience members to watch from an outer tier of the auditorium and, having chosen to sit, I felt regretfully distant from the immersive elements. It was clear that the promenading audience was experiencing the show differently.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/15/guys-and-dolls-review-bridge-theatre-london-nicholas-hytner">Continue reading...</a>
