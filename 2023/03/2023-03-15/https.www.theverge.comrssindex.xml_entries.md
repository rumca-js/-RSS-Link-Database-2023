  <p id="URAS3U">Last summer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23181342/starlink-rv-review-trees-rain-speed-latency">we reviewed Starlink RV</a>, a version of the satellite internet service that promised users access from pretty much anywhere on their continent. Now, it has been rebranded as <a href="https://www.starlink.com/roam">Starlink Roam</a>, available in either a regional access flavor for $150 per month or for global use anywhere the service is available for $200 per month.</p>
<p id="5S1tdM">As with the RV package, users can choose either a portable antenna for $599 or one intended for in-motion use for $2,500. Previously, you could only travel with Starlink’s satellite dish (nicknamed Dishy) within the same continent. </p>

  <p id="bVy3oM">Wemo, Belkin’s smart home company, has paused development of Matter smart home devices. In an email exchange, Debra Benson, a PR representative for Wemo, confirmed that, while the company remains convinced that “Matter will have a significantly positive impact on the smart home industry,” it has decided to “take a big step back, regroup, and rethink’’ its approach to the smart home. Benson went on to write that Wemo will bring new Matter products to market when it can find a way to differentiate them. It seems like Wemo might be concerned its smart home gear is becoming commoditized.</p>

<p id="jQ7VfN">Developed for the Artemis III mission, which will see the first woman and person of color walking on the Moon, the prototype suit was revealed at an event on Wednesday, March 15th. The prototype includes a dark gray cover, which was designed by costume designer Esther Marquis, who worked on the TV series <em>For All Mankind</em>, but the actual suit will be white for thermal reasons.</p>

  <p id="dW6oIp">Installing a mini data center could become a more sustainable way to heat public swimming pools in the UK. One data center, which is roughly the size of a laundry machine, has already been installed underneath a swimming pool in Devon County. Seven more similar setups are in the works across the UK, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64939558"><em>BBC News</em> reports</a>.</p>
<p id="sRkc38">It’s a practical partnership that helps the pools and data centers solve expensive technical problems. Since most of the electricity computers consume is eventually released as heat, data centers need to cool down their hardware. Public pools need to heat themselves up but face skyrocketing energy costs that have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62391323">pushed many pools in the UK to close</a>.</p>
