nation \u2013 but it remains to be seen whether his nation will turn for him. Mr Yousaf has devoted his working life to the goal of Scottish independence, but he takes power just as the cause\u2019s standing has dipped in the opinion polls. That probably explained why, in his acceptance speech, Mr Yousaf emphasised what he would do to help Scots with the cost of living crisis and how the SNP would support public services.

Scottish politics has been reshaped in the wake of the financial crash of 2008 and the decade of austerity that followed it. The pro-union parties \u2013 Labour, Liberal, Conservative \u2013 had two-thirds of all seats in the first two parliaments at Holyrood; since 2011, they have been in a minority. At the last general election, the SNP <a href=\"https://electionresults.parliament.uk/election/2019-12-12/results/Location/Country/Scotland\" title=\"\">won</a> 48 seats, reducing the once dominant Labour party to just one Scottish MP. Mr Yousaf will be the first Muslim to head a country in western Europe.

Large, capitalised signatures loom large in every one. Burton might be called an outsider artist, and dedicated herself to painting both happy moments, personal mementoes and uncomfortable memories. After discovering oil paint following open heart surgery in California, she painted incessantly. Born in 1926, Burton had suffered from rheumatic heart disease since childhood, and her daughter inherited the same condition, dying in her 30s. Burton went to the US with her American serviceman husband, got homesick listening to Tom Jones singing Green, Green Grass of Home and returned, first to her native Aylesbury and then to Bedford, where she joined the local art club. She was impervious to advice and went her own way. She married three times, and died in 2007.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/27/hermione-burton-and-andy-holden-review-gallery-of-everything-london\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/27/hermione-burton-and-andy-holden-review-gallery-of-everything-london", "date_published": "2023-03-27 14:15:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The billionaire amateur racing driver who runs the Poole oil leak pipeline", "description": "<p>Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo and his family-owned oil drilling company operate 3,000 sites around the world </p><p>The company that through a subsidiary operates the pipeline involved in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/26/poole-harbour-major-incident-declared-over-leak-from-oil-field\">\u201cmajor incident\u201d oil leak</a> within Poole harbour is owned and run by a multibillionaire amateur racing driver who owns 46 sports cars including a \u00a312m McLaren F1 GTR.</p><p>Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, 46, and other members of his family, own the <a href=\"https://www.perenco.com/\">global oil drilling company Perenco</a>, which controls the Wytch Farm oilfield in Dorset, from which about 200 barrels of \u201creservoir fluid\u201d \u2013 water with 15% of oil \u2013 leaked into Poole harbour on Sunday night.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/27/francois-perrodo-the-billionaire-amateur-racing-driver-who-runs-perenco\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/27/francois-perrodo-the-billionaire-amateur-racing-driver-who-runs-perenco", "date_published": "2023-03-27 14:13:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018Diana Dors screamed about George Best while rubbing herself against a young man\u2019: how we made Deep End", "description": "<p>\u2018A friend told me a story about a diamond that was lost for ever after being dropped in snow.

If the sniggerers couldn\u2019t get over the novel\u2019s sex scenes, it was perhaps only a mark of a bigger obstacle, which was that the real Hillary loomed unhelpfully in readers\u2019 minds.<br /><br />The purer pleasure of her zingy new novel deserves more widespread approval. <em>Romantic Comedy</em> \u2013 a title of impressively Ronseal-like clarity \u2013 is tighter than <em>Rodham</em> but it\u2019s ambitious too, navigating with unfussy panache tricky yet somehow already well-tilled terrain such as Covid-19 and modern celebrity as well as writing itself, a subject few novels manage to portray without accusations of self-indulgence.<br /><br />It starts in 2018, taking us through a week in the life of its narrator, Sally, a thirtysomething divorcee who writes for The Night Owls, a fictitious New York sketch show resembling <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. The frenzy of her schedule, from Monday afternoon pitch meeting to midweek all-nighter to small-hours \u201cafter-after-party\u201d, leaves little time for much beyond dating-app hookups. But when the show\u2019s guest host, heart-throb pop star Noah, starts to flirt \u2013 if Sally is reading the signs right \u2013 it threatens to upend the logic of the sketch she\u2019s been working on: a routine, gently pointed at a male colleague dating a bombshell actor, about why it is that gorgeous women go out with averagely attractive men, but never the other way around.<br /></p><p><br />In <em>Rodham</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/10/curtis-sittenfeld-on-american-wife-i-thought-democrats-wouldnt-read-it-because-it-was-about-a-republican\">American Wife</a></em>, about a fictionalised first lady akin to Laura Bush, Sittenfeld gave us the heady sense of peeking behind the curtain and part of <em>Romantic Comedy</em>\u2019s thrill is the sense that it\u2019s giving us the inside track on an industry. The structure of the novel\u2019s first third, centred on the frenzied tension of the week-long countdown to live transmission, is electrically compelling, with steady warmth as well as drama generated by the camaraderie and jostling for preferment among writers and actors hoping their ideas are the ones that will make the cut. Sittenfeld even manages to create page-turning interest from the nuts and bolts of composition, putting it at the heart of the novel\u2019s early will-they-won\u2019t-they? frisson, when Sally improves Noah\u2019s own idea for a skit.<br /><br />Throughout, the novel\u2019s command of structure, pace and dialogue is faultless. Sally and Noah almost kiss after the show, but instead she contrives to thoughtlessly insult him \u2013 and next thing, the novel cuts to lockdown in 2020. The hectic opening segment gives way to something aptly slower, a period portrayed as an exchange of emails between the two characters after Noah reopens contact.<br /><br />Part of the fun of this long middle section is getting the chance to observe for ourselves how Sally \u2013 a writer, after all \u2013 evidently feels more in control from behind a keyboard and there\u2019s quiet humour in how she finds ways to gradually up the stakes by casually mentioning what she\u2019s wearing and how hot it is.<br /><br />Soon another real-life meeting is on the cards \u2013 <em>Rodham\u2019</em>s reception hasn\u2019t put Sittenfeld off sex scenes \u2013 but not everything is plain sailing. For a start, there\u2019s social media; Sally can\u2019t quite help seeing comments: \u201cNhoa Brewster would never date a women who looks like that shes obvously his assitant.\u201d There\u2019s the matter of her widowed stepfather, too, vulnerable and alone in the pandemic, as well as the potential for awkwardness when you fall in love with someone rich enough to enable your dreams \u2013 the novel\u2019s title, as well as flagging the contents, refers to Sally\u2019s ambition to write romcom screenplays.<br /><br />Still, while Sittenfeld knows the dramatic value of putting obstacles in the path of characters you\u2019re rooting for, she also isn\u2019t above giving readers what they want \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what she does in this affable, intelligently crafted tale of work and love.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/27/romantic-comedy-by-curtis-sittenfeld-review-lights-camera-attraction\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/27/romantic-comedy-by-curtis-sittenfeld-review-lights-camera-attraction", "date_published": "2023-03-27 06:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "10 sustainable festivals in the UK and Europe", "description": "<p>With festivals attempting to clean up their shocking environmental record, we pick the best planet-friendly events, all accessible without flying</p><p>Plastic cutlery, abandoned tents, artists flown in to perform \u2026 the traditional music festival has not been a bastion of eco-friendliness.
