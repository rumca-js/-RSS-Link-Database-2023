Or at least he has learned fast. In Thomas Kail\u2019s sumptuous Broadway revival of the Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler musical, Groban plays the barber of the title. It\u2019s a counterintuitive choice in that his charm resides in the curious contrast between his sweet, menschy face and a rich, rumbling baritone, as dark as venous blood. And in truth, he never goes as dark as the role requires. Sweeney is among the great villains and antiheroes the musical stage has produced. Groban seldom reveals the depths of rage, trauma and mania that make a monster of this man. It\u2019s a close-shave approach to the role: clean and precise, it doesn\u2019t pierce the surface.</p><p>If Groban\u2019s partial view performance is a tear in the barber\u2019s apron of the revival, it also shows how durable that apron is. Based on a made-up Victorian shocker, it tells the tale of a homicidal stylist and the widow who upcycles today\u2019s victims into tomorrow\u2019s lunch. Haunting, horrible and thrilling, the show harmonizes its penny dreadful origins with a dense, operatic score that elevates the grand guignol into something grander and more terrifying, with beauty and horror and screeching comedy fighting it out from one song to the next. It\u2019s a nightmare of a show and in some ways a dream, pushing at the boundaries of what a musical might say and do and be.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/27/sweeney-todd-demon-barber-broadway-play-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/27/sweeney-todd-demon-barber-broadway-play-review", "date_published": "2023-03-27 13:21:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Talking Horses: Derby must avoid bookmaker backing for good of racing", "description": "<p>If a bookie is the only option for the Epsom Classic sponsor, it might be better to go with no sponsor at all</p><p>In its usual, almost apologetic style, the new British Flat season on turf will flicker into life at Doncaster on Saturday with the Lincoln Handicap, and this year the lack of fanfare in the country that gave the sport of organised horse racing to the world does not feel entirely misplaced.</p><p>The 2023 campaign will begin without an obvious star to pin early hopes and dreams upon, since Baaeed is already settling in to his new life as a stallion while Little Big Bear, last year\u2019s champion juvenile colt and 2,000 Guineas favourite, did not race beyond six furlongs at two, or any later than August.
