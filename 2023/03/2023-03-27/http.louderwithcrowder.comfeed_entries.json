Six people were killed, including three children, and the suspect is a 28-year-old female who may have been a former student. The suspect was killed in an altercation with police. Other than that, nothing. But the general lack of information did not stop the lovely Karine Jean-Pierre from blaming Republicans for this tragedy. Of course. </p><p><em>\"As you all know, President Biden has taken more action than any President in history on gun safety [...] He also believes it's not enough. We must do more. And he wants Congress to act. Because enough is enough.\" </em></p><p><em>\"How many more children have to be murdered before Republicans in Congress will step up and act, to pass the assault weapons ban, to close loopholes in our background check system, or to require the safe storage of guns?\" </em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">None</div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonateba/status/1640415175215038467\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These types of immediate calls for <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/illinois-guns-govvernor-felony\" target=\"_blank\">gun control</a> in the wake of mass shootings always drive me a tad nutso. If someone enters a school with the intent to <em>murder children, </em><em> </em>something tells me they <em>probably</em> wouldn't care about violating gun laws. Plus, we don't know what weapons were used, whether or not they were acquired legally, or if Biden's assault weapons ban would have prevented the shooting at all. But KJP still pounced on the opportunity to condemn Republicans. <br /></p><p>What I'm more interested in is, how did the shooter get into the school? Reports say she entered a side door. Why weren't all the doors of the school secured? Is this another <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/uvalde-update-gun-control\" target=\"_blank\">Uvalde</a> situation, where the door was unlocked? It seems like American schools have a maaajor security problem. If we aren't willing to fix that and guard our children with armed security, then we likely won't see school shootings decrease either. </p><p>I don't want to name the problem or condemn anyone before all the details come out. But I don't see what harm a little extra security for schools could possibly do. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

These days, suing rich people for money seems to be one of America's favorite past times.

The news is getting off to a slow start. And we're still waiting to hear more from the transwoman who claims TSA punched her in her testicles. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-woman-tsa-testicles\" target=\"_blank\">Yes, HER testicles</a>. So while we wait for the usual chaos and shenanigans that is politics and culture in 2023 to unfold, here's a video of a man fistfighting monkeys.</p><p>The fisticuffs take place in Thailand. A man was minding his business enjoying a beach day with his family when a monkey decided to get froggy.

Yes, the monkey went after Darwin. This is when Whitelum needed to square up against the monkey. The rub is that the monkey had his boys with him, and they all ganged up on Riley. Because, hey, they're monkeys. And people say they monkey around.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f6cb7\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33357339&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Folks, these are the jokes.</p><p>It was a dozen monkeys. Almost a barrelful. But Riley had no f*cks to give. These monkeys were after his family. He kept throwing punches until the kids were safe, their belongings were collected, and the monkeys discovered Whitelum was no one to be trifled with. Though Whitelum did require a rabies shot when one of the monkeys got bitey.</p><p>Man vs Monkey jumps right up to number three on our list of top monkey content here on the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/monkey-kidnaps-dog\" target=\"_blank\">Just above the monkey who kidnapped a dog</a>.</p><p>Number two goes to the monkeys in India who <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/breaking-monkeys-attack-lab-assistant-escape-with-covid-samples-wait-what\" target=\"_blank\">attacked lab assistants and stole their SCHMOVID samples</a>.

Where on one fateful day, rival monkey gangs saw each other and it was on sight. This too took place in Thailand. No word on if any of the monkeys in this video were part of the Great Monkey Wars of 2021.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Every other emergency worker on the scene EXCEPT for the Austin Police -- because they weren't on the scene -- could see the other driver, a 70-year-old man, was sh*tfaced.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/defunded-austin-pd-takes-so-long-respond-dui-crash-driver-sobers-up-walks-free-family\" target=\"_blank\">From Fox News</a>:</p><blockquote>The military family quickly realized the driver, a male in his 70s, was intoxicated. Purciful says that the \"first thing\" a bus driver on the scene told her was that the man \"smells like alcohol\" and was \"refusing to get out of the car.\"</blockquote><p>But by the time police got there two and a half hours later, the old man had sobered up and was able to pass field test. He wasn't arrested. Only five police officers were working in the area. </p><blockquote>Austin\u2019s city council slashed the police budget in 2020 amid the George Floyd riots across the country and has been mired in a situation where police staffing has plummeted and not recovered even though funding was restored after the state stepped in.<br /><br />Additionally, the low morale and a recent move by the city council to abandon a previously agreed upon police contract with the city has sparked a wave of police retirements.</blockquote><p>Like with most crime that happens in cities -- where progressive politicians passed pro-criminal defund the police policies -- you have to wonder who the victims voted for. The Purcifuls are a military family, so one would assume they voted for whatever passed for a law-and-order Austinite at the time.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
