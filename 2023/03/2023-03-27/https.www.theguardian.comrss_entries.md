<p>This tantalising police drama sees naive newcomers utterly unprepared for the dangerous situations they face on the job. You’ll be instantly hooked</p><p>This is a busy and productive period for high-concept police dramas, so you might be forgiven for thinking, ‘Oh God, not another one’. Don’t sleep on Blue Lights, however; it’s well-crafted, fantastically tense, thrilling stuff, created by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/14/the-salisbury-poisonings-review-novichok-drama-with-lessons-for-now">The Salisbury Poisonings’</a> Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson. Set in Belfast, it follows three new and extremely green recruits to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, who have two months of their probationary period left to serve. If this action-stuffed opener is anything to go by, those two months are not going to slide by quietly.</p><p>As in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/mar/26/greys-anatomy-the-tv-show-that-has-always-been-there-for-me">Grey’s Anatomy</a>, the idea of chucking a load of naive newcomers into a horribly stressful and dangerous environment for which they are inevitably unprepared all but guarantees excitement. Here, our three rookies are Grace (Siân Brooke), a former social worker and single mother in her early 40s, who has made a midlife career change; Annie (Katherine Devlin), a hard-partying, tough-on-the-surface young woman who has to lie about her chosen profession in her private life. “What kind of dickhead applies for fast track?” she asks, churlishly, in the staff room. Step forward the sheepish Tommy (Nathan Braniff), earnest, hard-working and on the fast track scheme, though he needs to refine his people skills if he has any hope of possessing authority. We are plunged straight into the fray with a high-speed car chase through narrow country lanes. “Remember your training, Grace, get the rifle,” says her “tutor”, Stevie (Martin McCann), which is certainly more treacherous than having to remember how everyone likes their tea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/27/blue-lights-review-dont-sleep-on-this-fantastically-tense-belfast-cop-show">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Humza Yousaf argues a union with England frustrates Scotland’s hopes, but one with Europe energises them</p><p>Humza Yousaf’s election as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/27/humza-yousaf-elected-leader-scottish-national-party-snp" title="">leader</a> of the Scottish Nationalist party is a turning point for his nation – but it remains to be seen whether his nation will turn for him. Mr Yousaf has devoted his working life to the goal of Scottish independence, but he takes power just as the cause’s standing has dipped in the opinion polls. That probably explained why, in his acceptance speech, Mr Yousaf emphasised what he would do to help Scots with the cost of living crisis and how the SNP would support public services. In backing him, party members decided to stick with the progressive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/27/humza-yousaf-profile-snp-scotland-first-minister" title="">agenda</a> of his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.</p><p>The Scottish independence movement can be seen as a reaction to the dysfunctional and unresponsive nature of British politics. It was the SNP’s opposition to the invasion of Iraq that drew Mr Yousaf into its <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/who-is-humza-yousaf-new-snp-leader-first-minister-r36vdsmjm" title="">orbit</a>. Scottish politics has been reshaped in the wake of the financial crash of 2008 and the decade of austerity that followed it. The pro-union parties – Labour, Liberal, Conservative – had two-thirds of all seats in the first two parliaments at Holyrood; since 2011, they have been in a minority. At the last general election, the SNP <a href="https://electionresults.parliament.uk/election/2019-12-12/results/Location/Country/Scotland" title="">won</a> 48 seats, reducing the once dominant Labour party to just one Scottish MP. Mr Yousaf will be the first Muslim to head a country in western Europe. Steered by a person of colour, the SNP can make the case that it champions a pro-immigrant civic nationalism more eloquently than the Tories, who, despite being led by Rishi Sunak, stir ethnic nativism when it<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/19/suella-braverman-racism-tories-holocaust" title=""> electorally</a> suits them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/27/the-guardian-view-on-the-snps-new-leader-he-understands-brexit-wont-help-scotland">Continue reading...</a>

Despite the positive spin, the upbeat exterior, this wasn’t the Scottish National party as it generally likes to be seen.</p><p>The SNP has dominated Scottish politics for decades. Now it is at a crossroads. Its leader for more than eight years has ruled almost as she pleased. Winning election after election and trusting in a party discipline that is the envy of leaders south of the border. A party way beyond the demands of normal democracy; one whose leaders normally appear by alchemy rather than through a vote of party members.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/27/scottish-national-party-humza-yousaf-in-no-mood-to-party-as-contest-finally-ends">Continue reading...</a>

Like the proverbial tip of the iceberg, the offerings that Cuevas gives audiences feel so suggestive of so much more, and everything in the show seems to fit together in some unbelievably complicated way. Juxtaposing elements from ancient indigenous cultures with 20th-century advertisements by oil conglomerates, and appropriating imagery from Mexico’s most lionized and institutionalized artists, the show pushes audiences to see beneath the surface and connect the dots.</p><p>On view at Kurimanzutto New York through 15 April, in gods we trust is a truly ambitious and wide-ranging exhibition. Cuevas framed her work as an attempt to add complexity to an all-too-simple story, bringing back many of the pieces that official accounts have left out. “I wanted to find these more complex narratives – not everything is Aztec,” said Cuevas, laughing. “We don’t know enough about these histories. I wanted to go further than this discourse of the Aztecs and the Mayas. Little by little you get these narratives of economic processes and social history.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/27/minerva-cuevas-artist-exhibition-mexican-history">Continue reading...</a>

The club blame the Boris Johnson-approved sanctions imposed on former owner Roman Abramovich, which will continue to be felt “in the following years”, as presumably will the £500m splurge set to hit next year, so good luck to everyone at the Bridge.

Should you favour tradition and wear your clan colours, with a kilt passed down through the family, or choose a punk styling by Vivienne Westwood? Is it the dress of revolt, worn by Bonnie Prince Charlie and his Jacobite rebels, or the uniform of repression, taken up by the British army and once even used to clothe enslaved people? Is it a cringe on shortbread tins or the unifying weave of Scots nationhood?</p><p>Tartan is, above all, a cloth of contradiction. And that is the refrain that runs through a new exhibition at the V&amp;A Dundee charting this instantly, globally recognisable textile’s journey from simple highland craft to mass-produced superbrand<strong>. </strong>“Tartan is linked to a hugely diverse range of identities,” says gallery director Leonie Bell. “It is the cloth of the establishment, of political power, regal power, military power.

<p>Brahms’s friendship with Robert Schumann was brief – but life-changing, while he and Clara supported and inspired each other to the end of their days. Pianist Benjamin Grosvenor on the trio’s musical and personal connections</p><p>We all need mentors. An inspirational teacher, a colleague to facilitate a choice introduction or someone to offer wise counsel. Perhaps we freelance musicians, without achievable goals and the agony of an annual review and sales targets, need them all the more. <br /><br />In 1853, a young Johannes Brahms found not one, but two. After an impromptu meeting with Robert and Clara Schumann, where he performed some of his fledgling compositions, the then highly influential Robert Schumann wrote an article for the New Journal of Music in Leipzig. This hyperbolic write-up, titled Neue Bahnen (New Paths), helped launch the relatively unknown 20-year-old on to the international music scene.</p><p>“One whose mastery … spring[s] fully armed from the head of Jupiter … has arrived, a young blood, at whose cradle graces and heroes kept watch. His name is Johannes Brahms,” wrote Schumann.<br /><br />The language of the article could be seen as telling, with its kaleidoscopic talk of a “peaceful rainbow”, “butterflies and nightingale voices” perhaps indicating Robert’s manic state of mind. It was a difficult period for him: his position as municipal director of music in Düsseldorf had come apart publicly, ousted by his musicians amid symptoms of deteriorating health.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/27/best-supporting-players-brahms-and-the-schumanns">Continue reading...</a>

## Hermione Burton review – the wonderfully strange artist discovered in a charity shop haul

<p><strong>The Gallery of Everything, London</strong> <br />She was an amateur painter with immaculate outfits but a turbulent life. Now artist Andy Holden has excavated Burton’s rollercoaster story in a film starring Saint Etienne’s Sarah Cracknell</p><p>Scenes from a life: the artist in her red beret, a phoenix risen from the ashes and surrounded by strange planets and indecipherable signs. The artist at the bottom of the stairs after a fall – the cat watches her while angular abstracts climb the wall and a cup of tea grows cold on the carpet. The artist naked except for a hat. Daughter Jacqui in a wedding veil, and another wearing fishnets, heels and a corset. The artist, or perhaps her daughter again, in tears. And here’s Jacqui dressed like her mother, looking ill and lazing on a platform in a wintry garden with bare trees. She’s wreathed in light. A big-eyed child holding an unhappy-seeming doll who looks more real than the child. A smiling vicar called David; a village hunting scene; a hospital ward; a city beach scene; somewhere in America.</p><p>The more you look, the odder <a href="https://andyholdenartist.com/the-estate-of-hermione">Hermione Burton</a>’s paintings are, with their mix of the fantastical and the observed, with their strange abbreviations and forced smiles, their mix of the inept and the characterful, their exactitude and wonkiness, their naivety and knowingness. Large, capitalised signatures loom large in every one. Burton might be called an outsider artist, and dedicated herself to painting both happy moments, personal mementoes and uncomfortable memories. After discovering oil paint following open heart surgery in California, she painted incessantly. Born in 1926, Burton had suffered from rheumatic heart disease since childhood, and her daughter inherited the same condition, dying in her 30s. Burton went to the US with her American serviceman husband, got homesick listening to Tom Jones singing Green, Green Grass of Home and returned, first to her native Aylesbury and then to Bedford, where she joined the local art club. She was impervious to advice and went her own way. She married three times, and died in 2007.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/27/hermione-burton-and-andy-holden-review-gallery-of-everything-london">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Making a book is an extraordinary thing’: Pip Williams on the invisible history of female bookbinders

<p>The bestselling author of The Dictionary of Lost Words shares the spark behind her new novel, The Bookbinder of Jericho – filling the ‘blank spaces’ around the women who worked at Oxford University Press</p><p>A few years ago in the museum of the Oxford University Press, author Pip Williams was shown a hypnotic short film made nearly a century earlier which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW7wsXuw2cI&amp;feature=youtu.be">crammed the entire production of an OUP book into 18 minutes</a>. The 1925 film shows a workplace divided by gender. While men were responsible for setting the type, manning the presses and affixing the covers, the labour of women – who comprised around a ninth of the Press’s workforce – was often hidden.</p><p>“It’s a black-and-white, silent film, but they’re <em>moving,” </em>Williams explains. She was struck by footage of a woman gathering up long sheets of pages, sometimes 16 pages per side, so they could be folded then bound together. “She sort of moved along the gathering bench like she’s dancing. She’s done it 1,000, <em>2,000</em> times, and she had this rhythm which was really graceful.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/28/making-a-book-is-an-extraordinary-thing-pip-williams-on-the-invisible-history-of-female-bookbinders">Continue reading...</a>

Its depth is so impressive that people often comment on the way it gleams in the light.</p><p>Every time I wear it, I’m intrigued that my grandmother (who died long before I was born) had hands exactly the same size as mine.

If only we could revive that message</p><p>My millennial friend was explaining the trajectory of the men-are-trash narrative. It fell out of fashion for a bit, but now it’s very much back. The proposition, in a nutshell, is that men are trash. It’s a narrative because it’s 2023, and everything is. There were boomers round the table as well. I know, I know: it sounds like an event I’ve made up, but what can I say, I run a very broad friend church, generation-wise. “Well, obviously,” said one, “that’s because men <em>are </em>trash.” “No, no,” said another 60-plus, who is known for her interjections of nuance. “Men aren’t trash. It’s just that women are more interesting.”</p><p>Tiny point of clarification: all these people are married and their husbands were <em>right there</em>. “Shhh, shhh, ladies, they can hear you!” I said, like a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/02/what-is-generation-x-good-for-i-have-finally-found-the-answer">true gen X</a>. “No, it’s true,” said a millennial guy. “We probably don’t do as much work on ourselves.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/27/the-men-are-trash-narrative-is-back-but-what-if-women-are-also-trash">Continue reading...</a>

## Britain, be warned: with ‘stop the boats’ with policies you brutalise migrants – and damage yourselves | Ben Doherty

<p>This hostile approach to asylum helped the Australian right win elections,  but it created divisions that still scar us as a nation</p><p>• Ben Doherty is a reporter for Guardian Australia</p><p>The order came directly from the minister for defence and the instruction was explicit. “No personalising or humanising images” were to be taken of those who had come to Australia by boat, seeking asylum. “<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/senate/committee/maritime_incident_ctte/report/report.pdf">Don’t humanise the refugees</a>” was the command to government officials recording the new arrivals to Australian soil in 2001.</p><p>The imperative was neither safety, nor concern for the welfare or privacy of those seeking asylum; it was political. Those who came by boat seeking sanctuary, the government insisted, were “potential terrorists”, “illegals”, “threats to national security”: the types of people it claimed – falsely – would throw their children overboard. Images that might humanise the desperate men, women and children who had arrived on those leaky boats would belie the government’s assertions.</p><p>Ben Doherty is a reporter for Guardian Australia, and a former foreign correspondent covering south-east Asia</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The legend goes that when local people treat their environment badly, Sedna, the Mother of the Sea, punishes them by gathering all of their animals in her fiery hair at the bottom of the ocean. With no animals, there is no food for the people and nature is out of balance. To keep Sedna happy, the people must comb her hair – clean the sea – so she releases the animals back into the wild.</p><p>There are a few versions of the Sedna story but this one is known by everyone in Greenland. It tells of their relationship with nature – which is not about profit but balance, where everyone respects and understands their place within the wider landscape.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/copa90/2023/mar/27/climate-crisis-life-greenland-football-hope">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester City’s big win, Lucía García finds form and some missed opportunities for wider exposure</p><p>Women’s Football Weekend has become a staple of the season after its launch in 2019. It’s a smart idea, capitalising on the men’s international break to highlight the women’s game. This time was no different, with the Football Association, Sky and the BBC heavily promoting the fixtures, which were spread across the weekend. Big crowds duly followed, but there was disappointment with the north London derby being hosted at Brisbane Road while the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was used for Saracens versus Harlequins. The pitch was so poor at Leyton Orient that it was deemed unfit for the men’s match the following day. Meanwhile, Manchester City hosted 5,222 at a packed Academy Stadium while the Etihad across the road loomed large and empty. The FA and broadcasters need the full buy-in of clubs if they are going to make the most of this particular showcase of women’s football. <strong>SW</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/27/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

Every young person is apparently simultaneously an overvulnerable snowflake terrified of opinions and a yowling fighter in the culture wars. But although there might well be a problem with the diversity and range of ideas in the academy, choosing to focus on it amounts to pointing at a fire in a wastepaper bin while the buildings burn down. The real problems are the result of government abandoning all management of the university world.</p><p>There used to be a cap on individual universities’ student numbers. Each of them got a figure imposed from the centre, and each received an appropriate level of funding. So far, so good. Every institution had a certain number of places, and they worked out what A-level offers they could make, based on those numbers, combined with past experience of how students would fare compared to predicted grades. Those universities at the “top” asked for As, in the “middle” Bs, and so on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/27/the-big-idea-how-can-englands-universities-survive">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Riseborough and Harry Melling play a couple who get off on violence in an oddball, over-saturated thriller with a surprise cameo from Demi Moore</p><p>A rocky-horror sexual awakening is promised in Amanda Kramer’s initially interesting but ultimately laborious queer reverie of 50s and 60s style, like a theatrical daydream as experienced by Anybodys, from West Side Story. The long dissolve fades and blue-lit nightclub scenes are amusingly Lynchian, as is the very stylish and all-too-brief cameo from Demi Moore as a mysterious and worldly neighbour called Maureen. But the film feels over-determined and self-satisfied.</p><p>Andrea Riseborough and Harry Melling play Suze and Arthur, a couple with liberal, bohemian tastes who live in a rough part of town and like going to beatnik poetry clubs. But passionate, slinky Suze is unsatisfied with her milksop husband Arthur; he rejects caveman masculinity and quotes Hamlet: “Man delights not me, no nor woman neither …” (Their apartment has the Shakespearean number 2B.) Then one evening they chance across a gang of murderous delinquents, led by Brandoesque tough guy Teddy (Karl Glusman) and something in his thrillingly criminal muscularity excites Suze and Arthur.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/27/please-baby-please-review-andrea-riseborough-leads-retro-reverie-of-vamp-and-camp">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This method for cooking leeks brings out their soft butteriness and can be used on mushrooms, too. Just add pasta and a little cheese, and you have a perfect, comforting dinner</p><p>Leeks are hard to come by in Rome, so when I do find some on a shelf or stall, there is even more reason to think: “Lovely leek.” Which is how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simon-hopkinson">Simon Hopkinson</a> describes them in his book <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-vegetarian-option-9781787132481">The Vegetarian Option</a>, and an alliteration so neat and right that it stuck and now flashes up every time I see one. And, because thoughts are like dominoes, lovely leeks could well remind me of the lovely Linda mug I shared a desk with for a week or so, many years ago; and of its owner, too, who was also lovely, with smooth hands (and a pot of hand cream on her desk) and a sister who was an optician in Barnes. It’s funny the things we remember.</p><p>Hopkinson also calls leeks the<em> “</em>softly softly”<em> </em>of the onion family, which isn’t just a good description of their flavour and nature, but is also a reminder of how to cook them for soups and sauces<em>. </em>Softly softly, and don’t forget slowly slowly. Which is where Hopkinson meets <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anna-del-conte">Anna Del Conte</a> and her method for cooking leeks for pasta or rice. This is also great, because it feels like two favourite cookery writers are having a chat and swapping advice in my kitchen. First, though, clean the leek, trim away the dark welly end and roots, then split it lengthways, but not all the way, so it stays intact and fans out like a peacock’s tail, allowing all the grit can be washed away. This central split also means the leek then cuts easily into half moons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/27/rachel-roddy-recipe-pasta-leeks-mushrooms-thyme-soft-cheese">Continue reading...</a>

My league table is highly competitive. Recently, I found myself presenting one of my Top 10 regrets to my five-year-old son (albeit under the guise of parental wisdom). We were discussing the importance of seatbelts and – to make my point – I suggested he reach forward and squeeze my face: prod the knuckly ridge of scar tissue in my eyebrow, then explore the blocky cartilage of my nose.</p><p>I told him I was 19 when it happened. I was in the back seat and my Australian friend was at the wheel, although it may have been her older brother. We were going … somewhere. Maybe Brisbane? To be honest, that whole day, and the days that followed, is blank. All I know is that we crashed into another vehicle and I was the only one not wearing my belt, as a result of which my face got mashed into the driver’s seat’s plastic headrest. Everyone else was OK. Or did my friend have whiplash? I can picture her in a neck brace.

<p>From Lily Allen’s withering takedown of self-obsessed fame to a ravaged painting in an attic, our critics pick culture about taking self-love too far</p><p>Ben Stiller’s satire on the fashion industry, Zoolander, is more a satire about media and celebrity generally – about people deeply in love with themselves – and it is a key text on modern narcissism. Stiller plays the “ridiculously good-looking” model Derek Zoolander, an empty-headed idiot, neurotically obsessed with being toppled from his status as the world’s No 1 runway model by an up-and-comer, Hansel, played by Owen Wilson. Derek has plans for an educational legacy project, a Center for Kids Who Can’t Read Good. But Derek’s masterpiece is his Blue Steel, the specific face he puts on for the cameras, a kind of intense, magnetic pouting stare. Blue Steel preceded social media by years but it is the great ancestor of the selfie craze that dominates Instagram and everything else. When we gaze lovingly into our own faces, framed by our smartphone screens, it is Derek Zoolander looking back at us.<em> Peter Bradshaw</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/27/cultural-prescription-music-film-art-books-tv-narcisissm">Continue reading...</a>

Here is an extract.</p><p>Under the plan, 16 areas in England and Wales will be funded to support either new ‘hotspot’ police and enforcement patrols in areas with the highest rates of anti-social behaviour, or trial a new ‘Immediate Justice’ scheme to deliver swift and visible punishments. A select few areas will trial both interventions, and following these initial trailblazers, both schemes will be rolled out across England and Wales from 2024.</p><p>The Conservatives have let antisocial behaviour make people’s lives a misery by slashing neighbourhood police and letting offenders get away without punishment. They have been content to oversee crumbling frontline services meaning these crimes are now plaguing communities, blighting town centres and leaving people feeling unsafe.</p><p>Under 13 years of Conservative government, community sentences have plummeted by two-thirds. And now they have finally realised how angry local people are, so once again following where Labour has led by trying to copy our plan on tough community payback.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/mar/27/labour-rishi-sunak-anti-social-behaviour-snp-scotland-humza-yousaf-kate-forbes-ash-regan-uk-illegal-migration-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

British director Paul Raschid – ambitiously for a 30-year-old – specialises in tending these mind-boggling gardens of forking paths. His latest The Gallery is a trenchant and thoughtful post-Brexit treatise that can be played on PCs and consoles, but it’s also doing the rounds in cinemas, where the group experience – including voting by glowstick – could work something like a referendum on modern Britain, given the film’s state-of-the-nation bent.</p><p>The Gallery has two separate but symmetrical timelines in 1981 and 2021. Plus ça change: both spotlight a reeling and fractured Britain in which the Argyle Manor gallery, about to put on a portrait exhibition, becomes a microcosm for their respective social tensions. In the 1981 timeline, Morgan (Anna Popplewell), a young gallerist in a twinset, is taken hostage by bitter northern painter and would-be revolutionary Dorian (George Blagden). In 2021, Popplewell and Blagden switch roles, but the dilemma is the same: cede to the hostage-taker’s demands to hand over a prize portrait (of Thatcher in the first timeline; of a social-media influencer in the second), or get “Jackson Pollocked” by the bomb under their chair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/27/the-gallery-review-bloody-interactive-treatise-on-post-brexit-britain">Continue reading...</a>

The angst and impatience within the fanbase over the lack of trophies that affects the players? Or the players’ inability to cope with the pressure and win trophies that fires the angst and impatience?</p><p>Antonio Conte is not sure. But what the latest former Spurs manager came to feel was that both were present and incorrect at the club, shaping an environment that resembled the results of an attempt to sprint through quicksand. Or, to put it another way, the impossible job for a manager. Any manager.

<p>Supreme shotmaker has positioned herself as one of the game’s elite with understated self-belief and calmness under pressure</p><p>Elena Rybakina stepped up to the baseline to face match point in the Miami Open third round on Saturday night with her game in total disarray. While Paula Badosa had erected a wall on her side of the court, refusing to offer up any mistakes, Rybakina’s unforced errors piled up to the skies. She had missed countless routine backhands, she had shanked decisive drive volleys and her frustration increasingly surfaced as she trailed 6-3, 5-4. Her brief time in Florida, it seemed, was coming to an end.</p><p>Instead the pressure of standing a point from defeat steadied her. Rybakina slotted in a sweet, angled cross-court forehand winner to save the match point and, after a further flurry of point‑ending shots, the entire complexion of the match had changed. She was suddenly striking winners from all parts of the court, marching towards a third set. Badosa unloaded her own frustration at her team, covering her eyes with her left hand before mimicking forehand and backhand swings with her right. The implication was that Rybakina was swinging blindly and the ball just happened to be landing in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/mar/27/elena-rybakina-wimbledon-champion-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Best creative attacker is likely to determine whether Gareth Southgate can finally mould a genuine champion team</p><p>With 40 minutes gone at Wembley Stadium Bukayo Saka took the ball in the inside left channel, bumped away the yellow shirt at his back and produced that familiar whip‑crack turn, one of those moments where he just seems to have a weirdly preternatural grasp of the physics of movement, snaking off into spaces that aren’t, technically, supposed to be there. Perhaps this is one reason why he gets kicked a lot. There is no logical answer to this problem.</p><p>Saka had time to think about what to do next, a micro-second of processing time. The finish was ridiculous. Not novel or unorthodox: the left-foot shot curled across goal, starting outside the line of the post, hips opened out to make the angle. We know that angle. It’s drill, a set move.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/27/bukayo-saka-england-ukraine-euro-2024-qualifier-wembley">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The illegal migration bill would change the status of children and family groups in the UK asylum system. Surely we’re better than this</p><p>Earlier this month, a four-hour parliamentary debate on the illegal migration bill <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/mar/13/rishi-sunak-defence-spending-uk-us-australia-aukus-summit-joe-biden-anthony-albanese-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live">produced the expected majority</a> (63) to secure a second reading. But during that debate there was a potentially misleading clarification from the home secretary. Claiming that the opposition had mischaracterised the bill’s proposals, Suella Braverman carefully noted that the government would not be detaining children. Or rather, for those who listened carefully, it would not be detaining <em>unaccompanied</em> children.</p><p>Good. But although unaccompanied children may not be detained, other children will be. The government is proposing to change the status of children and family groups in the UK asylum system. And in doing so it will overturn 12 years of established cross-party consensus in the UK that we are not a country that detains children and families for solely administrative immigration purposes. This policy was agreed by senior Conservatives still sitting in parliament. To overturn it would be a deeply, deeply regressive act.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/27/children-detention-uk-illegal-migration-bill-asylum">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This voyeuristic account of an eccentric who broadcasts himself hunting naked never meaningfully addresses his paradoxical existence</p><p>Having resolved to extricate himself from the chains of civilisation, Nils Leidal has taken solitary refuge among the mountains of Norway. While his basically furnished shed and daily rituals of scavenging and ice baths hark back to a simpler way of life, the sixtysomething is also glued to his internet-connected smartphone. The paradox is beguiling: how does one maintain a philosophy of self-sufficiency while simultaneously broadcasting his existence online?</p><p>Unfocused in its structure, Joost van der Wiel’s muddled documentary grapples with these fascinating contradictions on a superficial level. Apart from Nils’ vague distrust of the government, as evidenced in a video in which he burns his passport, the film offers little information about his background or the reasons behind his self-imposed exile. Punctuated by nondescript drone shots of the beautiful landscape, Drømmeland is mostly preoccupied with Nils’ more eccentric behaviour, like his rueful moaning to a lover on the phone, or his habit of hunting in the nude. Haphazardly edited with little consideration for his state of mind, these sequences come off as voyeuristic or plain strange.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/27/drmmeland-review-hermit-and-his-smartphone-in-the-norwegian-wilderness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US author’s zingy new novel tackles celebrity, lockdown and frustrated love lives with ambition and panache</p><p>C<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/curtis-sittenfeld">urtis Sittenfeld</a>’s previous novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/24/rodham-by-curtis-sittenfeld-review-hill-minus-bill">Rodham</a></em>, a counterfactual life of Hillary Clinton, imagined how things might have turned out for her and, by extension, the US had she not married Bill. Among the most audacious of the various novels responding to Trumpism, it yoked high-concept thought experiment to a rompy whole-life saga, to distinctly mixed reviews. If the sniggerers couldn’t get over the novel’s sex scenes, it was perhaps only a mark of a bigger obstacle, which was that the real Hillary loomed unhelpfully in readers’ minds.<br /><br />The purer pleasure of her zingy new novel deserves more widespread approval. <em>Romantic Comedy</em> – a title of impressively Ronseal-like clarity – is tighter than <em>Rodham</em> but it’s ambitious too, navigating with unfussy panache tricky yet somehow already well-tilled terrain such as Covid-19 and modern celebrity as well as writing itself, a subject few novels manage to portray without accusations of self-indulgence.<br /><br />It starts in 2018, taking us through a week in the life of its narrator, Sally, a thirtysomething divorcee who writes for The Night Owls, a fictitious New York sketch show resembling <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. The frenzy of her schedule, from Monday afternoon pitch meeting to midweek all-nighter to small-hours “after-after-party”, leaves little time for much beyond dating-app hookups. But when the show’s guest host, heart-throb pop star Noah, starts to flirt – if Sally is reading the signs right – it threatens to upend the logic of the sketch she’s been working on: a routine, gently pointed at a male colleague dating a bombshell actor, about why it is that gorgeous women go out with averagely attractive men, but never the other way around.<br /></p><p><br />In <em>Rodham</em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/10/curtis-sittenfeld-on-american-wife-i-thought-democrats-wouldnt-read-it-because-it-was-about-a-republican">American Wife</a></em>, about a fictionalised first lady akin to Laura Bush, Sittenfeld gave us the heady sense of peeking behind the curtain and part of <em>Romantic Comedy</em>’s thrill is the sense that it’s giving us the inside track on an industry. The structure of the novel’s first third, centred on the frenzied tension of the week-long countdown to live transmission, is electrically compelling, with steady warmth as well as drama generated by the camaraderie and jostling for preferment among writers and actors hoping their ideas are the ones that will make the cut. Sittenfeld even manages to create page-turning interest from the nuts and bolts of composition, putting it at the heart of the novel’s early will-they-won’t-they? frisson, when Sally improves Noah’s own idea for a skit.<br /><br />Throughout, the novel’s command of structure, pace and dialogue is faultless. Sally and Noah almost kiss after the show, but instead she contrives to thoughtlessly insult him – and next thing, the novel cuts to lockdown in 2020. The hectic opening segment gives way to something aptly slower, a period portrayed as an exchange of emails between the two characters after Noah reopens contact.<br /><br />Part of the fun of this long middle section is getting the chance to observe for ourselves how Sally – a writer, after all – evidently feels more in control from behind a keyboard and there’s quiet humour in how she finds ways to gradually up the stakes by casually mentioning what she’s wearing and how hot it is.<br /><br />Soon another real-life meeting is on the cards – <em>Rodham’</em>s reception hasn’t put Sittenfeld off sex scenes – but not everything is plain sailing. For a start, there’s social media; Sally can’t quite help seeing comments: “Nhoa Brewster would never date a women who looks like that shes obvously his assitant.” There’s the matter of her widowed stepfather, too, vulnerable and alone in the pandemic, as well as the potential for awkwardness when you fall in love with someone rich enough to enable your dreams – the novel’s title, as well as flagging the contents, refers to Sally’s ambition to write romcom screenplays.<br /><br />Still, while Sittenfeld knows the dramatic value of putting obstacles in the path of characters you’re rooting for, she also isn’t above giving readers what they want – and that’s exactly what she does in this affable, intelligently crafted tale of work and love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/27/romantic-comedy-by-curtis-sittenfeld-review-lights-camera-attraction">Continue reading...</a>

They say things like “Gosh, I’d love to do that,” and “That’s so bohemian of you!,” and “It must be so peaceful”. It is peaceful, sometimes, but it’s easy to forget that when you’re struggling to push open a heavy lock gate in the pouring rain with a screaming baby strapped to your chest. Still, I love the way I live: I love being close to the water, and feeling more connected to nature and in sync with the changing seasons than I did living on land.</p><p>That isn’t to say boat life was always the plan. I used to imagine I’d end up in some rambling old farmhouse, with Farrow &amp; Ball wallpaper, period features and an open fire. I still get pangs when I visit friends’ seemingly enormous and lavishly equipped houses – upstairs <em>and</em> downstairs! A freezer! Hot taps! But for my husband, Nigel, and I, with our ill-paid, bookish jobs (I’m a writer, he’s a librarian. OK fine, <em>my</em> ill-paid job) along with, you know, The Economy, buying a house just isn’t feasible, especially where we live in Oxford. But owning his own home has always been important to Nige, who grew up in council housing, so we began to explore alternative options. Once we let go of the impossible goal of a house and focused instead on what we could afford, everything changed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/27/living-on-a-boat-rental-market">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the Roy family’s fleet of helicopters land for their final outing, there’s no point in resisting this sumptuous programme. There really is nothing else like this on TV</p><p>I’m about to articulate one of the most controversial opinions of 2023, so do whatever you need to brace yourself: I’ve never really got Succession. Before you start, yes, I can see that it’s good. Yes, I can see that it is sumptuous, dense and brilliant, and that at its best it has some of the finest dialogue not just on TV now but on TV ever. I know it’s a thinly veiled portrait of the Murdochs and it’s whip-smart and Machiavellian.</p><p>But, sometimes, watching it I feel as if I’m being cornered at a party by someone telling me about a non-fiction book I “have to read” while I watch other people laughing and having fun. It feels clever in the same way that putting your hand up and saying the right answer in a classroom is clever: in a smug and self-satisfied way. Truly, over three seasons, I’m not sure Succession has ever matched the dagger-like family dynamics of the Christmas episode of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/apr/16/peepshowisthebestcomedyo">Peep Show</a> that preceded it.

## ‘A tough time – but so exciting’: cult film-maker Vivienne Dick on post-punk New York

<p>She fled rural Ireland and hit the Big Apple just in time to capture Lydia Lunch, James Chance and the post-punk scene take off. Now back in her home country, she relives those turbulent years</p><p>In 2014, the Irish Times ran a profile of the film-maker Vivienne Dick with the headline: <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/vivienne-dick-stifled-in-ireland-celebrated-in-new-york-1.1766850">“Stifled in Ireland, celebrated in New York.”</a> As an encapsulation of her formative years as an artist who found her calling in exile, it was blunt but pretty accurate. “There was nothing for me in Ireland back then,” says Dick of her youth in the 1960s and early 70s. “It was not an attractive place because, as a woman, you were essentially treated as a second-class citizen. You could train as a teacher, but that was about it. I remember I bought a camera, but there was no way to even get on a course.”</p><p>Having relocated to New York by the mid-70s, after various overland adventures that took her to Pakistan, Nepal and even Kabul, she found herself instinctively drawn to Manhattan’s edgy, bohemian downtown scene, where would-be artists, musicians and writers had colonised the low-rent apartments and makeshift studios of what was then a deprived, drug-ridden neighbourhood. There she hung out with many of the characters who would go on to define Manhattan’s legendary post-punk No Wave movement: the likes of Lydia Lunch (of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks), Pat Place (Bush Tetras), James Chance and Adele Bertei (the Contortions). Her films capture these maverick outsiders at the very moment the scene congealed into a fleeting but incredibly fertile cultural moment – all attitude and dissonance – that still resounds today.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/27/vivienne-dick-new-york-post-punk-scene-lydia-lunch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He often plays the quintessential British hero, but the actor also makes a fine villain.

He is 76 and has one of those faces that holds its adamantine shape, although its seriousness is offset by his easy, expansive manner, the relaxed confidence and ready laugh of a person who is “doing this fantastic job that I’ve been all over the world with. I get paid pretty well. Something has to be really bad for me to turn it down, otherwise I keep on doing it.”</p><p>The restaurant staff love him.

<p>Covid accelerated a decline in vaccinations in England. We have to make a stronger case for them, and ensure everyone can get them</p><p>In 1959, at the age of 29, the promising <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/dec/09/fogotten-story-jeff-hall-death-polio-birmingham-city">England footballer Jeff Hall</a> died of polio. His death sent shock waves across Britain, and caused an immediate change in attitudes towards vaccination, from complacency to a sudden rush to clinics. A polio vaccine had been available for three years, but takeup was low. After Hall’s death, the demand was so high that vaccines had to be flown in from the US. As the Daily Express <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/dec/09/fogotten-story-jeff-hall-death-polio-birmingham-city">put it</a>: “In the past 10 years over 3,000 people have died of polio in England and Wales. But it took the death of one footballer to get [people] pouring into the clinics.” More than half a century later, we may be returning to complacency when it comes to getting children vaccinated.</p><p>The past decade has seen a <a href="https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/news-events/news/paediatricians-respond-worrying-decline-childhood-immunisation-rates-england#:~:text=A%20d%5B%E2%80%A6%5D%20in%20London">decline in the uptake</a> of almost all routine vaccinations for children in England.

## Rabbit Hole review – Kiefer Sutherland’s fun new thriller is like 24 … but even wilder

<p>The one-time Jack Bauer is having the time of his life alongside Charles Dance in this high-tension conspiracy drama – and then it turns on a dime and goes absolutely berserk</p><p>At this point in Kiefer Sutherland’s career, the quality of his projects doesn’t really matter. Sutherland has developed a built-in fanbase (for transparency, I am one such built-in fan) who would quite happily watch anything he makes, so long as he’s slightly weary, slightly rushed and mutters to himself like the world very literally depends on it. Is this a coded way of saying that I wish 24 was still on TV? Why yes. Yes it is.</p><p>The good news about this new thriller, Rabbit Hole, is that it isn’t a million miles away from 24. Kiefer Sutherland plays John Weir, a corporate espionage expert who finds himself neck-deep in an enormous conspiracy. There are shadowy figures. There are characters guided through high-tension situations while wearing earpieces. There are moments where Kiefer Sutherland sees something catastrophic about to happen, but is too far away to stop it, so he just shouts “NO!”, and then it happens anyway. This is well-worn territory but, God, I want it fed to me like peeled grapes to a Roman emperor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/27/tv-review-rabbit-hole">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus ‘irresponsible’, says Nato; Ukrainian military says Russian attack on Avdiivka is devastating</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion">What we know on day 397 of the invasion</a></li></ul><p>NATO says <strong>Vladimir</strong> <strong>Putin’s</strong> plan to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus “dangerous and irresponsible” and a threat to Russia’s nuclear non-proliferation commitments.</p><p>Putin likened his Belarus plan on Saturday to the U.S. stationing its weapons in Europe, insisting Russia would not violate its nuclear non-proliferation promises.</p><p>NATO is vigilant and we are closely monitoring the situation.

<p>The UK government continues to claim that there were no civilian casualties as a result of its bombing campaign against Islamic State militants in Iraq. Emma Graham-Harrison reports from Mosul on the evidence that cannot any longer be ignored</p><p>Britain’s government and military have for years stood by the claim that in terms of protecting ordinary Iraqis, the UK fought a “perfect” war against Islamic State militants in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq">Iraq</a>. For all the bombs dropped on cities such as Mosul, the official position is that only militants were killed. Not a single civilian death is acknowledged.</p><p>For the Guardian’s foreign correspondent <strong>Emma Graham-Harrison</strong>, the claim of a perfect war seemed self-evidently unlikely. She tells <strong>Michael Safi </strong>how working with the non-profit organisation Airwars, she was able to piece together a very different picture of the war. One where numerous casualties could be inferred from data that showed civilian casualties resulting from bombs that only British missiles could have caused.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/mar/27/exposing-myth-britain-perfect-war-against-islamic-state-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
