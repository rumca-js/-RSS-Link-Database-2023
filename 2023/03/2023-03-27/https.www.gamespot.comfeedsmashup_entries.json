[{"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Ra Ra Boom Is A Heartfelt Take On The Classic Beat-'em-Up Genre", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">At first glance, Ra Ra Boom looks like an energetic brawler with a badass cast of women unleashing fists, kicks, and bullets on waves of robot baddies, each hit punctuated with rainbow-colored explosions as metal body parts sail across the screen. It is absolutely what it looks like: vibrant, energetic, and full of character. But look a little closer, and right alongside the Lisa Frank color palette and the Saturday-morning-cartoon aesthetic, you'll find a story about a group of young women not just battling robots, but overcoming their own grief and internal struggles in the process.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">During my hands-off preview, I got a little insight into this part beat-'em-up, part run-and-gun game, and the tricky balance studio Gylee Games has had to strike in telling an intimate story of loss and personal growth within a genre that rarely leaves room for emotional resonance. \"It's a constant balancing act,\" CEO and writer Chris Bergman told me. During one of the opening levels I had seen, the charismatic characters would banter back and forth in the midst of battling robots that were exploding into nuts and bolts. \"We probably cut 40 minutes of cutscenes and dialogue from the first level so we could keep the pacing up, but [kept] just enough to give the player an idea of who these girls are.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In Ra Ra Boom, the people of Earth have solved climate change with the aid of artificial intelligence. So how did AI solve global warming? Well, by eliminating its most predominant cause: mankind. In an attempt to save the world, humans created an AI that, in turn, created an army of robots that began to wipe out the human race. So in an attempt to survive, humans fled the planet and began to colonize on spaceships. Despite the growing trend of AI tools making constant headlines in our reality of 2023, Bergman assured me that it was purely coincidental, as production began years prior, in 2020. But not all themes were unintentional, specifically grief and personal growth.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ra-ra-boom-is-a-heartfelt-take-on-the-classic-beat-em-up-genre/1100-6512742/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ra-ra-boom-is-a-heartfelt-take-on-the-classic-beat-em-up-genre/1100-6512742/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-27 20:52:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "El Paso, Elsewhere Is A Supernatural Take On Max Payne Shooting To Its Own Rhythm", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">There's no dancing around it: El Paso, Elsewhere, the new action game from Strange Scaffold, is an unabashed homage to the 2001 seminal pulp-noir action classic Max Payne. It's an obvious influence that writer, director, and voice actor Xalavier Nelson Jr. isn't shying away from, but is hoping to elevate for a modern audience. During my hands-on preview of the game, he told me, \"I'm not interested in recreating Max Payne; I'm interested in seeing what Max Payne could be next.\" And for eclectic developer Strange Scaffold, that means a supernatural neo-noir blood-stained journey through a dimension-shifting motel to stop the world from being overrun by vampires.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You play as James Savage, a folklore researcher and drug addict on the hunt for his ex-girlfriend, Draculae, who has shacked up in a motel where she plans a ritual to destroy the world. That doesn't sound like your typical noir story, but all the pillars are there: a stoic and flawed protagonist spouting out fourth-wall-breaking quips in poetic prose; a femme fatale at the center of melodramatic plot of love, loss, and betrayal; and lots and lots of gun shells, violence, and substance abuse. \"We're trying to adapt those pulp sensibilities for a modern audience,\" Xalavier told me, with an emphasis on shifting it into neo-noir.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I'm a hardcore fan of the first two Max Payne games, and if there's one thing El Paso, Elsewhere nailed, it's the familiar feel of its movement and shooting. The way James Savage was front-and-center in frame; the slightly elevated camera angle; and the flow and motion of his trenchcoat as I strafed through guns blazing--these are small details, but their subtle nuances were represented in a way that satisfied me as a Max Payne enthusiast. I sprinted through the halls of a maze-like motel that twisted and transformed around every corner, making it feel more like something out of an evolving nightmare. I followed a blood trail into a bathroom stall door that opened into a blood-soaked industrial kitchen. A hall transformed into a graveyard, bathed in green and purple neon lighting. I was able to explore these spaces while rolling, diving, and jumping through the air in slow-motion, firing off guns akimbo at werewolves and vampires to the pulsating beats of a horror hip-hop soundtrack. The controls were intuitive to me <em>because </em>of my intimacy with Max Payne; I knew if I hit the Tab key, I'd take painkillers to restore my health, or if I right-clicked, I'd go into a bullet-time dodge through the air.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/el-paso-elsewhere-is-a-supernatural-take-on-max-payne-shooting-to-its-own-rhythm/1100-6512741/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/el-paso-elsewhere-is-a-supernatural-take-on-max-payne-shooting-to-its-own-rhythm/1100-6512741/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-27 20:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Company Of Heroes 3 Gets Big Update With Operation Sapphire Jackal", "description": "<p>Relic has announced that <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/company-of-heroes-3/\">Company of Heroes 3</a> will be getting its first major update, Operation Sapphire Jackal, for free tomorrow, March 28.

And though some have criticized the upcoming game for looking too distinct from other series entries, these eagle-eyed fans have uncovered a number of apparent references to other FF games.</p><div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Introducing a closer look at the world of Valisthea in Final Fantasy XVI. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FF16?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">#FF16</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ezqxe35Co1\">pic.twitter.com/ezqxe35Co1</a></p>  \u2014 FINAL FANTASY XVI (@finalfantasyxvi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1639705413930168322?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">March 25, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir=\"ltr\">The below thread compiled by Twitter user MKH13Omasters shows off the various references, and they range from very compelling to a bit of a reach. For example, several fans pointed out that the game's battle theme has certain similarities to a song from Final Fantasy 8 titled Don't Be Afraid.</p><div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\">This thread is other Final Fantasy References in Final Fantasy XVI<br />starting with Final Fantasy <a href=\"https://t.co/PUl6XXIYB3\">pic.twitter.com/PUl6XXIYB3</a></p>  \u2014 The Dragoon\ud83d\udd25/Keyblade Master \ud83d\udddd/Child of Fate (@MKH13Omasters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MKH13Omasters/status/1640069534039310336?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">March 26, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir=\"ltr\">Several of the other apparent references cite similarities in imagery from game to game. For example, the top tweet posits that one screenshot is a reference to the original Final Fantasy's title screen. Another shows off a short video of a glittering blue crystal. You could argue that these motifs appear not just in Final Fantasy, but in broader media, but it's clear that developer Square Enix has made an attempt to remind fans that XVI is a Final Fantasy game after all.

Its original blend of dark comedy and shocking violence entertained in a manner typically reserved for exploitative/grindhouse releases but with a wider appeal. Critics and horror fans are mostly united on just how \"groovy\" Evil Dead can be.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The original Evil Dead film was elevated from a well-received late-night experience to a certified cult classic, thanks in part to the talents of director Sam Raimi and famed actor Bruce Campbell. In fact, it became such a fan-favorite that it would go on to spawn several sequels, a remake, and even a TV show. The latest entry, Lee Cronin's Evil Dead Rise, is scheduled to release in theaters on April 21.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Evil Dead Rise will serve as a revamp of sorts. Gone are the old towns and cabins in the woods. Instead, there's a high rise apartment building for our heroes to battle in. And from what can be seen of the trailers, the movie places an emphasis on dark humor and brutally violent encounters making it a must see for fans.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To celebrate Evil Dead's return to the big screen, we've decided to rank the entire franchise from decent to best (as opposed to bad to good). Because honestly, it would be easier to disembowel a deadite than to outright hate on any of the previously released entries, including the whacky Ash vs. Evil Dead TV series.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Note: This list encompasses the Evil Dead films and television series. It doesn't include the video games, comic books and the Evil Dead Musical though they all are worth checking out in their own right.</strong></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Army of Darkness (1993)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1732/17320263/4116812-01-evil-dead.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Army of Darkness bookended the original Evil Dead trilogy in absurdity. Instead of offering fans a follow-up that was tonally similar to Evil Dead 2, Sam Raimi and co. leaned into the franchises' comedic aspects. And while it does work as a follow-up plotwise, the movie feels like a parody of the first two films; there isn't a frightful event to speak of, let alone champion.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The comedy isn't as dark as one would expect. Instead, the gags are more in line with a Leslie Nielsen movie than an Evil Dead installment. There's also the practical and hit-or-miss special effects, a noticeable issue given the movie's scope. Individual deadites looked great. The army of skeletons and some larger monstrosities, not so much.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That said, Army of Darkness still proves to be a fun watch thanks to Bruce Campbell's charm and the film's overall campy vibe. Seeing Ash battle various monsters (including mini versions of himself) in the middle ages using a chainsaw and shotgun combo is guaranteed to at least garner a few chuckles.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Ash vs. Evil Dead (2015-2018)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1732/17320263/4116813-02-evil-dead.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Ash vs. Evil Dead show was a fan-centered treat. It had almost everything they could want: a ton of gore, bad one-liners, endearing new characters, a plot filled with demonic lore--it even featured a return to the franchise's iconic cabin.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Ash vs. Evil Dead wasn't very scary. Aside from a few scenes here and there, it was void of any thrilling, pulse-pounding moments. Instead, the emphasis was placed on having a bloody good time with likable characters. Ray Santiago's Pablo is a standout. His turn from naive side-kick into a bonafide hero is a treat to watch. Dana DeLorenzo and Lucy Lawless are also great as the tough-as-nails Kelly Maxwell and surprisingly evil Ruby Knowby, respectively. The entire cast seemed to enjoy hamming it up on screen as much as the fans enjoyed laughing at them. Essentially, the Ash vs. Evil Dead show was cheesy in all the right ways.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There were some issues when it came to the show's plot. One being the reluctance to kill off key characters. It didn't matter if they became possessed or were actually \"murdered\", they'd always find their way back. This treatment weakened some of the more heartfelt moments. It also removed any sense of fear associated with a character's demise; it's hard to care about a wild cliffhanger when one considers how the heroes always seemed to make it through despite actually dying in the process.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. The Evil Dead (1981)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1732/17320263/4116814-03-evil-dead.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The original Evil Dead movie is a classic. It not only helped in launching the careers of both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, it also introduced the world to the deadite scourge. Things start out spooky enough. An old cabin in the woods, a group of college students, the book of the dead--what could go wrong? Apparently, everything.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sam Raimi didn't pull any punches when it came to depicting the violent deaths of his cast. This resulted in a gory and, at times, outright disgusting movie that scared the pants off viewers. There was some humor of course--a character becoming possessed after accidentally swallowing a flying eyeball is as silly as it sounds.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Evil Dead has aged quite a bit, and the prosthetic makeup and stop-motion animation don't hold up as well as one would hope. Still, the movie remains unnerving to watch. Acting as a blueprint of sorts for the franchise, with the emphasis placed on shocking body horror over comedy, it's a solid horror movie.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Evil Dead (2013)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1732/17320263/4116815-04-evil-dead.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Fede \u00c1lvarez's take on the Evil Dead is gruesome. Instead of trying to emulate the comedic elements found in the Sam Raimi films, \u00c1lvarez wisely takes a different approach--that being to lean into the horror side of things. The result is a disturbingly violent movie that not only lives up to the Evil Dead name but also introduces a darker path for subsequent movies to follow.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2013's Evil Dead does have its faults though. Some of the jump scares are diluted by how predictable they are. The horror is further subdued by scenes that overstay their welcome, making it easier to become desensitized to the frequent blood letting. And considering how it's a reimagining of the first movie, it isn't as unique or shocking as it could have been.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That said, it still offers a thrilling experience for Evil Dead fans and newcomers alike. The movie's plot is engaging. It features a cast of likable characters, the occasional dumb choice notwithstanding. There are some genuinely creepy moments, and the body horror is pushed to an extreme level, especially when it comes to the main antagonist. There is a lot to like here. So much so that it's rather easy to look over some of the movie's shortcomings.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Evil Dead 2 (1987)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1732/17320263/4116816-05-evil-dead.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Evil Dead 2 is a certified cult classic. A near-perfect combination of humor and horror, this re-quel (sequel/prequel) is easily the best film in the Evil Dead franchise. It features the Ash fans have come to love, hilarious slapstick comedy, and some truly terrifying moments--it proved once and for all that old decrepit cellars aren't safe to venture down into, even when armed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, Evil Dead 2 is also silly and as over-the-top as any other movie on this list. That doesn't stop it from being wildly entertaining, though. If anything, the madness on screen gives credence to the plot. Thematically, everything works as intended, gory bits and all.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-evil-dead-movie-and-show-ranked-from-good-to-groovy/2900-4694/", "date_published": "2023-03-27 16:24:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Get This 1TB Samsung SSD For PS5 For As Low As $75", "description": "<p>If you're running out of space on your PS5--it's surprisingly easy to fill up the drive--you may want to consider picking up an internal SSD.
