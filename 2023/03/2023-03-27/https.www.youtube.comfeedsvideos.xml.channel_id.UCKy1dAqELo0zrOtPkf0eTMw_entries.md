Co-production designer Dylan Cole and his team conceive of the marine creatures required for Avatar: The Way of Water while James Cameron and his stunt team devise extraordinary means to bring those creatures to life in a performance capture tank.

The Metkayina have a unique and spiritual relationship with the tulkun, a species of sentient whale-like creatures that can grow to 300-feet long. The character of Payakan is an adolescent tulkun who befriends Jake and Neytiri’s son Lo’ak, though like the Na’vi teen, Payakan also is something of an outcast—the two communicate using sign language.

20th Century Studios’ and James Cameron’s Avatar: The Way of Water will be available from all major digital retailers on March 28.
