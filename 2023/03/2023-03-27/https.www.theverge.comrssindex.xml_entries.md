  <p id="escpMC">After two weekends of lengthy server queues, and a brief taste of the game’s opening areas and five classes, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23639562/diablo-4-open-beta-access-pc-console"><em>Diablo IV</em> beta</a> is officially over. I personally didn’t get to play too much since I was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23654583/gdc-2023-best-indie-games-venba-cart-life">doing other things</a>, but I enjoyed the brief time I got to spend in Sanctuary. </p>
<p id="Wjq6TV">I went into both weekends as a Barbarian. I played a Sorceress in <em>Diablo II</em>, and the ill-conceived Witch Doctor in <em>Diablo III</em> so I wanted something with a bit more in-your-face brutality. As a relative newcomer to the series, <em>Diablo IV</em> seems like a perfect <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">“no thoughts, head empty” kind of game</a>.

  <p id="8egRnz">So I read through<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8680-23"> the CFTC complaint</a> against the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, and it seems like the lawyers are having fun with this one. For instance: “Binance’s decision to prioritize commercial success over compliance with US law has been, as Lim paraphrased Zhao’s position on the matter, a ‘biz decision.’” I never get tired of reading these complaints.</p>
<p id="GbSUhl">Now to be clear, I don’t think Binance is the only entity ever to decide that skirting US law to acquire more customers — after all, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/johnson-johnson-pay-more-22-billion-resolve-criminal-and-civil-investigations">US pharma companies </a>have been making <a href="https://www.justice.gov/civil/cpb/case/us-v-eli-lilly-and-company-zyprexa">billion-dollar settlements</a> over that exact same “biz decision.” But I do think explicitly writing that you are deliberately doing that is a real clown move.

  <p id="CPMJeD">It’s that time of year: new emoji season! Apple’s just-launched iOS 16.4 update adds emoji like a moose, a goose, a pink heart, and importantly for <em>Verge</em> readers, a Wi-Fi symbol. I’m <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode">something of an emoji fan</a>, so I’m personally thrilled to have a few more options, though I’m still thinking of a clever use for the jellyfish emoji. Emojipedia has <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/first-look-new-emojis-in-ios-16-4/">a good overview</a> of the emoji that are being added, if you want to know ahead of time.</p>
<p id="UvKqvB">The update doesn’t just bring new emoji; there are a handful of other small additions as well.

The planned experiment was revealed last week alongside <a href="https://www.levistrauss.com/2023/03/22/lsco-partners-with-lalaland-ai/">Levi’s partnership with Lalaland.ai</a>, a digital fashion studio that creates realistic AI-generated fashion models.</p>
<p id="H8iyft">Currently, most products advertised on the Levi’s app or website can only be viewed on a single clothing model. The AI clothing models created by this partnership could be more body-inclusive, allowing customers to view what an article of clothing would look like on a multitude of models spanning a wide range of body types, ages, sizes, and skin tones. In theory, that should help consumers who are frustrated when clothing...</p>

<p id="xA82NT">Staff affected by this first round will hear from leaders “over the next four days,” according to Iger. The second round of cuts, which is set to encompass “several thousands” of people, will happen sometime in April. The third round will happen “before the beginning of the summer.”</p>
<p id="2AYymr">Iger first revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23590901/disney-layoffs-earnings-streaming-bob-iger">in February</a> that the company was planning the cuts, meaning that employees have been waiting for weeks to know if they’ll still have a job at Disney.

  <p id="jPV9bU">There are plenty of movies about the last people on Earth, but — based on the first teaser trailer — <em>Biosphere</em> might be among the most charming. The directorial debut for Mel Eslyn, <em>Biosphere</em> stars Sterling K. Brown and Mark Duplass as humanity’s sole remaining survivors, who also happen to be best pals living together inside of the titular biosphere. It looks very cozy. They even play video games.</p>

<blockquote><p id="8stbrn">In the not-too-distant future, Billy (Duplass) and Ray (Brown) are lifelong best friends, brothers from another mother they also happen to be the last two men on earth.

Like an OLED, the U8H’s Mini LED panel produces some excellent color contrast and detail, but unlike the pricier displays, a Mini LED better handles brightly lit rooms while running a lower risk of burn-in.</p>

  <p id="xeQCXo">Quite possibly the biggest game of the year is getting an appropriately large gameplay reveal. Nintendo announced that will be releasing a presentation featuring “roughly 10 minutes of gameplay” from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23589488/nintendo-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-trailer-direct"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, the much-anticipated sequel to the defining <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>.</p>
<p id="uNUgtF">The presentation will be led by longtime series producer Eiji Aonuma, who has worked on <em>Zelda</em> since <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. It’ll be available on YouTube on March 28th at 10AM ET, and it sounds like the video will be entirely focused on the new <em>Zelda</em>.</p>

  <p id="U3aeM7">Lucid Motors <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=23V110">issued a recall</a> for 637 of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23509511/lucid-air-gt-review-specs-photos-price">luxury Air sedans</a> over a faulty switch in its electrical motor that could lead to a loss in power. </p>
<p id="jjxR9J">The issue is with electrically activated switches called contactors that “close at vehicle startup to transfer energy to and from the drive units, and open at vehicle shut down.” In a “small population” of contactors, the spring force may overcome the magnetic holding force, which could result in the switch unexpectedly opening, cutting off power to the electric motors. The connectors for 2022 and 2023 Lucid Air sedans are supplied by Sensata Technologies. </p>

  <p id="KEM30b">Zoom has become the latest productivity app to expand its use of artificial intelligence. In a blog <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-iq-smart-companion/">post published on Monday</a>, the company announced a partnership with OpenAI that brings AI-generated summaries, message drafts, and more to the video conferencing app through its Zoom IQ AI-powered assistant.</p>
<p id="RK6eMn">While Zoom IQ can already do things like create chapters and highlights for recorded meetings, Zoom’s giving the assistant even more features, including a way to catch up on meetings that you may have been late to. That means you’ll be able to ask the tool to summarize what you’ve missed as well as “ask further questions.”</p>

<p>When you find a good spatial audio song, Sonos’ new speaker can blow your mind and sounds like nothing else. But it trails the Sonos Five at stereo playback and suffers from the wildly inconsistent state of Atmos mixes.</p>
