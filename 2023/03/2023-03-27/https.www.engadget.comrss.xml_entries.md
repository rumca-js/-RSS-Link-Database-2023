<p>When Rode released the original Wireless GO, it was an instant success. The ease of use, audio quality and reasonable price made wireless microphones much more accessible. In fact it was so successful that it spawned a number of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mic-clip-on-lapel-175000217.html"><ins>copycat</ins></a> products from <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL21hY2tpZS5jb20vZW4vcHJvZHVjdHMvbWljcm9waG9uZXMvZW0td2F2ZS9lbV93YXZlX1hMUi5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlMGIwOTJkYS1iODgyLTRkODYtODc5MC00OGUzMWNmM2IzNDMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZd58sKghbckDsQc2MFy_yb6wlb9WaJKrhvNx0T9nzuQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmackie.com%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fmicrophones%2Fem-wave%2Fem_wave_XLR.html"><ins>rivals</ins></a>. After releasing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-wireless-go-ii-unveiled-150043322.html"><ins>Wireless GO II</ins></a> ($299) with dual mics, the company is back with a more affordable option - the $149 <a href="https://rode.com/es/microphones/wireless/wireless-me">Wireless ME</a>. There’s also a new video app called Rode Capture aimed at creators which offers tight integration with the Wireless ME and other products from the company.</p><p>If you’re thinking “more affordable” means fewer features, then you’d be right. But also you might be surprised. Even though there initially appears to be just one transmitter (mic) and one receiver, the latter also has a mic built-in so you can still record two speakers at the same time with their own separate audio files. That said, Rode is calling the second mic the “ME mic” and describes it as a “narrator” microphone because you can’t use it wirelessly (it’s the one that plugs into your recording device) so it can only really be used by someone off camera. That obviously is no problem if you’re not recording video, but worth knowing if you are.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are, of course, other minor compromises. For one, the receiver doesn’t have any type of display, so visual feedback for connectivity is limited to a pair of LEDs. There doesn’t appear to be any feedback for gain levels at all. There’s also no onboard storage for recording away from a camera, computer or a phone. This also means there’s no option to record a safety track at a lower gain level which, given the lack of a way to see levels means you’ll have to really be sure you have everything set right up front. As a reminder, though, the ME is half the price of the GO II.</p><figure><img alt="Rode's Wireless ME lav mic system connected to a phone." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/f6465890-cc87-11ed-bad6-824e6425a92b" style="height: 1240; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>There are tools to help, though. The Wireless ME comes with a feature called GainAssist which internally monitors the signal and sets levels automatically depending on your environment and the volume of the subject. This definitely helps keep things from clipping, but you can still go into the red with it. It appears to be using either a limiter or compression (or both) but you can still make it go into the red. There’s a “dynamic” mode too for when recording things with a more consistent volume than speech.</p><p>In terms of range, you can expect about 100 meters / 328 feet (line of sight) but in practice this can vary a little in either direction depending on the conditions. This is a shorter range than the Wireless GO II (200 meters /  656 feet) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mic-clip-on-lapel-175000217.html"><ins>DJI’s Mic</ins></a> (250 meters / 820 feet) but likely ample for most scenarios. As for battery life, it’s a respectable seven hours but there’s no charging case as with DJI or <a href="https://uk.ankerwork.com/products/a3320-m650-wireless-microphone"><ins>Anker’s</ins></a> solutions.</p><p>With no way to change settings directly on the device, you’ll want to get familiar with the Rode Central app. It’s here where you’ll be able to turn the receiver’s microphone on or off if you want to use it, change whether it records to one or two separate files (if using both mics) and adjust the gain settings. There are versions for both desktop and mobile (Android/iOS) so you can  change modes on the go, even if it’s a bit more involved than doing it on the receiver as with DJI and Anker’s products.</p><p>Given that the narrator-guest setup isn’t ideal for recording two speakers on camera at the same time it's a shame that the receiver doesn't have the option to plug an external 3.5mm lav mic into it. This would mean you could theoretically run one with a longer cable and have two on camera hosts. You can still use 3.5mm mics with the main transmitter though. Alternatively, if you have access to another transmitter, such as a Wireless GO II, you can pair it with the ME’s receiver and record up to three people at the same time – though two of them will have to share an audio channel in case having separate files for all speakers is important to you.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots of Rode's new video recording app " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/bd2dec50-cc8a-11ed-bdff-422115f583a3" style="height: 1007; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rode</div></figure><p>The interoperability between the Wireless GO II and the ME shows that Rode is thinking about how these products can work together, meaning creators can collaborate seamlessly with their own gear or continue using older products even as new ones come around. Expect to see more interoperability with other wireless devices in the future.</p><p>Along with the new microphone kit is the aforementioned <a href="https://rode.com/es/software/rode-capture">Capture app</a>. It’s a dedicated video app with a twist: direct access to the settings of compatible Rode microphones. Most video apps don’t even let you know what mic you’re using which can cause anxiety when you’re not sure it’s working with the one you plugged in. Having this assurance alone is useful and the direct access to microphone settings is always going to be a welcome bonus for creators. The app is entirely free and doesn’t require a Rode product to work but will need one of Rode's <a href="https://rode.com/es/software/rode-capture">compatible products</a> if you wish to access its settings.</p><p>The Wireless ME is available for $149 starting today.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/rodes-wireless-me-squeezes-a-second-mic-into-its-receiver-230032706.html?src=rss

## Lyft co-founder Logan Green is stepping down as CEO

<p>More than a decade into its life, Lyft is bringing on a new chief executive officer. On Monday afternoon, the company <a href="https://investor.lyft.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2023/Lyft-Announces-Leadership-Succession-Plan/default.aspx"><ins>announced</ins></a> current CEO and co-founder Logan Green would hand day-to-day operations of Lyft to David Risher, a former Amazon executive, on April 17th. That same day, Green will take over as chair of Lyft’s board of directors. The announcement is part of a larger executive shuffle that will also see Lyft president and co-founder John Zimmer move to the company’s board where he will serve as its vice chair. Zimmer’s last day as president will be June 30th.</p><p>Green and Zimmer founded Lyft in 2012 and successfully <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-01-lyft-ipo-s1-filing.html"><ins>took the company public in 2019</ins></a>. Since its IPO, however, the value of Lyft’s stock has dropped dramatically. Following an initial high of $78.29 per share in 2019, the stock hit a record low of $9.60 per share earlier today. On February 9th, the day Lyft announced its <a href="https://investor.lyft.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2023/Lyft-Announces-Q422-and-Fiscal-2022-Results/default.aspx"><ins>Q4 2022 </ins></a>results, the stock shed <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lyft-stock-melts-down-after-earnings-debacle-for-the-ages-45418807?mod=article_inline"><ins>36 percent of its value</ins></a> after Green delivered what was widely considered one of the worst earnings calls in recent memory, telling investors the company would need to increase spending to stay competitive with Uber. To say Lyft’s new CEO has his work cut out for him would be an understatement. The company has never reported a profit, and, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=111c4362-0f7f-48fd-83a0-5cf398008667&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Vox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxMTFjNDM2Mi0wZjdmLTQ4ZmQtODNhMC01Y2YzOTgwMDg2NjciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9yZWNvZGUvMjAyMC85LzI1LzIxNDU2NDIxL3doeS1zZWxmLWRyaXZpbmctY2Fycy1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLXN0aWxsLXllYXJzLWF3YXkiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjJiZWRkMjkyLTljN2EtNDYyNy1iMDliLWI1NTRlYWZhOWM1ZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfztD7JARHpOCE6v5jxrf01L2ebTHetJEpmRBH9d5qdn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Frecode%2F2020%2F9%2F25%2F21456421%2Fwhy-self-driving-cars-autonomous-still-years-away"><ins>barring a surprise breakthrough in autonomous driving</ins></a>, it has a difficult path ahead due to the economics of ride-sharing. Still, Risher is definitely qualified to turn Lyft around having previously served as Amazon’s first head of product and head of US retail.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lyft-co-founder-logan-green-is-stepping-down-as-ceo-221928157.html?src=rss

## Fitbit challenges, adventures and open groups join the Google graveyard today

<p>In February, Fitbit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-removing-open-groups-adventures-challenges-app-140024841.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> it would sunset open groups, adventures and challenges on March 27th. That day has arrived, and if you didn’t download your trophies before today, I’m sorry to say you missed your chance to do so. Last month, Fitbit said it was removing those features due to “limited use.”</p><p>If you’re a longtime Fitbit user, the demise of open groups, adventures and challenges is likely to come as a shame, particularly since two of them made the platform more social and were widely copied by the company’s competitors. Challenges, for instance, made it possible to motivate your friends and family to hit their daily step count. Meanwhile, open groups were a great way to meet other like-minded users, and there were some groups with hundreds of thousands of active users. Now those are gone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-challenges-adventures-and-open-groups-join-the-google-graveyard-today-204519144.html?src=rss

<p>China’s Chang’e 5 rover has found tiny glass beads containing water in an impact crater on the Moon. Samples collected from a 2020 mission found beads with water content as high as 2,000 parts per million (PPM). Given the prevalence of these glass spheres on the lunar surface, there <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9tb3JlLXdhdGVyLWZvdW5kLW9uLW1vb24tbG9ja2VkLWluLXRpbnktZ2xhc3MtYmVhZHMtMzM0YzVmZGUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJhYTBlZWJkLWJlNTQtNDlhOC05ZWFjLWZkYWI3NmIxNmNkNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaWDf4jPx9_RXdz9-t2PwCzQuaI7cyvo2pFhOrusPTqi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fmore-water-found-on-moon-locked-in-tiny-glass-beads-334c5fde">may be enough</a> to provide 71 trillion gallons of water.</p><p>Some beads formed when asteroids collided with the Moon millions of years ago, while others came from ancient volcanoes. Scientists believe the water originated from a chemical reaction when hydrogen ions emitted from the sun — transported to the lunar surface from solar winds — combined with oxygen atoms inside the beads. The water-filled beads are tiny, ranging from “tens of micrometers to a few millimeters.” Still, there are enough on the Moon’s surface to (theoretically) supply an estimated 270 trillion kilograms of water — enough to fill 100 million Olympic-sized swimming pools.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, scientists haven’t yet figured out how to collect them, and they would need to heat them to around 212 degrees Fahrenheit to extract water. Still, they could be a resource for future lunar settlements, where astronauts could use water for drinking, bathing, cooking, cleaning and even producing rocket fuel.</p><p>Scientists believe other moons in our Solar System may have similar beads. “Our direct measurements of this surface reservoir of lunar water show that impact glass beads can store substantial quantities of solar wind-derived water on the moon and suggest that impact glass may be water reservoirs on other airless bodies,” the study’s authors <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zNDE1NjEtMDIzLTAxMTU5LTYiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJhYTBlZWJkLWJlNTQtNDlhOC05ZWFjLWZkYWI3NmIxNmNkNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAe8iawU2mUNIbiyTAE0908BqNgsBXTGK5vC8ob0rZxLr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41561-023-01159-6">wrote</a>. “The presence of water, stored in impact glass beads, is consistent with the remote detection of water at lower-latitude regions of the Moon, Vesta and Mercury.

<p>You can add Ubisoft to the list of companies that won’t be attending the first in-person E3 in four years. Before this week, it was one of the few major publishers to come out in support of the revamped event. On Monday, however, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-pulled-out-of-e3-2023/"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>VGC</ins></em></a> it would not be at the tradeshow, and would instead host its own event at around the same time.</p><p>“E3 has fostered unforgettable moments across the industry throughout the years,” a Ubisoft spokesperson said. “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are no two ways about it, Ubisoft’s withdrawal from E3, particularly less than three months before the show is set to return on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/e3-2023-dates-announced-162713745.html"><ins>June 13th</ins></a>, raises serious questions about its near and long-term prospects.

Before that, Nintendo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-confirms-it-wont-be-at-e3-2023-184336696.html"><ins>confirmed</ins></a> it would not attend the event at all. Sony has yet to state whether it will be at E3 2023.

The order applies to all departments, including those involved in law enforcement, defense and intelligence. It also prohibits the use of spyware that in the past was used to disclose non-public information about the US government.</p><p>The executive order the Biden administration published on the White House website doesn’t include a list of affected spyware vendors. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/27/biden-order-commercial-spyware-ban/"><ins>Per </ins><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>, government officials declined to name specific firms when asked by reporters. However, the administration said the order includes US and foreign-made spyware. Judging from the criteria laid out in the order, known government spyware makers like Isreal’s NSO Group and Macedonia’s Cytrox are likely affected.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <em>TechCrunch</em> notes, security researchers have long warned of the dangers posed by commercial spyware. Such programs frequently target previously undisclosed vulnerabilities that make entire software ecosystems unsafe. In the case of NSO Group’s infamous Pegasus spyware, the firm exploited a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-8-macos-big-sur-11-6-security-updates-182807411.html"><ins>CoreGraphics vulnerability</ins></a> in iOS that allowed the program to infect an iPhone without the victim needing to <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/"><ins>tap anything</ins></a>. Moreover, while many governments claim to use spyware sparingly to investigate serious crimes, that hasn’t stopped some from using the software for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-israel-182952780.html"><ins>domestic surveillance</ins></a> and to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html"><ins>target political dissidents</ins></a>.</p><p>“We are very concerned about the threat of digital authoritarianism and practices around the world but we are also very cognizant that the misuse of technology can occur in any state,” a White House official <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3919985-biden-moves-to-prohibit-government-use-of-spyware-that-poses-national-security-risk/"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>The Hill</ins></em></a>. “So, we are taking steps to make sure that the way that we would like technology to be used is aligned with human rights and democratic principles all around the world.”</p><p>On Monday, the Biden administration said at least 50 US federal employees in 10 countries are either suspected or confirmed of having had their devices compromised by spyware. In one recent example, an unknown assailant used the Pegasus spyware to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-group-spyware-us-state-department-report-183647765.html"><ins>infect iPhones belonging to at least nine US State Department officials</ins></a> stationed in Uganda or whose work involved the East African country. The order follows questions about the US government’s alleged use of commercial spyware. Last fall, <em>The New York Times </em>reported that the FBI had considered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fbi-reportedly-considered-using-pegasus-spyware-195512125.html"><ins>using Pegasus in criminal investigations</ins></a>. Between late 2020 and early 2021, agency officials were reportedly in the “advanced” stages of developing plans to brief FBI leadership on the software.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-bans-federal-agencies-from-using-commercial-spyware-182812610.html?src=rss

<p>The NBA’s regular season ends in just a couple of weeks, but Google just surprise-dropped a major overhaul of its popular Pixel Arena feature. The original Pixel Arena was advertised as a virtual space for fans to fully experience the NBA, but there wasn’t much to do other than play trivia and watch 3D shot recaps. The new Pixel Arena, however, is chock-full of activities for the discerning basketball fan, according to an <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/all-new-nba-and-google-pixel-arena/"><ins>official blog post</ins></a>.</p><p>The biggest change is that users can now roam freely around the space, so the emphasis on menu-diving has been reduced in favor of natural exploration. As you roam about the virtual arena, you want to look your best for onlookers, so the avatar creation process has also been significantly overhauled. The updated avatar builder now takes more natural skin tones into consideration, with adherence to the 10-shade Monk Skin Tone (MST) scale.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google was also not shy about adding new virtual fashion and accessory options, saying there are now over a “trillion style combos inspired by futuristic streetwear and basketball culture.” Of course, each avatar comes with a fake Pixel 7 Pro because brand synergy. Additionally, the highlight clips tool has been updated, allowing users to remix 3D highlights by spotlighting specific viewing angles and the like.</p><p>Google and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nba/"><ins>the NBA</ins></a> have added some new mini-games to the roster, though they continue to be trivia-based. Still, the app is loaded with machine learning algorithms that automatically populate new trivia questions based on recent events. For instance, if a player scores a career high, you will likely encounter a relevant question sooner rather than later. All of those modes are available in single-player or multiplayer.

## Acer Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition review: Glasses-free 3D is just pointless
 - [https://www.engadget.com/acer-predator-helios-300-spatiallabs-edition-review-173058399.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/acer-predator-helios-300-spatiallabs-edition-review-173058399.html?src=rss)

<p>There's a vast gulf between the dreamy notion of glasses-free 3D – extra visual depth without any clunky eye-wear! – and the reality: fuzzy imagery, buggy execution, and headaches. Oh, the headaches. So it goes with Acer's Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition, equipped with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-spatiallabs-stereoscopic-view-134520222.html">company's glasses-free 3D screen</a>. It's meant to unlock an entirely new dimension of gameplay in titles like <em>God of War</em> and <em>Forza Horizon 5 – </em>and it does, to a degree. But it's also obscenely expensive, starting at $3,499, and its 3D functionality isn't worth losing the higher refresh rates and better quality screens you find on most other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">gaming laptops</a>.</p><p>When I've demoed glasses-free 3D in the past, it's always seemed like a potentially useful feature for deep-pocketed professionals, people who may want to check out their 3D models without slapping on a VR headset. That could very well be true, but the Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition convinced me that it serves practically no purpose in the gaming world, where players are often aiming to inject as many frames in their eyeballs as possible.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That's just not possible with this computer, since it's limited to a 15.6-inch 4K panel (which scales down to 1080p per eye in 3D mode) running at 60Hz. So at best, this gaming laptop is restricted to 60fps at a time when even budget machines can deliver enough power to fill 120Hz and 144Hz screens. The tradeoff for glasses-free 3D, ultimately, is responsiveness while gaming. The higher the refresh rate, the more silky smooth a game can appear. And when it comes to fast-paced shooters, it could make all the difference between a clutch headshot and digital oblivion.</p><p>Now if Acer's 3D technology was truly groundbreaking, perhaps that wouldn't matter so much. But while it can look good, it's a mere curiosity. Acer's TrueGame app lets you play a select handful of games in two different modes: 3D+, which shifts depth buffer pixels to deliver a vague depth effect, and 3D Ultra, which uses a virtual second camera to create a far more immersive sense of space. Eye tracking sensors above the screen help to direct two different sets of images to your eyes, a technique that's typical for glasses-free 3D displays, but that also means only one person can actually use the 3D feature. As for game support, there are only 9 games using 3D Ultra at the moment, including <em>God of War</em>, <em>Psychonauts 2</em> and <em>A Plague Tale: Innocence</em>. Acer says <a href="https://spatiallabs.acer.com/truegame/list">around 65 titles</a>, mostly older games, work with 3D+.</p><p>Competitive online shooters aren't supported at all – Acer claims their anti-cheat software prevents its 3D technology from being applied. That's a shame if you were hoping a bit of depth would make your <em>Warzone</em> or <em>Apex Legends</em> matches more rewarding. Honestly, you wouldn't want to play those in 3D either, as the technology generally makes games look less sharp. You can blame the slightly lower resolution for that, as well as the inherent haziness from having your eyes adjust to a 3D screen on the fly.</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme)</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5</p></td><td><p>Cinebench R23</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Acer Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition (2022, Intel i9-12900H, NVIDIA RTX 3080)</p></td><td><p>7,441</p></td><td><p>5 ,996</p></td><td><p>1,800/13,098</p></td><td><p>1,896/16,272</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Acer Predator Triton 500 SE (2022, Intel i9-12900H, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti)</p></td><td><p>6,779</p></td><td><p>4,887</p></td><td><p>1,736/11,382</p></td><td><p>1,774/17,329</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Razer Blade 15 (2022, Intel i7-12800H, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti)</p></td><td><p>7,085</p></td><td><p>4,798</p></td><td><p>1,795/9,529</p></td><td><p>1661/10,464</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus G14 (2022, AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS, Radeon RX 6800S)</p></td><td><p>7,170</p></td><td><p>3,821</p></td><td><p>1,543/9,839</p></td><td><p>1,521/12,212</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Playing <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> in 3D+ was almost like looking at a Magic Eye puzzle – I had to be in just the right spot to detect any depth. And if my eyes shifted a bit, I would sometimes lose the effect entirely. <em>God of War</em> fared better in 3D Ultra Mode, with a convincing sense of immersion similar to what you'd expect from a 3D film. Throwing Kratos's axe had the uncanny effect of going beyond the screen in my office, and at times the Helios 300 SL felt like a portal into another world.</p><p>Still, playing <em>God of War</em> in 3D almost instantly made my eyes tired. 3D Ultra relies on your brain constantly making sense of two different camera views. I sometimes felt motion sick while I was walking around the game, especially if I glanced over to my unmoving, clutter-filled desk. It was almost like playing the game in VR, sans the bulky headset. I found myself resting my eyes every 30 minutes or so, just like I do with VR headsets.</p><p>You could, of course, play any PC title in 2D on the Helios 300 SL, but why would you buy a $3,500 glass-free 3D laptop for that? Our review unit was equipped with an RTX 3080 and Intel Core i9-12900H CPU (an updated model with a 40-series GPU is coming in a few months). It was certainly beefy enough for any game I threw at it, especially since the display is limited to 60Hz. But playing <em>Halo Infinite</em> or <em>Overwatch 2</em> just didn't feel nearly as smooth as it did on the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE I reviewed last year. That $2,300 machine featured a gorgeous 240Hz 1,440p screen, which helped me line up sniper shots with ease.</p><section><img alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition side ports" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/7006f8e0-ccb7-11ed-beef-e6384476e86f" style="height: 1321; width: 2000;" /></section><p>Beyond its unique screen, the Predator Helios 300 SL looks like a typical Acer gaming laptop. Its matte metal case feels sturdy, and aside from a small lightbar up front, and per-key RGB lighting, there's none of the obnoxious bling we've seen on some high-end gaming PC. There's almost every port imaginable spread around the machine: Two USB 3.2 Type-A connections on the right side; with another Type A USB-port on the left side, beside a gigabit Ethernet and a headphone jack. On the rear, there's a USB-C Thunderbolt 4 connection, MiniDisplayport, HDMI and a DC power port.</p><p>Acer probably just wanted to keep the Helios 300 SL low-key, but with a unique feature like glasses-free 3D, it would have been nice to set its design apart from the sea of other black gaming laptops out there. It's also clear that the screen was the major priority: Its keyboard feels a bit too mushy for extended typing (though I appreciated the wide layout), and the trackpad isn't very responsive. I often had to click on icons several times before the trackpad responded.</p><p>If it had a better keyboard and trackpad, as well as a higher refresh rate screen, the Helios 300 SL could have been a potential option for professionals working with 3D models. Unfortunately, it's focused on gamers, and it's not nearly compelling enough for that crowd. Its mediocre battery life – 6 hours and 15 minutes, according to PCMark 10's office productivity benchmark – didn't help matters much either.</p><figure><img alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition keyboard and trackpad" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/70085870-ccb7-11ed-bd90-7513416965af" style="height: 1343; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>If, for some reason, glasses-free 3D is still compelling to you, there are few other options. Acer also sells a standalone 15.6-inch SpatialLabs screen for $1,100 – but I don't need to tell you that's a bad idea. The company's <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=56197a86-8c27-4ba2-9aa1-20de6e52c761&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Acer&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1NjE5N2E4Ni04YzI3LTRiYTItOWFhMS0yMGRlNmU1MmM3NjEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNlci5jb20vdXMtZW4vbW9uaXRvcnMvc3BhdGlhbGxhYnMjZmlsdGVySGVhZGVyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjMmJmOTA5YS1mYWMyLTQ5ZDItODUwYS02YTA3ZDEzMjU5NmYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARjv7s2lp359JHfGoQvUaygILSdNIqcBcj2cvR-NeNoJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fus-en%2Fmonitors%2Fspatiallabs%23filterHeader">ConceptD 7 laptop</a> also had that screen, but it’s no longer available.

It just doesn’t make sense to spend $3,500 on the Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition. While there's a chance the technology could eventually help a certain subsection of professionals, those folks would likely be served better with VR headsets, and potentially AR devices <a href="https://www.engadget.com/magic-leap-2-ar-headset-tech-dive-143046676.html">like the Magic Leap 2</a> in the future. Either option would deliver a better dose of 3D without the headaches of glasses-free tech.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/acer-predator-helios-300-spatiallabs-edition-review-173058399.html?src=rss

## Crypto giant Binance charged with violating US trading and derivatives laws

<p>Add Binance to the list of crypto heavyweights facing serious legal trouble. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8680-23">charged</a> Binance, founder Changpeng Zhao and former compliance chief Samuel Lim with allegedly violating both the agency's regulations and the Commodity Exchange Act. The company supposedly offered unregistered crypto derivatives, didn't ask users for mandatory identity verification, structured itself to avoid US regulation and even told customers how to dodge its own compliance system for US-based customers.</p><p>Zhao directed much of the rulebreaking himself, the CFTC claims, and there are reportedly chats and emails as evidence. Lim, who left Binance in 2022, is accused of knowingly aiding in the scheme. Among other things, he purportedly encouraged American users to mask trades through a VPN and even create new accounts through shell companies. The activity indicates that Binance's compliance mechanisms &quot;have been a sham,&quot; CFTC chief counsel Gretchen Lowe says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Commission hopes to permanently ban Binance's registration and trading. It also hopes to levy fines and make the firm disgorge its gains. There's no estimated financial penalty.</p><p>We've asked Binance for comment and will let you know if we hear back. The company has historically defended itself against accusations. Zhao's brand is also facing a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sec-is-investigating-binance-over-its-bnb-token-000556001.html">investigation over its BNB token</a>, and a long-running probe has looked into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/binance-insider-trading-probe-184903656.html">possible insider trading</a>. Senator Elizabeth Warren recently sent Zhao a <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023.03.01%20Letter%20to%20Binance%20and%20Binance.US%20re%20Compliance%20and%20Risk.pdf">letter</a> accusing him of creating a &quot;hotbed of illegal financial activity&quot; that enables crooks and sanction-dodgers.</p><p>The charges come in the wake of multiple scandals rocking the crypto industry. The fraud charges levelled against FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried are the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-criminal-and-civil-charges-200410951.html">most notable examples</a>, but there are also allegations and investigations targeting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-celsius-ceo-crypto-fraud-lawsuit-171421110.html">Celsius' former CEO</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sec-investigating-coinbase-over-unregistered-security-listings-123321443.html">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sec-charges-terraform-and-ceo-with-fraud-145347680.html">Terraform Labs</a>, among others. Binance is the largest crypto exchange left, and a US ban could significantly affect the industry as customers are forced to move to smaller outfits.</p><p>The CFTC is also staking out territory with this move. Both it and the SEC have argued that they should regulate crypto in the absence of laws outlining their roles. With these charges, the CFTC is signalling that it wants to be the de facto regulator for crypto trading. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-republican-crypto-subcommittee-165521735.html">House</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-crypto-regulation-bill-responsible-financial-innovation-act-143136481.html">Senate</a> members may limit the Commission's authority if they pass legislation, but the agency clearly isn't willing to wait before cracking down.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/crypto-giant-binance-charged-with-violating-us-trading-and-derivatives-laws-170817954.html?src=rss

## Nintendo's eShop closures are putting generations of games out of reach

<p>The Nintendo eShop for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-26-the-wii-u-revisited-looking-back-on-a-forward-thinking-console.html">Wii U</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-07-10-nintendo-3ds-xl-review.html">3DS</a> game consoles officially closed for business on March 27th, 2023, permanently disabling all new purchases on the platforms. We knew this was coming. Nintendo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-shutting-down-3ds-wii-u-shops-2023-082014166.html">quietly announced the eShop's closure over a year ago</a>, asserting that it was the "natural life cycle for any product line as it becomes less used by consumers over time." That's true. It's even a reasonable business justification. That doesn't make it any less of a loss for Nintendo fans, because legally playing some of these console’s best games is now not only harder, but in some cases, nearly impossible.</p><p>The time to argue that Nintendo should keep this aging digital storefront open has long since passed (though yes, they should have). The eShop <em>is</em> closed, but it's worth reflecting on what consumers are losing with it: one of the last affordable, convenient and legal options for buying a vast library of games. And not just Nintendo's retro library of "Virtual Console" titles from its classic era, either. Between the 3DS and Wii U eShop's closure, consumers have lost easy access to modern and classic games from a dozen platforms — from more recent systems like the Wii U and 3DS, to the original Wii, the DS and DSi, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-21-nintendo-game-boy-30th-anniversary.html">three flavors of Game Boy handhelds</a> (Advance, Color and original), the Sega Game Gear, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-duo-turbografx-pc-engine-turboduo-fpga-console-150059918.html">TurboGraphix-16</a>, as well as the Nintendo 64, Super Nintendo and original Nintendo Entertainment System. Losing these libraries now is especially painful, as it's becoming harder than ever to find and play older games.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It used to be easy.  Unless you were looking for something rare, building a modest library of classic and recent games was fun and affordable. Recently, that changed. Prices for used games <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/old-video-games-value-spike-post-covid-retro-gaming-collector-price-increase/">shot up dramatically since March of 2020</a> — a 2021 analysis from Pricecharting.com found that retro game prices shot up 33% in just a year — and prices have remained high. To make matters worse, the retro market has also been flooded with bootleg cartridges, which often aren't properly labeled as reproductions.</p><p>Digital storefronts like the Nintendo eShop offered an affordable alternative. Let's say you wanted to play <em>Metroid Prime</em>, for example. You could pick up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-prime-remastered-switch-230628691.html"><em>Metroid Prime Remastered on the Nintendo Switch</em></a> for $40 and enjoy the updated visuals and new features, but if you wanted to play the other two games in the series, you'd have to find a copy of <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em> for the Wii. According to PriceCharting.com, that'll set you back between $80 and $90 — $117 if you want it in the original case. The Wii U eShop, on the other hand, sold a digital copy for just $19.99.</p><figure><img alt="Dr. Luigi on the Wii U" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/37a9a610-c9d7-11ed-b64b-734a64ce8103" style="height: 539; width: 875;" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>There are countless similar examples. <em>Game &amp; Wario</em> sells for between $30 and $80 on eBay, but it could have been had for $30 on the eShop. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD</em>, which still hasn't been ported to the Switch, goes for between $30 and $100 used — but the eShop let you play it for just $20. If you are itching to play the 3DS versions of<em> Dragon Quest VII</em> and <em>VIII</em>, you'd have to pay in the ballpark of $100 each on the secondhand market, but the 3DS eShop sold them for $49.99, their original retail price.</p><p>The eShop was also home to a lot of exclusives we may never see again, like <em>Pushmo</em>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-07-22-attack-of-the-friday-monsters-im-in-love.html"><em>Attack of the Friday Monsters</em></a>, <em>Dr. Luigi</em> and more. All gone, now that consumers no longer have  convenient, legal access to the eShop’s library. In the past, Nintendo has pointed to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-tetris-mario-zelda-224822629.html">Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a> as the future home for classic games, but the service's current offerings are a paltry sampling of was available before. Not only is this solution limited, and only available if you’re subscribed to a service, but it offers only a modest selection of nostalgic classics, without the depth of the eShop’s back catalog of retail games. Players looking for affordable ways to play hard to find Wii, Wii U and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-3ds-10th-anniversary-games-160019952.html">3DS games</a> are now just out of luck.</p><p>Not that accessing those games<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-02-08-nintendo-digital-content-problem-wii-u-ecosystem.html"> was remotely easy</a>. The Wii U and 3DS digital libraries (not to mention Sony’s counterparts for the PS3 and PS Vita) may be vast archives containing multiple generations of playable gaming history, but each of these storefronts is chained to an aging platform. As Nintendo Fans dusted off their old consoles before the eShop’s closure, some found that their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630417/wii-u-system-error-160-0103-bricking-nand-memory">Wii U consoles were suffering from memory corruption</a>, potentially the fallout of having sat unused for so long. Even accessing these stores on a healthy device presented a fair share of hurdles: all of these platforms have disabled native payment options, forcing users to add funds through other consoles, web portals or by redeeming retail points cards.</p><div id="9b02a08bebcd47b1aea9522fdf550c28"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">You want proof that Nintendo's not going to take responsibility for keeping games in print?

The effort cost $22,791 and took almost a year to complete, due to wallet limits, interface frustrations and the limited storage capacity of the consoles themselves. He’s donating the completed archive of 866 Wii U games and 1,547 3DS games, plus all relevant DLC, to the Video Game History Foundation. That’s a noble endeavor, but that doesn’t help the average consumer that wants to play these games. As VGHF co-founder Kelsey Lewin <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/why-game-archivists-are-dreading-this-months-3ds-wii-u-eshop-shutdown/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_medium=social">recently told <em>Ars Technica</em></a>, even if these games were made available from  a preservation entity like VGHF, the only way one could legally play one of them would be to physically visit the library themselves and sign a consent form to play it on-site.</p><div id="92a5e01eccc04e46a182e6b8538a72e1"></div><p>Thanks to the work of games preservationists and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-12-11-wii-u-homebrew-channel.html">emulation community</a>, almost no game is truly out of reach if someone wants to play it, so long as you’re comfortable exploring the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-10-nintendo-uk-case-will-block-switch-piracy-sites.html">hobby pirate scene</a>. But there's still a big market for those of us who want legal, convenient access to older games. It's why the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-11-nes-classic-edition-review.html">NES</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-27-snes-classic-edition-review.html">SNES Classic</a> both sold so well. It's why Sony <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wont-stop-selling-psp-games-after-july-2nd-065844351.html">reversed course on closing the PlayStation 3 and Vita stores</a> in 2021. And it’s why the closure of the 3DS and Wii U eShops is such a loss for keeping video game history accessible to consumers.</p><p>We can’t rely on the commercial games industry to preserve its own history. Publishers have proven to us time and time again that these fleeting windows into nostalgia will be closed when they are no longer profitable. Publically mourning the loss of Nintendo’s digital stores, and fearing the eventual end of PlayStation Store support for the PS3 and Vita, won’t likely stop these companies closing them in favor of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-google-is-shutting-down-stadia-its-game-streaming-service-111527272.html">streaming</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming-subscriptions-guide-150008106.html">subscription services</a> and other, newer trends. Still, I hope one day these companies will realize that while their back catalogs may not be the most lucrative part of their business, they still hold a lot of value for many fans. And we’ll happily pay to access them – if you let us.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nintendos-eshop-closures-are-putting-generations-of-games-out-of-reach-140052823.html?src=rss

<p>The Nintendo Switch OLED is a big improvement over the original, due in particular to the 7-inch OLED display that's larger and brighter than the original model.

## Sonos Era 300 review: A big bet on spatial audio

<p>If you pay attention to the music industry, you’ve probably heard about spatial audio. The promise is that music will envelop the user from all directions without needing a room full of speakers to achieve the effect. Apple has pushed it a lot in the last few years, in Apple Music, its line of AirPods headphones and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-review-2nd-generation-140040630.html">latest HomePod speaker</a>. Amazon’s streaming service also offers spatial audio, and its Echo Studio speaker can play back compatible tracks.</p><p>Sonos has been paying attention, as well – its recent Arc and Beam soundbars support Dolby Atmos for movies, and now the company is releasing its first music speaker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-is-betting-big-on-spatial-audio-with-the-450-era-300-speaker-140041530.html">designed for spatial audio</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvZXJhLTMwMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGE5MzM1MTAtZWY0Yy00YjE1LTllMjEtM2UyZGFmYTgzNmZjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQC6mDC5AEh8lGo8Ot-Myt5paR7AkoyHp5_uPaLRBYpJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fera-300">the Era 300</a>. This beast is large and has an unusual shape to accommodate all the drivers needed for achieving these room-filling effects. At $450, you’d expect this speaker to sound excellent, regardless of whether it’s playing back spatial audio or not, but support for this new format is what sets it apart from other speakers. As such, the big question on my mind is whether this feature is a game changer, a gimmick, or somewhere in between?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Photos of the new Sonos Era 300 speaker, which can play back music in Dolby Atmos spatial audio." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/17fe4a63-cc29-11ed-bea2-c0678ae68c83" style="height: 1600; width: 2400;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><p>There’s nothing in the Sonos lineup to compare the Era 300 to. From a size and weight perspective, it’s a large speaker, similar to the Sonos Five, but its unusual shape immediately sets it apart. Seen from the front its oval reminds me of a race track, but any other angle reveals a distinctive footprint. If you look at it from the top, it’s thinner near the middle than it is on the ends; the best way I can describe it is a knocked-over hourglass.</p><p>This is to accommodate the complex driver array inside the Era 300. There’s one tweeter pushing out from dead center, and two more sending audio out the left and right sides. Finally, there’s a fourth tweeter inside a directional horn pointed upwards; Sonos says that it’s at a specific angle optimized for spatial audio. Two woofers, again on either side of the speaker, complete the array.</p><p>The Era 300 reminds me of most other recent Sonos products. It is well-built, exceedingly sturdy and generally feels like a product that justifies its high price tag. That said, its physical appearance is definitely more unusual than the company’s other speakers. I recognize that it’s functional, but the combo of its size and strange tapering make it stand out more than you might like.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of the new Sonos Era 300 speaker, which can play back music in Dolby Atmos spatial audio." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/17ff0db0-cc29-11ed-b6f2-75d889dbedd1" style="height: 1600; width: 2400;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>A lot of new features and changes in the Era 100 are also found in the Era 300. This includes a redesigned set of touch controls on the top panel, a USB-C port for line-in and ethernet (provided you shell out for the optional adapters), a Bluetooth toggle and a switch to physically disconnect the microphone on the back. For more on these features, I’ll point you to the relevant section of my Era 100 review. Most everything I said there applies. That said, for $450, it’s a little disappointing that Sonos requires an adapter for line in or Ethernet. The $550 Sonos Five has both of those built right in. I’m sure the company has the data showing that a small percentage of owners use those features, so I’m glad they haven’t been removed completely, but it would definitely be nice if they didn’t require an adapter.</p><div id="35193eac38824b6389a0f4293db0e92f"></div><h2><strong>Setup</strong></h2><p>Setting up the Era 300 is pretty simple, even if you don’t already have a Sonos system. You’ll need to download the Sonos app to your phone and set up an account; from there, the app will look and see if there are any speakers to add. You’ll also need to log in to your audio services of choice – if you want to try spatial audio, you’ll need either Apple Music or Amazon Music Unlimited. You can search for and play music through the Sonos app, but there are also a bunch of options if you’d rather stick with the music apps you’re used to. You can use AirPlay 2 to shoot audio from Apple Music and other services on the iPhone directly to the Era 300, or use Spotify Connect without needing to go through the Sonos app. That said, it’s worth noting that if you want to play back tracks in spatial audio, you’re required to use the Sonos app.</p><p>There are a few optional but useful things you can do while you’re setting up the Era 300. The first is Trueplay, a feature that tunes your speaker’s output based upon where it’s placed in your room. Trueplay has been around since 2015, but in the past it required you to have an iPhone. You’d have to walk around your room slowly raising and lowering the phone while the speaker played a test tone. The Era 300, though, can use its built-in microphones to listen and optimize its output – that process is much simpler and faster than the old technique, and Android users aren’t left out either.</p><p>I’ve been extremely happy with Trueplay’s results in the past, so I’d recommend that everyone try this out. That said, I did find that the old, manual tuning process yielded slightly better results. So while I appreciate the ease of use in the new Trueplay system, I’ll probably still walk around my room waving my phone – but I won’t judge you if you take the easier route.</p><p>If you like using voice controls, you can also add a voice assistant to the Era 300. Amazon’s Alexa has been supported since the One launched back in 2017, and last year Sonos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-voice-control-assistant-for-music-200538441.html">added its own music-focused assistant</a>. Setting up the Sonos assistant is a little easier than Alexa, because you don’t need to go linking your Amazon account, but both are pretty straightforward at this point. One thing to note: past Sonos speakers with microphones also worked with Google Assistant, but that’s no longer the case. The Era 100 only works with Alexa and the Sonos assistant, likely due to the ongoing patent battles between Google and Sonos. I personally prefer Google Assistant over Alexa, so this is a bit of a bummer. But I also mostly just talk to my speaker to play music, so the Sonos option works well enough.</p><section><img alt="Photos of the new Sonos Era 300 speaker, which can play back music in Dolby Atmos spatial audio." class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/17fe7170-cc29-11ed-bdfe-b40634cd5884" style="height: 1600; width: 2400;" /></section><h2><strong>Audio quality and the spatial experience</strong></h2><p>Putting aside the potential of spatial audio for a moment, the Era 300 sounds excellent – as it should, given its price. It doesn’t quite match the stunning detail and bass presence of the Sonos Five, which remains the most impressive audio-focused speaker Sonos sells. But for $100 less, you’re getting a premium experience that far surpasses the Era 100 and other speakers like Apple’s HomePod. I was very impressed with the Era 100, but playing the speakers back side-by-side shows just how much better the Era 300 is at making each separate component of a song shine. Bass, vocals and instrumentation are all reproduced in excellent detail that smaller speakers simply can’t match.</p><p>But the real question with the Era 300 is the value of spatial audio – does it really provide a new and worthwhile listening experience? For me, the answer is a big “sometimes.” Right now, I think that the trick of spatial audio, to a large extent, remains just that: a trick. I spent a lot of time bouncing between Atmos versions of songs on Apple Music and Amazon, comparing them to the standard versions on Spotify. I could always tell there was a difference, but I also didn’t always feel that it was an improvement. Broadly speaking, spatial audio tracks <em>did</em> feel less like they were coming out of a single point in space. But a lot of times, the immediacy of the song’s original mix was lost and the vocals felt drenched in reverb rather than being right up close.</p><p>In some cases, especially when I listened to older albums that were remixed for spatial audio, the results were simply worse. The excellent guitarwork and vocals on the Alice in Chains classic “Down in a Hole” from 1992’s <em>Dirt </em>sounded a million miles away. I had high hopes for the multi-layered doom rock of “Rain When I Die,” but again the mix felt mushy and poorly defined. Alice in Chains’ 1990 debut  <em>Facelift </em>was also released in Atmos recently, and it sounds <em>far</em> better than <em>Dirt</em>, so it’s clear that older albums and spatial audio aren’t inherently incompatible. Pearl Jam’s 1991 debut <em>Ten </em>didn’t sound bad, but there was still a lack of definition to too much of the mix. By contrast, the recently-released Atmos mix of 1998’s <em>Yield</em> was an enjoyable listen, but I’m not convinced it’s better than the original. For the record, this isn’t a fault of the speaker, but rather a fault of these mixes – I noticed the same issues when listening through Apple’s HomePod or AirPods Max.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of the new Sonos Era 300 speaker, which can play back music in Dolby Atmos spatial audio." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/17fe7171-cc29-11ed-bdfb-96371ce141a7" style="height: 1600; width: 2400;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Newer songs and albums that are likely recorded, produced, and mastered with spatial audio, in mind sounded better. The acoustic guitar and hushed vocals of Billie Eiish’s “Billie Bossa Nova” felt wonderfully close, and the club beats of Dua Lipa’s <em>Future Nostalgia</em> were lively and impressive. In most cases, though, the mixes that sounded best to me were only slightly different than the originals, and I still often felt like the Atmos versions put too much reverb into the mix. This was particularly true on Carly Rae Jepsen’s latest album <em>The Loneliest Time. </em>Instrumentation sounded lush and vibrant, but the vocals lacked impact. In a best case scenario, with a single Era 300, the difference between the best spatial audio and standard mixes is often going to be fairly subtle.</p><p>I will admit that when I simply put on a playlist of new songs (many of which were in spatial audio) and stopped thinking about it, I enjoyed myself a lot more. It helps that newly-released songs generally sound much better in Atmos than the remixes of older albums I’ve come across. When I wasn’t obsessively comparing the new mixes to old versions of songs I knew inside and out, it was easier to appreciate the Era 300 for the great-sounding speaker it is. But that’s the case whether you’re listening to an Atmos version of a song or the standard mix, so spatial audio shouldn’t be the main reason to buy the Era 300.</p><p>Like basically all Sonos speakers, you can pair two Era 300s together for stereo playback, though I’m not sure “stereo” is the right word when we’re talking about spatial audio. The fact that you can’t adjust the left / right balance between them kinda proves that point. Regardless of what you call it, two Era 300s provide an absolutely massive experience that does a better job of delivering on the promise of spatial audio. With two speakers, there’s no real sweet spot; instead, music sounds consistently excellent regardless of where you are relative to the speakers. And if you want to get really wild, you can use a pair of Era 300s as rear speakers along with a Sonos Arc or second-gen Beam soundbar to get Dolby Atmos home theater playback. I don’t have the right living room or soundbar setup to make this work, but I can say it was impressive in a demo Sonos gave the press last month. Of course, considering how much an Arc and two Era 300s costs, it had better be.</p><section><img alt="Photos of the new Sonos Era 300 speaker, which can play back music in Dolby Atmos spatial audio." class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/17fe4a61-cc29-11ed-b9a9-67bfac597cd1" style="height: 1600; width: 2400;" /></section><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>The Era 300 is in a slightly strange place in the Sonos portfolio. Its higher price means it’s not going to be as broadly appealing as the $250 Era 100. It’s closer to the $550 Sonos Five, which is probably a superior speaker despite lacking spatial audio capabilities. But, for $100 less, the Era 300 still provides a premium audio experience and has a handful of improvements over the Five, including built-in microphones and automatic Trueplay tuning. For $500, you could also buy a pair of Era 100 speakers and run them in stereo – those speakers sound great, and you’ll get excellent coverage with two of them working together.</p><p>And, of course, there’s the messy potential for spatial audio. After spending a lot of time listening to the Era 300, I don’t think it’s a game-changer yet. In the best cases, it provides a different listening experience, but it’s not always better – in fact, I’ve been surprised at how often it has been worse. While lots of new music is being released in spatial audio, most older music is only available in good old stereo, so the catalog of songs available in the new format is comparatively small.</p><p>Fortunately, the Era 300 is a great speaker, whether or not it is playing songs in Dolby Atmos. It’s crisp, loud, detailed and has lively bass – and when I’ve stopped thinking about spatial audio, it has been a joy to listen to. Spatial audio is a potentially interesting feature, especially if more and more musicians and producers embrace it, but I’d recommend that you not buy the Era 300 with only that in mind. Buy it if you’re really interested in a premium speaker that does a great job filling a room with sound, whether it’s an Atmos mix or not.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-300-review-a-big-bet-on-spatial-audio-130053487.html?src=rss

Unlike the Era 300, there’s no need to ponder the value of spatial audio; the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvZXJhLTEwMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2FjMDYxNTEtNDliNi00MDcxLWI2MzgtZTA0M2VkMTdlZGJiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARPIp6yiLWynzmoELmOiWaTYkIEu0SvH74et11G6Okal&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fera-100">Era 100</a> is a relatively straightforward mono speaker, just like the One and the Play:1 before it. Don’t let that simple description deceive you, though – the $250 Era 100 is a complete redesign, inside and out, and the end result is a worthy upgrade and a very versatile speaker.</p><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><p>At first glance, the Era 100 looks quite similar to the One, but upon further examination you’ll notice a number of small but meaningful changes. That starts with the vertically-oriented Sonos logo that you’ll find on most of their other speakers like the Roam and, naturally, the Era 300. The Era 100 is slightly taller and deeper than the One; it’s also slightly deeper than it is wide. But it should fit basically anywhere the older speaker did.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="72a5eadd43d844678f2ae8b95bdd9d17"></div><p>The most significant external change is on top of the speaker. There, you’ll find a redesigned set of touch controls, including dedicated track forward and back buttons for the first time. Those surround the play / pause button instead of the volume controls that you’ll find on the One. Volume has been moved to a touch slider in the center of the touch panel. Tapping either side of it raises or lowers the volume, or you can slide your finger left and right. Using the slider takes a little practice, and it’s far too easy to go from silent to deafening, but there’s no doubt it’s better for rapid adjustments than tapping a button repeatedly. There’s also a spot to mute the mic, just like on the One.</p><p>There are also some major changes on the Era 100’s back. There’s no more ethernet jack or setup button. Instead, there’s a USB-C port you can use to plug in the $20 line-in adapter or the $40 combo line-in / ethernet adapter. On the one hand, it’s annoying to have to shell out extra cash for these adapters – but this is the first time Sonos has offered line-in at all on a speaker in this price range, so it’s not a total bummer.</p><p>Aside from the USB-C port, you’ll find another switch for muting the mic. Unlike the top button, which just mutes it with software, this physically disconnects the mic for additional privacy. Finally, there’s a Bluetooth button that puts the speaker in pairing mode.</p><p>As with most Sonos products, the company has done a good job here marrying clean, attractive design without compromising on functionality. Yes, the loss of the Ethernet jack will rankle a small number of users, but for the most part these changes are improvements. I wish that they just put a line-in right on the speaker instead of requiring a dongle, but I’m more glad that the feature is here at all than I am annoyed at needing to buy an extra piece of plastic.</p><figure><img alt="The latest Sonos speaker, the Era 100" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/a12a68f0-cc29-11ed-bbff-ae4d197f0a74" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2><strong>Setup</strong></h2><p>Getting the Era 100 up and running is pretty simple, even if you don’t already have a Sonos system. You’ll need to download the Sonos app to your phone and set up an account; from there, the app will look and see if there are any speakers plugged in it can add. You’ll also need to log in to your audio services of choice, but after that you should be good to go. Obviously you can search for and play music through the Sonos app, but there are also options if you’d rather stick with the music apps you’re used to, like AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect.</p><p>There are a few optional but useful things you can do while you’re setting up the Era 100, though. The first is Trueplay, a feature that tunes your speaker’s audio output based upon where it’s placed in your room. Trueplay has been around since 2015, but in the past it required you to have an iPhone. You’d have to walk around your room slowly raising and lowering the phone while the speaker played a test tone.</p><p>The Era 100, though, can use its built-in microphones to listen and optimize its output – that process is much simpler and faster than the old technique, and Android users aren’t left out either. I’ve been extremely happy with Trueplay’s results in the past, so I’d recommend that everyone try this out. That said, I did find that the old, manual tuning process yielded slightly better results.</p><p>You can also add a voice assistant to the Era 100. Amazon’s Alexa has been supported since the One launched back in 2017, and last year Sonos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-voice-control-assistant-for-music-200538441.html">added its own music-focused assistant</a>. Setting up the Sonos assistant is a little easier than Alexa, because you don’t need to link your Amazon account, but both are pretty straightforward at this point. Sadly, where past Sonos speakers supported Google Assistant the Era 100 does not. This is likely due to the ongoing patent battles between Google and Sonos. I personally prefer Google Assistant to Alexa, so this is a bit of a bummer.</p><figure><img alt="The latest Sonos speaker, the Era 100" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/a12b2c40-cc29-11ed-bfcb-f053bec0854c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2><strong>Audio quality</strong></h2><p>While new features like easier Trueplay and new controls are important, what I really wanted to find out was how the Era 100 compares to the One it replaces. (I’ve also been comparing it to Apple’s latest HomePod as well as the Era 300.) So far, I’ve been extremely impressed. It’s immediately obvious that the Era 100 is a notable upgrade over the One.</p><p>First off, the Era 100 is <em>loud.</em> Surprisingly so – it’s significantly louder than the One and the HomePod, and the Era 300 isn’t that much louder. Even a single Era 100 should provide enough volume for just about any room in your house. If you have a large open floor plan, you’ll probably want a couple speakers to cover the space rather than cranking a single, relatively small speaker to its limit. But in the vast majority of use cases one Era 100 should be sufficient.</p><p>Obviously, there’s a lot more to good sound than just volume. The Era 100 has significantly improved bass performance when compared to the One, again exceeding what I’d expect from a compact speaker. Bass-heavy tracks like Dua Lipa’s “Levitating” and Dragonette’s “T-shirt” had a solid thump without being overwhelming, especially at higher volumes. It doesn’t match the Era 300 or HomePod, both of which have more dynamic bass performance, but Sonos is getting a lot out of the Era 100.</p><figure><img alt="Comparison of the two newest Sonos speakers, the Era 100 and Era 300." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/17fe4a64-cc29-11ed-bfbf-4f0d44c110c5" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>While I’m glad the bass has improved, I’m more impressed with the speaker’s overall clarity. The two tweeters definitely help make higher frequencies more defined. The sound profile is crisper and more dynamic than that of the One. The nuance and sheen of “California” by Chvrches and Metric’s “Formentera” came through wonderfully, while standard four-piece rock or metal like Metallica’s self-titled classic and Tool’s <em>AEnima</em> sounded lively and powerful. I also checked out my go-to film and game scores from <em>Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>The Last of Us,</em> and the intricate compositions were full and well-balanced. The One now sounds somewhat muddy by comparison, with both the highs and lows less distinct. The Era 300 sounds clearer still, thanks to the many drivers it has on board, but the 100 again is doing a lot with its comparatively limited speaker array.</p><p>If you have a larger space or just want increased volume and detail, I recommend getting two Era 100s and pairing them in stereo. While the Era 100 technically has left and right tweeters, the small size means there’s no real stereo separation to speak of. Putting two of them together naturally yields a much wider soundstage and brings out lots of details that get erased when you squish a stereo mix down to one channel.</p><p>A pair of Era 100s can also be used as rear surround speakers in a setup with one of Sonos’ soundbars. I didn’t test this, as I don’t have a great living room setup and I was more interested in the music performance, but it’s worth mentioning this feature. Sonos has long offered the option to use basically any of its music speakers as rear surrounds, and I’m glad they’ve continued with that here.</p><p>The Era 100 (and 300) are the first non-portable speakers that include Bluetooth connectivity. It’s exceedingly simple: just hold the Bluetooth button on the back of the speaker to put it in pairing mode and it should show up for your phone or other device to connect to it. I had no reason to use Bluetooth, but the fast setup and pairing process could be useful if you have a friend who quickly wants to play a tune over your speaker, for example. It’s not essential, but having more options never hurts.</p><section><img alt="The latest Sonos speaker, the Era 100" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/a12ba170-cc29-11ed-a44f-686f46452cc2" /></section><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>Sonos made a lot of smart decisions with the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvZXJhLTEwMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2FjMDYxNTEtNDliNi00MDcxLWI2MzgtZTA0M2VkMTdlZGJiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARPIp6yiLWynzmoELmOiWaTYkIEu0SvH74et11G6Okal&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fera-100">Era 100</a>. The improvements it offers over the One are immediately obvious, both in sound quality and new features like line-in, Bluetooth and easier Trueplay setup. I don’t think Sonos One owners should necessarily run out and replace their speakers, but Sonos is now offering a better product at a $30 price increase, one that I think is justified for what you get.</p><p>Of course, Sonos makes things a little complicated because there are two generations of the One; they’re identical in terms of audio components, but the gen 2 model has more memory and a faster processor. If you have the One from 2017 or 2018, replacing it with an Era 100 will provide better sound and more future-proof internals.</p><p>The Era 100 isn’t the most exciting speaker I’ve listened to – I still have fond memories of being blown away by the Sonos Play:5 (now just called the Five) in 2015, and the Era 300 is also a delight. But when you take into consideration what most people will need from a speaker, the Era 100 provides impressive performance at a reasonable price.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-100-review-affordable-multi-room-audio-that-actually-sounds-good-130007717.html?src=rss

<p>According to a <em>New York Times </em>report, parts of Twitter’s source code were leaked online. Court filings published Friday reveal Twitter claimed copyright infringement to have the code taken down from Github as soon as possible. The code was removed the same day, but there’s no report on how long it was online for – or the leak's scope or depth. The Twitter executive who spoke with the <em>NYT</em> said the company's primary concern was that the source code could be used in future hacking efforts.</p><p>Twitter executives suspect it's the work of a former employee who left &quot;within the last year.&quot; That might not narrow down the hunt for the leak.

<p>It's the end of an era as Nintendo is <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/61150">shutting down</a> its Wii U and 3DS eShops today (March 27th) at 5PM PST (8PM EST). After that, you'll no longer be able to purchase new games for those consoles, though you'll still be able to redownload titles you've already purchased for the time being.&nbsp;</p><p>The company first warned of the eShop closures <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-shutting-down-3ds-wii-u-shops-2023-082014166.html">back in February 2022</a>, and barred users from adding funds to their accounts on August 29th.
