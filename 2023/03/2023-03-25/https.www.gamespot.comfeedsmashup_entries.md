<p>So far in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> beta, the Druid has been a bit underwhelming for most players. While most find <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-druid-skills-guide/1100-6512695/">the Druid's skills</a> enjoyable from strictly an aesthetic point of view, there is a growing consensus that the skills are weak overall, especially when compared to the other four classes. However, if players want to try and increase the power of the Druid, they should look at spending skill points on Talents. Talents are passive abilities that allow players to further customize their build and increase the power of their active skills.</p><p>Below, you can see all of the Druid's available Talents and which ones we recommend for a couple of key builds.</p><h2>Diablo 4 Druid Talents</h2><p>Similar to other classes, the Druid has Talents that are grouped into different categories. For example, there are some Talents that you can't acquire before learning Talents that have come before it. Comparatively, they work exactly like other skills where you need to spend a certain number of skill points to gain access to certain Talents. We have everything broken down below so you can see exactly which Talents fall where for the Druid.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-druid-talents-guide/1100-6512711/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Diablo 4 - Druid Build Guide

<p>The Druid is an intriguing class in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> beta. While players are enamored with the idea of transforming into a werebear or summoning wolves on command, the class has been proven to not be nearly as strong as the other classes. Druids can make use of elemental damage, such as lightning, poison, and earth, but players have found it difficult to create much synergy among these damage types.</p><p>If you've been struggling to create your Druid build in a harmonious and impactful way, then fear not, as we have put together an entire build for the class. Keep in mind, though, that the developers could easily buff the Druid and its other skills before the full game launches in June.</p><h2>Diablo 4 Druid leveling build</h2><p><strong>Our Druid build opts for a mix of defensive and AoE skills</strong>, allowing your character to deal a ton of damage at the start of a fight and then increase damage reduction while you wait for your cooldowns. Of course, we have chosen some skills that make use of the Druid's shapeshifting abilities, as that's the most enjoyable aspect of the class.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-druid-build-guide/1100-6512710/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Diablo 4 - Druid Animal Spirits Guide

<p>Every playable class in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4 </a>has a unique mechanic that is specific to them. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-rogue-specializations-guide/1100-6512619/">Rogues have Specializations</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-sorcerer-enchantment-guide/1100-6512479/">Sorcerers have Enchantments</a>, and so on. In regard to the Druid, players will have access to the <strong>Animal Spirits</strong> mechanic. While this mechanic is not playable in the Diablo 4 beta, we have enough of an understanding of Animal Spirits to describe it in-depth and predict how it will play out in the full game.</p><h2>Diablo 4 Druid Animal Spirits mechanic</h2><p>To start, the Animal Spirits system builds off of the Druid's ability to shapeshift into a wolf or bear and also have animals as companions. However, with Animal Spirits, players will be able to pick one of four different spirits at a time. The Animal Spirit they pick will offer them unique bonuses, which are called Boons in Diablo 4.</p><p>There's no word on what the Animal Spirits will be yet or what each of their Boons will be. Players could see an increase in their elemental damage, have their animal companions become stronger, or get some additional defensive buffs, but none of that has been confirmed by Blizzard as of yet.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-druid-animal-spirits-guide/1100-6512709/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">A couple weeks before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-4-season-2-neon-lights-katana-fights-and-more/1100-6512208/">Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2</a> launched, the rumors began circulating about a "Neo Tokyo" kind of futuristic city location being added with the new season. And I thought: "Cool, they're bringing back Neo Tilted Towers." But I was wrong. Mega City is far beyond anything else we've ever seen in Fortnite--there are no good past comparisons for this place, either in terms of size <em>or</em> quality.</p><p dir="ltr">What makes it so great? Well, it's the first place that Epic has built on the Fortnite island that feels like Zero Build was considered when they conceived it. Mega City has a bunch of skyscrapers, but the bulk of the interiors are inaccessible--making the number of places you might get shot from significantly more manageable. Likewise, this place has serious infrastructure in the form of grind rails and three or four different vertical ziplines on each building, and a car or motorcycle on every corner.</p><p dir="ltr">And if you've got a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-not-suck-with-fortnites-kinetic-blade/1100-6512469/">Kinetic Blade</a>, too?

## 12 Resident Evil Games You Forgot Existed

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4116336-residentevilhdproject.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">From the chaotic action of Resident Evil 4 to the creeping horror of the original Resident Evil, the series has featured a wide variety of genres and styles. But while there isn't an RE kart racer--or at least not yet--not every game in the series has managed to garner the mass acclaim of a Resident Evil 2, or the cultish love that still burns for the misunderstood Resident Evil 6. (Yes, there are dozens of us.)</p><p>The following 11 Resident Evil games include notable entries that have fallen by the wayside, strange curiosities that have been forgotten by all but the most hardcore fans, and bizarre ideas that probably should've never made their way off the drawing board in the first place.Now that the long-awaited Resident Evil 4 remake is finally out, fans can't help but wonder which classic entry Capcom will retell next--we're hoping for Code: Veronica. We gave the RE4 remake a 10, calling it a masterful version of one of the greatest games ever made.Though we certainly can't recommend checking out everything on this list, they each form a lesser-known part of one of the most storied series in gaming, so read on to discover what awaits you.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil Survivor</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4116338-residentevilsurvivor.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of the first major Resident Evil spin-offs is also one of the all-time worst-received entries in the series. The idea of combining the horror trappings of RE2 with the PS1's GunCon was not necessarily a terrible one, but the execution left a lot to be desired. We gave it a 4.1 back in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-survivor-review/1900-2545924/">2000</a>, and that's actually slightly higher than the game's <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/resident-evil-survivor">Metascore </a>of 39. Unfortunately for North American fans, the light gun functionality was left out of that version due to controversies surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. As such, this one is best left in the dustbin of gaming history. It did spawn a sequel, however.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil Code: Veronica (and Veronica X)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4116339-codeveronica.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Old-school Resident Evil fans are more than familiar with Code: Veronica, but newer fans might have to go out of their way to try it. Known as the true sequel to Resident Evil 2 (it was given a different name because it didn't release on PlayStation originally) and widely considered one of the best games in the series, Code: Veronica has been stuck on retro consoles for far too long. The GameCube and PS2 versions of the Dreamcast original, dubbed Veronica X, remain the easiest way to play it in 2023, though the HD version for PS3 and Xbox 360 is also a good choice. Let's hope that Capcom finally remakes this game after RE4, because there are a lot of fans who haven't had a chance to experience it yet.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil Gaiden</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4116340-residentevilgaiden.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Every classic video game series that was around in the early 2000s got its own weird Game Boy entry that few remember, and that's exactly what Resident Evil Gaiden is. A top-down survival-horror game set on a passenger ship--that also features clunky first-person combat for some reason--Gaiden stars series heartthrob Leon S. Kennedy, as well as returning mentor figure Barry Burton. Though it's sometimes considered <a href="https://www.retrogamer.net/top_10/game-boy-color-games/">underrated</a> for a Game Boy Color game, Capcom has long-since scrubbed it from the series' canon. That said, you could do a lot worse in the Game Boy catalog--Austin Powers: Oh Behave, anyone?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil Zero</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4116341-residentevil0.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Another well-received Resident Evil game that newer fans might have missed out on, Zero is a bit of a strange beast. As its name implies, Zero serves as a prequel to the game that started it all, and it's actually set one day before the original. Inspired in part by pioneering horror game Sweet Home, it's significantly more difficult than previous entries in the series, while returning to the slow, count-every-bullet fundamentals established in its first two games. Unlike every other game on this list, Zero is easily playable on modern-day consoles, so if you like survival-horror classics, definitely check it out.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil Outbreak</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4116342-residenteviloutbreak.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of the strangest RE games ever, Outbreak is a co-op horror game for PS2 that relied on that console's fledgling internet support for its basic functionality. Set in Raccoon City during the events of RE2, Outbreak featured a cast of normal people just trying to survive the zombie attacks. Though the game could be played solo, it was really designed like a proto-Left 4 Dead, with players pooling resources and using their character's unique abilities to get through a number of scenarios. The game's servers shut down in 2011, but there have been a number of<a href="https://obsrv.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=5251&amp;sid=1d6e65da8791a21e1b86f44dfb01e7d5">fan efforts</a>to bring the game back from the dead over the years, and they appear to be ongoing.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil: Deadly Silence</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4116343-si_nds_residentevildeadlysilence.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Nintendo DS is the second best-selling console of all time, which might be why Capcom decided to port the original Resident Evil to it. Subtitled Deadly Silence, the port featured two separate versions of the game, one that stayed as close to the original as possible, and another that added more enemies and added some DS-specific puzzles. It also added some new mechanics, like the 180-degree turn. I doubt anybody would go to bat for Deadly Silence as the ideal way to experience the original Resident Evil today, but it's an interesting relic of a faded era.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil: Dead Aim</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4116344-deadaim.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The third light-gun game in the now-forgotten Resident Evil Gun Survivor series, Dead Aim is considered<a href="https://archive.ph/20120718001823/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/residentevildeadaim/index.html?tag=result;title;1">by many</a>to be its best entry. Combining third-person movement with the first-person shooting mechanics of a light-gun game, Dead Aim's other aspects were less than thrilling, particularly its by-the-numbers plot. There are better light-gun games in the series, but Dead Aim is the best of the early entries.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles &amp; Darkside Chronicles</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4116345-umbrellachronicles.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Released for Wii in the late 2000s, Umbrella Chronicles and Darkside Chronicles are generally considered the best light-gun games in the Resident Evil series. Though the two games lack unique stories of their own, instead opting to retell key events from previous titles (with a few exceptions), the Wii's control setup brings them nearer to the standard of the rest of the series. Only hardcore Resident Evil fans need to play these forgotten light-gun games, but if you're interested, they're pretty good for what they are.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4116346-raccooncity.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Capcom has tried to bring the popular action of the shooter formula to the RE series several times, and it never seems to work out very well. 2012's Operation Raccoon City is a non-canonical retelling of the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3 from the perspective of a military squad, featuring fan-favorite character HUNK. Unfortunately, the tactical combat of the SOCOM and Rainbow Six franchises did not translate well here, and it ended up with a<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/resident-evil-operation-raccoon-city">Metascore</a>of 48. There are definitely worse Resident Evil games, and this is one that deserves to be forgotten.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Resident Evil: Revelations and Revelations 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4116347-revelations2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Revelations sub-series is well-known to hardcore RE fans, and if you're in the mood for a more subdued survival-horror experience, they might be up your alley. The original Revelations was designed for the 3DS, and thus even the HD re-release feels a bit dated at times, but Revelations 2 is essentially a full-throated series entry split into four different episodes. They can't compare to classics like RE2 or RE4, but if you've beaten all the best games in the series over and over, you'll probably appreciate their more psychological take on the horror genre.</p></h3></p><br />
