Not only is it overrun with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/los-angeles-clerk-robber-knife" target="_blank">crime</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-snowstorm-woman" target="_blank">extreme weather</a> events, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/california-governor-signs-bill-offering-legal-refuge-transgender-youth-rcna50240" target="_blank">trans surgeries for minors</a>. But now, a proposed bill could make it legal for therapists to legally kidnap children over 12. Without a trial. Or evidence. </p><p>The proposed bill was introduced by Democratic Assembly Member Wendy Carrillo and would allow a mental health professional to place a child as young as 12 in a residential shelter facility without parental knowledge or consent and without any prior allegations of incest or child abuse. Under current law, children aged 12 and up can consent to receive mental health treatment and counseling, but cannot consent to being placed in a residential shelter facility without being deemed a risk to themselves or others, or in cases of incest or child abuse. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>According to the bill, a “shocking 78 percent of LGBTQ+ youth who were surveyed shared they had considered suicide." So naturally, the next step would be to completely isolate these youth from their family who loves them. Naturally. </p><p>This bill seems to piggyback off the widely held belief amongst leftists that unless gender-confused children transition, they will kill themselves. And therefore parents opposed to their children transitioning are a threat to their lives. But in reality, separating a child from their family and convincing them that their parents don't have their best interest in mind is extremely damaging, isolating, and creates paranoia where there should be trust. And it probably won't even work. </p><p>In 2010, then-Governor  Schwarzenegger signed a bill that gave children aged 12 and over the ability to get counseling without parental consent. It was intended to help prevent youth suicide, but failed, according to a recent report that found suicide rates increased by 11% for those 24 and younger since the law went into effect. </p><p>So to all of y'all still living in California, I lovingly ask, why the heck are you still there? Get out before the state literally kidnaps your child. <em>Literally</em>. </p>

## Watch: A university spent tens of thousands of dollars to host Dylan Mulvaney for some unknown reason

And on day 374, they let us know they're speaking at the University of Pittsburgh. For an unknown reason. </p><p>Dylan explained their recent absence from social media, saying they "needed a few days to process the past year" and that a "proper catch-up" is in order. But Dylan had to show off their outfit - a white blazer and skirt with feathers hanging off of it. Plus a pink purse, of course. <br /></p><p><em>"And you might be thinking, Dylan, why do you look so professional? And it's because I have my first speaking engagement at a college today, I'm at the University of Pittsburgh. And I was only in college just a few years ago, and I was very lost then [...] But I finished, I got my degree, and now look at me. And I don't know exactly what I have to teach these college students, but we're going to have a good time." </em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>The University of Pittsburgh Student Government Board actually <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/03/20/university-allocates-thousands-host-trans-activist-speaker-pride-week/" target="_blank">spent</a> $26,000 to host Dylan at their campus for its pride week. I always thought pride was in June, but it seems like it's just all the time, any time now. The Pitt Program Council apparently covered the remaining speaking fees, which can range from $30k-$50k. </p><p>The event included a one hour program, a 45-minute moderated Q&amp;A and a 15-minute audience Q&amp;A. Tickets were free, and the event was held in response to several upcoming conservative speaking events on campus, including <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ncaa-swimmer-choked-up" target="_blank">Riley Gaines</a>, the former former University of Kentucky swimmer who competed against Lia Thomas, and a debate between Michael Knowles and transgender professor Deirdre McCloskey. </p><p>It's still unclear what exactly Dylan spoke to these students about. But I guess Dylan is an "expert" in girlhood. And we all know how much American colleges love the "experts". </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: GOP governor tells Hollywood celebrity to kiss his dog's butt...then literally holds up his dog's butt

Joe Manchin <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/24/manchin-senate-republicans-2024-00088620" target="_blank">might be challenging Joe Manchin for the senate in 2024</a>. It reminded me of the one and only time I heard the name "Jim Justice." It involves Better Midler and his dog's butt. And Justice holding up his dog's butt in reBUTTal (tee hee) to Midler and celebrities like her.</p><p>In January 2022, Gov. Jim Justice gave his state of the state address on Thursday. Where, with the help of his dog, illustrated what part of the dog Bette Midler and other haters could pucker up to. Just-- just watch the video.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">“Absolutely too many people doubted us. They never believed in West Virginia. ... They told every bad joke in the world about us.”<br /><br />Governor Jim Justice held up his bulldog and told Bette Midler to kiss "Babydog's" hiney.<br /><br />STORY: <a href="https://t.co/12P55GLyju">https://t.co/12P55GLyju</a> <a href="https://t.co/gRqm61hEYk">pic.twitter.com/gRqm61hEYk</a><br />— 7News DC (@7NewsDC) <a href="https://twitter.com/7NewsDC/status/1487106581397393408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p><em>“They told every bad joke in the world about us. [...] Babydog tells Bette Midler and all those out there, kiss her hiney.”</em></p><p>You may find yourself wondering how we got here? What led to this man holding up this butt?</p><p>Our story begins with West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin. Manchin made the (albeit temporary) decision to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-manchin-voting-rights" target="_blank">stand with his constituents</a> and NOT the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-manchin-liberal-protestors" target="_blank">half-a-commie, freak liberal activists trying to bully him into supporting Joe Biden's agenda</a>. Manchin said that, no, what Biden wanted to do <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/henry-winkler-joe-manchin" target="_blank">would not build anything back better</a>. Biden's economic agenda went the way of Biden's senility and continence. The left did what the left does, accused West Virginians of all being illiterate rednecks. Bette Midler led the charge.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">What <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JoeManchin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JoeManchin</a>, who represents a population smaller than Brooklyn, has done to the rest of America, who wants to move forward, not backward, like his state, is horrible. He sold us out. He wants us all to be just like his state, West Virginia. Poor, illiterate and strung out.<br />— bettemidler (@BetteMidler) <a href="https://twitter.com/BetteMidler/status/1472955243935711236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2021</a></blockquote> </div><p>Midler has since apologized to those who were offended by her tweet. It wasn't good enough for WV Gov. Justice. Which, if we're being honest, is a dope name for an elected official. It wasn't good enough for Babydog Justice, either. Hence, Babydog's hind parts are now a part of our national discourse.</p><p>If it were me, I would have said that if Babydog looked like Bette Midler, I'd shave Babydog's ass and teach her to walk backward. But Gov. Justice being an elected official needs to worry about decorum. He decided to go with the visual aid instead.</p><p>The irony of all this being is that since Bette lashed out at an entire state because Joe Manchin held a single political opinion she doesn't like, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-gates-joe-manchin" target="_blank">he has since completely sold out that state to the Democrat Party and Bill Gates</a>. Hence there now being a Senator Justice in the near future.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## World's dumbest criminals tunnel out of jail, only to be caught having breakfast at IHOP

Prior to your incarceration, be sure to watch <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>. If and when you go through the trouble of tunneling out of jail, you go to MEXICO. You don't stop down the road for a Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity. <a href="https://policetribune.com/escaped-inmates-captured-eating-breakfast-at-ihop-after-tunneling-through-jail-cell-wall/" target="_blank">Two Virginia knuckleheads did not watch </a><em><a href="https://policetribune.com/escaped-inmates-captured-eating-breakfast-at-ihop-after-tunneling-through-jail-cell-wall/">Shawshank</a></em>, and now they are back in jail.</p><p>John Michael Garza and Arley Vaughn Nemo were guests of the Newport News Jail Annex. Garza for contempt of court. Nemo for an assortment of credit card fraud. The two men, <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/newport-news/inmate-escape-newport-news/291-d518e7da-8e22-46d9-b5fd-b4e7e799302f?fbclid=IwAR2rvcGY3lMXssY_sVRN3aaI5lGgec2NHqXuEPeRqMT6bo2DTpYnLZCiqf8" target="_blank">according to the local news</a>, took advantage of a construction flaw and using only a toothbrush and a metal bar, tunneled their way out of their cell. This was 7:15 PM on March 20th.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="e7b53" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33352880&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Now, had Nemo and Garcia had a full-functioning brain between them, they would know when you escape from jail you go as far away from the jail as you can. It's called "being on the lam." You stay hidden. You keep a low profile. And when you at the very least cross state lines, you start a new life for yourself living in the shadows.</p><p>Nemo and Garcia decided to go to an IHOP. Six miles away.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="31f5a" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33352883&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Upon sitting down for an early breakfast, one of the IHOP employees noticed the two men in prison garb and covered in dirt. That employee said to themself, "Self, this seems unusual." </p><p>The Newport News Sheriff’s Office was called. And at 4:20 am on March 21st, after not even a full twelve hours of freedom, Garcia and Nemo were back in jail. Because they couldn't go one minute or one mile more without breakfast foods.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="bdcc9" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33352889&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>None of us here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website are familiar with Virginia penal (tee hee) code. But one could guess a prison break holds a lengthier jail sentence than both credit card fraud and a bench warrant combined.</p><p>Garcia and Nemo should have gone the full ten miles <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=waffle+house" target="_blank">to the Waffle House</a>. They would have blended in better.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Reporters are crying about Ron DeSantis again, and their new reason shows an AMAZING lack of self-awareness

You know, what with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-kamala-harris-desantis" target="_blank">them sucking at life</a> and his team <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-apologizes-team-desantis" target="_blank">calling them out for sucking at life</a> at every opportunity. Now reporters have a new complaint about America's Governor. As he (maybe) prepares to announce he's running for president, none of them can figure out how to cover him. Why?</p><p>Because reporters can't find anyone in DeSantis' orbit to leak information to them.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/reporters-bemoan-desantis-team-not-leaking-being-tight-circle-bit-culture-shock?intcmp=tw_fnc" target="_blank">Fox News writes</a> how other media outlets accuse Team DeSantis of running a "straight-up opposition campaign" against the press. And the press can't deal.</p><p>But this quote...if you could bottle the lack of self-awareness in this quote and sell it on eBay, you could fund an entire presidential campaign in 2024.</p><blockquote>Vanity Fair staff writer Charlotte Klein wrote Friday, “It can be particularly challenging to report inside DeSantis’s orbit, which makes the jockeying by news organizations all the more competitive. For one, it’s hard to source up inside an operation that appears inherently distrustful of journalists.”</blockquote><p>The press can't report on DeSantis' presidential(?) campaign...because they can't find anyone from inside the campaign to leak to them.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="2c35d" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33352569&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Klein also says it is "a little bit of a culture shock" from dealing with Trump's Team. Who also claims to hate the press, yet could always be counted on to leak to the press.</p><p>"We all took advantage of the knife fighting over at the White House—that’s how everyone got their leaks."</p><p>IF DeSantis runs for president -- we still have to hedge since he hasn't announced --  it could create a brand new paradigm of conservatives dealing with the press when running for office. In that, conservatives stop dealing with the press when running for office.</p><p>We know the press' job is to shill for the Democrat Party. We know newsrooms are filled with people who went to journalisming school out of a hatred for the right and the belief media wasn't biased enough. Why waste the time?</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
