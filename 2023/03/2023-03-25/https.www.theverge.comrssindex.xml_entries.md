  <p id="YtTUQh">Microsoft doesn’t want its rivals to use Bing’s search index to power their AI chatbots, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-25/microsoft-threatens-to-restrict-bing-data-from-rival-ai-search-tools?sref=ExbtjcSG">according to a report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The company reportedly told two unnamed Bing-powered search engines that it will restrict them from accessing Microsoft’s search data altogether if they continue using it with their AI tools.</p>
<p id="TTwNei">As noted by <em>Bloomberg</em>, Microsoft licenses out Bing’s search data to several search engines, including DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22770614/you-salesforce-startup-search-engine-privacy-information-control">AI search engine You.com</a>. While DuckDuckGo, for example, <a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/sources/">uses a combination</a> of Bing and its own web crawler to provide search results, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/09/search-engine-you/">You.com</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/05/neeva-brings-its-ad-free-search-engine-to-europe/">Neeva</a> also pull some of their results from Bing, helping to conserve some of the time and resources that come along with crawling the entire web.</p>

  <p id="hdX6nq"><em>Arrested Development</em> isn’t leaving Netflix anymore. The <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1639383443577643009?s=20">streamer announced on Twitter</a> that the show will remain on the platform after licensing issues nearly resulted in its removal.</p>
