<p>Gareth Southgate warns against distractions at Wembley on the back of his side’s big step forward in victory against Italy</p><p>It is fair to say that there will be a lot going on at Wembley on Sunday before England kick off their second Euro 2024 qualifying tie, against Ukraine. A golden boot presentation for Harry Kane to mark his status as the nation’s record goalscorer; he set the mark with a penalty in Thursday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/23/italy-england-euro-2024-qualifying-group-c-match-report">2-1 win over Italy in Naples</a> and would be congratulated by the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, on Saturday.</p><p>Another presentation, this one of a posthumous honorary England cap to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/07/fa-award-jack-leslie-posthumous-england-cap-97-years-after-call-up">family of Jack Leslie</a>, the black player who was denied the chance to play for his country in 1925 because of the colour of his skin. And a minute of applause for George Cohen, the 1966 World Cup winner, who died in December. So, sporting achievement; anti-racism plus the righting of a historical wrong; and the celebration of a cherished football figure. The power of the game – and specifically that of a sold-out Wembley – to provide a platform for so much continues to amaze.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/25/england-must-show-steel-as-emotions-run-high-before-visit-of-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>

## Nathan Broadhead’s last-gasp strike rescues draw for Wales in Croatia

<p>So, Wales finally know what life after Gareth Bale looks like and it’s not so bad, after all. Just as the supporters in a lively away end were ready to swallow a slender defeat against World Cup semi-finalists, the substitute and Wales debutant Nathan Broadhead poked in a stoppage-time equaliser to stun Croatia in Split. Cue delirium as the away bench emptied into the technical area. A few hours before kick-off the Wales squad went for a pre-match stroll on a glistening stretch of the Dalmatian coast and by the end of the night they had clinched an unlikely draw to claim a point from their Group D Euro 2024 qualifying opener. Croatia should have been out of sight but Broadhead’s late equaliser cancelled out Andrej Kramaric’s first-half strike.</p><p>This match, Wales’s first since exiting the World Cup at the end of November, always had the makings of a tricky opening assignment against a team who finished third in Qatar. Since departing Doha, Joe Allen, Chris Gunter and Jonny Williams have stepped back from international duty, Bale has been busy wowing seasoned golfers at Pebble Beach after retiring from football altogether and manager Rob Page has added Eric Ramsay, first-team coach at Manchester United, to his staff as part of a reshuffle. That is not to say Wales’s starting lineup in Split was unfamiliar – every player in the XI got minutes in Qatar – but there was room for six uncapped players on the bench.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/25/croatia-wales-euro-2024-qualifying-group-d-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Joselu scores twice on long-awaited debut to ease Spain past Norway

<p>Joselu had waited 15 years to make his international debut but he wasn’t about to wait any longer. Sent on with nine minutes left, the 32-year-old Espanyol striker was only two minutes into his first ever game when he scored the goal that finally secured victory for Spain and only three minutes into it when he scored his second, clinching a 3-0 victory over Norway on their first night under the coach Luis de la Fuente.</p><p>After the first had given Spain a 2-0 lead, Joselu had stood by the centre circle, holding his head, barely able to believe this but it was going to get even better. Next thing he knew, he was lying in the corner having only gone and done it again, while the Rosaleda chanted his name. This was not the way anyone had expected a sometimes nervy night to finish, but they were loving it. An old man had won it for a new team.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/25/joselu-scores-twice-on-long-awaited-debut-to-ease-spain-past-norway">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From bloated World Cups to dull club competitions excess is everywhere, but who will stand up against the exploitation?</p><p>It’s worth asking before launching into a jeremiad where you would have stood on major disruptions of the past. Have I become the old man who yells at clouds and is simply opposed to everything new? Would I have been against professionalism, the 1925 change in the offside law, the advent of European football, the foundation of the Premier League? Is this just the conservative creep of age? Perhaps. But, equally, it’s hard to look at football and where it may be headed and not feel fearful.</p><p>In some ways, football has rarely had it so good. The Premier League this season offers a title race, a battle for fourth and a nine-team relegation scrap; almost every match feels consequential. The World Cup provided a classic variant on one of the greatest narratives of all time, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/qatar-2022-dishes-up-sporting-surprise-and-a-coronation-for-lionel-messi" title="">ageing star triumphing at the last</a> – and Lionel Messi’s consecration came after extraordinary tension against the Netherlands in the quarter-final and France in the final.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/25/in-this-golden-age-for-football-the-threat-of-overkill-looms-ever-larger">Continue reading...</a>

A penalty from captain Katie Zelem and goals from Lucia García and Hayley Ladd saw them delight the home crowd who had turned out in their numbers on Women’s Football Weekend.</p><p>United returned to league action on the biggest stage of all, the Theatre of Dreams, after the disappointment of losing to Chelsea a fortnight ago. Despite that, confidence in the squad remained high after Marc Skinner’s side reached their first ever FA Cup semi-final last weekend. Looking to get their title chase back on track, the United manager named his strongest available line up. Leah Galton was the most notable returnee, taking up her customary position down the left in her 100th appearance for the club.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/25/manchester-united-west-ham-women-super-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

He offered no specific assurances regarding long-term financial help but did credit iwi (tribes) and marae (meeting grounds) for the critical work they had undertaken over the past month. He acknowledged the likelihood of an event as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/cyclone-gabrielle">Cyclone Gabrielle</a> occurring again, adding that the cumulative effect of the damage wrought provided a reminder of the “volatility of New Zealand” and that more could be done. One lesson, he submitted, was “you can never have one plan and assume that plan will work”.</p><p>This observation is felt instinctively, by people like local teacher José, who was out on the morning after the floods, riding on horseback through brown waters with his students to save a flooded Māori language learning centre. This knowledge is why he and others like him may view formal visits by those in suits with scepticism, trepidation. There is the sense that it is works that ought to precede words.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/my-cyclone-diary-amid-the-cleanup-the-true-meaning-of-home-and-community-emerges">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor turned novelist on creating authentic working-class characters, swapping Dublin for New York aged 16, and why sewing is like writing</p><p>Before making his literary debut in 2017 with <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/29/montpelier-parade-karl-geary-review">Montpelier Parade</a></em>, Irish-born novelist Karl Geary spent more than two decades acting and screenwriting, with credits including <em>Coney Island Baby</em> (starring his wife-to-be, <em>Breaking Bad</em>’s Laura Fraser), <em>The Burrowers</em> and an episode of <em>Sex and the City</em>. (Just don’t ask him about his shirtless appearance in Madonna’s 1992 coffee-table tome, <em>Sex</em>.) Now 50, he’s back with a second book, <em>Juno Loves Legs</em>, a piercing platonic love story whose misfit protagonists careen into young adulthood in 1980s Dublin, where he himself grew up.</p><p><strong>How did the new novel start for you?<br /></strong>With Juno’s voice and this line: “Dear Legs, it’s not gone my way.” She’s a bit of a bully – she elbowed and kneed her way in, screaming to be heard. I was writing a totally different book set in New York, but once I had her voice it just flatlined on the page.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/25/karl-geary-i-was-writing-out-of-confusion-and-horror-rage-and-love-juno-loves-legs">Continue reading...</a>

The Windsor framework offers hope for Northern Ireland, yet some, such as Boris Johnson, played with peace and voted against it<p>It was possible to hope, last Wednesday afternoon, that the toxic idiocy of British politics might recede a little. Even as Boris Johnson spaffed truth and common sense up the wall, in his seemingly vain effort to redeem his reputation, a slow defeated sigh, as of air leaving a leaking balloon, came from the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/03/22/tory-big-beasts-lick-wounds-brexit-rebellion-fizzles/?li_source=LI&amp;li_medium=liftigniter-rhr" title="">rightwingers’ rebellion</a> against the Windsor framework, the plan to rescue Northern Ireland from the worst effects of Brexit.</p><p>That evening, I went to <em>Under the Black Rock</em> by Tim Edge, a play set during the Troubles and performed at the Arcola theatre in Dalston, east London. It featured torture, murder, the destruction of a family and the deaths of children as collateral damage from bomb explosions, all of them realities of the conflict that the Good Friday agreement helped to end. The play brought home the monstrosity of English politicians such as Johnson, who voted against the framework, casually playing games with peace in Northern Ireland.

<p>(No Format!) <br />This stellar quartet, featuring kora, cello, accordion and saxophone, channel a multitude of influences to irresistible effect</p><p>The French cellist Vincent Segal is one of those peripatetic players who shows up across the musical frontier: on albums by Sting or “barefoot diva” Cesária Évora, on an arthouse film score or a dancefloor remix of Bumcello, the duo he formed with drummer Cyril Atef almost a quarter of a century ago. Segal’s most feted collaboration remains with Malian kora master <a href="https://www.ballakesissoko.com/en/">Ballaké Sissoko</a> on <em>Chamber Music</em> (2009) and <em>Musique de Nuit</em> (2015), where they pulled the traditions of Africa and Europe into a seductive neoclassical fusion.</p><p>Here, the pair are joined by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/17/vincent-peirani-and-emile-parisien-abrazo-review-delightful-and-astonishing">accordionist Vincent Peirani and soprano sax player Émile Parisien</a> on a venture that proves just as irresistible, even if its title translates as The Lost. It’s a sprightly, restless set, with Segal’s plucked cello providing a thrumming heartbeat to what is a communal, improvisational approach. There are reflective pieces – Sissoko’s Ta Nyé and Banja bookend the record in flurries of kora – but more typical is the group’s reworking of the late Joe Zawinul’s Orient Express, while on Esperanza the quartet seem to be channelling a drunken Colombian cumbia. Although inflected by various accents – there’s a Balkan feel to Izao, a touch of John Coltrane to Parisien’s sax – this is truly fusion music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/25/ballake-sissoko-vincent-segal-vincent-parisien-emile-peirani-les-egares-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The fact that ChatGPT isn’t the only machine-learning program out there is down to the way in which tech breakthroughs arise</p><p>When, late last year, the editor asked me and other <em>Observer</em> writers what we thought 2023 would be like, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/01/sport-tv-tech-and-fashion-what-does-2023-have-in-store-for-us">my response</a> was that it would be more like 1993 than any other year in recent history. Why? Simply this: 1993 was the year that Mosaic, the first modern web browser, launched and all of a sudden the non-technical world understood what this strange “internet” thing was for. This was despite the fact that the network had been switched on a whole decade earlier, during which time the world seemed almost entirely unaware of it; as a species, we seem to be slow on the uptake.</p><p>Much the same would happen in 2023, I thought, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>.

And then out comes ChatGPT and suddenly “meatspace” (internet pioneer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/08/john-perry-barlow-open-internet-dream-dying">John Perry Barlow</a>’s derisive term for the non-techie world) wakes up and exclaims: “So <em>that’s</em> what this AI stuff is all about.

It’s quite disconcerting,” says Carla von der Becke, looking up at an assemblage of agricultural tools – hefty saws included – hanging around a rustic chandelier in the kitchen of her home in the South Downs. The perilous-looking arrangement is the latest intervention here, in the house Carla grew up in, by her friend the South African artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/helena_pritchard_/?hl=en" title="">HelenA</a> Pritchard (who intervened in her own name to add the “A” in at the end).</p><p>The two women met a decade ago through mutual friends in the art world – Carla is co-director of London-based PR agency <a href="https://www.albanyartscommunications.com/" title="">Albany Arts</a> – and HelenA had occasionally been a visitor to the house when Carla was staying with her parents. Then, early in 2021, Carla’s mother died “quite unexpectedly. She had been caring for my dad, who has dementia, so then I was here caring for him, and it was quite intense…” It was at this point that HelenA offered to come and stay for a longer spell. “Carla didn’t have any help, she was doing everything herself and I thought she might just need a friend. And I love getting out into the country.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/25/it-was-a-magical-place-to-grow-up-the-artist-using-her-childhood-home-as-a-canvas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A French couple’s dreams of the good life in rural northern Spain descend into all-out war with the locals in Rodrigo Sorogoyen’s superbly acted drama </p><p>It was meant to be a purer, simpler way of life. Former teacher Antoine (Denis Ménochet) and his wife, Olga (Marina Foïs), relocated from their comfortable life in France to a smallholding in the Spanish hill country of Galicia. The aim is to grow organic vegetables and give back to the community by renovating abandoned village houses. But while the land may be fertile, it is drenched in bad blood. And while there’s a melancholy beauty in the verdant, mist-shrouded peaks, the hill people, as their menacing neighbour Xan (Luis Zahera) points out with relish, are an ugly bunch. There’s a simmering, creeping menace to Spanish director Rodrigo Sorogoyen’s superb, award-winning thriller, a sense of an inevitable collision between the newcomers and those whose roots – and grudges – run generations deep in the Galician soil.</p><p>The modest village bar is Xan’s domain. Face sharpened by the elements, dissatisfaction and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of spite, he uses the gloomy room as a combat arena in which he goads his chosen target – in this case, Antoine. Xan and his brother Lorenzo are already at odds with the French couple over a planning dispute, but it soon becomes clear that Xan plans open warfare, and that Antoine is not one to back away from a fight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/25/the-beasts-review-breathtakingly-tense-galician-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In an epic feat of improvisation, 12 players over three days reimagined the jazz great’s magnum opus. Nubya Garcia, Dave Okumu and producer Martin Terefe talk us through the recording of London Brew</p><p>“We played for three days straight with no notes on the page and no repeats. There were 12 musicians in the room, just listening and responding. It was intense.” In December 2020, the jazz saxophonist <a href="https://www.nubyagarcia.com/">Nubya Garcia</a> took part in a marathon London-based recording session to mark the 50th anniversary of the release of Miles Davis’s album <em>Bitches Brew</em>. Also recorded over three days, in New York in 1969 with a group of 13 musicians, <em>Bitches Brew</em> is a sprawling work of jazz, funk and psychedelic rock. Squealing horns battle with a thunderous, swinging rhythm section of double drummers, while electronic keyboard and guitars shred through melody with a piercing clarity.</p><p>One of the most groundbreaking jazz albums ever made, it won a Grammy in 1971 and has sold more than 1m copies. Its use of tape editing and looping techniques went on to inspire the process of hip-hop sampling, and its sound helped birth the genre-hopping style of jazz fusion, influencing the work of artists as varied as the pianist Herbie Hancock (who played in Davis’s Second Great Quintet until 1968), guitarist George Benson and Radiohead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/25/uk-jazz-musicians-50-years-of-miles-davis-bitches-brew-london-nubya-garcia-shabaka-hutchings-dave-okumu">Continue reading...</a>

She tried to hold her own position inside the baseline, but was easily pushed back. When she assumed more risk, forcing the ball closer to the lines, her errors piled up. After 67 minutes, the 20-year-old was thoroughly beaten 6-1, 6-1.</p><p>Eighteen months on from her unforgettable run to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/11/emma-raducanu-makes-tennis-history-with-us-open-final-win" title="">the 2021 US Open final</a>, Fernandez faces plenty of her own struggles as she tries to follow up her breakout performance. In New York, she showed off the full breadth of her talent. Despite standing 5ft 6in, she smote opponents with the combined force of her vicious lefty forehand, unfailingly aggressive returning, movement that allowed her to quickly flip defence to attack and her crafty resourcefulness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/25/leylah-fernandezs-struggles-on-show-in-miami-but-she-has-grit-to-rise-again">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London; Bristol Cathedral</strong><br />A heckler heightened the atmosphere before a precise performance of Bach’s testing mass; and care home residents enjoyed a thrilling rendition of Beethoven’s Fifth in a truly resonant setting</p><p>Feelings run high in classical music, especially now. You sense it in audience behaviour. At the Festival Hall last week, <a href="https://oae.co.uk/people/crispin-woodhead/">Crispin Woodhead</a>, chief executive of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, came on stage before a performance of Bach’s Mass in B minor. The gist of his brief welcome, of which more shortly, was to thank the audience for buying tickets: in so doing, they were supporting an organisation that believes in excellence and in making music available to all. We all knew what he meant. No need to say the words “BBC” or “Singers” or “Arts Council” or “cuts”. But there was unexpected opposition. A man at the front started shouting and gesticulating. The crowd jeered back in an effort to silence him, some in language even more colourful than his own. For an instant, the atmosphere was nasty. He was escorted out. The performance began, magnificent and affecting, and the loss was his.</p><p>Bach finished this two-hour choral work in 1749, a year before his death. His reason for writing it is unknown. He probably never heard it performed in its entirety and may not have intended it as a single work. The challenge to the singers is immense. At times, the choral writing is in five parts, high-lying, exposed, technically difficult, tiring. The 22-strong Choir of the Enlightenment was impeccable, each entry confident and precise, keeping up with the brisk tempi set by the conductor, Václav Luks, in his OAE debut. Czech-born, a harpsichordist as well as horn player, Luks is an early music specialist. His application and care showed in every bar and in the thoughtful coherence of the whole: look out for his name.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/25/the-week-in-classical-oae-bachs-mass-in-b-minor-aurora-orchestra-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Repair Shop presenter reflects on growing up poor, discovering fashion, and why fame will never go to his head</p><p>Born in London in 1970, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/sep/18/jay-blades-i-talk-a-lot-about-black-history-but-i-also-love-black-future" title="">Jay Blades</a> is the furniture restorer and TV presenter best known for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/17/the-repair-shop-the-idyllic-show-that-brings-me-to-tears" title="">The Repair Shop</a>. His childhood in Hackney was blighted by racism and fighting, until a career in community and social work changed the course of his life. It wasn’t until Blades was 40 and working for a charity which encouraged young people to repair furniture that he discovered he had a skill for crafting and fixing objects. Before finding fame on screen, he got a degree in criminology and philosophy from Buckinghamshire New University, where he is now chancellor. Blades opened the first physical shop for his online brand Jay &amp; Co in Poole, Dorset, earlier this month.</p><p><strong>The car in this photo </strong>was parked somewhere on Clapton High Street in east London, and I was on my way to a wedding – probably of one of my cousins. I was 13 and looking properly grown-up. I was always tall – 6ft by the time I was 11! But being in that tux, even though I had cheap white sports socks on underneath, made me feel like the governor. Hence why I am posing like that: “Bosh! Here I am!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/25/jay-blades-looks-back">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘There were fist-fights down at CD:UK’ – 90s pop remembered by those who lived through it

<p>Conflict between bands, conflict within bands, booze, breakdowns and awards-show agony: in these extracts from oral history Reach for the Stars, Five, Steps, Pete Waterman and more spill about the dark side of the decade</p><p>Formed in May 1997, Five, AKA Ritchie Neville, Scott Robinson, J Brown, Sean Conlon and Abz Love, released their debut single Slam Dunk (Da Funk) just six months later and found themselves living in a house together as teenagers. The band’s 11 UK Top 10 singles, three Top 5 albums and two arena tours spanned less than a four-year period. That it ended in burnout, depression and fist-fights was hardly surprising given their light-speed ascent. In recent years, there has been a happy ending of sorts with Neville, Robinson and Conlon reuniting as a three-membered Five and releasing a new album last year. But it all started out via five lads standing out from an initial crowd of 3,000 wannabes that featured a pre-fame Russell Brand among their number …</p><p><strong>Chris Herbert (manager, Five)</strong> The idea [behind Five] was Boyzone were going to bring you a bunch of flowers and Five were going to fuck you against a wall down the side alley. Girls love a bad boy and boys could relate to it. Musically it was going to be harder and tougher.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/25/five-steps-90s-pop-reach-for-the-stars-michael-cragg-extract">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Glossop, Derbyshire:</strong> We were watching the farmer feeding the younger sheep outside, when suddenly her alarm went off</p><p>As the mid-afternoon mist came down upon us, we drove over the picturesque rolling hills. The car jolted from side to side on the craggy, treacherous ground. We came to a stop at a farm and a farmer greeted us with a warm welcome. She led us into an old, creaking barn with friendly cows and a small flock of sheep laying beside their wobbly little lambs. We went outside and across the yard to see the two dominant male sheep in a massive field. It was feeding time, so the farmer poured feed into buckets as they nudged her legs.</p><p>She then fed the younger sheep in the opposite field, throwing them pellets like a thousand bullets firing over the wall. Suddenly, her phone went off like a siren, warning her that a baby lamb was being born.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/25/young-country-diary-not-just-one-newborn-lamb-but-two">Continue reading...</a>

How did our asylum system get so broken – and what does it reveal about Rishi Sunak’s promise to stop the small boats?</p><p>In late September last year, a Home Office employee walked into a newly opened section of the Manston short-term holding facility in Kent and realised that conditions there were spiralling out of control: “It had got way beyond what was ethical and humane.”</p><p>The site, a collection of marquees in the grounds of a former army barracks near a disused airport, was overcrowded, and staff were improvising increasingly unsuitable makeshift expansions. “There were people who’d been sleeping on a mat on the floor of a marquee for 20 days. We’d run out of space, so we were opening old bits of the site. They’d put some mats on the floor of the gym – a really old building. It looked like it was about to fall down. None of it had been set up with decent hygiene facilities, bedding or anything. You walked in and your heart just sank. I had a feeling of: ‘Oh my God, what have we got into here?’” says the official, who asked not to be identified.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/25/inside-story-of-manston-detention-centre">Continue reading...</a>

## Resistance fighter, novelist - and Sartre’s favourite agony aunt: rediscovering Alba Céspedes

<p>Championed by Elena Ferrante, Céspedes’s neo-realist classic The Forbidden Notebook is being reissued 70 years after it was first published. It still speaks to women’s lives today</p><p>Postwar Italian neorealism was one of the most exciting literary movements of the 20th century, but it’s only recently that the female neorealists have had the attention they deserve. In 2018, the publisher Daunt began its vital championing of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/25/if-ferrante-is-a-friend-ginzburg-is-a-mentor-the-rise-and-rise-of-writer-natalia-ginzburg" title="">Natalia Ginzburg</a>, and now Pushkin brings us Alba de Céspedes. These women were famous in their lifetimes but have been forgotten since, and I think we owe their rediscovery to our own need for a reinvigorated realist novel during a moment almost as crisis-laden as Italy in the 1940s.</p><p>It’s telling that many of today’s most sophisticated realists, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/rachel-cusk" title="">Rachel Cusk</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/sally-rooney" title="">Sally Rooney</a> among them, have been crucial in championing Ginzburg. And it’s no coincidence that all this began with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/elena-ferrante" title="">Ferrante</a> fever. Elena Ferrante herself owes so much to neorealism, and it’s she who has driven the rediscovery of Céspedes. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/29/frantumaglia-a-writers-journey-elena-ferrante-review" title="">Frantumaglia</a>, a collection of letters and reflections, she listed Céspedes’s The Best of Husbands as one of the few novels – “books of encouragement” – she could read while writing. Publishers everywhere rushed to find a copy, and this agile, conversational translation of Céspedes’s 1952 Forbidden Notebook, by Ferrante’s own translator, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/12/ann-goldstein-i-try-to-make-it-really-clear-that-i-am-not-elena-ferrante" title="">Ann Goldstein</a>, is the first in a series of novels to be republished.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/25/resistance-fighter-novelist-and-sartres-favourite-agony-aunt-rediscovering-alba-cespedes">Continue reading...</a>

Plus – an extract from her new book</p><p>When Leah Williamson was seven, her father told her he didn’t want to hear any excuses. If she really wanted to become a professional footballer, and was prepared to put the effort in, there was no reason why she shouldn’t succeed. Today, Williamson is one of the best-paid women in the game and captain of an England team that hasn’t lost for 29 matches, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report" title="">the final of last year’s Euros</a>.</p><p>What makes her father’s words remarkable is that, at the time, there was no professional women’s league in England. Even more remarkably, when she was a toddler her parents feared that she might never walk properly. Williamson was born with inward-pointing toes. “If they couldn’t have fixed it, it would have created problems when I started to grow.

<p>This vegetarian recipe takes its influence from Korean fried chicken, and the resulting sticky, sweet, crisp dish will more than satisfy any fast-food cravings</p><p>This is a recipe for Saturday nights, when you need something fried, crisp and dripping in delicious, hot, sticky-sweet sauce. The inspiration came from our incredible local Korean fried chicken shop, though I’ve bowed to my boyfriend’s challenge to cut down on meat and produced a recipe that vegetarians can enjoy. The use of vodka in the batter (a tip I picked up from <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/j-kenji-lopez-alt-5118720">J Kenji López-Alt</a>) might strike you as strange, but it’s crucial to the final texture: the alcohol rapidly boils away, leaving the crispest batter you’ve ever had.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/25/tamal-ray-recipe-crisp-fried-tofu-tempura-spring-onions-spicy-barbecue-sauce">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Five years on from her acclaimed novel Ordinary People, the writer returns to explore the lives of black British Londoners. She talks about Grenfell, belonging – and how she writes to bear witness</p><p>In 2019, Diana Evans’s third novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/11/ordinary-people-diana-evans-review-couples-marital-angst-black-mixed-race" title="">Ordinary People</a> met with a rapturous critical response, was shortlisted for the Women’s prize, and earned comparisons to Tolstoy from the New Yorker, due to her gift for intertwining “the public and the private, the momentous and the mundane”. Since her debut, 26A, was published in 2005, her novels have been a record of our times, offering elegant yet excoriating observations of London life through the intimate lens of domestic relationships.</p><p>Her fiction takes aim at the intersection of love and politics. Her characters come alive by how they experience, observe and react to current events. This in turn influences how they love and are loved. The political becomes part of the pain of ordinary life. It is a project she continues in her latest novel, A House for Alice, the follow-up to Ordinary People, which continues the story of two long-term couples – Melissa and Michael, and Damian and Stephanie. When we speak, she explains that she was drawn back to the characters by a visceral connection: “I genuinely believed in Michael and Melissa’s love story but there’s so much in their way – psychologically, societally – and I wanted to pick that apart a bit more.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/25/diana-evans-the-tory-rhetoric-asks-us-to-forget-im-trying-to-make-sure-that-we-dont">Continue reading...</a>

<p>British summer time starts at 1am on Sunday, when clocks go forward an hour</p><p>The ritual of clock-changing is upon us once again as British summer time begins at 1am on Sunday 26 March, when clocks go forward to 2am. Much of the population gets to lose an hour’s sleep – excluding those who work nights, those who are having a big night out, and those with pets and small children that don’t pay any heed to the clock anyway.</p><p>Sometimes known as “daylight savings time”, the clock-change moves the UK to GMT+1, resulting in more daylight in the evenings but less in the mornings. That is great news if you want to go out and do things in the evenings, less so if you have a job where you have to start early.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/25/clocks-go-forward-british-summer-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From back garden keepie-uppies to airport flicks and tricks, a countdown of the greatest commercials from the decade</p><p>Scott Parker before he was Scott Parker, or rather when he was a lad called Jimmy who loved doing keepie-uppies in his back garden, and what impressive keepie-uppies they were.

It is simple and cool, and because of who Jimmy grew up to be it is memorable.

<p>State opposition leads to prison while the national team plays all games away from home due to the support of Russia</p><p>There will be no supporters in the stands of Stadion Karadorde, in the Serbian city of Novi Sad, when Belarus begin their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign with a “home” match against Switzerland on Saturday. Nor, in many eyes, will there be much excuse for the fact their meeting is taking place at all. Belarus are the competition’s pariahs: virtually friendless bar this weekend’s hosts and condemned to play all of their games on foreign soil for the foreseeable future, they will play on despite the deep sense of unease around their participation.</p><p>Last March Uefa banned Belarus from playing on their own territory on account of the country’s supporting role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But they have not been barred from competing, unlike the state to which Belarus is essentially a vassal, and few think the governing body has gone far enough. The case for a ban becomes even stronger when Belarus’s dismal human rights record, which has had a direct and crippling effect on its football scene, is thrown in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/25/aliaksandr-ivulin-its-not-very-safe-to-be-a-footballer-in-belarus-now">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Chicken schnitzels coated in semolina crumb with a pea salsa, savoury south Indian cakes for dipping in coconut chutney and spicy oil, and irresistible lemony semolina and almond cookies</p><p>Many of my favourite comfort foods are connected by one ingredient: semolina. Whether it’s the gnocchi my Italian grandmother made for us or the syrup-drenched cakes, dumplings and couscous of my childhood in Jerusalem, it’s often semolina at work. Its texture is distinct: somehow glutinous and gritty in the likes of those gnocchi, but also light and sandy in cakes and cookies. Semolina, which is halfway between wheat and flour, is also a really effective way to bring a welcome crunch to two other great comfort foods: roast potatoes, which benefit hugely from being rolled in a little semolina after they’ve been parboiled, and chicken schnitzel. In fact, it’s a bit of a miracle ingredient.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/25/chicken-schnitzel-braised-peas-idli-coconut-chutney-lemony-cookies-yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-cooking-with-semolina">Continue reading...</a>
