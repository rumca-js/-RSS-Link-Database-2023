As Bencic squeezed up to the baseline, suffocating the young Canadian with her early ball-striking and sharp redirections, Fernandez could not keep up. She tried to hold her own position inside the baseline, but was easily pushed back. When she assumed more risk, forcing the ball closer to the lines, her errors piled up.

You sense it in audience behaviour. At the Festival Hall last week, <a href=\"https://oae.co.uk/people/crispin-woodhead/\">Crispin Woodhead</a>, chief executive of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, came on stage before a performance of Bach\u2019s Mass in B minor. The gist of his brief welcome, of which more shortly, was to thank the audience for buying tickets: in so doing, they were supporting an organisation that believes in excellence and in making music available to all. We all knew what he meant. No need to say the words \u201cBBC\u201d or \u201cSingers\u201d or \u201cArts Council\u201d or \u201ccuts\u201d. But there was unexpected opposition. A man at the front started shouting and gesticulating. The crowd jeered back in an effort to silence him, some in language even more colourful than his own. For an instant, the atmosphere was nasty. He was escorted out. The performance began, magnificent and affecting, and the loss was his.</p><p>Bach finished this two-hour choral work in 1749, a year before his death. His reason for writing it is unknown. He probably never heard it performed in its entirety and may not have intended it as a single work. The challenge to the singers is immense. At times, the choral writing is in five parts, high-lying, exposed, technically difficult, tiring. The 22-strong Choir of the Enlightenment was impeccable, each entry confident and precise, keeping up with the brisk tempi set by the conductor, V\u00e1clav Luks, in his OAE debut. Czech-born, a harpsichordist as well as horn player, Luks is an early music specialist. His application and care showed in every bar and in the thoughtful coherence of the whole: look out for his name.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/25/the-week-in-classical-oae-bachs-mass-in-b-minor-aurora-orchestra-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/25/the-week-in-classical-oae-bachs-mass-in-b-minor-aurora-orchestra-review", "date_published": "2023-03-25 12:30:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Reece James out of England qualifier with Ukraine due to \u2018ongoing issue\u2019", "description": "<ul><li>James missed the World Cup in Qatar after a knee injury</li><li>Marcus Rashford, Mason Mount and Nick Pope also absent</li></ul><p>Reece James will miss England\u2019s Euro 2024 qualifier against Ukraine \u201cfor assessment on an ongoing issue\u201d.</p><p>The 23-year-old has endured an injury-interrupted season, with the Chelsea right-back missing the World Cup in Qatar due to a knee problem.
