<p>In 2020, Epic Games publicly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-unreal-engine-5-demo-150044561.html"><ins>demoed Unreal Engine 5</ins></a> for the first time. Nearly three years later, gamers are still waiting for the tech to go mainstream. Outside of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-chapter-4-season-1-announced-201610345.html"><em><ins>Fortnite</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epics-the-matrix-awakens-gets-delisted-on-july-9th-203902046.html"><em><ins>The Matrix Awakens</ins></em></a>, there aren’t any UE5 games you can play right now, and the first salvo probably won’t arrive until the end of the year at the earliest. None of that stopped Epic from showcasing the engine’s latest capabilities with a handful of new demos during its recent <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/dive-into-epic-s-announcements-from-gdc-2023"><ins>State of Unreal keynote</ins></a> at GDC 2023.</p><div id="449ba4d13bac4c7c9cd2958d0c2763e3"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Arguably the most impressive one saw <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 </em>developer Ninja Theory show off Epic’s new <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/new-metahuman-animator-feature-set-to-bring-easy-high-fidelity-performance-capture-to-metahumans"><ins>MetaHuman Animator</ins></a>. The tool promises to make realistic facial capture accessible to indie developers by allowing them to use an iPhone, instead of dedicated equipment, to capture facial performances. As you can see from the two demos Epic shared, the tool makes it possible to quickly and accurately transform a closeup video of an actor into something a studio can use in-game. Epic said the animator would launch this summer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="705ddeb80a494597b21327ca05798795"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Separately, Epic showed off some of the enhancements coming to Unreal Engine 5.2 with a demo that featured, of all things, a digital recreation of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-review-150019762.html"><ins>Rivian’s R1T</ins></a> electric truck. The EV turned out to be the perfect showcase for UE 5’s new Substrate shading system. The technology allows artists to create different shading models and layer them as they see fit. In the demo, Epic gave the R1T an opal body to show how Substrate can allow different material layers to interact with one another without creating lighting artifacts. The demo was also a showcase for Epic’s new set of Procedural Content Generation tools. They allow artists to create expansive, highly detailed levels from a small set of hand-crafted assets.</p><div id="005b389830734cd08e690313c585dc94"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>If all goes according to plan, it won’t be much longer before the first slate of Unreal Engine 5 games arrive. Provided it’s not delayed again, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-20223-release-date-204512203.html"><em><ins>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is slated to release this year. <em>Lords of the Fallen </em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-myth-wukong-2022-gameplay-and-cinematic-trailer-221033645.html"><em><ins>Black Myth: Wukong</ins></em></a><em>, </em>two other UE5 projects, don’t have a release date yet but have been in development for a few years now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/epic-made-a-rivian-r1t-demo-to-show-off-its-latest-unreal-engine-5-tools-214300199.html?src=rss

<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-28303">released a pair of emergency updates</a> to address the “aCropalypse” security flaw found within its native Windows 10 and 11 screenshot editing apps. As <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-pushes-oob-security-updates-for-windows-snipping-tool-flaw/"><em><ins>Bleeping Computer</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reports, the company began testing a fix for the vulnerability earlier this week shortly after it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-security-flaw-exposes-cropped-out-screenshot-data-131519887.html"><ins>discovered by retired software engineer Chris Blume</ins></a>.</p><p>On Friday evening, Microsoft began rolling out public updates for Windows 11’s Snipping Tool as well as Windows 10’s Snip &amp; Sketch app. You can manually prompt Windows to patch the app you use by opening the Microsoft Store and clicking on “Library,” followed by “Get Updates.” Microsoft recommends all users install the updates.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The aCropalypse flaw was first discovered on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-vulnerability-allows-bad-actors-to-undo-markup-screenshot-edits-and-redactions-195322267.html"><ins>Pixel devices</ins></a>, and subsequently addressed by Google in Android’s recent March security update. In the case of Windows 11’s Snipping Tool, it turned out the utility wasn’t properly overwriting cropped PNG data. The issue did not affect all PNG files, but the concern was that bad actors could exploit the vulnerability to partially recover edited images, particularly those that had been cropped to omit sensitive information. As with Google's March Android update, Microsoft's patches won't protect images that were previously created with its screenshot tools.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-releases-fix-for-windows-11-screenshot-privacy-bug-195412172.html?src=rss

## Internet Archive violated publisher copyrights by lending ebooks, court rules

<p>A federal judge has ruled against the Internet Archive in its high-profile case against a group of four US publishers led by Hachette Book Group. Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rules-internet-archives-digital-book-lending-violates-copyrights-2023-03-25/?utm_source=reddit.com"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, Judge John G. Koeltl declared on Friday the nonprofit had infringed on the group’s copyrights by lending out digitally scanned copies of their books.</p><p>The lawsuit originated from the Internet Archive’s decision to launch the “National Emergency Library” during the early days of the pandemic. The program saw the organization offer more than 1.4 million free ebooks, including copyrighted works, in response to libraries worldwide closing their doors due to coronavirus lockdown measures.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before March 2020, the Internet Archive’s Open Library program operated under what’s known as a “controlled digital lending” system, meaning there was often a waitlist to borrow a book from its collection. When the pandemic hit, the Internet Archive lifted those restrictions to make it easier for people to access reading material while stuck at home. The <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/internet-archives-national-emergency-library-is-vile-says-copyright-alliance-310331/"><ins>Copyright Alliance</ins></a> was quick to take issue with the effort. And in June 2020, Hachette, as well as HarperCollins, Penguin Random House and John Wiley &amp; Sons, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/internet-archive-publishers-lawsuit-open-library-193358101.html"><ins>sued The Internet Archive</ins></a>, accusing the organization of enabling “willful mass copyright infringement.” That same month, the Internet Archive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/internet-archives-national-emergency-library-close-early-lawsuit-191522607.html"><ins>shuttered the National Emergency Program early</ins></a>.</p><p>Going into this week’s trial, the Internet Archive argued the initiative was protected by the principle of Fair Use, which allows the unlicensed use of copyrighted works under some circumstances. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/24/23655804/internet-archive-hatchette-publisher-ebook-library-lawsuit"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em><ins> notes</ins></a>, HathiTrust, an offshoot of the Google Books Search project, successfully used a similar argument in 2014 to <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/authors-guild-v-hathitrust"><ins>fend off a legal challenge</ins></a> from The Authors Guild. However, Judge Koeltl rejected the Internet Archive’s stance, declaring “there is nothing transformative” about lending unauthorized copies of books. &quot;Although [the Internet Archive] has the right to lend print books it lawfully acquired, it does not have the right to scan those books and lend the digital copies en masse,&quot; <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/lbvggjmzovq/internetarchive.pdf">he wrote</a>. Maria Pallante, the president and CEO of the Association of American Publishers, <a href="https://publishers.org/news/publishers-prevail-in-summary-judgement-against-internet-archive-for-copyright-infringement/">said</a> the ruling “underscored the importance of authors, publishers, and creative markets in a global society.&quot;</p><p>On Saturday, the Internet Archive said it would appeal the decision. “Libraries are more than the customer service departments for corporate database products. For democracy to thrive at global scale, libraries must be able to sustain their historic role in society — owning, preserving, and lending book,” the nonprofit wrote in a <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/03/25/the-fight-continues/"><ins>blog post</ins></a>. “This ruling is a blow for libraries, readers, and authors and we plan to appeal it.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/internet-archive-violated-publisher-copyrights-by-lending-ebooks-court-rules-164629790.html?src=rss

## Intel co-founder Gordon Moore has passed away

<p>Gordon Moore, co-founder and former CEO of Intel, has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d327af4-8b42-4ff1-a409-ae7bf906e9e9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Intel&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDMyN2FmNC04YjQyLTRmZjEtYTQwOS1hZTdiZjkwNmU5ZTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW50ZWwuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvd3d3L3VzL2VuL25ld3Nyb29tL25ld3MvZ29yZG9uLW1vb3JlLW9iaXR1YXJ5Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImUzYjZhZDlmLTE0ZDQtNDFiYi04YWVhLTZjZDA4NDI3MzVkNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVkshOeQvRz6nBo_ilE7XjXjI8BNXCU2nV41IRKfHM32&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews%2Fgordon-moore-obituary.html">passed away</a> at 94. He was the last surviving member of the Intel Trinity, which also included his fellow founder Robert Noyce and their first hire <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-22-andrew-grove-intel-ceo.html">Andy Grove</a>. Moore and Noyce previously worked with the co-inventor of the transistor, William Shockley, before helping found Fairchild Semiconductor. In 1968, the two struck out on their own and founded NM Electronics, which eventually became Intel.&nbsp;</p><p>A few years before that, in 1965, Moore wrote a paper that envisioned the miniaturization of computers. To be precise, he predicted that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every year, leading to the creation and production of smaller and more powerful chips that would, in turn, enable advancements in technology. His prediction was dubbed "Moore's Law," and it was proven accurate in the years that followed. By 1975, he adjusted his estimate for the doubling of transistors to every two years, though now top chipmakers <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/27/intel-says-moores-law-is-still-alive-nvidia-says-its-ended.html">disagree</a> on whether Moore's Law still holds.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In 1979, Moore was named chairman of the board and CEO at Intel before giving up the latter role in 1987. He apparently served as mediator between Noyce and Grove, and he and Grove were the ones who decided that Intel would focus on microprocessors instead of continuing with its memory business. The rest, as they say, is history. Before Moore completely stepped down from his duties at Intel in 2006, he and his wife established the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation with $5 billion in funding. The foundation supported environmental conservation efforts, mostly in the San Francisco Bay area, and donated to various educational institutions' science and technology departments.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/intel-co-founder-gordon-moore-has-passed-away-073145647.html?src=rss
