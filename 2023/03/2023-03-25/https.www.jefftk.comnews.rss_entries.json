I can approximate correction with a\nvertical shear:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/shear-y-corner-crop-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/shear-y-corner-crop.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nFollowed by a horizontal scale:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/shear-y-scale-x-corner-crop-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/shear-y-scale-x-corner-crop.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn writing this up, however, I realized that my phone's (Pixel 5a)\ncamera app takes a different approach.  Instead of waiting for you to\ncrop an image, it automatically fixes faces itself.  The pictures\nabove were taken with Open Camera, which doesn't have these smarts;\nhere's what I get with the default camera app:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/pixel-photos-corner-crop-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/pixel-photos-corner-crop.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt made the fix initially, not on cropping; the full-size image also\nminimizes distortion around my face:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/uncropped-corner-distortion-fixed-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/uncropped-corner-distortion-fixed.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSince this is only applied to my face, though, and not the rest of my\nbody, it does give a slightly uncanny effect.  Compare to the\nfull-size version of the Open Camera image:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/uncropped-no-correction-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/uncropped-no-correction.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nYou can see what the Pixel camera app did around my face by looking at\nthe line of the bookcase:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/pixel-photos-corner-crop-annotated-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/pixel-photos-corner-crop-annotated.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn real life and in a raw photo that line would be straight:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/standard-corner-crop-annotated-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/standard-corner-crop-annotated.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnd in my manually corrected version from above the line is straight:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/shear-y-scale-x-corner-crop-annotated-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/shear-y-scale-x-corner-crop-annotated.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nBut because the Pixel camera is doing its correction on the whole\nimage, instead of waiting for you to crop, it isn't able to preserve\nall the straight lines in the original image.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI think the Pixel edit is probably still worth doing, since we care a\nlot about faces and they do look more natural projected as if you were\nlooking straight at them.  Reprojecting the whole image to minimize\ndistortion when you crop would also be a pretty nifty feature, and\ndoesn't introduce the kind of distortions that fixing one part of a\nlarger image does.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0ZuTgZRhEVknkSr4yeNV6mqq119Fdo2o6rSAnqEa4mTwmwLBtSk1C94mQmaartYPul\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/Q47fsq4CeTtgEFLvm\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110086126826900225\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/reproject-on-cropping", "date_published": "2023-03-25 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
