## Farrell edges Smith to help Saracens to bonus point win over Harlequins

<ul><li>Saracens 36-24 Harlequins</li><li>Victory clinches home semi-final spot for Premiership leaders</li></ul><p>At the home of one undisputed No 10, Owen Farrell edged his fly-half rival Marcus Smith to guide Saracens to a home semi-final in an entertaining bonus point victory over Harlequins. Farrell departed the pitch with a nasty bang to his left ankle before full-time but up till then had played his part in a powerful if far from perfect performance from the league leaders who are now assured of a top-two finish.</p><p>Smith, for his part, dazzled at times, made mistakes in others but never stopped trying to carve open the Saracens defence. It makes for captivating watching – Spurs could do with a player like that themselves – and comes in stark contrast to Farrell’s composed style. In truth, neither player had the kind of impact as Billy Vunipola, persona non grata with England at the moment, and if the No 10 battle caught the eye, it was Saracens’ ruthless streak, coupled with their ability to keep the error count lower than their visitors, which ultimately proved decisive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/25/saracens-harlequins-premiership-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From jazz prodigy to Sharon Van Etten co-writer, the Oregon musician gets personal on her catchy new album of melodic indie-rock</p><p>It was, of all things, a viral 2014 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyTTX6Wlf1Y">YouTube cover</a> of Meghan Trainor’s All About That Bass that launched Oregon native Kate Davis on her current career trajectory. It brought her attention, but some of the sexist online reaction to the Postmodern Jukebox video disturbed the conservatory-trained jazz prodigy deeply. “I was really overwhelmed by the attention, and, honestly, a lot of it was very inappropriate and really upsetting as a woman. So I hid,” she told Oregon Public Broadcasting.</p><p>After five years away from the spotlight, Davis marked her return with a co-writing credit on Sharon Van Etten’s sublime single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7sTHoeH0eA">Seventeen</a>. With its blend of warmly indelible melody and indie-rock dynamics, it makes a good reference point for Davis’s newly released album, <em><a href="https://kated.ffm.to/fishbowl">Fish Bowl</a></em>; People Are Doing and Consequences, in particular, occupy similar ground. Compared with Davis’s 2019 album <em>Trophy</em>, the songwriting is sharper, the tunes far catchier.</p><p><em><a href="https://kated.ffm.to/fishbowl">Fish Bowl</a> is out now on on Anti-.

<p>Award-winning Catalan peach farm drama Alcarràs joins an impressive crop of movies​ about living off the land​, from Minari and The Grapes of Wrath to Babe</p><p>We’re officially into spring now, a time when even lifelong city-dwellers like me start entertaining bucolic thoughts.

Earthy and angry, this portrait of a Catalan peach-farming family being forced off the land they’ve held for generations captures the occasional, elemental rewards of agricultural life, but also its punishing grind – and thus fits into a rich tradition of films where the dramatic stakes, tensions and catharses all derive from the unpredictability of living off the land.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/25/streaming-the-best-farming-films-alcarras">Continue reading...</a>
