  <p id="bY2ksV">The final look at <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> ahead of its theatrical premiere is here. Today, Nintendo and Illumination released what they say is the last trailer for the film, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23390869/super-mario-movie-trailer-chris-pratt">which stars Chris Pratt as the iconic plumber</a>. It’s more of an overview of what to expect, but it includes both a very dark intro and some side-scrolling action. There’s also a good shot of a <em>Mad Max</em>-style battle on Rainbow Road. Good idea for the next <em>Mario Kart</em>.</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="erTF2N"><div></div></aside></div>
<p id="3WrrEE">We got our first proper glimpse of the movie <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23390869/super-mario-movie-trailer-chris-pratt">last October</a> (as well as a first listen to Pratt’s take on Mario), and since then, there have been a handful of trailers focusing on characters like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/29/23484511/super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-princess-peach">Princess Peach</a> (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23500825/super-mario-bros-movie-toad-clip-game-awards-2022">Toad</a> (Keegan-Michael Key), and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/29/23576904/super-mario-bros-movie-teaser-seth-rogan-donkey-kong">Donkey Kong</a> (Seth Rogen).

## GM will give the majority of its US team cash if they quit in the next two weeks

  <p id="MmeAf0">A letter from CEO Mary Barra sent to GM workers on Thursday offered buyouts to many of its 58,000 employees, saying the company plans to trim $2 billion in fixed costs over the next two years. GM announced its plan to cut costs in January, on the same earnings call where it announced a record income of $14.5 billion for 2022. GM <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23464509/general-motors-ev-profit-1-million-annual-2025">plans to spend billions over the next few years</a> transitioning to building electric cars and making other changes.</p>

  <p id="6fIM06">Delta Air Lines laid out a new plan to wean its planes off fossil fuels in an effort to address climate change. The goal, the airline said, is for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to make up at least 95 percent of its fuel consumption by 2050. </p>
<p id="oHhaUV">SAF is made from waste or crops through a process that’s supposed to cancel out much of the greenhouse gas emissions a plane produces. It’s not a perfect system and could create <a href="https://stay-grounded.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/EN_agrofuels_case-study_2022.pdf">new environmental problems</a>. And with very little SAF produced today, it’s going to be an uphill climb for Delta to hit its 2050 target. Nevertheless, SAF is largely seen by the industry as the most viable alternative to fossil fuels for now. </p>

  <p id="22O7rP">Discord is now using OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology to transform its existing Clyde bot into a talkative chatbot. Clyde is being upgraded next week to answer questions and have conversations with users, much like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23488017/openai-chatbot-chatgpt-ai-examples-web-demo">OpenAI’s ChatGPT</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23590873/microsoft-new-bing-chatgpt-ai-hands-on">Microsoft’s Bing chat feature</a>. It’s part of a broader push for AI in Discord, which also includes AI-generated conversation summaries and the ability for Discord admins to leverage AI technology to moderate servers.</p>
<p id="Xf0EPT">The Clyde chatbot will be free for Discord users during a public experiment in a very limited number of servers with Discord alpha users next week. Discord admins will eventually be able to add the Clyde chatbot to servers to allow users to summon it into conversations and have it respond to queries...</p>

  <p id="IdTyvw">Epic Games is once again going to give away free PC games every week of the year through the Epic Games Store, the company announced on Thursday. But how does Epic choose which games to give away? The company tells us it’s about timing — and picking some big names.</p>
<p id="SJIaFz">Since the Epic Games Store’s launch in late 2018, Epic has spent millions of dollars to give away games as a way to hook new users and bolster its nascent game store. (Originally, it gave away a free game <a href="https://www.vg247.com/epic-games-store-offering-2-free-games-every-month">every two weeks</a> before upping that to every week <a href="https://www.vg247.com/epic-games-store-free-game-every-week-in-2019">in June 2019</a>.) Epic’s goal is to have one “tentpole” game every month, Steve Allison, VP and general manager of the Epic Games Store, said in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. “Those become really big weeks,” he said.

  <p id="tg9MUG">Epic Games is finally going to let developers self-publish games to the Epic Games Store beginning Thursday. The change could mark a potentially seismic shift for the PC storefront because now that self-publishing is available, a lot more games may show up on the store. </p>
<p id="8l6E93">The big draw for developers is Epic’s generous revenue share model. Epic takes a 12 percent commission on game sales, meaning developers keep the money earned from the remaining 88 percent. Valve generally takes a 30 percent cut on its competing Steam marketplace, though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18120577/valve-steam-game-marketplace-revenue-split-new-rules-competition">that cut decreases</a> if your game hits certain sales milestones.</p>

  <p id="G1yfzw">Cowboy’s latest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22417053/cowboy-c4-st-electric-bike-price-specs">4 and 4ST e-bikes</a> are being treated to a free software update today that adds a new <a href="https://uk.cowboy.com/pages/adaptive-power">adaptive power</a> feature meant to automatically overcome any resistance as it occurs, be it a hill, blast of wind, or kid in a baby seat. Cowboy is also adding three new color options for its 4ST step-through model.</p>
<p id="vi235N">According to Cowboy, its proprietary software feature works at low and high speeds and doesn’t require any gear changes — good, because the company only sells belt-driven single-speed e-bikes. With the new update, Cowboy says the motor will provide the extra power “seamlessly” whenever a C4 or C4ST senses any extra resistance in the environment.</p>

  <p id="3w2DQK">Humane, a secretive startup led by two former Apple executives and staffed by several ex-Apple employees, has secured a further $100 million in investment as part of a new funding round, the <a href="https://hu.ma.ne/media/humane-raises-100m-in-series-c-round-as-it-builds-device-and-services-platform-for-the-ai-era">company has announced</a>. The Series C round includes investments from Microsoft, OpenAI founder Sam Altman, Volvo and LG, and brings Humane’s total funding to $230 million (per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/humane/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>). The company appears to be working on a wearable camera device, if an apparent leaked pitch deck from 2021 is anything to go by.</p>
<p id="OAdhZS">But despite the investment it’s generated, and its plans to reveal an “initial product offering” as early as this spring, it’s still unclear exactly what Humane actually plans to do as a company. Its press release notes that it’s hoping to...</p>

  <p id="a4MNS2">Netflix TV users can now customize the appearance of subtitles and closed captions on the streaming platform, allowing subscribers to adjust the size and style of the text. Announced on Wednesday, the new feature can toggle subtitle text size between small, medium, and large, and alter the overall appearance of the text to make it easier to read.</p>
<p id="HTDeji">Alongside the default white text, Netflix now also provides three new text style options with contrasting backgrounds to make the text stand out: Light (black text / white background), Drop Shadow (white text / black background), and Contrast (yellow text / black background).</p>

  <p id="j58u3G">Microsoft’s Bing search engine has passed the 100 million daily active users milestone just weeks after the software maker launched its AI-powered Bing Chat feature. Bing has been steadily growing in recent years, but it appears the new Bing Chat feature is helping Microsoft grow usage with people that have never touched Bing before.</p>
<p id="84bYWf">Google has more than 1 billion daily active users, so that puts Microsoft’s 100 million milestone in perspective as it seeks to gain market share. </p>
<p id="CA0ayb">“We are pleased to share that after a number of years of steady progress, and with a little bit of a boost from the million plus new Bing preview users, we have crossed 100 million daily active users of Bing,” says Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s head of consumer...</p>
