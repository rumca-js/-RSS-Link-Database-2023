Check out the final trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The movie stars Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, and more.

For the first time, the iconic global entertainment brands Illumination and Nintendo join forces to create The Super Mario Bros. Movie, a new, big-screen adventure starring one of pop culture’s most prominent plumbers of the past four decades.

Based on the world of Nintendo’s Mario games, the film invites audiences into a vibrant, thrilling new universe unlike any created before in an action-packed, exuberant cinematic comedy event. 

While working underground to fix a water main, Brooklyn plumbers Mario (Chris Pratt; Jurassic World and The LEGO Movie franchises) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day; It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi. 

With the assistance of a Mushroom Kingdom resident Toad (Keegan-Michael Key; The Lion King) and some training from the strong-willed ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy;The Queen’s Gambit), Mario taps into his own power. 

The Super Mario Bros. Movie features an extraordinary comedic cast, including Jack Black (Jumanji films) as Bowser, Seth Rogen (Neighbors franchise) as Donkey Kong, Fred Armisen (Portlandia, Saturday Night Live) as Cranky Kong, Kevin Michael Richardson (American Dad!, Family Guy) as Kamek and Sebastian Maniscalco (Green Book) as Spike, plus a special voice appearance by Charles Martinet, who has voiced the characters of Mario and Luigi in the Super Mario games for more than 30 years.

The film is directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (collaborators on Teen Titans Go!, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies) from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel (Minions: The Rise of Gru, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part). 

From Nintendo and Illumination—creator of the global blockbuster Despicable Me, Minions, Sing and The Secret Life of Pets franchises—The Super Mario Bros. Movie is produced by Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri p.g.a. and by Nintendo’s Representative Director and Fellow Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Mario, after more than six years of close bond and discussions between the two. The film is co-financed by Universal Pictures and Nintendo and will be released worldwide by Universal Pictures.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie opens in theaters on April 5, 2023.

## Can The Punisher Work in the MCU? | Jon Bernthal Joins Daredevil: Born Again

Great news for Punisher fans- the story of The Punisher will be told in the MCU as Marvels The Punisher will reappear with Frank Castle played by none other than Jon Bernthal. The Jon Bernthal Punisher was distinctly darker than what the MCU has portrayed itself as mostly, but with Daredevil: Born Again on the horizon, so will be the Punisher/Daredevil relationship that often defines their characters.  As Punisher joins Daredevil: Born Again, its not totally clear what the tone will be, based on the only evidence we have of Daredevil, MCU edition.

Could the Punisher, MCU version face being toned down? Is the MCU, Marvel at large, and Marvel Studios really going to keep the darker and more violent themes of the show and air them on Disney+? Or will we see a blend for the Disney Plus version of Daredevil and Punisher? IGN has ideas based on history, which host Kim Horcher lays down here as we eagerly await the return of Charlie Cox and Daredevil, MCU edition.

Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania DLC reviewed by Cameron Hawkins on PC, also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

The latest paid expansion to Dead Cells is a shining blueprint of how to do a crossover right. It celebrates the history of Castlevania while mixing it with Dead Cells’ own identity to make something that’s more than the sum of its already excellent parts. Not only does this collaboration feel like it makes total sense, the utmost care has clearly been put into every aspect, whether it be the still fantastic monster-slaying combat or the huge number of secrets waiting to be found inside. Regardless of whether this is the last content update Dead Cells will get or not, developers Motion Twin and Evil Empire deserve to receive their flowers and proudly take a massive bow.

With Jon Bernthal set to reprise his role as The Punisher in the upcoming Daredevil: Born Again series, the question on everyone’s mind is ‘what does a Disney Plus Frank Castle variant look like?’ Bernthal delivered quite the performance as the killer vigilante on Netflix’s #Daredevil and two seasons of #ThePunisher spinoff, but with Disney’s family-friendly prestige, it’s hard to fathom how it’ll make the Marvel character work in the new series. How #DisneyPlus plans on pulling off The Punisher on the Daredevil series will be something we’re all going to be watching.
