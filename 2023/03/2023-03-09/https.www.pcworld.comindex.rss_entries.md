<p>The Epic Games Store launched just over four years ago, building an appeal for users on high-profile exclusives and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502496/1502496.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">tons of freebies</a>, and appeal for developers and publishers with a more lucrative revenue split. While it&rsquo;s been growing in terms of both users and catalog, it&rsquo;s still a fraction of the size of the de facto standard for PC gaming, Steam. Today Epic is leveling the playing field for one of Steam&rsquo;s biggest draws, as it allows indie developers to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-launches-self-publishing-tools-for-game-developers-and-publishers&amp;xcust=2-1-1574027-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post their own games to the store</a> without the need for a publisher. </p>



<p>The setup for Epic is similar to Steam: Pay $100 to submit a game, create a landing page, input some business info, and submit your game for review. Notably, the Epic Games Store is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=epic+88%2F12#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=epic%20store%20revenue%20" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">preserving the well-publicized 88/12 revenue split</a> for indie developers (which beats out the usual 70/30 split of Steam, the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and most other digital storefronts). While developers will have access to the Epic Online Services platform tools like game achievements, they aren&rsquo;t limited to using Epic&rsquo;s Unreal engine. </p>



<p>There are a few restrictions, however. Epic doesn&rsquo;t have the same <em>laissez-faire </em>attitude towards explicitly adult games as Steam does. While &ldquo;Mature&rdquo; content is obviously allowed, the recent glut of straight-up porn games seen on Steam&rsquo;s storefront won&rsquo;t be making an appearance on Epic. No games that would be rated Adults Only by the ESRB will be accepted. Multiplayer games submitted to Epic need to allow crossplay with other game stores, which notably isn&rsquo;t a requirement for Steam. </p>



<p>While Steam is still the primary source for indie developers to host PC games, the market has become more democratized of late, with additional options <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406186/how-itchio-became-an-indie-pc-game-havenand-steams-antithesis.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">like GoG and Itch.io</a> opening up. Steam publishes more than 1,000 new games every month at this point. Epic has a long way to go, but with that enticing revenue split and a growing audience built by free games and F2P staples like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Rocket League, </em>it&rsquo;s in a good place to get there. </p>

## Discord is adding an AI chatbot, moderator, and art

<p>Discord is adding AI to its platform in the form of ChatGPT and generative art, which will manifest as a chatbot and options to manage chats and create custom avatar profiles.</p>



<p>Discord plans to roll out a public ChatGPT-powered chatbot named &ldquo;Clyde&rdquo; beginning next week, alongside a new technology to summarize Discord chats in a sidebar, called conversation summaries. This Friday, Discord will update its AutoMod automatic moderation bot to include AI-powered moderation, examining the content of moderated chats to determine if a server&rsquo;s rules are being followed. All three are considered public experiments, with updated, further rollouts to come later.</p>



<p>Discord also showed off early progress in two new features it hopes to add later: the ability to &ldquo;remix&rdquo; Discord avatars, as well as an updated real-time whiteboard feature that can take sketches and transform them into generative AI art, via a prompt.</p>



<p>It might seem like most applications are hurriedly adding AI to their core functions, though Discord was on the cutting edge, early on. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/820518/midjourneys-ai-art-goes-live-for-everyone.html">Midjourney&rsquo;s AI art generator</a> uses Discord as its only UI, in part because Midjourney chief executive David Holz led a self-funded team and didn&rsquo;t have the time or resources to invest in a UI or social media model, he said during a briefing. Discord disclosed that Midjourney has 13 million subscribers as of March 2023. Slack, a Discord rival in the productivity space, has also <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1534320/several-bots-will-be-typing-on-chatgpt-for-slack.html">announced an AI-powered chatbot</a>, and Google and Microsoft have already <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html">launched their own AI-powered search</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504572/google-announces-bard-ai.html">plan to</a>. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Discord AI chatbot Clyde" class="wp-image-1536232" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Discord-Clyde.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A look at Discord&rsquo;s AI chatbot, Clyde.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>Discord&rsquo;s first chatbot, Clyde, will eventually be available site-wide, in both public and private channels as well as direct messages, according to Prachi Gupta, Discord&rsquo;s vice president of engineering. In a demonstration, Gupta showed how you&rsquo;ll use Clyde: addressing it via &ldquo;@clyde&rdquo; in a text chat, which will open a small text prompt button. You&rsquo;ll be able to ask Clyde your own private queries, or use Clyde in a public setting to provide advice and answer questions. Clyde will also have access to Discord&rsquo;s tools, so it can suggest GIFs and emojis, as well. Clyde can also be disabled by a channel admin.</p>



<p>(Discord also showed off a partner&rsquo;s work, Anthropic, which uses a similar-sounding AI chatbot called Claude.)</p>



<p>ChatGPT will also be used to boost Discord&rsquo;s AutoMod capability. Like Clyde, AutoMod has been available for some time, filtering out obscenities and performing other filtering roles. What ChatGPT will do is allow AutoMod to interpret and apply the varied rules that admins have set out for various servers and groups, understand them, and apply them. In a demonstration, Gupta showed how a group dedicated to hamsters could flag messages that self-promoted other social media channels (a no-no, according to the group rules) as well as look for deliberate misspellings to avoid moderation bans. </p>



<p>Filters sometimes aren&rsquo;t enough. An AI-powered AutoMod can also look at intent as a moderation tool, Gupta added. &ldquo;For example&hellip; asking about the &lsquo;leading cause of death in hamsters&rsquo; is not the same as another ill-willed user declaring &lsquo;death to hamsters,'&rdquo; she said.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Discord AutoMod AI moderation" class="wp-image-1536231" height="659" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Discord-automod.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Discord&rsquo;s AI AutoMod auto-moderator will interpret rules and apply them.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>The conversation summary feature looks a bit like Otter.ai&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://otter.ai/blog/otters-new-otterpilot-tm-is-the-smart-ai-meeting-assistant-youve-been-waiting-for&amp;xcust=2-1-1536082-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">OtterPilot</a>, a new feature in Otter&rsquo;s transcription tool that transcribes, summarizes, and annotates a meeting, with links to relevant portions. If <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">you&rsquo;ve used ChatGPT</a>, you may also be aware that it breaks down individual conversations by topic. Discord&rsquo;s new conversation summary feature does something similar, marking a shift in the conversation topic with a link to the relevant exchange.</p>



<p>Eventually, you&rsquo;ll be able to use generative AI to produce art that can be applied to Discord. You&rsquo;ll be able to &ldquo;remix&rdquo; your own avatar (or someone else&rsquo;s, which sounds a little weird) using AI art to add a mustache, a party hat, or some other feature. You&rsquo;ll also be able to use image-to-image AI art (where an image or a sketch you provide can be used as a model for something else) to take a sketch and reimagine it as a piece of AI-generated art.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Discord AI conversation summaries" class="wp-image-1536230" height="658" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DIscord-conversation-summaries.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Like other AI services, Discord will summarize chats using AI, too.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>Discord has 150 million users per month, chief executive Jason Citron said. &ldquo;Right now we&rsquo;re seeing one of the most exciting moments in technology emerging and it has the power and potential to truly transform how we learn how we communicate, how we express creativity, how we have fun with the people in our lives,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Harnessed properly, AI can fundamentally enhance and empower genuine human experience and connection. That&rsquo;s why Discord is the home for AI experiences with friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No new PC is complete without a fresh copy of Windows. And if you&rsquo;ve built your own rig (congrats!), the PCWorld Software Store can help you snag a fresh, fully legal Windows license for a fraction of the price you&rsquo;d normally pay at retail. And yes, that includes Windows 10 licenses that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477078/microsoft-will-stop-selling-windows-10-licenses-in-a-few-days.html">Microsoft no longer sells direct</a>&mdash;though we&rsquo;ve got Windows 11 covered, too.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got. Pick your poison and hit those links:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://software.pcworld.com/p43292-windows_10_home">Windows 10 Home for $49.99</a> (normal price: $139.99)</li><li><a href="https://software.pcworld.com/p43717-windows_10_professional">Windows 10 Professional for $69.99</a> (normal price: $199.99)</li><li><a href="https://software.pcworld.com/p43834-windows_11_home">Windows 11 Home for $59.99</a> (normal price: $139.99)</li><li><a href="https://software.pcworld.com/p43833-windows_11_professional">Windows 11 Home for $79.99</a> (normal price: $199.99)</li></ul>



<p>Wondering if you should opt for Windows Home or Pro? Most people should just stick to Home and pocket the extra $20, but we break down <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/422701/who-needs-windows-10-pro-5-reasons-to-upgrade.html">Windows Pro&rsquo;s pros and cons here</a>.</p>



<p>Simply put, these are fantastic deals offering up to 65 percent off the usual retail price for a Windows license. Several members of the PCWorld staff&mdash;including yours truly&mdash;loaded up on keys once the PCWorld Software Store started offering them. They&rsquo;re legit, too, so you won&rsquo;t have to worry about your license suddenly being deactivated or needing to put a tedious call into Microsoft tech support to get them working, which happens all too often when you&rsquo;re trawling for dirt-cheap keys on many software resale sites.</p>



<p>There are a couple finer points worth mentioning, though they shouldn&rsquo;t surprise veteran PC builders.</p>



<p>This version of Windows 10 and 11, when installed, will be tied to a single PC and is non-transferrable. And it&rsquo;s designed to be installed on a new or clean PC&mdash;upgrading from an older version of Windows is not supported. These limitations aside, you&rsquo;ll still enjoy unlimited reinstalls (on the same machine), plus access to all future Windows updates, like those <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1535749/new-windows-11-update-arrives-in-a-week.html">fancy new Windows 11 features coming next week</a>.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re unsure whether your PC is eligible for Windows 11 given its stricter requirements, hit this link and scroll down to the bottom until you see the &ldquo;Download PC Health Check App&rdquo; button in the compatibility section. It&rsquo;ll download a Microsoft tool that informs you whether you&rsquo;re good to go, or if you should stick to Windows 10.</p>

## The supercar of PCs? Lenovo just made an Aston Martin-infused workstation

<p>What does Lenovo have to do with Aston Martin? On Thursday, the PC manufacturer better known for its ThinkPad laptops debuted the ThinkStation PX workstation&mdash;and it tapped the British luxury automaker to help with its chassis design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t a gimmick. With the ThinkStation PX, Lenovo is taking its content-creation workstations to an even higher level of performance: dual Intel Xeons, and up to four Nvidia RTX A5000s. &ldquo;Before the PX, we have never been able to support this many cores and this many GPUs,&rdquo; said Jennifer Ramsay, Lenovo&rsquo;s senior worldwide product manager for workstations.</p>



<p>However, as any PC builder knows, with great power comes great heat. That&rsquo;s where Aston Martin&rsquo;s expertise in cooling down sports cars comes in. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkStation P10 with panel removed" class="wp-image-1536122" height="805" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lenovo_thinkstation_p10.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Note the red accents. Aston Martin helped, but this is still very much a Lenovo machine.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Melissa Riofrio/Foundry</p></div>



<h2 id="sorry-you-cant-build-this-pc-at-home">Sorry, you can&rsquo;t build this PC at home</h2>



<p>While it is possible to build a very powerful desktop PC, the ThinkStation PX is not something you could replicate using off-the-shelf hardware. And even if you could afford all the components, the PX&rsquo;s motherboard is a Lenovo in-house design. As with any legit workstation, the level of testing and validation that goes into a machine like this far exceeds what most home builders would ever do.</p>



<p>Beyond the hardware, you also can&rsquo;t touch the ThinkStation PX&rsquo;s chassis design. There are lots of nice cases out there, but this one exercises a century of Aston Martin sports-car wisdom to cool the system&rsquo;s high-end parts.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Aston Martin DBS Superleggera 2" class="wp-image-1536034" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Aston-Martin-DBS-Superleggera-2-cropped.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Aston Martin DBS has a hexagonal front grille that inspired the design for the Lenovo ThinkStation PX chassis.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Aston Martin</p></div>



<p>The hexagonal front grille on the ThinkStation PX riffs off the aggressive look of the Aston Martin DBS. That car, which has a starting price north of $333,000, is exotic in every possible way, including its front ventilation, which is designed to maximize airflow to the 715-horsepower, V12 engine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve spent the last 110 years controlling heat in cars,&rdquo; said Cathal Loughnane, Director of Partnerships at Aston Martin. While Aston Martin proposed a number of designs, the DBS&rsquo;s hexagons won out.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkStation P10 hexagonal front grille detail" class="wp-image-1536039" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lenovo-ThinkStation-P10-hexagonal-front-grille-detail.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>This close-up shows the three-dimensional, heavily ridged design of the Lenovo ThinkStation </p> PX grille.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Melissa Riofrio / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Note the prominent array of bladelike ridges in the pattern. As with the DBS, this effect is functional. &ldquo;The extension blades further stabilize the airflow to maximize cooling potential,&rdquo; Loughnane said. &ldquo;The deeper the grille, the better the airflow.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As air enters the system, Lenovo&rsquo;s patented tri-channel cooling baffle (which has been around since 2014) routes separate airflows over the CPU, GPU, and memory. No single part has to share air warmed by another component. This is luxury, PC-style.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkStation P10 tri-channel cooling baffle inside" class="wp-image-1536041" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lenovo-ThinkStation-P10-tri-channel-cooling-baffle-inside.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>On the inner side of the Lenovo ThinkStation PX&rsquo;s tri-channel cooling baffle, you can see the separate chambers that dedicate air-cooling to each major component.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Melissa Riofrio / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Future-proofing is another workstation hallmark. Lenovo&rsquo;s Ramsay said the ThinkStation PX will accommodate the recently announced Nvidia RTX A6000 cards when they become available. Sixteen DIMM slots can accommodate up to 128GB of RAM. We also noted the useful mix of both PCIe Gen 4 and Gen 5 slots; both 1-Gigabit and 10-Gigabit ethernet; and both USB-A and USB-C ports (11 in total). </p>



<p>No surprise, this thing weighs more than 70 pounds. So here&rsquo;s another thing you won&rsquo;t find on every PC case: four handles, one on each corner, for easier hefting.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo ThinkStation P10 interior cpu gpu" class="wp-image-1536043" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lenovo-ThinkStation-P10-interior-cpu-gpu.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Dual CPUs and four GPUs take up a lot of space, but the ThinkStation PX still has plenty of room for expansion and connectivity.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Melissa Riofrio / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The more I looked at the ThinkStation PX, the more I coveted all its tool-free details, also hard to find in other cases. The three front drive bays have release levers. There&rsquo;s a push-button release on the side panel. User-touchable pieces inside the case are marked in Lenovo red. The 1850W power supply has a release lever <em>and</em> a handle. What are the rest of us doing with our damn screwdrivers?&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Front drive bay lever on the Lenovo ThinkStation P10." class="wp-image-1536129" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lenovo-ThinkStation-P10-front-drive-bay-lever.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Who needs screwdrivers when your drive bays have levers?</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Melissa Riofrio/Foundry</p></div>



<h2 id="so-whats-all-this-performance-good-for">So what&rsquo;s all this performance good for?</h2>



<p>As if to highlight the ThinkStation PX&rsquo;s star power, Lenovo showed it off at the Burbank, California headquarters of a famous customer: Dreamworks Animation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lenovo technology&mdash;its prior generation of ThinkStations, plus its water-cooled Neptune servers&mdash;helped Dreamworks animators create the studio&rsquo;s latest hit. &ldquo;The painterly style employed in <em>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</em> required a lot more compute power,&rdquo; said Lenovo vice president Rob Herman during the presentation.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Puss in Boots: The Last Wish." class="wp-image-1536050" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/puss-in-boots-the-last-wish-gallery-05.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dreamworks Animation</p></div>



<p>We watched as Ludo, a lead Dreamworks animator, took a scene from a digital storyboard to a rough animation to a near-final product. Thanks to the ThinkStation&rsquo;s compute power, incremental changes appeared immediately, where they once would have required lag time to render.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Power lies at the heart of this Lenovo ThinkStation PX story&mdash;just as it would with an Aston Martin sports car. The executives were very clear: Dreamworks is a data business. Whether the data is pixels or retail sales or healthcare statistics, managing data for efficiency and profit requires powerful technology&mdash;workstations, servers, and more. That&rsquo;s what Lenovo hopes to deliver.</p>

## Valve says the Steam Deck 2 is years away

<p>Valve&rsquo;s Steam Deck turned the market on its head last year, creating an arms race for portable gaming PCs you can throw in a bag. But if you were hoping for yearly upgrades to the design, a la the cell phone or laptop categories, you&rsquo;re out of luck. According to a recent interview, Valve is taking a more console-style approach, aiming for a hardware upgrade several years down the line at the earliest. </p>



<p>A year after the gadget&rsquo;s debut, Valve designer Lawrence Yang <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-community-continues-to-blow-our-minds-valve-talk-the-steam-deck-one-year-on&amp;xcust=2-1-1555020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told Rock Paper Shotgun</a> that a sequel device won&rsquo;t be here for quite a while. &ldquo;A true next-gen Deck with a significant bump in horsepower wouldn&rsquo;t be for a few years,&rdquo; he said. That certainly dashes the hopes of at least some fans, who were hoping for an upgrade to the AMD Zen 2 internal hardware now several years old. </p>



<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the design will remain completely static&mdash;Valve has already made a few adjustments <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1369318/how-to-swap-out-the-steam-decks-noisy-fan.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">like a quieter exhaust fan</a>. But, if you&rsquo;re looking for a dramatic increase in power, you&rsquo;ll have to look elsewhere, perhaps to one of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/707281/cheaper-steam-deck-competitors-are-on-the-way.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dozens of competitor devices</a> that have popped out of the woods in the meantime. </p>



<p>But if the Steam Deck is hurting for horsepower, it isn&rsquo;t showing it. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified&amp;xcust=2-1-1555020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deck Verified certification program</a>, which guarantees that games will run on the portable hardware is adding new titles all the time, including heavy-hitters like <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. And the community continues to embrace the current machine, with a wide array of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1509769/1509769.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">accessories to buy</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9w0Y7kVfg&amp;xcust=2-1-1555020-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">tweaks for adventurous owners to try out</a>. </p>

<p>Once upon a time, everyone used to shell out for Microsoft Office. You had to for compatibility reasons, since collaborating on documents was much harder otherwise.</p>



<p>Nowadays we all have access to Google&rsquo;s editing apps and even Microsoft&rsquo;s own gratis version of Office Online, plus <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/494496/best-microsoft-office-alternatives.html">free productivity suites</a> like Libre Office. So it may seem strange to pay <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/p/microsoft-365-family/cfq7ttc0k5dm?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&amp;xcust=2-1-1527859-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$100 per year for Microsoft 365 Family</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/p/microsoft-365-personal/cfq7ttc0k5bf?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&amp;xcust=2-1-1527859-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$70 for Microsoft 365 Personal</a>&mdash;why spend money on a productivity suite? And yet a Microsoft 365 subscription can still be very useful. Dig past the idea of it being just about Office apps and you&rsquo;ll see why pretty fast.</p>



<h2 id="loads-of-onedrive-storage-space">Loads of OneDrive storage space</h2>



<p>This feature can be worth the cost of the whole subscription, no matter which tier you choose. You could never touch the Microsoft Office apps and you&rsquo;d still get a lot of bang for your buck&mdash;especially if you sign up for the Family plan.</p>



<p>On the Personal plan, you get 1TB of space for one user. If you don&rsquo;t need more space, you&rsquo;ll save between $30 to $50 compared to rival plans from Google and Dropbox.</p>



<p>Meanwhile on the Family plan, you get 1TB of space <em>per user</em> (up to six total), with each person&rsquo;s storage counted independently of everyone else in the group. You can pay as as little as $16.50 per user annually. It&rsquo;s still a smoking deal on cloud storage&mdash;and the plan still includes other benefits.</p>



<h2 id="stronger-onedrive-security">Stronger OneDrive security</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Der Personal Vault in OneDrive soll noch in diesem Jahr f&uuml;r alle Nutzer verf&uuml;gbar sein." class="wp-image-1178602" src="https://bilder.pcwelt.de/4218138_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Along with more space, Microsoft 365 also offers tighter security in OneDrive, too. For starters, you can add expiration dates and passwords to shared links. Paid users also get unlimited use of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/607361/onedrive-personal-vault-how-to-use-it.html">Personal Vault</a>, a feature that lets you put files into a special folder that you must unlock to access. It&rsquo;s perfect for tax forms, bank statements, and other sensitive info you decide to put in the cloud&mdash;and anything in it is encrypted on your local drive, too.</p>



<p>Restoring your whole OneDrive is possible, too. Should you accidentally delete everything, encounter file corruption, or run into some other mishap, you can roll back to an earlier time within the last 30 days. And if a ransomware attack is detected, you&rsquo;ll get help restoring your files up to 30 days afterward.</p>



<h2 id="full-web-mobile-and-desktop-access-to-microsoft-office-apps">Full web, mobile, and desktop access to Microsoft Office apps</h2>



<p>Free document editors have limitations, particularly Microsoft&rsquo;s own free versions of its web and mobile apps. If you&rsquo;re in a position where your document edits require formatting consistency across organizations or more sophisticated tools, you&rsquo;ll need Microsoft Office.</p>



<p>A Microsoft 365 subscription unlocks access to the full versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and more across the web, mobile, and desktop. It also guarantees updates to the latest versions of the apps as they release, unlike with a standalone copy of Office.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="novedades-microsoft-365.jpg" class="wp-image-1408901" src="https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/features/3817908/novedades-microsoft-365.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s lineup of programs is bigger than the familiar names, too. You may also expect Access, OneNote, OneDrive, Skype, and Teams, but the full list includes far more these days. You&rsquo;ll find useful tools like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html">Clipchamp</a>, which lets you trim video files quickly, as well as heavyweight apps like Power Automate and Power BI that let you easily whip up automated tasks and data dashboards.</p>



<h2 id="seamless-multi-device-support">Seamless multi-device support</h2>



<p>A single license for Microsoft&rsquo;s Office Home &amp; Student software works on just one computer. With a Microsoft 365 subscription, all users can be active in Office apps on up to five different devices simultaneously&mdash;and still have the programs installed on the other non-active devices. You&rsquo;ll <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-sign-in-works-in-microsoft-365-1d646e83-1585-4278-8daf-d4a2cc0905e0&amp;xcust=2-1-1527859-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">automatically be logged out of devices</a> not in use when you use the apps on a new or previously deactivated device.</p>



<h2 id="extra-users">Extra users</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, the Family plan includes up to six users&mdash;and each person in your group gets the same benefits as the primary account holder. That means six people can get the perks of the Personal plan for just a fraction of the price. Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t require all plan members to live at the same address, either, so your &ldquo;family&rdquo; can be spread far and wide.</p>



<h2 id="free-skype-minutes">Free Skype minutes</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Skype-Name &auml;ndern: So geht?s" class="wp-image-1176336" src="https://bilder.pcwelt.de/4253796_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jirapong Manustrong/Shutterstock.com</p></div>



<p>Whether you need to make the occasional domestic or international phone call, Microsoft 365 has you covered. All Personal and Family users get <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12230/how-do-i-activate-my-microsoft-365-skype-minutes&amp;xcust=2-1-1527859-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">60 minutes of free calling</a> to landline and mobile phones per month. It might not cover all your needs, but it&rsquo;s a start.</p>



<h2 id="bonus-discounted-subscriptions">Bonus: Discounted subscriptions</h2>



<p>You can regularly pay less than the sticker price on Microsoft 365 subscriptions, unlike with plans from well-known competitors. Between <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/540496/how-to-get-office-365-on-the-cheap.html">this strategy</a> and periodic sales at retailers like Newegg, Antonline, and Amazon, you can save big bucks on discounted digital codes&mdash;especially since you can stack up to five years at a time.</p>



<p>One sneaky tip: You can apply Personal codes to Family plans, at a prorated amount of 9 months. If you find a hot deal on Personal codes, do the math&mdash;you may still end up ahead if you use them to top up your Family plan. My best score so far? Newegg&rsquo;s Black Friday 2015 sale on Personal plan codes&mdash;$15 per year, maximum five codes. I wish it would come around again.</p>



<h2 id="what-about-microsoft-365-basic">What about Microsoft 365 Basic?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470455/microsofts-cheaper-microsoft-365-basic-plan-is-just-2-mo.html">Microsoft 365&rsquo;s newest price tier</a> costs $20 per year (or $2 per month) for 100GB of space, along with access to the full versions of web and mobile Office apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and OneDrive. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/compare-onedrive-plans?activetab=tab:primaryr1&amp;xcust=2-1-1527859-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a decent plan</a> meant to go head-to-head with Google One&rsquo;s basic plan, but lacks many of the Personal and Family plan perks. We primarily recommend it for people who need the Microsoft ecosystem but don&rsquo;t want desktop Office.</p>

It&rsquo;s hard to recommend at MSRP, but sales may help its fortunes.</p>
</div>


<p>Budget gaming laptops often struggle to stand out. Packing a competent CPU and GPU into a machine priced around $1,000 or less is difficult and most laptops in this category make similar compromises. The MSI Katana GF66 12UD doesn&rsquo;t buck this trend, but solid performance can make it a wise choice when the price is right.&nbsp;This particular rig offers strong performance, plentiful connectivity options, a reasonable price point, and more. Let&rsquo;s get right into it.</p>



<p><strong>MSI Katana GF66 12UD: Specs and features</strong></p>



<p>The MSI Katana GF66&rsquo;s specifications are typical for a high-performance yet budget gaming laptop. It cuts costs with the Intel Core i7-12650H CPU, which has six performance cores and four efficiency cores, and an Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti GPU.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-12650H</li><li>Memory: 16GB DDR5</li><li>Graphics/GPU: Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti</li><li>Display: 1,920 x 1,080 144Hz</li><li>Storage: 512GB PCIe Gen4 M.2 solid state drive</li><li>Webcam: 720p</li><li>Connectivity: 1x USB-C, 3x USB-A, 1x HDMI, 1x Ethernet, 1x 3.5mm combo audio, 1x AC barrel plug</li><li>Networking: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2</li><li>Biometrics: None</li><li>Battery capacity: 53 watt-hours</li><li>Dimensions: 14.13 x 10.20 x 0.98 inches</li><li>Weight: 4.96 pounds</li><li>MSRP: $1,049.99</li></ul>



<p>MSI still has the budget to deliver 16GB of RAM, a 512GB solid state drive, and a 1080p 144Hz IPS display. These specifications are what I&rsquo;d personally consider the bare minimum for any modern gaming laptop, and they help the Katana provide acceptable (though not outstanding) performance.</p>



<p>While this laptop is listed at $1,049.99 on Amazon, pricing can vary significantly between retailers, with some offering similar models as low as $799.99. Shoppers should be careful to stick with the latest configurations: variants with outdated Intel Core 10th-gen and Core 11th-gen processors are still sold by third-party sellers on Amazon and other retailers.</p>



<p><strong>MSI Katana GF66 12UD:</strong> <strong>Design and build quality</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Katana design" class="wp-image-1531122" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-katana-gf66-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>MSI&rsquo;s Katana GF66 12UD&rsquo;s is simple and understated. The MSI logo is small enough to be easily overlooked, which could be a plus for those who prefer a laptop that seems unbranded. The black-and-red color scheme cuts against this, however, increasing the laptop&rsquo;s aggression. MSI&rsquo;s design is definitely a step behind Lenovo and Dell, which offer more elaborate and detailed aesthetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The laptop&rsquo;s size is typical for a 15.6-inch laptop, at 14 inches wide and 10 inches deep. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372718/lenovo-legion-5i-review-cranks-nvidias-rtx-3060-up-to-11.html">Lenovo Legion 5i</a>, Dell G7 15 and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/920328/hp-victus-15-review-a-mediocre-gaming-laptop-at-a-great-price.html">HP Victus 15</a> are similar in size. MSI undercuts the competition slightly on weight, however, dipping just below 5 pounds. Many alternatives in this price bracket weigh a half-pound to a pound more.</p>



<p>Build quality is best described as functional. The plastics used look and feel basic, but the chassis and display lid allow minimal flex. I&rsquo;d once again place budget laptops from Lenovo and Dell above the MSI, as they make better use of mixed material textures. Still, the Katana&rsquo;s quality is good for the price, and on par with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/700135/acer-nitro-5-review-a-gamers-gaming-laptop.html">Acer Nitro</a> and Asus TUF laptops.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MSI Katana GF66 12UD:</strong> <strong>Keyboard and trackpad</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Katana keyboard" class="wp-image-1531123" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-katana-gf66-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The MSI Katana&rsquo;s keyboard is spacious and easy to use, with a numpad included for convenience. The numpad has half-sized keys, however, which can make it difficult to use for more than an occasional entry into an Excel spreadsheet. The overall size of the keyboard could be larger, as there&rsquo;s about a half-inch of space on either size, but it&rsquo;s comparable to other budget laptops.</p>



<p>Key travel is long, but the feel is vague and springy. Gamers who like a more tactile experience will be disappointed. There&rsquo;s noticeable flex in the keyboard, which contributes to the springy key feel. The typing experience is not as good as Lenovo&rsquo;s Legion laptops but similar to other budget gaming laptops including Dell&rsquo;s G7, Acer&rsquo;s Nitro, and Asus&rsquo; TUF series.</p>



<p>Keyboard backlighting is standard, though only available in red. The backlight offers three brightness levels. The highest is easy to see in a lit room, while the dimmest is only visible in a room with the lights off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The touchpad is cramped, measuring only 4 inches wide and 2.5 inches across. It feels small, and multitouch gestures can be difficult to execute due to the limited space available. There&rsquo;s plenty of wasted space on the laptop&rsquo;s palmrest that could be used for a larger touchpad. Bad touchpads are common on budget gaming laptops, and the Katana isn&rsquo;t an exception.</p>



<p><strong><strong>MSI Katana GF66 12UD:</strong></strong> <strong>Display, audio</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Katana display" class="wp-image-1531124" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-katana-gf66-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Every MSI Katana GF66 12UD has a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS display with a 144Hz refresh rate. This is typical for a budget laptop, but not all 1080p displays perform the same&mdash;and, unfortunately, the Katana&rsquo;s display ends up near the bottom of the pile.</p>



<p>Brightness is a problem. The display reaches only 254 nits, which isn&rsquo;t high enough to allow comfortable use in a brightly lit room. Gamers are likely to play in a space with dim lighting, of course, but the dim screen can be annoying in day-to-day use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The contrast ratio is better, reaching a maximum ratio of 1240:1. That&rsquo;s comparable to many laptops sold at a variety of price points and better than some more expensive laptops I&rsquo;ve tested, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1070976/1070976.html">Acer Predator Helios 300</a>. The contrast ratio is high enough to provide an acceptable sense of depth and realism, but it&rsquo;s not stunning.</p>



<p>Color performance is disappointing. The display can handle just 65 percent of the sRGB color gamut and 48 percent of DCI-P3. That&rsquo;s an extremely restrained color gamut, and it leads to a dull, muted experience that lacks the vibrance and punch gamers expect.</p>



<p>Motion performance is decent. Quick camera pans in 3D games lead to noticeable blur, but the image is far more legible than on a laptop with a 60Hz IPS display. Fast-moving objects have only slight motion blur behind them. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html">G-Sync support</a> isn&rsquo;t listed in the laptop&rsquo;s specifications and wasn&rsquo;t available in Nvidia&rsquo;s settings, so gamers must play with an uncapped framerate or use V-Sync.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the MSI Katana&rsquo;s display isn&rsquo;t great, it&rsquo;s (again) typical of a budget gaming laptop. Many competitors, such as the HP Victus 15 and Acer Nitro, have an identical display in their entry-level configuration. Lenovo&rsquo;s Legion 5i has an edge, however, offering a slightly better 165Hz display with 300 nits of brightness in its current entry-level configuration.</p>



<p>The built-in speakers are mediocre, with a modest maximum volume and lack of bass to fill out the sound stage in music and games. To their credit, however, they mostly avoid serious distortion when playing music at high volume, providing a crisp and clear experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MSI Katana GF66 12UD:</strong> <strong>Webcam, microphone, biometrics</strong></p>



<p>MSI bundles a basic 720p webcam into the Katana. It&rsquo;s not great. The image looks soft and serves up muted, faded colors. Any significant swing in lighting can confuse the webcam, causing big swings in exposure. It&rsquo;s fine for a Zoom call, but that&rsquo;s about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microphone quality holds up better, picking up my voice well without allowing background noise from a space heater to creep into the audio. Recorded audio sounds a bit tinny, but that&rsquo;s true of nearly all laptop microphones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MSI Katana doesn&rsquo;t offer biometric login or other biometric features.</p>



<p><strong><strong>MSI Katana GF66 12UD:</strong></strong> <strong>Connectivity</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Katana ports" class="wp-image-1531128" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-katana-gf66-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>A healthy mix of ports line the MSI Katana&rsquo;s flanks. This includes one USB-C port, three USB-A ports (two of which are USB 3.2), HDMI, Ethernet, and a 3.5mm combo audio jack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The USB-C port is data only, however, which means it can&rsquo;t handle DisplayPort video or charge the laptop. I confirmed this by testing the laptop with a USB-C monitor that provides Power Delivery, as well as a USB-C power brick. This is disappointing. The Dell G7 15 offers DisplayPort Alternate Mode and the latest Lenovo Legion 5 adds support for up to 135 watts of USB Power Delivery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2, which is typical for a budget gaming laptop. I would prefer to see Wi-Fi 6E, the latest available Wi-Fi standard, which can be found in some competing budget laptops. Most people don&rsquo;t own a Wi-Fi 6E router, however, so its absence isn&rsquo;t a major issue.</p>



<p><strong>MSI Katana GF66 12UD:</strong> <strong>Performance</strong></p>



<p>The MSI Katana GF66 12UD I tested had an Intel Core i7-12650H processor, Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 3050 Ti, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB solid state drive. A variety of Katana models are available at online retailers, but this is the most common variant of the 15-inch Katana. A less expensive configuration with Intel Arc A370M graphics exists but comes equipped with a less powerful processor and less RAM, and stock appears limited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I tested the laptop at the Balanced power setting. MSI asked that I test the laptop at the Extreme Performance setting, but I found this simply turns the fans up to their maximum setting and leaves them there. It&rsquo;s as annoying as it sounds and not how I expect most owners would use the laptop. I also found the Extreme Performance mode had a negligible impact on performance in most situations.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Katana PCMark" class="wp-image-1531133" height="746" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-katana-gf66-pcmark10.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The tests start with PCMark 10, a benchmark that attempts to test a system&rsquo;s overall performance through a variety of scenarios that mimic-real world use, but which tends to lean towards relying on CPU performance. The MSI Katana scores a respectable 6,941. This essentially ties the Ryzen 7 6800H and Ryzen 9 6900HS in the Acer Nitro 5 and Corsair Voyager, and is just a hair behind the Lenovo Legion 5i with Intel Core i7-12700H. This is a solid start.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Katana Cinebench" class="wp-image-1531135" height="740" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-katana-gf66-cinebench-r15.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s a similar story in Cinebench R15, where the Katana maintains its third-place finish. This is a great result for a laptop that&rsquo;s sold for just $1,050, and shows that sticking with the Intel Core i7-12650H, rather than the more expensive Core i7-12700H, doesn&rsquo;t tank performance.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Katana Handbrake" class="wp-image-1531137" height="752" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-katana-gf66-handbrake.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>There&rsquo;s no big surprise in Handbrake, another CPU-heavy workload, as the Katana once again slices its way to a third-place finish. The fastest processors (Intel&rsquo;s Core i7-12700H and AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 9 6900HS) manage to extend their lead in this benchmark, but the Katana&rsquo;s performance remains admirable for a budget machine.</p>



<p>The focus now moves on to GPU benchmarks. The Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti in the Katana I tested has a maximum graphics power of just 60 watts, which is much lower than most gaming laptops with RTX 3060 or Radeon RX 6800M hardware. Unsurprisingly, this proves a drag on performance.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Katana Time Spy" class="wp-image-1531140" height="739" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-katana-gf66-time-spy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The MSI Katana&rsquo;s 3DMark Time Spy score of 5,862 earns it a fourth-place finish, and the gap between competitors has widened. Choosing the MSI Katana with RTX 3050 Ti results in performance about 30 percent less than an RTX 3060 alternative. However, the RTX 3050 Ti opens up a big lead over the older Nvidia GTX 1650 in the HP Victus 15.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Katana Shadow of the Tomb Raider" class="wp-image-1531142" height="791" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-katana-gf66-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Trends continue in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, with the Katana again taking a fourth-place finish. It does manage to achieve 70 frames-per-second, however, which providing a smooth experience in real-world gameplay. The same can&rsquo;t be said of the less expensive HP Victus 15, which dips well below 60 FPS.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Katana Metro Exodus" class="wp-image-1531143" height="761" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-katana-gf66-metro-exodus.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p><em>Metro Exodus</em> is a rough test for the Katana, as it averaged just 23 frames-per-second at Extreme detail and with ray tracing turned off. That&rsquo;s better than the GTX 1650 in the HP Victus 15, but also not playable. A 30 FPS experience is possible by turning down detail to Ultra (this boosts the average to 42 FPS), and the game still looks great at this preset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also gave the MSI Katana a spin in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> with ray tracing turned on and DLSS turned off. It averaged just 14 frames-per-second, which isn&rsquo;t playable. Playable performance was only possible with DLSS set to its Performance mode and ray tracing quality turned to Medium, and even these compromises netted an average of 36 FPS with a few brief detours into the teens.</p>



<p>Clearly, the Katana is not a powerhouse, but it lands in a comfortable spot for its price. And price, really, is the story here. The performance gaps between GTX 1650, RTX 3050/RTX 3050 Ti, and RTX 3060 laptops are large, but the difference in price is often just a couple hundred dollars. Even a small reduction in price will greatly improve the Katana&rsquo;s value&mdash;so keep an eye out for sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MSI Katana GF66 12UD:</strong> <strong>Battery life</strong></p>



<p>The MSI Katana GF66 12UD has a 53 watt-hour battery. That&rsquo;s not large for any laptop, never mind a 15-inch gaming laptop with discrete graphics, and it leads to lackluster battery life.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Katana Battery Life" class="wp-image-1531144" height="782" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-katana-gf66-battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>I measured 4 hours and 14 minutes of endurance while playing a 4K file of <em>Tears of Steel</em> on repeat, which isn&rsquo;t a particularly demanding workload. Playing game will drain the battery far more quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a silver lining: this result, though unimpressive, is about average for a gaming laptop. Most gamer laptops struggle to break five hours of endurance. The Acer Nitro 5 is an exception in this case, as the model we tested was a 17-inch laptop with room for a much larger 96 watt-hour battery.</p>



<p><strong><strong>MSI Katana GF66 12UD:</strong></strong> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>MSI&rsquo;s Katana GF66 12UD is a thoroughly average budget to mid-range gaming laptop. It&rsquo;s fast enough to handle most modern titles at 30 to 60 frames-per-second, especially if you&rsquo;re willing to compromise on detail settings. It also packs strong processor performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The laptop&rsquo;s most serious flaws are found in details such as the display, keyboard, and touchpad. These shortcomings are shared with many inexpensive gaming laptops. However, the Katana&rsquo;s price of $1,050 puts it up against some alternatives that can do better. The Lenovo Legion 5 and Dell G17 15 are two examples.</p>



<p>So, should you buy it? My advice is simple: look for a sale. The Katana would make a lot of sense under $1,000, and it&rsquo;s a steal under $800. Microcenter, for example, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microcenter.com/product/646848/msi-katana-gf66-12ud-015-156-gaming-laptop-computer-platinum-collection-black&amp;xcust=2-1-1529835-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">currently offers a model with an even better Core i7-12700H processor for $799.99</a>.&nbsp;</p>

## A Microsoft 365 accessibility assistant will make content easier to see

<p>Microsoft will add an Accessibility Assistant to Microsoft 365, a boon for those who have trouble seeing, but also a feature you may see crop up while you&rsquo;re writing in Word or designing PowerPoint presentations.</p>



<p>Keep an eye out for a small &ldquo;person&rdquo; icon next to paragraphs or bullet points&mdash;if you do, that&rsquo;s a signal that you should revise your content to make it more legible.</p>



<p>Five years ago, Microsoft launched the Accessibility Checker, a small tool that helped creators ensure content was legible. The Accessibility Assistant will improve upon that, stealing design elements from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549224/microsoft-editor-now-knows-who-to-talk-to-and-what-to-share.html">Microsoft Editor</a>. In fact, you&rsquo;ll eventually see the Accessibility Assistant pane in Word and other Microsoft 365 apps, which looks like Editor&rsquo;s recommendations sidebar for identifying and remediating issues. It&rsquo;s due later this year, Microsoft said. Given that accessibility is becoming increasingly important in businesses, you&rsquo;ll likely see the feature as part of your business environment.</p>



<p>Accessibility Assistant will begin with the features that Accessibility Checker already covers, making sure your copy is colored appropriately to provide high contrast and visibility. A related color picker will appear in Word, PowerPoint, and other apps, highlighting which colors will be highly visible in your current layout. You may also be prompted to review the alt-text in any images you provide. Those captions/alt-text snippets are provided via AI, but reviewing them will help ensure an accurate description.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Accessibility Assistant for Microsoft 365" class="wp-image-1536181" height="645" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Microsoft-365-accessibility-assistant.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Microsoft&rsquo;s Accessibility Assistant will roll out later this year.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Eventually, the Assistant will incorporate other features as well, which Microsoft will add on to. Microsoft Editor already examines your content for inclusiveness and language; the Accessibility Assistant will do the same. Each &ldquo;issue&rdquo; it highlights will be linked to the appropriate text block, so you can make quick changes in your copy.</p>



<p>At Microsoft&rsquo;s Accessibility Summit, the company announced the Accessibility Assistant as well as some other improvements: more languages for its Translator app, porting the accessories for its Microsoft Business Pen to the Surface Pen, and automatic image captioning on LinkedIn. Microsoft&rsquo;s Seeing AI app for mobile, which uses your phone&rsquo;s camera to identify objects around you for the benefit of those who have trouble seeing, also added 1,500 new objects, Microsoft said.</p>
