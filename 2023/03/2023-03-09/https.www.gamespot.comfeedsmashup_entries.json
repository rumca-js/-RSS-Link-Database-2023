Season of the Deep is the second season of the Lightfall expansion, and it'll contain a quest set in Neomuna. \"Throughout this quest, players will explore the city to learn about the nature of the Veil through Osiris's research and newly uncovered Ishtar Collective data,\" Bungie stated.</p><p>The Veil was mentioned in the Season of the Seraph and acknowledged that it would play a significant role in the Lightfall campaign. However, the Veil remains a mystery--much to the frustration of players who expected more answers from Lightfall when nearing the end of the Light and Darkness saga. Bungie seemed to acknowledge that in its blog post, noting, \"While we\u2019re just a week into Season of Defiance and we don\u2019t always share future narrative details this far in advance, we feel it\u2019s important to give everyone a preview of a particular quest we\u2019re bringing to Neomuna in Season of the Deep.\"</p><p>By completing this quest, players will earn new Strand Aspects--each class has two Aspects so far. Bungie also clarified that players will not need to collect additional <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-farming-strand-meditations-and-final-warning-exotic-sidearm-guide/1100-6512030/\">Strand Meditations</a>, which are currently required to unlock abilities like Fragments. The developer shared the names of the Aspects as well: Hunter's is called Threaded Specter, Titan will get the Flechette Storm, and Warlock gets The Wanderer. Along with that, players will get a new Legendary hand cannon when they complete the quest.</p><a

They tend to have focused features that are designed with gaming comfortably in mind. The best gaming desks feature ample space for your <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-monitor-for-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6488680/\">gaming monitor</a>, keyboard, mouse, and other accessories as well as room for your PC or console. You may also might to find a desk that has gaming-specific features such as cable management, headphone mounts, or monitor stands. Pairing your flashy PC and peripherals with a good gaming desk brings the entire setup together. While there are some really nice options out there that cost a lot of money, you don't necessarily have to spend a ton to get one of the best gaming desks for your needs.</p><p>There's an overwhelming amount of options out there, and it's easy to assume that you need a desk specifically marketed as a \"gaming desk,\" but that's not necessarily the case. Finding the best gaming desk for you depends on your specific needs, including your budget, how much equipment you have, and how much space you can afford to take up. You'll also need to consider whether you're looking for an ultrawide or not. At the end of the day, a regular computer desk can work great for gaming and can be much more budget-friendly. Some of these non-gaming-specific desks may also have added features like drawers or shelving that you don't often see in a typical gaming desk. We've rounded up a variety of highly rated gaming desk options here--whether you're looking for something cheap or looking to splurge on something a little nicer like a standing desk, we've got you covered.</p><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"6479382 - Best Gaming Desks\">  <div class=\"buylink-container\">                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://secretlab.co/products/magnus-metal-desk&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;sref=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-desk/1100-6479382/\">Best Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://secretlab.co/products/magnus-metal-desk&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;sref=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-desk/1100-6479382/\">Secretlab Magnus Gaming Desk (59.1&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1601/16018044/3900061-secretlab.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://secretlab.co/products/magnus-metal-desk&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;sref=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-desk/1100-6479382/\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p>Not just a sturdy platform to put your gaming rig on, the Secretlab Magnus is a good-looking piece of furniture as well that's sure to turn some heads.

Folks with multiple monitors or a massive ultrawide display will get the most mileage out of the added real estate, although it\u2019s also a great option for someone who has amassed a small army of collectibles and figurines and wants to display them around their battlestation.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://secretlab.co/products/magnus-pro&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;sref=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-desk/1100-6479382/\">See at Secretlab</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Ergonomic-Z1-S-Gaming-Desk/dp/B07DC3321Q?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Best Ergonomic Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Ergonomic-Z1-S-Gaming-Desk/dp/B07DC3321Q?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Eureka Ergonomic Z1-S Gaming Desk (44.5&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1591/15918215/3864485-eurekaergonomic.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Ergonomic-Z1-S-Gaming-Desk/dp/B07DC3321Q?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p><span>If you're looking for the best gaming desk to fill your space and support your gaming equipment, you can't go wrong with Eureka's series of ergonomic desks. The Eureka Z1-S is the standout option--this sturdy desk features a Z-shaped metal frame with an F1 balancing lever near the top of each leg to help stabilize the desk and prevent it from wobbling. It also has four adjustable feet to further help you level the desk. With a length of 44.5 inches, the Eureka Z1-S gaming desk is ideal for a single-monitor setup (although you could certainly fit two smaller ones) and perfect for rooms where space is at a premium.</span></p><p>Bonus features make this desk even more worthwhile--notably, it comes with RGB lighting on the sides. All you have to do is plug a USB cable into your gaming PC or laptop to power it. The Eureka Z1-S has eight different lighting modes and six different colors so you can customize the effects to your liking. It also features a handy controller stand, a cup holder, cable management grommets, and a headphone hook on the left side. This gaming desk also comes with a large removable mouse pad.</p><p>One drawback: The Eureka Z1-S doesn't come with a built-in retractable keyboard tray; instead, Eureka sells it separately for $100. Considering a retractable keyboard tray greatly improves the ergonomics of this desk, it's a shame the feature doesn't come built-in, but it does leave you with options on how much you want to spend. After trying out the Eureka Z1-S, it's possible you won't miss this feature at all.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Ergonomic-Z1-S-Gaming-Desk/dp/B07DC3321Q?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Arozzi-Arena-Gaming-Desk-Black/dp/B01K1JW1L0?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Best Ultrawide Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Arozzi-Arena-Gaming-Desk-Black/dp/B01K1JW1L0?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Arozzi Arena Gaming Desk (63&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1591/15918215/3864487-arozzi.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Arozzi-Arena-Gaming-Desk-Black/dp/B01K1JW1L0?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p><span>The Arozzi Arena gaming desk is another popular option for those looking to load their desk up with monitors or a single ultrawide display. With a surface that's 63 inches (over 5 feet) long and a depth of 32 inches, there's plenty of desk space for not only your displays but your mouse, keyboard, and any other gaming accessories you want. Five different color options are available, including a plain black one and other shades like blue and green. Notably, this gaming desk comes with a large mouse pad that matches the shape and size of the surface area, converting the entire top of the desk into a usable pad. This is a hefty mouse pad that weighs 7 pounds, so you don't have to worry about it sliding around all the time.</span></p><p>While it lacks bonus accessories like a cup holder or headset hook, the Arozzi gaming desk adds meaningful features you'll probably appreciate more, including the ability to adjust the height of the desk. That means you don't have to worry about your gaming chair fitting under the desk or that your monitor will be at the proper ergonomic height--you can easily customize the Arozzi desk to your desired height.</p><p>The Arozzi Arena desk also has a great cable management system, with three cutouts in the desk and mousepad surface that allow you to hide cables in a net underneath the table. In addition, the feet are adjustable--be sure to follow the assembly instructions carefully and tighten the screws in the feet to prevent wobble.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Arozzi-Arena-Gaming-Desk-Black/dp/B01K1JW1L0?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Vitesse-Computer-Professional-Station-Headphone/dp/B07RBVL2ZY?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Best Budget Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Vitesse-Computer-Professional-Station-Headphone/dp/B07RBVL2ZY?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Vitesse Gaming Desk (55&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1591/15918215/3864488-vitesse.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Vitesse-Computer-Professional-Station-Headphone/dp/B07RBVL2ZY?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p><span>At just $150, the Vitesse gaming desk is a great value for everything you get. Its 55-inch surface offers ample room to hold more than one gaming monitor and your PC or console on one side while taking up less space than the Arozzi Arena, and it also comes with an extra-large mouse pad that covers the entire surface. It brings back bonus features like a cup holder, headset hook, and controller rack, the latter of which features four USB ports for charging your devices so your gaming session can go uninterrupted.</span></p><p>The Vitesse gaming desk features a solid T-shaped frame that's sturdy enough to hold up to 260 pounds of weight. One annoying quirk: The desk is split into two boards, leaving a line down the middle. That's easily covered by the full-surface mouse pad that comes with it or another of your choosing, but it's something to be aware of.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Vitesse-Computer-Professional-Station-Headphone/dp/B07RBVL2ZY?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Vitesse-Ergonomic-Gaming-Computer-Headphone/dp/B08JTHFFMZ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Best Budget Ultrawide Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Vitesse-Ergonomic-Gaming-Computer-Headphone/dp/B08JTHFFMZ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Vitesse Gaming Desk (63&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1702/17023653/4109921-vitesse.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Vitesse-Ergonomic-Gaming-Computer-Headphone/dp/B08JTHFFMZ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p> </p><p>Ultrawide monitors require a bit more space than your standard monitors, and few desks do a better job of welcoming ultrawide monitors than the Vitesse Gaming Desk.

And since it\u2019s difficult to find gaming desktops this small, it\u2019s definitely worth considering if you\u2019re working with a tight space.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Homall-Computer-Workstation-Surface-Headphone/dp/B07ZFD97MM?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.flexispot.com/comhar-all-in-one-standing-desk-wooden-top-48-w&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;sref=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-desk/1100-6479382/\">Best Standing Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.flexispot.com/comhar-all-in-one-standing-desk-wooden-top-48-w&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;sref=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-desk/1100-6479382/\">FlexiSpot Comhar EG8 Gaming Desk (48&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1591/15918215/3864504-flexispot.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.flexispot.com/comhar-all-in-one-standing-desk-wooden-top-48-w&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;sref=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-desk/1100-6479382/\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p><span>Standing desks aren't generally what comes to mind when one thinks of gaming desks, but if you're someone who's worried about the health effects of sitting too much or who suffers from back pain, a standing desk is worth considering. The FlexiSpot Comhar EG8 is one of the top standing desks we've tested, and it works great as a multipurpose desk for both gaming and working from home. Available in either all-black or all-white, the Comhar EG8 has a sleek glass top that gives the desk a premium look and feel--and it's as expensive as it looks, coming in at $500 for the list price. However, if you're looking to invest in a standing desk, we think the Comhar EG8 is worth the price for its bevy of features.</span></p><p>Powered by a motor that plugs into the wall, this standing desk is operated by a small control panel on the right side, which has up and down arrows that you use to raise or lower the desk to your preferred height. Notably, four programmable height presets are available so you can save your preferred standing and sitting heights (and share the desk with others if needed). A child lock prevents the desk from being activated accidentally, and there's an anti-collision feature as well, though we did have issues getting this to work every time when we tested this desk. The Comhar EG8 also has three USB charging ports (two USB Type-A, one Type-C) so you can easily charge smaller devices like your phone and tablet while keeping them close by. Assembly is surprisingly simple and quick as well.</p><p>If gaming is your only consideration, you may be better off choosing one of the other desks on this list that offer gaming-specific features, but if you want a desk that you can do work at as well as play games--and want to start taking more standing breaks--the Comhar EG8 is an excellent choice.

Available in a wide variety of designs (including Solid Wood and Bamboo), this sturdy desk is highly adjustable and can support a staggering 355 pounds, making it a great option for games with a heavy rig.</p><p>Its weight capacity of 355 pounds is even more impressive when you realize that its height is so adjustable that it can accommodate users between the heights of 4\u20192\u201d all the way to 6\u20194\u201d. That\u2019s no small feat, and one that gives the Flexispot a leg up on most of the competition.</p><p>Other notable features included an embedded cable tray, an optional under-desk drawer, and programmable height presets for easy operation. It\u2019s not cheap (you can easily spend over $600 depending on your configuration), but no doubt you\u2019re getting a premium product.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.flexispot.com/flexispot-pro-standing-desk-e7&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;sref=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-desk/1100-6479382/\">See at Flexispot</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Mr-IRONSTONE-L-Shaped-Computer-Workstation/dp/B078M32QST?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Best L-Shaped Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Mr-IRONSTONE-L-Shaped-Computer-Workstation/dp/B078M32QST?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Mr. Ironstone L-Shaped Desk (59&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1591/15918215/3864492-mrironstonelshaped.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Mr-IRONSTONE-L-Shaped-Computer-Workstation/dp/B078M32QST?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p>Another solid option from Mr. Ironstone, this L-shaped desk comes in four different colors, including the all-black one shown above. It measures 59 inches in both directions and is 21.7 inches deep. You can count on it to be extremely sturdy and stable thanks to its X-shaped support bars, adjustable feet pads, and six separate legs to hold it upright. The bars along the bottom are also designed to be a footrest if you'd like, although again, if you have long legs, you could end up feeling cramped.</p><p>The appeal of an L-shaped gaming desk is obviously the amount of surface area and support it offers, and this Mr. Ironstone desk gets the job done well. It can support two to three monitors plus your gaming PC or console without fear of anything collapsing. The bevel edge in the middle is cleverly designed to offer room for cables to slide down between the desk and the wall corner. For less than 200 bucks, the Mr. Ironstone L-shaped gaming desk is one of the best we've found.

The longer side measures 58.1 inches, while the shorter side is just 44.3 inches. The flexibility is definitely a pro, but the depth is a tad shorter, coming in at 19 inches. The curved corner allows for a little extra room to put your monitor or anything else there, and one could easily fit two of these L-shaped desks together to form a large U-shaped desk for even more room. It's available in five different shades, including black.</span></p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/GreenForest-Reversible-Computer-Monitor-Workstation/dp/B07N439XLX?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon (black)</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Walker-Edison-Soreno-3-Piece-Corner/dp/B001FB5LE8?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Best L-Shaped Glass Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Walker-Edison-Soreno-3-Piece-Corner/dp/B001FB5LE8?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Walker Edison L-Shaped Glass Gaming Desk (51&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1591/15918215/3864501-walkeredisonlshaped.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Walker-Edison-Soreno-3-Piece-Corner/dp/B001FB5LE8?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p><span>If you're looking to avoid cheaper-looking desks made of engineered wood, consider this Walker Edison L-shaped desk instead. Its sleek black top is made of tempered glass, giving it a more modern and professional look, although keep in mind the glass will be more prone to scratching and fingerprints if you're not careful, and it may get hot. It notably has a slide-out keyboard stand that's also made out of glass, but many Amazon reviewers have found that it's on the smaller side and hangs a bit too low, so you can always consider uninstalling it.</span></p><p>This corner gaming desk features very strong supports along the bottom, but don't pile too much on top of this tempered glass desk as you may risk breaking it. While it can support several monitors, I'd suggest leaving your hefty gaming PC on the ground just to be safe--it comes with an unattached CPU stand, but regardless of whether you use it, the back corner is a great spot for the PC itself.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Walker-Edison-Soreno-3-Piece-Corner/dp/B001FB5LE8?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Homall-Computer-Monitor-Writing-Workstation/dp/B08XQ4FQTP?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Best Budget L-Shaped Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Homall-Computer-Monitor-Writing-Workstation/dp/B08XQ4FQTP?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Homall L Shaped Gaming Desk (51&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1702/17023653/4109920-homall.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Homall-Computer-Monitor-Writing-Workstation/dp/B08XQ4FQTP?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p> </p><p>Finding a reliable gaming desk under $100 isn\u2019t easy, but the Homall L Shaped Gaming Desk manages to punch well above its price tag.

Aside from those features, it offers everything else you\u2019d expect from a reliable gaming desk--such as adjustable foot pads and solid construction.</p><p>Its L-shaped footprint might not fit all game rooms, but if you can find space for it in your home, there\u2019s a lot to love about this unique gaming desk.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Homall-Computer-Monitor-Writing-Workstation/dp/B08XQ4FQTP?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Bush-Furniture-Shaped-Computer-Espresso/dp/B005EOL812?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Best L-Shaped Desk For Storage</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Bush-Furniture-Shaped-Computer-Espresso/dp/B005EOL812?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Bush Furniture L-Shaped Computer Desk (60&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1591/15918215/3864502-bushfurniture.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Bush-Furniture-Shaped-Computer-Espresso/dp/B005EOL812?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p><span>Sometimes, you just want drawers to put stuff in. The problem: Most gaming desks don't have them. If you're looking for a more traditional-looking office desk that can also be used for gaming, this Bush Furniture L-shaped desk is a solid option, although it'll put you on the pricier end of the spectrum. For just over $300, you get a full 60 inches of workspace on either side, with the surface measuring 24 inches deep on the left side and 20 inches on the right. That's plenty of space to put your monitors, gaming PC, console(s), keyboard, and anything else you might need. The desk can hold up to 200 pounds of weight, so you don't have to worry about this one collapsing. It also features a four-port USB hub and a soft tray in an open cubby for storing and charging small devices, which is quite handy.</span></p><p>This Bush Furniture desk gets you extra storage space for your gaming equipment, with two drawers on one side and a concealed storage cabinet with a fluted glass door on the other side. These offer a great place to store extra gaming accessories, cords, games, and even your CPU tower if you want. Keep in mind this isn't solid wood, but rather engineered wood, so it'll show scratches and damage easier, but the dark espresso finish still gives it a nice look, even if it probably won't match your gaming chair color scheme.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Bush-Furniture-Shaped-Computer-Espresso/dp/B005EOL812?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/CubiCubi-Computer-Storage-Shelves-Writing/dp/B087TSQQQ5?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Best Gaming Desk For Small Spaces</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/CubiCubi-Computer-Storage-Shelves-Writing/dp/B087TSQQQ5?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">CubiCubi Computer Desk (47&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1591/15918215/3864505-cubicubi.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/CubiCubi-Computer-Storage-Shelves-Writing/dp/B087TSQQQ5?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p><span>Offering just enough space for a </span><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dual-monitor-setup-for-pc-gaming/1100-6489725/\">dual-monitor setup</a><span>, the CubiCubi computer desk would work especially well for college students or apartment dwellers due to its smaller size and added storage. If you'd rather keep your gaming PC off the floor, the height of the middle shelf can be increased to allow enough room for it on the bottom shelf. The shelves can also be installed on either side of the desk, giving you some flexibility.</span></p><p>The back of this desk is completely open, which means there's plenty of space to stretch out and no bars to bump your legs into. The desk measures 47 inches long, offering enough room for a monitor or two along with your keyboard and mouse. However, assembly can be a bit of a pain, and you'll likely want another person on hand to help. Still, this industrial-style computer desk is a stylish and space-efficient option for those looking for a multi-purpose desk.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/CubiCubi-Computer-Storage-Shelves-Writing/dp/B087TSQQQ5?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Couchmaster-CYCON%C2%B2-Fusion-Grey-ergonomic/dp/B07WDR2GS3?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Best Gaming Lap Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Couchmaster-CYCON%C2%B2-Fusion-Grey-ergonomic/dp/B07WDR2GS3?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Couchmaster Cycon 2</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/3945734-couchmaster.png\" />                             <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Couchmaster-CYCON%C2%B2-Fusion-Grey-ergonomic/dp/B07WDR2GS3?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p>If you prefer to sit on the couch while gaming, a lap desk is a great option. It could even be something you purchase in addition to a standard gaming desk. The best gaming-focused lap desk around is the Couchmaster Cycon 2. This clever peripheral comes with a sturdy board for your keyboard as well as a mouse pad. Your peripherals can be secured with included velcro. It also has a cable management compartment that keeps everything looking clean as well as functional USB ports. The Cycon is propped up by a cushion on each side. It's important to note that the cushions do not attach to the board--that way you can find the right positioning for you. That said, once in place, everything feels secure. In addition to being great for PC gaming with a mouse and keyboard, it's also one of the best lap desks around for productivity due to the ample space it provides and overall comfort.</p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Couchmaster-CYCON%C2%B2-Fusion-Grey-ergonomic/dp/B07WDR2GS3?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">See at Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">                    <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Modern-Sturdy-Writing-Coleshome/dp/B07MB1WNQQ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Best Standard Desk For Gaming</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class=\"item-deck\">                      <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Modern-Sturdy-Writing-Coleshome/dp/B07MB1WNQQ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\">Coleshome Computer Desk (47&quot;)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class=\"image-container\">                                  <img class=\"main-image\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1591/15918215/3864507-coleshome.jpg\" />                             <a href=\"https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Modern-Sturdy-Writing-Coleshome/dp/B07MB1WNQQ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp\"></a>                        </div>              <div class=\"item-description\"><p><span>Here's another standard computer desk that puts you on the lower end of the price spectrum: this 47-inch Coleshome desk that works great for office work as well as gaming.

Its desk panel is also waterproof and anti-scratch, so it's more resistant to wear and tear than other desks with engineered wood.

It's important to consider the desk's frame and what material it's made of--can the legs support potentially hundreds of pounds of weight? If you're buying a standard office desk rather than a dedicated gaming desk, keep an eye out for ones with adjustable foot pads that will ensure the desk is stable.</p><a

It\u2019s a tough task. Are they better killers for working alone or for coordinating with a partner? Do they get more points for the viciousness and creativity of each kill? Certainly, you have to consider the kill count. And, of course, there is the motive. When the killer finally removes their mask, who has the best rationale behind their murder spree?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For the uninitiated, the franchise began in 1996 with Scream, written by Kevin Williamson and directed by Wes Craven (who would direct the first four films in the franchise until his death in 2015). Neve Campbell stars as final girl Sidney Prescott, who is terrorized when a killer in a Halloween costume starts stalking and killing her and her friends on the anniversary of her mother\u2019s murder. Courteney Cox stars as Gale Weathers, the tabloid journalist who comes to Woodsboro to make her name on the story, and David Arquette stars as Deputy Dewey Riley. These three become the legacy characters, appearing in the first five installments of the franchise.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Leading up to the sixth film--the first without Campbell or Arquette--we went through the Scream franchise and analyzed each murder, each killer reveal, and the motives for each villain. We have ranked them from the \u201cworst\u201d killer to the \u201cbest.\u201d The ranking of these killers has nothing to do with how we would rank each individual Scream film, but rather what we think of each person donning the Ghostface mask.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Charlie Walker (Scream 4)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4110140-scream-5-robbie.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Charlie has the least to do of any Ghostface killer in any Scream movie. The majority of his screen time is spent lusting after fan-favorite Kirby. He is most useful when he is being used as a trap to lure Kirby out to him when she thinks he has been captured by Ghostface.</p><p><strong>Motive: </strong>None stated. He is the only Scream killer to not specifically state a motive.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Jill Roberts (Scream 4)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4110139-scream-4-jill.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">There are nine Ghostface kills in this Scream film - not including the four fake-out Stab kills in the two opening sequences. Jill is unique in that she is the only one who definitively kills her accomplice. Several other Ghostfaces have attempted to kill their partners, but have always required Sidney or Gale (or both) to land the final killshot. She also has the entire killing spree on video, to show the world. Such Millennial thinking.</p><p><strong>Motive:</strong> Jill has the weakest motive. She is Sidney\u2019s cousin and is annoyed by hearing about Sidney\u2019s life at every turn. So, with Charlie\u2019s help, she has decided that they are going to be the new Sidney and Randy, leaving them surviving heroes of a new Woodsboro murder spree. She has even picked out a new \"Billy Loomis\" to blame this on: Trevor.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Mickey (Scream 2)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4110137-scream-2-mickey.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately for him, Mickey is just a patsy. Debbie met him on a website for serial killer fans, and he needed some tuition money, so the two teamed up. Debbie could have used any unstable college kid to be her #2. She didn\u2019t care about him, as evidenced by her shooting him. (She didn\u2019t kill him, though--that honor went to Sidney and Gale in a dual shoot-out when Mickey popped up for \u201cone last scare.\u201d)</p><p><strong>Motive:</strong> Mickey, a film student, planned on stating that the \u201cmovies made me do it!\u201d He was going to say that he was inspired to kill because of the influence of violent movies, then get the Christian Coalition to pay his legal fees. Debbie reveals herself to be the second killer and shoots him down, putting an end to his attempt at a political statement.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Debbie Salt (Scream 2)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4110136-scream-2-dennie.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Scream 2 ups the body count, giving us eight murders at the hands of the two Ghostface killers. Debbie Salt, small-town reporter, reveals herself to be Billy Loomis\u2019 mother and the newest killer, keeping the Loomis brand of psychopathy alive.</p><p><strong>Motive: </strong>\u201cGood old-fashioned revenge.\u201d She\u2019s just a mom looking for a little payback for the murder of her son.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Amber Freeman &amp; Richie Kirsch (Scream 5)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4110141-scream-6.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Scream 5 goes back to the classic, with only five murders (though one of which happens off-screen--we come in to discover a dead cop in the hospital hallway). However, the killers here get some bonus points for killing Dewey, a legacy character, who survived near-fatal injuries in virtually every other Scream film to date. It is interesting to note that this is the first Scream film in which the Ghostface killers are not killed by either Sidney or Gale. The moniker of Final Girl has officially been passed to Tara and her sister Samantha.</p><p><strong>Motive: We</strong> put Amber and Richie together because they have the same motive: to restart the Stab franchise. The duo feels that the Stab franchise--a franchise they love--has gotten stale, and the best way to reinvigorate it is to create a new massacre to base a new movie on.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Roman Bridger (Scream 3)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4110138-scream-3-roman.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Roman deserves an extra point in his column because he is the only killer in the Scream franchise (so far) to act alone. What is even more impressive is that he got nine kills all by himself.</p><p><strong>Motive:</strong> Roman reveals himself to be Maureen Prescott\u2019s illegitimate, unrecognized son. He took video of Maureen, revealing her affair with Billy\u2019s father, and showed these videos to Billy. Roman is proud to announce to Sidney that he \u201cgot [Billy] started\u201d on his whole killing spree. In a sense, then, he is at least partially responsible for the acts in the first Scream movie. His motivations for his own murders are simply to get Sidney\u2019s attention.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Stu Macher (Scream)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4110143-scream-stu.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Involved in five of Billy\u2019s six murders, Stu is too manic to play much of a role in the set-up of Sidney\u2019s dad, but if you are looking for someone wild enough to go along with damn near anything, then Stu is your guy. He doesn\u2019t do well under pressure, however, as he starts to whine the moment Billy stabs him to set up their \u201cleft for dead\u201d story.</p><p><strong>Motive:</strong> Peer pressure, plain and simple.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Billy Loomis (Scream)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4110142-scream-billy.png\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Billy Loomis is the end-all, be-all Scream killer. Even though he was partnered up with Stu Macher in his murder spree, Stu is rarely mentioned as the second killer. Between Billy and Stu, the pair can claim five murders, but Billy has an additional kill to his name: the murder of Maureen Prescott, a year prior.</p><p><strong>Motive:</strong> Sidney\u2019s mom, Maureen, was having an affair with Billy\u2019s dad, destroying their marriage. Billy had the foresight to frame another man for Maureen\u2019s murder, then return a year later, with plans on framing Sidney\u2019s dad for this new rampage which, had he been successful, would have included Sidney on the death list.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ghostface-killer-from-the-scream-movies-ranked/2900-4673/", "date_published": "2023-03-09 21:34:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Time-Looping Shooter Lemnis Gate Is Shutting Down Online Servers Soon", "description": "<p>The time-looping shooter Lemnis Gate is shutting down, its developers have announced.
