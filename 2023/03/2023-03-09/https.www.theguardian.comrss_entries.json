The insults included \u201cclown\u201d, \u201cfake\u201d and \u201cdemenza senile\u201d, and the whole thing peaked when Mourinho, reaching a heroic level of gratuitous pettiness, referenced Conte\u2019s historical ban for failing to report match-fixing. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/05/antonio-conte-jose-mourinho-chelsea-manchester-united\">Did he?

Cuthbert is one of Britain\u2019s most popular saints, widely venerated for his affinity with animals, his sympathy for ordinary working people and his association with the landscapes and holy places of the north of England. At the time he died, Christianity was a relatively new religion in Britain. Following his interment on Lindisfarne, Cuthbert\u2019s remains were removed to the mainland in order to prevent their desecration by invading Danes. Loyal monks and shifting bands of followers conveyed Cuthbert\u2019s coffin to Chester-le-Street, where it remained until 995, when Viking invaders again made it necessary to move it to safety. It is on the final leg of this journey that Benjamin Myers\u2019s novel opens, with the great cathedral, founded in Cuthbert\u2019s honour in 1093 at what will later be Durham, still nothing but a holy vision of his most fervent disciples.</p><p>Cuddy is divided into four parts, with an additional prologue and interlude.
