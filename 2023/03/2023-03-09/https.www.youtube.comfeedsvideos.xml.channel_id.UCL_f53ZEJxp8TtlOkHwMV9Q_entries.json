Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality \u2014 with a vision. \n\nDr Jordan B Peterson and Stephen J Shaw discuss the Birthgap, a term recently coined by Shaw\u2013 and the subject of his new documentary by the same name. In this interview, they examine the long building but invisible causes of what may be the most pressing issue facing the western world in the next few decades. Worst case scenario: total societal collapse due to a lack of new children being born, and a rise in senior citizens living longer.\n\nStephen is a British national who has studied and lived on three continents. He trained as a computer engineer and then as a data scientist before starting his first film project, \u201cBirthgap,\u201d at age 49. He is president and co-founder of the data analytics company, Autometrics Analytics LLC.\n\nStephen holds an MBA graduate business degree from ISG in Paris, France, and is continuing his studies at Harvard Extension School.\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n- Sponsor - \n\nBirch Gold Group: Hedge inflation by owning gold.
