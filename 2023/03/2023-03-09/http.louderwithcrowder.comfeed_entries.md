The chairman actually allowed the witness to respond to Bush's attacks, and he proceeded to completely dismantle her dishonest narrative. Oopsies.</p><p>The witness was Alex Epstein, a philosopher and energy expert who was testifying about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Epstein is also the author of 'Fossil Future," a book that argues "global human flourishing requires more oil, coal, and natural gas - not less." So you can see why Cori Bush didn't exactly take a liking to him. And proceeded to smear him as a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shelia-jackson-lee-supremacy" target="_blank">white supremacist.</a> Naturally. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>Bush brought up an old college newspaper article in which Epstein argued that Western culture is superior to all other cultures. She responded emotionally, saying, <em>"We are not inferior to any culture, speaking as a descendant of one of those cultures [...] He came here to promote fossil fuels, which we know are disproportionately harming and killing black and brown people." </em></p><p><em></em>She also claimed he <em>"espoused white supremacist views." </em>But<em> </em>since Bush launched a direct attack on Epstein, the chairman allocated him an extra minute so he could respond. And he began by asking her to put the cards up again. Like an absolute boss.</p><p>He then explained, "<em>What I argued and what I've argued for my entire adult life is that Western culture is superior in the sense that it promotes individualism and freedom. And I have fought my entire life for freedom around the world - including in Africa, including in Asia, including in India [...] There are different places around the world that are in many ways inferior. They have female genital mutilation. They have slavery. These are not as good as not mutilating female's genitals and not enslaving people." </em></p><p>He concluded, <em>"The idea that freedom and reason and individualism only apply to people of certain skin colors, that is the actual original racist idea." </em></p><p>Beautiful. The only thing he was missing was a mic drop. </p>

## 'Something I'll Go To The Cross On': Spy Kids Actress Reveals She's Pro-Life And Once Helped Save A Baby

She's actually extremely <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/prolife-spiderman-phoenix-skyscraper" target="_blank">pro-life</a>. Alexa PenaVega, who played Carmen Cortez in the movies, joined Christine Yeargin on the Students for Life podcast “Speak Out". The two discussed her pro-life beliefs and how she's been ostracized in the entertainment industry. </p><p><em>"I honestly believe that you either believe in life as a whole, and you see babies, whether babies are in the womb or outside of the womb, as life or you don’t. And… once life begins — that is a whole baby. That is a beautiful life, and for me, I will do whatever it takes to protect that.”</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

        <a href="https://twitter.com/LiveActionNews/status/1632705084734750721"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Amen. And PenaVega doesn't just talk the talk - she actually helped save a baby. Last year, a "well-known man" messaged her asking to help a fan of hers that was contemplating abortion. He asked if she'd join a Zoom call with the young girl. </p><p>PenaVega spoke to the girl for an hour and a half: <em>"I just told her about the joy that I have with my kids and the greatest thing that I ever felt was like being able to tuck them in at night and like seeing their beautiful little sleeping faces. … Those are moments that just are so life-giving. They’re so simple and yet they’re the most beautiful things you can experience as a mom." </em></p><p>PenaVega also offered to be there for the girl throughout her pregnancy and birth, and the girl ultimately decided to keep her baby. The two still have a relationship. PenaVega cries over photos of the now-born little girl, knowing she could have very well been aborted. </p><p>In terms of working in the entertainment industry, PenaVega has heard some pretty gruesome stories. Some women have had so many abortions, they can no longer have children. And she did initially experience pushback for her views and some people declined to work with her. But PenaVega said she will never deny being pro-life: it's something she will "go to the cross on.”</p><p>Stories like this give me hope for the future of entertainment and conservative media. If more <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mark-wahlberg-ash-wednesday" target="_blank">entertainers are willing to be brave</a> and speak out, we can slowly undo the toxic wokeism plaguing media. And my guess is the movies would be better for it - perhaps a few less <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/peter-pan-tinkerbell-disney" target="_blank">"diverse" remakes</a> and a few more new ideas. Without the wokeness. </p><p><br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

## Elon Musk Is Apparently Building A Texas 'Utopia' Called Snailbrook For His Employees

Only time will tell. </p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-china-covid" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> apparently wants to build a town in Texas, on farmland outside of Austin. The location is next to future SpaceX and Boring facilities currently under construction. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-ftc-twitter" target="_blank">Musk's</a> vision for the city is reportedly a "utopia along the Colorado River, where his employees could live and work," and would have affordable housing at below-market rent. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The area already has some homes, a pool, an outdoor sports area, and a gym.  And it's apparently called "Snailbrook," which I find downright adorable. It isn't a reference to a brook of snails, though that would be fitting. It references Boring's mascot - a snail named Gary (yes, after Spongebob). </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The mascot is a snail because Elon Musk initially challenged his employees to build machines that move "faster than a snail." Which doesn't sound very impressive. But apparently, that's actually pretty fast for a tunnel drill. According to Musk, a snail moves 14 times faster than a tunnel-digging machine. So, in this case, "faster than a snail" would be lightening speed. </p><p>Musk's plans for the town include up to 110 homes and a private compound for himself, and some of the streets have already been given names: Boring Boulevard, Cutterhead Crossing, Waterjet Way, and Porpoise Place. It might even have a small school, and employees may be able to rent 2-3 bedroom homes for $800 a month. </p><p>This all sounds like a fun social experiment, but again, I'm a <em>tad</em> wary of commune-style living arrangements. To my knowledge, they have historically ended less than well. And by that I mean the place mysteriously burns to the ground shortly after the FBI's arrival. But maybe this will be different. Elon is a pretty cool guy, after all. </p>

</p><p>While details are sparse, the neighbor is the clear villain. She's the one who lashed out and, without evidence, accused Katz of being an exhibitionist.

## 'Women feel silenced': Female powerlifter lashes out after court ruling forces them to compete against biological males

The trick is that the people born men need to now identify as a woman to compete against women. Critics say it's not fair, what with the biological advantages men are born with such as elevated testosterone and stronger bone density. On the flip side of that, biology is transphobic.</p><p>The unfair advantage is most unfair in a powerlifting competition, which is based on body strength. Olympic Powerlifter April Hutchinson spoke out on Fox News about how the female competitors feel about the ruling: “We’re outraged. We’re angry. We’re hurt. We’re offended. We’re basically every emotion except for happy."</p><p>She went on to say, "A lot of women are silenced and feel silenced and that they have no voice, or they’re afraid to speak up in fear of maybe getting kicked out of the federation, to be called names for backlash."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Team Canada powerlifter April Hutchinson on the ruling that USA Powerlifting MUST allow biological males to compete in the women's division:<br /><br />"The women of powerlifting are...We're outraged, we're angry, we're hurt, we're offended." <a href="https://t.co/VQ0edUf5Lx">pic.twitter.com/VQ0edUf5Lx</a><br />— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) <a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1633650609176956933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Much like in girls' collegiate swimming, if you are a woman <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-riley-gaines" target="_blank">who dares speak out or question it</a>, activists and the media (but I repeat myself) <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out" target="_blank">will have your life destroyed on the internet</a>.<br /></p><p>But even when the female competitors win, they lose.

## ​Man gets kicked out of McDonald's for his "Barefoot Lifestyle" and is demanding answers as to why

That's right, no shoes (or socks) go on those puppies. He's even run twenty marathons with no shoes. But this apparently is not acceptable conduct for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grandpa-mcdonalds-weight" target="_blank">McDonald's</a>. </p><p>Graham went to a McDonald's in Bexhill, Sussex in England. He had already ordered and was sitting down when he was asked to leave. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>Graham described the traumatizing incident to The Daily Mail:</p><p><em>"I went to McDonald's in Ravenside and ordered my food. Minding my own business, I just sat down waiting for the table service when one of the service people came up and said that I could not be in there without shoes on. I</em><em> questioned her about this and she said the words. "No shoes, no shirt, no service", to which I told her that this was an old saying from hippie times in the US, used to restrict people from going into places."</em></p><p>He pushed back, but the worker eventually got their manager, who also said Graham could not have his smelly dogs out in the public eye. Graham protested, pointing out that several children were barefoot in the play area. So surely he, a fifty-five-year-old grown man, should also be permitted to air his feet in public. He followed up about the incident with the head office, who told him the decision was up to the franchise manager of the site.  </p><p>McDonald's said in a statement, <em>"</em><em>At McDonald's we want to create a welcoming environment for all our customers to enjoy their experience.The Bexhill team informed the customer that for his own safety and for the comfort of other diners all customers are asked to wear footwear in the restaurant. </em><em>When he refused, the customer was allowed to remain on this occasion and finish his food before leaving."</em></p><p>Graham explained that he began to live barefoot after his wife passed in 2013, and since then, he's just been "living life." He said some people are horrified by the nakedness of his feet, and others totally support it and "wish they had the courage and freedom to do it". </p><p>I personally don't care that much either way. I just think it's funny that bare feet is where McDonald's draws the line. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mcdonalds-australia" target="_blank">Violent fights</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mcdonalds-real-hamburgler" target="_blank">chicken thieves</a>, all good. When I worked at McDonald's, one of my coworkers was a convicted arsonist. And she was on the grill. But bare feet? Get outta here. <br /></p>

<p>Vargas described how, days before the attack, he and his team identified an IED test-run being performed by ISIS or the Taliban. They reported this incident to their chain of command.  Days later, they were told to be on the lookout for two vehicle-borne IEDs. In the early morning hours of August 26th, two intel guys confirmed the suicide bomber was in the vicinity of the Kabul Airport. Vargas asked why the suspect wasn't identified sooner, since they had a full description, and was told: "the asset could not be compromised".</p><p>Vargas went on to explain how he and his team disseminated information about the suicide bomber to ground forces all day long. Vargas himself spotted the bomber for an hour that day, and communicated that there was an imminent IED threat and requested engagement authority. But he was told not to engage. </p><p>They invited their battalion commander to the tower to see what they were seeing. When he got there, they showed him all the evidence and asked if they could shoot.  He said, <em>"I don't know." </em></p><p>The suspected suicide bomber then disappeared. Vargas left the tower to help find an Afghan interpreter. Then the explosion happened, blowing off his right arm and left leg. Vargas wept as he detailed the attack and the fallen Marines. </p><p>This tragedy is incredibly difficult to swallow because it was <em>so</em> preventable. Why weren't the snipers allowed to take out the suicide bomber? Why were they left to wait until they died? It doesn't make any sense. Unless Joe Biden and co. really are <em>that</em> incompetent. Which I'm not sure I believe. </p>

## 'Here's $200': Enraged dad kicks door down after daughter is hit with a car... but he gets the wrong house

You can also understand why he's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/home-intruder-woman-first-time" target="_blank">lucky to not be swiss cheese'd up</a> right now.</p><p>Allegedly, someone hit his daughter with a car and took off. He went to confront the person while the police were on their way, as you can imagine a father wanting to do. Here's the rub. My man got the wrong house.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">That guy is lucky he isn't dead. <a href="https://t.co/yJAoK0fpAG">pic.twitter.com/yJAoK0fpAG</a><br />— OnlyBangers (@OnlyBangersEth) <a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyBangersEth/status/1633181090230722563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 7, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>What happened prior to this video is where things get confusing and we should allow a 20% chance this is an elaborate hoax. The daughter who was hit by the car is allegedly outside because the mother yelled out at her to see if they were at the right place. Did the daughter know the person who hit her with his car? Because if it was a hit-and-run, she wouldn't know where to do go. And if they exchanged insurance information to where she was given a fake address... that doesn't rise to a dad breaking and entering into some dude's house.</p><p>But what makes this a 10/10 video is when my man takes out $200 to pay for damages. Then takes the money back when the homeowner tells them THEY'RE going to call the cops. You know, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/armed-intruders-alabama" target="_blank">what with B&amp;E being a felony</a> and all that. Even accidental B&amp;E.</p><p>The moral of the story is don't ever do this. And if you do, instead of attempting to reason with the guy whose house you broke into, accept the egg on your face and go back through the door you just kicked in.</p><p><p>

## Watch: To "save democracy," Whoopi Goldberg calls for Fox News to be shut down and its employees prosecuted

<p>Token "Republican" Alyssa Farah Griffin then chimed in to say that <em>"Tucker Carlson is more destructive to American political discourse than Donald Trump [...] This is a man who goes on his airwaves and says, 'what would be so bad if Putin won against Ukraine?' He says insane things. He pits Americans against each other knowingly, lying to them."</em></p><p>Pits Americans against each other, eh? Didn't Whoopi just say 30 seconds ago that everyone at Fox News should be sent to the gulag? Just checking. </p><p>Sunny Hostin concluded by whining that Tucker Carlson gets more views than they do. Imagine Americans not wanting to watch a group of middle-aged women complain about men. Must be sexism.</p><p>And remember, the only reason all these <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-chuck-schumer" target="_blank">lefties are so pissed </a>at Tucker Carlson is because he <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-january" target="_blank">played footage from January 6th</a>. That's it. Apparently, that's Orwellian and pushing a false narrative to stir up division. As opposed to concealing said footage and trying to keep it hidden from the American people forever. That's "democracy."</p><p>Tucker Carlson revealed last night that he invited Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell on his show to address any issues they have with him playing the videos, as well as answer a few questions about the arrested Shaman: <em>"Why should a demonstrably nonviolent man - who literally said a prayer of thanksgiving for police officers from the Senate floor - how is that man Isis?

## Will Smith's "sources" do him dirty, leak to press Chris Rock hurt his feelings

Or, his sources commented when they leaked to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11838887/Will-Smith-embarrassed-hurt-Chris-Rocks-controversial-Netflix-special.html" target="_blank"><em>Entertainment Tonight</em></a>. If I were to guess, Will won't say anything until the sitdown with Oprah where his wife does most of the talking.</p><p>But according to sources, Will Smith is "embarrassed and hurt" by Rock's comments addressing the infamous 2022 Oscar slap. And that he wishes Rock would "let it go." Also, while Smith has been "deeply affected" by special, he claims not to have watched it. Critics say that sounds like horsesh*t. By critics, I mean...hi. It's me. I'm the critics. It's me.</p><p>Let's recap...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="f4738" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33242885&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>In March 2022, Chris Rock made a joke about a movie at the Oscars that Will Smith found funny. The rub is that Will Smith's wife didn't find it funny, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/will-smith-chris-rock-oscars" target="_self">so Smith assaulted Rock on stage</a>. Smith's wife <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jada-pinkett-smith-laughing" target="_self">found THAT funny</a>, even though she is a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jada-pinkett-smith-responds" target="_self">"strong woman" who "didn't" want her husband</a> to do that. Four months later, Will Smith posted a lame-ass apology.</p><p>Rock <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-rock-netflix-will-smith" target="_blank">addressed the matter for the first time last Saturday</a>, where the big joke was Rock pointing out all the people who called Will Smith a b*tch. All the current voices in black culture: The Breakfast Club, Drink Champs, The View, et al. He also said Will should really be mad at his wife, who turned him into the world's biggest cuck making him sit there on a podcast and listen to her talk about cheating on him. Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett-Smith, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jada-pinkett-smith-chris-rock" target="_blank">claims this is really about her and Rock's obsession with her</a>. Or, that's what her "sources" claim she thinks.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="41881" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33242903&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Two things. One, I noticed this when I was cutting the thumbnail. Shout out to Chris Rock for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/princes-prophetic-warning-about-internet" target="_blank">showing love to Prince</a>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="c76bb" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33242908&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Second, Will Smith's "sources" have done him dirty and he needs to find better ones. You don't leak to the press that Smith is "hurt" and "embarrassed." You leak to the press that Smith laughed it off. And that the next time he sees the comedian, he's going to slap him with the back of his hand because that's how you TREAT b*tches.</p><p>Will Smith's "sources" leaking to gossip sites that his little fee-fees were hurt does nothing but make Chris Rock have a point about him. Bad, "sources." Bad!</p><p><p>

## UK votes to make it illegal to have conversations, silently pray outside if it's near a "certain" area

And that we are never, ever, ever getting back together. This is the latest. Because while the FBI in America <a href="https://www.christianpost.com/news/pro-life-activist-mark-houck-to-attend-state-of-the-union.html" target="_blank">can raid your house for peacefully protesting outside an abortion clinic</a>, you at least have to say words with your mouth. In England, they can and will arrest you for praying in silence.</p><p>And now it's extra illegal. <a href="https://www.lifenews.com/2023/03/07/british-parliament-passes-law-banning-silent-prayers-outside-abortion-centers/" target="_blank">According to Life News</a>, MPs proposed an amendment to say when you stand outside and pray in a buffer zone -- those are the zones near where abortions happen because the pro-abortion lobby gives pro-abortion politicians lots of money -- it doesn't need to lead to an arrest. "The amendment sought to specify that silent prayer and consensual conversations outside abortion clinics would not be included in buffer zones legislation. This was defeated by 116 to 299."</p><p>If you find yourself wondering what it looks like to see <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/praying-arrested-silence" target="_blank">someone arrested for praying</a> as opposed to standing around and thinking to themselves:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">WATCH: British Police Officers arrest a woman for praying outside an abortion clinic. <a href="https://t.co/JlozDcICX5">pic.twitter.com/JlozDcICX5</a><br />— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1605982752188137472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>You will literally be asked, "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/prayer-army-vet-fined" target="_blank">are you praying?</a>"</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">🚨BREAKING: Army vet fined for silent prayer (for his late son) in PSPO zone near abortion facility in Bournemouth.<br />"I'm sorry for your loss, but ultimately, we have to go along with the guidelines of the PSPO..."<br /><br />Ask the Home Sec to protect free thought: <a href="https://t.co/FbAujacddq">https://t.co/FbAujacddq</a> <a href="https://t.co/GW7cs07YSr">pic.twitter.com/GW7cs07YSr</a><br />— Lois McLatchie (@LoisMcLatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/LoisMcLatch/status/1616054556001210369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'm not entirely sure you'll see this post. Facebook acts as one giant buffer zone.

## Watch: Girl won't calm down when Taco Bell runs out of her favorite item, puts her hands on the wrong employee

I love myself some Taco Bell. I love alcohol. There have been times when I was drunk for some tacos and needed someone sober enough to drive me to Taco Bell. But if they ever ran out of my favorite item, I would order something else. Everything is delicious.</p><p>Not sure if these girls were drunk or just being basic. But starting a fight over The Bell running out of a Crunchwrap Supreme is an overreaction and they need to calm down.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Taco Bell employee snaps after getting hit by female customers because they ran out of Crunch Wrap Supremes... <a href="https://t.co/FiXoSx9rWY">pic.twitter.com/FiXoSx9rWY</a><br />— Fight Haven (@FightHaven) <a href="https://twitter.com/FightHaven/status/1631353680980242432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>We're missing context here because the video starts with the Taco Bell employee screaming "I don't give a f*ck." The unruly customers obviously pushed him to that point because they couldn't get their Crunchwrap Supreme. Someone needed to tell the girls they were out of hand. Instead, they attacked the employee and he had to gently push back in self-defense.</p><p>Should a man hit a woman? No. When the man is being ganged up on? He has a right to protect himself. And staring at the dude she's with while you do it is a nice touch.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="73589" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33242038&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Then the dudes started exchanging blows. Backward hat dude has no one to blame but himself. If he would have gotten the girls to behave themselves, things would have never been escalated to this level. Now he finds himself fighting some kid who works at Taco Bell. And losing.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="5e192" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33242051&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>One of these days, people are going to learn <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fast-food-counter-hands" target="_blank">not to start fights with fast food workers</a>. They <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/popeyes-fight" target="_blank">have fewer f*cks to give</a> than any other employee anywhere.</p><p>But the real moral of the story is that when they run out of the Crunchwrap Supreme, just get a Cheesy Gordita Crunch. It's f*cking Taco Bell. It all tastes the same.</p><p><p>
