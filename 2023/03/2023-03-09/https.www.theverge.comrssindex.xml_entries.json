But how does Epic choose which games to give away? The company tells us it\u2019s about timing \u2014 and picking some big names.</p>\n<p id=\"SJIaFz\">Since the Epic Games Store\u2019s launch in late 2018, Epic has spent millions of dollars to give away games as a way to hook new users and bolster its nascent game store. (Originally, it gave away a free game <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/epic-games-store-offering-2-free-games-every-month\">every two weeks</a> before upping that to every week <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/epic-games-store-free-game-every-week-in-2019\">in June 2019</a>.) Epic\u2019s goal is to have one \u201ctentpole\u201d game every month, Steve Allison, VP and general manager of the Epic Games Store, said in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. \u201cThose become really big weeks,\u201d he said.

Epic takes a 12 percent commission on game sales, meaning developers keep the money earned from the remaining 88 percent.
