"If you don't give me an explanation, I'll give you an explanation" has been a popular phrase on the Chinese internet since 2008. As we enter 2023, local governments in China are pushing for reforming employee health care.  It has led many Chinese to ask, “Where did my money go?” They are demanding answers from the government. After bureaucratic responses from the authorities, a lot of people have decided to give the government an answer, namely, to opt out of social security.
