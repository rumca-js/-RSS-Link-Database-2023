Times have changed: The final trailer for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/super-mario-bros-movie-first-trailer-203221015.html\"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> by Illumination</a> leans hard into its origins. This is <em>absolutely</em> a game, it says. See? Here's a scene that looks like <em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em>, and another one that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-next-batch-of-mario-kart-8-deluxe-tracks-arrives-on-march-9th-171713387.html\">looks just like <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a>.</p><div id=\"25f35247a724483aa1705e9171551050\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>If you were hoping to hear more of Chris Pratt's Mario voice, you won't find it here \u2014 but the final trailer does give viewers a clear look at the tone the movie is going for. We watch Bowser list off an army of familiar video game enemies. We watch Mario and Donkey Kong use power mushrooms and fire flowers as they run through a training course that looks like a traditional Mario level. We see Mario and Peach race through a brightly rendered Rainbow Road. It looks familiar. It looks fun. And it looks like a game, but with better graphics.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>That's no surprise. According to directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, Illumination has worked closely with Nintendo to make sure the film feels right. The directors also say that Illumination has improved its lighting and rendering technology to help push Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level &quot;beyond anything Illumination has ever done.&quot;</p><p>As for that Mario voice? You'll finally be able to hear the full performance when the film hits theaters next month. <em>The Super Mario Bros.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/03/08/taxiway-landing-alerts\">tells</a><em>Axios</em> that 43 major US airports are now using ASDE-X Taxiway Arrival Prediction (ATAP), a software platform that warns air traffic controllers if an aircraft is lining up to land on a taxiway by mistake. An aviator shouldn't endanger lives on the ground simply because they're inexperienced or fatigued.</p><p>The system relies on standard radar along with other sensors. It also works regardless of aircraft size \u2014 it can flag small turboprops and large airliners. ATAP first saw use at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in 2018, and the FAA says it <a href=\"https://medium.com/@FederalAviationAdministration/faa-upgrades-wrong-surface-alert-technology-6041988dce6e\">finished</a> software upgrades at compatible airports last September.

The FAA notes ATAP has caught over 50 potential taxiway landings since 2018, and there have been eight alerts so far in 2023. While accidental landings are far less common than crashes (and thus far less deadly), the software may still be helpful even if it prevents chaos from an aircraft disrupting the queue.</p><p>ATAP's rise comes as aircraft and airports increasingly rely on digital safety systems. Airbus, for instance, recently began testing a pilot assist that can <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airbus-dragonfly-autonomous-pilot-assist-171226854.html\">automatically divert flights in emergencies</a>, aid with taxiing and even land if the pilots are incapacitated.

Releases also have to meet a baseline quality level that matches the description customers see, and they'll need (free) age ratings in countries where they're required.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As with the Epic Games Store's usual practices, the main draw is the higher cut of revenue. Epic takes a relatively modest <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-06-the-epic-games-store-is-live.html\">12 percent cut</a> where its main rival, Steam, can take up to 30 percent depending on sales figures. The company also doesn't demand a portion of in-app purchases if they're made using a non-Epic payment system. While it's potentially more lucrative for most developers, it's particularly beneficial for small studios that may want to reach a large audience without giving up a large chunk of their revenue.</p><p>The self-publish mechanism has taken a long tim to reach this point. Epic first started beta-testing the feature in August 2021 ahead of an expected 2022 debut. The delay is because &quot;developing software is hard,&quot; CEO Tim Sweeney <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/9/23630864/epic-games-store-self-publish-tools-ratings\">tells</a><em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Whether or not developers flock to the Epic Games Store as a result isn't certain.

It remains the largest multi-developer game portal on computers. Epic's requirements are also more stringent than Valve's, which only really forbid illegal content and &quot;trolling&quot; attempts.

Starting next week, the company will begin rolling out a public experiment that will augment Clyde, the built-in bot Discord employs to notify users of errors and respond to their slash commands, with conversational capabilities. Judging from the demo it showed off, Discord envisions people turning to Clyde for information they would have obtained from Google in the past. For instance, you might ask the chatbot for the local time in the place where someone on your server lives to decide if it would be appropriate to message them. You can invoke Clyde at any time, including in private conversations among your friends, by typing @Clyde.</p><figure><img alt=\"Clyde, Discord's new ChatGPT-powered chatbot, can answer questions for users.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/09e31b00-be90-11ed-bbbd-8b9e34a29d96\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Discord</div></figure><p>Discord is quick to note Clyde is programmed not to bother you and your friends. Admins can also disable the chatbot if they don\u2019t want to use the feature on their server. The first time you activate Clyde, Discord will display an opt-in prompt. For users worried about privacy, Anjney Midha, Discord\u2019s head of platform ecosystem, told Engadget the company is not sharing user data with OpenAI to assist the startup in training its machine learning models.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Separate from Clyde, Discord is using OpenAI\u2019s technology to enhance <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/discord-automod-announced-150037142.html\">AutoMod</a>, the automated content moderation tool the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/discord-automod-announced-150037142.html\">introduced last June</a>. As a refresher, server admins and moderators can configure AutoMod to automatically detect and block inappropriate messages before they\u2019re posted by creating a list of words and phrases they don\u2019t want to see. In the nine months since it began rolling out AutoMod, Discord says the feature has blocked more than 45 million unwanted messages.</p><p>Moving forward, the tool will use large language models to interpret and apply server rules. In practice, this should make AutoMod capable of spotting and taking action against people who attempt to go against a community\u2019s norms and expectations. In one demo, Discord showed AutoMod taking action against someone who tried to skirt a server rule against self-promotion by writing their message in a different language. In that instance, AutoMod wasn\u2019t preprogrammed to watch for a specific word or phrase, but it was able to use context to infer that there was a potential infraction.</p><figure><img alt=\"AutoMod screenshot, showing the tool's new capability to enforce server rules.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/235a1e30-be90-11ed-bd7b-0ddb23464d93\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Discord</div></figure><p>According to Midha, Discord has been exploring how machine learning can improve user safety for a while. While he didn\u2019t have early data to share on AutoMod\u2019s new capabilities, he said the early results are \u201csuper promising,\u201d adding he has \u201cnever seen anything like it.\u201d The new and improved AutoMod is rolling out to select servers starting today.</p><p>If you\u2019re the type of person who uses Discord mostly to chat with friends, chances are the upgrades to Clyde and AutoMod won\u2019t dramatically change your experience of the app, particularly since plenty of other apps already <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/even-slack-has-a-chatgpt-app-now-154334452.html\">offer ChatGPT integration</a>. But Discord is also using OpenAI tech to power a feature that everyone should find useful: Conversation Summaries. If you\u2019ve ever joined a large server only to immediately feel like you can\u2019t keep up with some of its more active members, this feature promises to solve one of Discord\u2019s longstanding pain points. When it arrives in a limited number of servers next week, the feature will begin creating bundles designed to provide you with an overview of chats you may have missed while away from the app. Each bundle will include a title, a summary of what was said and any images that were shared, as well as a log of who took part. You won\u2019t need to endlessly scroll to try and piece together something you missed.</p><p>It can feel like Discord is just another tech firm up in the generative AI craze, but Midha wants users to know machine learning has been part of the Discord identity for a while. Every month, more than 30 million people use AI applications through the platform, and almost 3 million servers include at least one AI experience. On GitHub, many machine learning projects feature links to Discord servers, a fact Midha attributes to Discord being a natural place for those conversations to start. With its emphasis on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/discord-rebranding-151953314.html\">bringing friends and communities together</a>, the company believes it has a leg up on the competition.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/with-the-help-of-openai-discord-is-finally-adding-conversation-summaries-160030905.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/with-the-help-of-openai-discord-is-finally-adding-conversation-summaries-160030905.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-09 16:00:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "DJI\u2019s Mini 3 drone is currently $90 off", "description": "<p>One of the most compelling aspects of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dj-is-mini-3-is-a-cheaper-but-far-less-capable-version-of-the-mini-3-pro-130008247.html\"><ins>DJI's Mini 3 drone</ins></a>, a stripped-down version of the Pro model, is the price, which was already fairly reasonable.

It also weighs less than 249 grams, which means you won't need to secure a dedicated permit to fly it in certain territories (it's always worth checking local drone regulations before buying one, though). Despite the small size, DJI claims the Mini 3 is resistant to winds of 38 KPH (23.6 miles per hour).</p><p>An automated video feature called QuickShots sees the drone fly automatically on certain paths, such as moving around a subject. There are some features that could come in handy for novice flyers, such as automatic takeoff and functions that bring the drone back to its departure point in certain circumstances, such as when the battery is running low or the signal cuts out. On the downside, unlike on the Mini 3 Pro, there are no forward and rear obstacle detection sensors, which could particularly become an issue when the return to home function is engaged when the drone's out of your line of sight.</p><p>For those who'd prefer to take charge of the Mini 3 with a controller that has a built-in 5.5-inch screen (rather than the regular RC-N1 one that you'd likely have to use in combination with your smartphone), it's worth noting that the RC model is on sale as well.

In a word, physics. The larger sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses with far superior optics. Where smartphones have one f/stop, cameras have many, which gives you more exposure control. You also get natural and not AI-generated bokeh, quicker shooting, a physical shutter, more professional video results, and so on. Smartphones do have impressive AI skills that help make photography easier, but that\u2019s about it.</p><p>With that settled, mirrorless is the best way to go if you\u2019re shopping for a new camera. Both Canon and Nikon recently announced they\u2019re discontinuing development of new DSLRs, simply because most of the advantages of that category are gone, as I detailed in a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1ueVBLQkJlSHk2ayZ0PTFzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MzRmOWVlYy0xZmY3LTRmNjUtOGU4Mi1lNTk1Njc3OTQyNjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXmCjfEttjOnoXX9aziLn_IMPCCZihMcE0KQI88KrRLp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnyPKBBeHy6k%26t%3D1s\">recent video</a>.

Panasonic has built a number of good models in the past, but recently said it would focus only on video-centric mirrorless models going forward. And we haven\u2019t seen any new ones from Canon or Nikon lately, either. Only Sony and Fujifilm are still carrying the compact torch, the latter with its <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTU0MjY3NS1SRUcvZnVqaWZpbG1feDEwMHZfZGlnaXRhbF9jYW1lcmFfc2lsdmVyLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUzNGY5ZWVjLTFmZjctNGY2NS04ZTgyLWU1OTU2Nzc5NDI2NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYqGhxupn_OqixHefMKSWedzhMrnlgA7mh3FXo2E_7tg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1542675-REG%2Ffujifilm_x100v_digital_camera_silver.html\">$1,400 X100V model</a>, which has become <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2022/11/18/the-x100v-is-so-popular-fujifilm-cant-handle-more-orders/\">famously hard to find</a>.

The one that affects your photography (and budget) the most is sensor size. The largest is medium format, but that\u2019s only used on niche and expensive cameras from Hasselblad, Fujifilm and Leica, so we\u2019ll skip over those for this article. (See my <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-gfx-100s-review-140025104.html\">Fujifilm GFX 100S</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hasselblad-x2d-100c-incredible-resolution-beautiful-imperfections-150029773.html\">Hasselblad X2D</a> reviews for more.)</p><p>The most expensive category we\u2019ll be discussing here is full-frame, largely used by pros and serious amateurs. Models are available from all the major brands except Fujifilm, including Sony, Canon, Nikon and Panasonic. That format offers the best image quality, low-light capability and depth of field, with prices starting around $1,000. With the right lenses, you can get beautifully blurred backgrounds, but autofocus is more critical. Lenses are also more expensive.</p><p>Down one size are APS-C cameras, offered on Fujifilm, Sony, Nikon and Canon models. Cameras and lenses are cheaper than full-frame, but you still get nice blurred \u201cbokeh,\u201d decent low-light shooting capability and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size equivalent to 35mm movie film, it's ideal for shooting video.</p><figure><img alt=\"Nikon Z7 II Engadget camera guide\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/c5148710-a2d6-11eb-b3f5-51eb0461cfa7\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Micro Four Thirds, used by Panasonic and Olympus, is the smallest mainstream sensor size for mirrorless cameras. It offers less dramatic bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, it\u2019s harder to blur the background to isolate your subject, but focus is easier to control.</p><p>The next thing to consider is sensor resolution. High-res cameras like Sony\u2019s 61-megapixel full-frame A7R V or Fujifilm\u2019s 40-megapixel APS-C X-H2 deliver detailed images \u2013 but the small pixels mean they\u2019re not ideal for video or low-light shooting. Lower-resolution models like Panasonic\u2019s 10.3-megapixel GH5s or Sony\u2019s 12.1-megapixel A7S III excel at video and high-ISO shooting, but lack detail for photos.</p><p>Image quality is subjective, but different cameras do produce slightly different results. Some photographers prefer the skin tones from Canon while others like Fujifilm\u2019s colors, for example. It\u2019s best to check sample photos to see which model best suits your style.</p><p>What about handling? The Fujifilm X-T5 has lots of manual dials to access shooting controls, while Sony\u2019s A6600 relies more on menus. The choice often depends on personal preferences, but manual dials and buttons can help you find settings more easily and shoot quicker. For heavy lenses, you need a camera with a big grip.</p><p>Video is more important than ever. Most cameras deliver at least 4K at 30 frames per second, but some models now offer 4K at up to 120p, with 6K and even 8K resolution. If you need professional-looking results, choose a camera with 10-bit or even RAW capability, along with log profiles to maximize dynamic range.</p><p>In-body stabilization, which keeps the camera steady even if you move, is another important option for video and low-light photography. You\u2019ll also want to consider the electronic viewfinder (EVF) specs. High resolutions and refresh rates make judging shots easier, particularly in sunny environments.</p><p>Other important features include displays that flip up or around for vlogging or selfie shots, along with things like battery life, the number and type of memory card slots, the ports and wireless connectivity. Lens selection is also key, as some brands like Sony have more choice than others. For most of our picks, keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to buy at least one lens.</p><p>Now, let\u2019s take a look at our top camera picks for 2023. We\u2019ve divided the selection into four budget categories: under $800, under $1,500, under $2,500 and over $2,500. We chose those price categories because many recent cameras slot neatly into them. Manufacturers have largely abandoned the low end of the market, so there are very few mirrorless models under $500.</p><h2>Best mirrorless cameras under $800</h2><p></p><p>My top pick in the budget category is Canon\u2019s brand new $680 24.2-megapixel <a href=\"https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/eos-r50?color=Black&amp;type=New\">R50</a>, an impressive model considering the price. It can shoot bursts at up to 15 fps in electronic shutter mode, and offers 4K 10-bit at up to 30p with supersampling and no crop. It has a fully articulating display, and unlike other cameras in this category, an electronic viewfinder. It uses Canon\u2019s Dual Pixel AF with subject recognition mode, and even has a popup flash. The only drawback is the lack of decent quality lens that\u2019s as affordable as the camera itself. Pre-orders are open with delivery set for spring.</p><p></p><p>Your next best option is an older model, the 20.7-megapixel <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PbHltcHVzLU9NLUQtTTEwLVNpbHZlci1DYW1lcmEvZHAvQjA4RDYyOVBOOD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1paC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTM0ZjllZWMtMWZmNy00ZjY1LThlODItZTU5NTY3Nzk0MjY2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQT2babVaViNov4rp9NaxQxp1NtRKzzypx_5l8lsrRuk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOlympus-OM-D-M10-Silver-Camera%2Fdp%2FB08D629PN8\">Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV</a>, as it offers the best mix of photography and video features. You get up to 15 fps shooting speeds, 4K 30p or HD 120p video, and it\u2019s one of the few cameras in this price category with built-in five-axis stabilization. It\u2019s portable and lightweight for travel, and the lenses are compact and affordable. The drawbacks are an autofocus system that\u2019s not as fast or accurate as the competition, and a small sensor size.</p><p></p><p>If you\u2019re a creator, Sony\u2019s 24.2-megapixel <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LUFscGhhLVpWLUUxMC1JbnRlcmNoYW5nZWFibGUtTWlycm9ybGVzcy9kcC9CMDlCQkxINFNHP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWloLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MzRmOWVlYy0xZmY3LTRmNjUtOGU4Mi1lNTk1Njc3OTQyNjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAU4cJpH3QY0y47p1Rs5Ki4B-y4UzAV7pzxXynMW_XvvI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-Alpha-ZV-E10-Interchangeable-Mirrorless%2Fdp%2FB09BBLH4SG\">ZV-E10</a> is a strong budget option. It can shoot sharp, downsampled 4K video at up to 30 fps with a 1.23x crop (or 1080p at 120 fps) and uses Sony\u2019s fantastic AI-powered autofocus system with face and eye detection. It also has a few creator-specific features like Product Showcase and a bokeh switch that makes the background as blurry as possible so your subject stands out. Another nice feature is the high-quality microphone that lets you vlog without the need to buy an external mic. The main drawbacks are the lack of an EVF and rolling shutter.</p><p></p><p>Another good creator option that\u2019s better for photography is <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QYW5hc29uaWMtQ2FtZXJhLU1pcnJvcmxlc3MtVmxvZ2dpbmctMTItMzJtbS9kcC9CMDhCRzU5N1M4P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWloLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MzRmOWVlYy0xZmY3LTRmNjUtOGU4Mi1lNTk1Njc3OTQyNjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaNj_ZeGMTsUvvGbCufDS0zBefzBdMNbeMvzpFIVvQxw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPanasonic-Camera-Mirrorless-Vlogging-12-32mm%2Fdp%2FB08BG597S8\">Panasonic\u2019s Lumix G100</a>, on sale right now with a 12-32mm lens. As with the ZV-E10, it can shoot 4K video at 30 fps (cropped 1.47x), though 1080p is limited to 60 fps. Unlike its Sony rival, though, the G100 has a 3.68-million dot EVF and 10 fps shooting speeds. Other features include a fully-articulating display, and 5-axis hybrid image stabilization.</p><p>Honorable mentions go to two models, starting with Nikon\u2019s 20.9-megapixel <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTcxMzg1MC1SRUcvbmlrb25fejMwX21pcnJvcmxlc3NfY2FtZXJhX3dpdGguaHRtbD8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUzNGY5ZWVjLTFmZjctNGY2NS04ZTgyLWU1OTU2Nzc5NDI2NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARjh0hkczcyvSDSy6GVWLVF626tdCBGk6hzKKWGkQvx-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1713850-REG%2Fnikon_z30_mirrorless_camera_with.html%3F\">APS-C Z30</a>, another mirrorless camera designed for vloggers and creators. It offers 4K using the full width of the sensor, 120fps slow mo at 1080p, a flip-out display and AI powered hybrid phase-detect AF. The drawbacks are the lack of an EVF and autofocus that\u2019s not up to Sony\u2019s standards.

Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job.

The 24.2-megapixel sensor delivers more detail than the previous model, and you can now shoot RAW stills at up to 40 fps in electronic shutter mode. Video specs are equally solid, with full sensor 4K supersampled from 6K at up to 60 fps. Autofocus is quick and more versatile than ever thanks to expanded subject detection. It\u2019s still not quite up to Sony\u2019s standards, though, and the microHDMI and lack of a CFexpress slot isn\u2019t ideal.</p><p></p><p>If you\u2019re OK with a smaller APS-C sensor, check out the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0eee6f60-6f21-4ba6-b70e-cc15b39bf860&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Adorama&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZWVlNmY2MC02ZjIxLTRiYTYtYjcwZS1jYzE1YjM5YmY4NjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvcmFtYS5jb20vaWZqeGgyc2FrLmh0bWw_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MzRmOWVlYy0xZmY3LTRmNjUtOGU4Mi1lNTk1Njc3OTQyNjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASRSWL0CShUx8vKTjCsWYBlD4wETm67OC77qXIb12oXk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fifjxh2sak.html%3F\">Fujifilm X-H2S</a>. It has an incredibly fast stacked, backside-illuminated 26.1-megapixel sensor that allows for rapid burst shooting speeds of 40 fps, along with 4K 120p video with minimal rolling shutter. It can capture ProRes 10-bit video internally, has 7 stops of in-body stabilization and a class-leading EVF. Yes, it\u2019s expensive for an APS-C camera at $2,500, but on the other hand, it\u2019s the cheapest stacked sensor camera out there. The other downside is AF that\u2019s not quite up to Canon and Sony\u2019s level.</p><p></p><p>Video shooters should look at Panasonic\u2019s full-frame <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTc0MjQyOC1SRUcvcGFuYXNvbmljX2RjX3M1bTJib2R5X2x1bWl4X3M1X2lpX21pcnJvcmxlc3MuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTM0ZjllZWMtMWZmNy00ZjY1LThlODItZTU5NTY3Nzk0MjY2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQybzTYum7QVfGHDg5Gn4WF1za5O8Q5fLg1eLfCB2s8d&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1742428-REG%2Fpanasonic_dc_s5m2body_lumix_s5_ii_mirrorless.html\">S5 II</a>. It\u2019s the company\u2019s first camera with hybrid phase-detect AF designed to make focus \"wobble\" and other issues a thing of the past. You can shoot sharp 4K 30p video downsampled from the full sensor width, or 4K 60p from an APS-C cropped size, all in 10-bit color. It even offers 5.9K 30p capture, along with RAW 5.9K external output to an Atomos recorder. You also get a flip-out screen for vlogging and updated five-axis in-body stabilization that\u2019s the best in the industry. Photo quality is also good thanks to the dual-gain 24-megapixel sensor.

It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that\u2019s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap, albeit with significant rolling shutter. If you don\u2019t need the video, however, Sony\u2019s A7R IVa does mostly the same job, photo-wise, and costs a few hundred dollars less.</p><p>The 12-megapixel A7S III, meanwhile, is the best dedicated video camera, with outstanding 4K video quality at up to 120 fps, a flip-out display and category leading autofocus.

While the 12-megapixel sensor doesn\u2019t deliver a lot of photo detail, it\u2019s the best camera for low-light shooting, period.</p><p></p><p>And if you want a mirrorless sports camera, check out Canon\u2019s 24-megapixel <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYW5vbi00ODk1QzAwMi1FT1MtUjMtQm9keS9kcC9CMDlGRlRNM0Y2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWloLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MzRmOWVlYy0xZmY3LTRmNjUtOGU4Mi1lNTk1Njc3OTQyNjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYRO-icDxj0aE4Fr6n9_j4p8aprtfOxeosrdxPA6mbjd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCanon-4895C002-EOS-R3-Body%2Fdp%2FB09FFTM3F6\">EOS R3</a>. It can shoot bursts at up to 30 fps with autofocus enabled, making it great for any fast-moving action. It\u2019s a very solid option for video too, offering 6K at up to 60 fps in Canon\u2019s RAW LTE mode, or 4K at 120 fps. Canon\u2019s Dual Pixel autofocus is excellent, and it offers 8 stops of shake reduction, a flip-out display and even eye detection autofocus. The biggest drawback for the average buyer is the $6,000 price, so it\u2019s really aimed at professionals as a replacement for the 1DX Mark III DSLR.</p><p></p><p>Honorable mention goes to Canon\u2019s 45 megapixel <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTU0NzAwOS1SRUcvY2Fub25fZW9zX3I1X21pcnJvcmxlc3NfZGlnaXRhbC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MzRmOWVlYy0xZmY3LTRmNjUtOGU4Mi1lNTk1Njc3OTQyNjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASPoWgA1cF5rBcYWoXVDQepesVuuOfUdjKNmH_MD_ezC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1547009-REG%2Fcanon_eos_r5_mirrorless_digital.html\">EOS R5</a>. For a lot less money, it nearly keeps pace with the A1, thanks to the 20 fps shooting speeds and lightning fast autofocus. It also offers 8K and 4K 120p video, while besting Sony with internal RAW recording. The big drawback is overheating, as you can\u2019t shoot 8K longer than 20 minutes and it takes a while before it cools down enough so that you can start shooting again.

The release brings the company\u2019s generative music platform to mobile, where it was not available previously. Engadget\u2019s James Trew has been using the app since <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/aimis-mobile-app-lets-you-remix-its-endless-ai-generated-beats-150003232.html\"><ins>January</ins></a>. Since then, Aimi has made a few user interface tweaks.</p><p>What hasn\u2019t changed is the premise of the app. As before, Aimi is built around continuous music \u201cexperiences\u201d you can subtly tweak by interacting with a handful of interface elements. If you're familiar with platforms like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-17-endel-standalone-apple-watch-app.html\">Endel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-23-the-science-behind-beats-to-study-to.html\">Brain.fm</a>, you probably know what you're getting into. As a free user, you can tap the thumbs-up and down buttons to guide Aimi\u2019s algorithm. There\u2019s also a shuffle button if a section comes on that you don\u2019t like at all. With today\u2019s release, Aimi will also prompt you to indicate if you want to hear a section more or less frequently, as well as for longer or shorter periods of time.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"56e1704e175f4973a2b74892944d3cc9\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Users who pay $10 per month gain access to additional controls. First, a \u201cSection\u201d view allows you to isolate individual elements of a musical composition, including parts like the harmony and melody, and adjust the gain and tell Aimi whether you like what you\u2019re hearing. An additional \u201cComposition\u201d interface allows you to shape what you\u2019re hearing by adjusting a set of four sliders. For instance, by moving the \u201cProgression\u201d slider, you can instruct Aimi to modify the experience you\u2019re listening to more or less often. Meanwhile, the \u201cIntensity\u201d and \u201cTexture\u201d sliders allow you to control the number of effects Aimi employs and whether a composition sounds organic or synthetic. Last but not least, there\u2019s a self-explanatory Vocals slider.</p><p>The release of a mobile app is part of a broader plan by Aimi to bring more people into the world of generative music. Later this year, the company plans to release Aimi Studio, which will allow users to take a more hands-on approach to craft their own compositions. \u201cOne of the strengths of generative music is that we can use it to attract casual listeners with continuous music experiences and then introduce them to interactive music by letting them take ownership of their music experience,\u201d Aimi CEO Edward Balassanian told Engadget at the start of the year.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/aimis-app-for-listening-to-ai-generated-beats-arrives-on-android-and-ios-150035919.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/aimis-app-for-listening-to-ai-generated-beats-arrives-on-android-and-ios-150035919.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-09 15:00:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Wing debuts a rideshare-style drone delivery network", "description": "<p>Ridesharing is convenient in part because there's often a vehicle near you, and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wing-expanding-drone-delivery-to-lusk-ireland-in-the-coming-weeks-173039215.html\">Alphabet's Wing</a> wants to extend that advantage to drone delivery. The company is <a href=\"https://blog.wing.com/2023/03/the-wing-delivery-network.html\">debuting</a> a Wing Delivery Network platform that relies on decentralized and highly automated pickups. Drones charge and deliver in whatever locations make the most sense for the broader system. If demand surges in a given area, more drones can operate around the nearest pads.</p><p>Crucially, your local restaurant or store doesn't have to do much to take advantage of the network. An AutoLoader system lets shops simply latch a package to a curbside pickup location and walk away \u2014 the drone handles the rest. Businesses have to order drones, but they don't have to manage the fleet or make employees wait for an aircraft to arrive.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"dcb60200d9c04df6a642d6031593cf5c\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>The technology is also meant to scale elegantly. It's relatively easy to add new pad locations as usage grows, and the drones can double as scouts that expand the network. The drones can even make sure they're allowed to fly in a given area.</p><p>Wing expects &quot;elements&quot; of the Delivery Network to deploy over the next year, with demonstrations taking place worldwide in 2023. Provided all goes according to plan, the brand wants to handle &quot;millions&quot; of deliveries by mid-2024, at prices that beat conventional ground-based delivery.</p><p>There are catches. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/faa-final-drone-rule-dates-184538960.html\">Drone regulations</a> aren't always prepared to handle autonomous deliveries, let alone for decentralized systems. Amazon's Prime Air drones have<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-drone-deliveries-faa-restrictions-205756349.html\"> made few deliveries</a> precisely because of regulatory requirements. Likewise, there's no guarantee businesses will be willing to invest in drones and adapt their curbside pickup spaces. Wing's approach is markedly different than seen with other networks, however, and its combination of lightweight drones and gentle deliveries (Amazon's heavy drones have to drop packages from 12 feet up) may make it more appealing to officials and stores alike.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wing-debuts-a-rideshare-style-drone-delivery-network-144212334.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/wing-debuts-a-rideshare-style-drone-delivery-network-144212334.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-09 14:42:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Roku is adding a Local News Hub to its Live TV menu", "description": "<p>Roku wants you to rediscover local news.

The whole affair only makes sense if you assume the whole crew had taken a big dose of idiot pills an hour before the episode began, and wish you\u2019d had some as well. This week, there\u2019s a lot more to say, especially since it\u2019s the first episode this season that feels even remotely fun. And while the setup for all of these conflicts was pretty flimsy, their resolutions are all very enjoyable to watch.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>After the Shrike uses its <em>Portal</em> gun to encourage the Titan to shoot itself in the back, the ship drifts into a gravity well and certain doom. It\u2019s here we get one of the worst tell-not-show moments in the series so far as the bridge crew state, and then restate (and then re-restate) the situation the ship finds itself in. Loss of power, is it? Sinking into a gravity well, is it? We don\u2019t have enough power to get out of the gravity well, is it? Is that because we\u2019ve not got much power, is it? And because of the gravity well? Sorry, not following, can you explain it to me like I\u2019m five, please? It doesn\u2019t help that while the decision to take the shields offline is set up as some big, dangerous decision, it\u2019s never mentioned again.</p><p>It\u2019s here that Picard, opting to get his affairs in order, chooses to sit down for a touching moment with Jack. And they choose to do so on the holodeck, in the Ten Forward bar that\u2019s been turning up time and again this run. Picard says that holodecks are hooked up to their own power supply because it\u2019s better to die in comfort than use that power to survive. I think we can all tell that it\u2019s a cover for either a production or a budget issue that meant they had to re-use the set. (<em>Picard</em>\u2019s first season did the same, endlessly going back to the chateau office on La Sirena\u2019s holodeck.) And, again, the two-hander between Patrick Stewart and Ed Speelers is great.</p><p>Also, remember when a broken leg wouldn\u2019t require much more than a quick waft of a med bay doodad and you\u2019d be good as new? Not in <em>Picard</em>, where Shaw storms into Picard\u2019s heart to heart, apparently full of painkillers, and reveals why he\u2019s so angry at both Seven and Picard. It turns out that, like a big chunk of Starfleet, he\u2019s a survivor from Wolf 359! And if this wasn\u2019t another thing that was explored pretty well by <em>Next Generation</em> and <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, it might carry a bit more dramatic weight. It also feels like the start of a pre-ordained redemption arc for Todd Stashwick\u2019s Captain Shaw as the powers that be use <em>Picard </em>as a way to backdoor pilot a Titan-A spin-off series. (You can imagine the pitch: We\u2019ve got the cast, and the sets are already built, it\u2019s practically free content if you greenlight another ten!) And, to be fair, Todd Stashwick\u2019s such a charismatic actor that you could feel him straining to play someone more unlikeable at the start of the series.</p><p>From here until the conclusion, however, the tone starts to lighten, and Beverley\u2019s realization that the nebula is a space lifeform gives everyone a sense of purpose. You see, the nebula is undergoing the exact same contractions that a pregnant person would when they\u2019re in labor. The moment that Riker stops pointlessly objecting to the plan of riding the contractions out of the gravity well, it suddenly feels like we\u2019re watching Star Trek again. The gang works together, Seven and Shaw successfully lure out the changeling infiltrator, and they even have a nice spot of payback for the Shrike as Riker orders the Titan to lock onto a massive asteroid, dragging it behind long enough for it to smash the enemy vessel out of contention long enough for them to escape.</p><p>And that\u2019s not even the best bit, because there\u2019s also the wonderful B-Story of Picard dealing with his adoring fans while in (the real) Ten Forward five years previously. <del>Patrick Stewart</del> Picard is accosted by a bunch of <del>fans</del> cadets who ask him to regale them with stories of his time on <del>Star Trek</del> the Enterprise. All the while, unseen, Jack lingers in the background, listening to Picard as he builds out his myth and his legacy while minimizing any reference to his own family. When Picard closes the gathering by saying that Starfleet <em>is</em> his family, it\u2019s both an unwittingly hollow indictment of Picard\u2019s own life (his co-workers are his only friends, <em>oof</em>) and an unwitting rejection of the son he could have grown to know years previously. This, my friends, is a great moment, full of depth and pathos and I just wish that it hadn\u2019t taken <em>this long</em> to get here.</p><p>Speaking of which, Paramount recently punted <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-ending-season-5-next-year-070320271.html\"><em><ins>Star Trek: Discovery\u2019s</ins></em><ins> fifth season to 2024</ins></a>, adding it would now be that show\u2019s final run. With news that the studio is looking to tighten its belt in order to milk some actual profit from its streaming service, fans are feeling <a href=\"https://trekmovie.com/2023/03/01/the-future-of-star-trek-tv-remains-unclear-as-paramount-announces-streaming-spending-cuts/\"><ins>antsy</ins></a>. After all, Trek shows aren\u2019t cheap to make, and it\u2019s not clear how much crossover appeal these shows have. Despite David Stapf\u2019s <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/08/patrick-stewart-star-trek-franchise-expansion-plans-cbs-all-access-executives-interview-tca-1202440492/?uuid=tlPw9HvtWQyUtuZK1064\"><ins>2018 promise</ins></a> that we\u2019d have \u201ca Star Trek something on all the time,\u201d there\u2019s a worry that it\u2019s closing time at the all-you-can-eat buffet. With <em>Discovery</em> and <em>Picard</em> on the outs, and no sign (yet) that <em>Lower Decks</em> and <em>Prodigy </em>will get renewals, we could go from five shows to three, or one, in no time at all. But, based on the merits of some of what\u2019s been released under the Trek brand of late, would that really be such a bad thing?</p><p>After all, these four episodes of <em>Picard</em> form little more than an extended prologue for the rest of the run. It\u2019s taken the better part of <em>four hours</em> to establish the broad outline of the plot as well as the main antagonists, and the stakes at hand. Even then, we\u2019ve still not encountered more than half of the <em>Next Generation </em>returnees who formed such a key part of the marketing. A prologue that I would have enjoyed a hell of a lot more if it had been compressed down to closer to ninety minutes. Imagine if, rather than filling out a corporate-mandated ten-week block each year, the format was designed to suit the story being told at each time. On the merits of the last four weeks alone, fewer episodes of higher quality Trek would be infinitely preferable.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-34-no-win-scenario-review-140041872.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-34-no-win-scenario-review-140041872.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-09 14:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Roku's first self-made TVs hit Best Buy stores today", "description": "<p>At CES, Roku announced that it'll finally be <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roku-tv-select-premium-televisions-140014570.html\">building its own Roku TVs</a>, in addition to working with partners like TCL and Hisense. Starting today, you can pick up one of those sets at Best Buy's stores and website.

That's in-line with similar offerings from TCL and other partners. At CES, Roku's VP of retail strategy, Chris Larson, said the company is aiming to deliver features partners don't always include, like voice-enabled remotes, as well as automatic brightness adjustment (on the Premiere sets).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Roku isn't saying much about its Select TVs, perhaps because there's not much to say. They'll include HD and 4K models (there's no need to go 4K on very small TVs, after all), as well as its standard voice remote. Like most bargain TVs, they'll also rely on edge dimming backlights \u2014 so expect to see gray-like blacks and spotty lighting. The Roku Plus sets are far more advanced: They'll include QLED panels, local backlight dimming for better contrast, 4K Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos-approved speakers. They'll also get <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roku-express-4k-rechargeable-remote-130031381.html\">Roku's rechargeable voice remote</a>.</p><p>While Roku told us that it's not trying to compete with its longtime partners, it'll be interesting to see how those companies respond. By making voice remotes standard, perhaps TCL and others will follow suit. The company also unveiled a Roku OS update today, which will include local news and support for premium subscriptions on Roku's live channel guide.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/roku-tv-select-plus-best-buy-140020537.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/roku-tv-select-plus-best-buy-140020537.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-09 14:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Netflix now lets you customize subtitles on your TV", "description": "<p>If you want to change the appearance of subtitles and closed captions on Netflix \u2014 perhaps to switch font sizes or to add a shadow that would make them more readable \u2014 you'd have to access your account on a browser.

In a statement, the board said they planned to scrutinize the social network\u2019s policies surrounding election content in \u201chigh-risk\u201d areas.</p><p>The case stems from a user who posted a video in early January calling for people to \u201cbesiege\u201d Brazil\u2019s congress following the election of President Lula da Silva. The video also featured clips of a speech from a Brazilian general, who called for people to go into the streets and government buildings. The video was reported seven times by four different users, according to the board, but remained on Facebook even after it was reviewed by five separate moderators. Meta later opted to remove the post and issue a \u201cstrike\u201d to the person who had originally posted it, following the Oversight Board\u2019s decision to review the case.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Though the case is related to Brazil\u2019s most recent presidential election, the board\u2019s recommendations could have a more-far reaching impact. \u201cThe Board selected this case to examine how Meta moderates election-related content, and how it is applying its Crisis Policy Protocol in a designated \u2018temporary high-risk location,\u2019\u201d the group wrote in a statement.</p><p>As the board points out, Meta\u2019s \u201cCrisis Policy Protocol,\u201d is a central aspect of the case. The protocol, which was <a href=\"https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/improving/crisis-policy-protocol/\"><ins>created</ins></a> after the Oversight board weighed in on the suspension of Donald Trump, allows Meta to respond to situations when there is a risk of \u201cimminent harm\u201d either offline or online. So any recommendations that address that policy could end up affecting election-related content around the world, not just in Brazil.</p><p>However, that outcome is still months away. For now, the Oversight Board is asking for public feedback on various issues associated with the case before it makes recommendations to Meta. The company will then have 60 days to respond, though, as usual, Meta is not required to adopt policy changes suggested by the board.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/metas-oversight-board-will-review-the-companys-handling-of-election-content-in-brazil-100001018.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/metas-oversight-board-will-review-the-companys-handling-of-election-content-in-brazil-100001018.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-09 10:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Microsoft says Bing has crossed 100 million daily active users", "description": "<p>Bing has <a href=\"https://blogs.bing.com/search/march_2023/The-New-Bing-and-Edge-%E2%80%93-Momentum-from-Our-First-Month/\">crossed 100 million daily active users</a> a month after the launch of its chatbot AI, according to Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's VP for Modern Life, Search and Devices. He said the company is fully aware that it's still just &quot;a small, low, single digit share player,&quot; but hey, there was a time when Bing wasn't even a part of the conversation. Now, after the tech giant <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html\">released its next-gen version</a>, even those who haven't used it in the past are relying on it for their searches: Mehdi noted that one-third of Bing's daily active users are new to the search engine.</p><p>&quot;We see this appeal of the new Bing as a validation of our view that search is due for a reinvention and of the unique value proposition of combining Search + Answers + Chat + Creation in one experience,&quot; the VP said.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In addition to seeing a boost in numbers, Microsoft is also apparently enjoying a growth in engagement, with more people conducting more searches. The company credits two factors for that particular victory, the first being Edge's growth in usage, most likely aided by the addition of Bing's chat AI as a new feature. It also said that the introduction of its Prometheus AI model made Bing's search results more relevant, so people have been using \u2014 or at least trying out \u2014 the search engine more.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, around one third of Bing's daily preview users have been using its chat AI for their queries every day. On average, Microsoft is seeing three chats per session, with over 45 million chats since it introduced the new Bing. Further, in 15 percent of all chat sessions, people have been using Bing to generate new content. The launch of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-brings-its-bing-ai-chatbot-to-mobile-apps-and-skype-173839923.html\">Bing's AI chatbot on mobile</a> has propelled the search engine to a new level of popularity, as well, and has led to a six-time increase in daily active users from before it became available.&nbsp;</p><p>By integrating an AI chatbot into Bing earlier this year, Microsoft gave its search engine the weapon it needs to be able to compete against Google. That said, Google does have plans to launch a chatbot of its own and introduced a chat AI called Bard last month. Bard <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html\">spouted misinformation</a> during its unofficial debut, but Google is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-human-employees-bard-chatbot-testing-055243004.html\">working with employees</a> to improve the chatbot's responses before it becomes available.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bing-crossed-100-million-daily-active-users-080138371.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bing-crossed-100-million-daily-active-users-080138371.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-09 08:01:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The AI Seinfeld show 'Nothing, Forever' is back on Twitch", "description": "<p><em>Nothing, Forever</em>, an AI-generated livestream inspired by Seinfeld is <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/watchmeforever\">back on Twitch</a> after being taken offline for an anti-LGBTQ outburst, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/seinfeld-nothing-forever-twitch-ai-1850204553\"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> has reported. After launching in December, the show (from Mismatch Media) became internet-famous for its Seinfeld-adjacent plots, janky '90s-era video game style animation and terrible (though coherent) dialogue. However, it was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai-seinfeld-bigoted-transphobic-hateful-moderation-193449772.html\">pulled over a month ago</a> after violating Twitch's conduct policy banning hate speech around sexual and gender identity.</p><p>In the most notorious incident, the AI lead character (&quot;Larry&quot;), went on an offensive rant. &quot;I\u2019m thinking about doing a bit about how being transgender is actually a mental illness. Or how all liberals are secretly gay and want to impose their will on everyone. Or something about how transgender people are ruining the fabric of society. But no one is laughing, so I\u2019m going to stop.&quot;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Shortly afterwards, Mismatch Media cofounder Skyler Hartle explained that the problem started when its OpenAI GPT-3 Davinci model stopped working correctly. The team switched to Davinci's predecessor Curie, believing that OpenAI's content moderation was still active \u2014 which was apparently not the case. The offensive outbursts started shortly afterwards.</p><p>&quot;We mistakenly believed that we were leveraging OpenAI\u2019s content moderation system for their text generation models. We are working now to implement OpenAI\u2019s content moderation API (it\u2019s a tool we can use to verify the safeness of the content) before we go live again, and investigating secondary content moderation systems as redundancies,&quot; the team said.&nbsp;</p><p>Problems of moderation and offensive content have plagued AI chatbots since they arrived. Microsoft has experienced it twice, first with its Tay chatbot that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist\">turned racist</a>, and later with the Bing Chat search assistant powered by OpenAI tech. The latter was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-explains-bings-bizarre-ai-chat-behavior-134931486.html\">pulled for a time</a> after it started insulting users and outputting incorrect information, while insisting it was right.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Nothing, Forever</em> seems to be working as before, with the same laugh track, engaged viewers (around 3,500 currently) and complete disregard for collision detection \u2014 but no offensive outbursts so far. While nothing in the show makes any sense, the fact that AI can generate all the elements in real time is impressive.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-ai-seinfeld-show-nothing-forever-is-back-on-twitch-064359854.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-ai-seinfeld-show-nothing-forever-is-back-on-twitch-064359854.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-09 06:43:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
