<p>Governor has 21 counties under emergency orders while 16m people in the state are under flood watch warnings</p><p>An impending atmospheric river and rapidly melting snow has put communities across California on high alert for flash flooding, mudslides and rockslides as the subtropical storm surge moves over the state. Rivers and streams could also quickly rise beyond capacity and breach, the National Weather Service warned. Overall, some 16m people are under flood watch warnings.</p><p>The state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has declared a state of emergency for 21 counties, including some mountain communities still digging themselves out from the snow. “The state is working around the clock with local partners to deploy life-saving equipment and first responders to communities across California,” Newsom said on Wednesday evening. “With more dangerous storms on the horizon, we’ll continue to mobilise every available resource to protect Californians.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/09/california-emergency-storm-weather-flooding">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Outstanding fly-half gets chance to dazzle against France while ‘mag dog’ Ellis Genge will make for a fascinating captain</p><p>Nothing can match Downing Street over the past nine months in terms of high-profile reshuffles at No 10 but Twickenham is fast catching up. There have now been as many different starting England captains since July as there have been serving prime ministers, with Marcus Smith’s elevation to the starting lineup to face France at the expense of Owen Farrell the latest abrupt changing of the old guard.</p><p>Fair play to Steve Borthwick who, at a stroke, has transformed expectations in middle England, at least for a day or two. The easy thing to do would have been to keep calm and simply carry on with Farrell as skipper and fly-half for England’s final tournament home game before this autumn’s World Cup. Instead Borthwick, for a mixture of reasons, has taken a deep breath and gone for it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/09/borthwicks-bold-smith-pick-comes-because-england-are-playing-catchup">Continue reading...</a>

## 65 review – Adam Driver v dinosaurs in almost fun enough thriller

<p>A scrappy adventure, shot two years ago and getting unceremoniously dumped, isn’t as bad as its backstory would suggest but it’s missing something</p><p>It’s almost impossible sitting down to watch the loopy sci-fi thriller 65 without being niggled by a familiar sinking feeling, like you’re about to eat a meal that you know won’t agree with your system. Despite the intriguing presence of Adam Driver, whose post-Star Wars roles have typically prioritised art over commerce, and a magnetically gonzo premise that sees a pilot crash-land on prehistoric Earth, it’s arriving weighed down by baggage heavy enough to flatten any hopes the thrillingly nutty trailer might have inspired.</p><p>Not only has the film, shot two years ago, already missed five prior release dates but it’s landing last minute without much of a visible campaign (it was only officially scheduled last month) and almost entirely without screenings for critics (I attended the only one in New York, taking place just hours before release). Inevitably, this then lowers even the most optimistic of optimist’s expectations to beneath ground level, a cursed backstory for something seemingly so awful that studio Sony would rather bury it than have anyone actually watch it. But as is often the case with such a lead-in, it’s more ho-hum than horrible, a mess but not a hugely embarrassing one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/09/65-review-adam-driver-dinosaurs">Continue reading...</a>

Paulinho converted one for Sporting after half-time but Arsenal’s own swift riposte, delivered through Hidemasa Morita’s unlucky own goal, ensured parity. Arteta will hope for a more composed display at the Emirates next week.</p><p>He had picked six of his established Premier League starters in a selection that was consistent with the respect he has shown this competition.

<p>A new legal order in the high seas must prevent marine riches from being monopolised or privatised</p><p>In his 1968 essay <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" title="">The Tragedy of the Commons</a>, the ecologist Garrett Hardin argued that resources which do not clearly belong to anyone are likely to be overexploited, since protecting them is in no one person’s interest. That tragedy is unfolding on the high seas – the two-thirds of the ocean that lies beyond coastal states’ national jurisdiction. This is a commons, where fishing and mining have been opened to all. The result is serious damage to a vital resource that covers almost half the planet’s surface. The high seas are not entirely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/28/one-of-the-most-important-talks-no-one-has-heard-of-why-the-high-seas-treaty-matters" title="">lawless</a>. Yet only a tiny fraction of these waters are protected from exploitation, despite harbouring the world’s marine wilderness and its unique biodiversity.</p><p>Beneath the waves lies a rich prize. Many scientists think the high seas <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325384" title="">harbour</a> novel disease-fighting chemistry that might lead to new drugs. Until this month, there was no mechanism to prevent nations or companies monopolising the world’s marine genetic resources. One study in 2018 <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/deep-sea-creatures-genes-patent-genetics-marine-basf-a8386606.html" title="">pointed</a> out that BASF, which calls itself “the largest chemical producer in the world”, owned nearly half of the 13,000 patents derived from marine organisms. Mining exploration licences in the Pacific alone span an area <a href="https://twitter.com/OceanIPSO/status/1154051231708352515" title="">almost</a> as wide as the US. If deep sea extraction were permitted to go ahead, many warn, it would lead to biodiversity loss on an enormous scale.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-un-ocean-treaty-arriving-just-in-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>People once hoped the two powers could forge a better relationship. Now the best hope is stopping deterioration</p><p>Looking back, it is hard to believe that in the Obama era there were serious discussions about whether a “G2” could emerge – with the US and China coming together, never easily but earnestly, and in good faith, to tackle the world’s great problems.</p><p>The costs of mutual hostility are now greater and clearer than they were back then: the risk of global economic recession, a failure to tackle the climate crisis, and even of military conflict in the future. Yet far from strengthening, bilateral relations have nosedived. The relationship between China and the US is not only at its lowest point for years, but appears to be trapped in a downward spiral. For now Beijing, in particular, seems to be giving up on fixing it. Its support for Moscow has contributed to the deterioration, but is also driven by its belief that the partnership helps to buttress it against US hostility. How and when the war in Ukraine ends could prove critical for US-China relations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/09/the-guardian-view-on-china-us-relations-can-the-downwards-spiral-be-halted">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former CEO did handsomely on the back of high oil and gas prices while the windfall levy hits the small players harder</p><p>The straightforward piece of news from the energy sector on Thursday was that Ben van Beurden departed Shell at the end of last year with his pockets full. The chief executive’s pay packet for 2022 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/09/shell-chief-ben-van-beurden-pay-2022">rose 53% to a whisker under £10m</a>, the most he’s scooped since his bumper £17.8m in 2018.</p><p>As then, the biggest boost to his winnings came via his long-term incentive scheme (LTIP), which in large part is a function of the share price, which itself is heavily influenced by the wholesale prices of oil and gas. Energy prices were already rising thanks to the industry’s underproduction during the pandemic, and then surged after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Result: already well-paid executives got even more than they could reasonably have expected.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/mar/09/shell-ben-van-beurden-gets-lucky-harbour-energy-doesnt">Continue reading...</a>

I believe this to be deceitful, and I speak from personal experience. With the exception of the successful Homes for Ukraine scheme, it is virtually impossible to claim asylum through official channels. I have a good friend who is Afghan and who was blinded by the Taliban while working for the British forces. Because of his association with the British, his family are in hiding. We have been applying for 18 months for them to be relocated to this country under the Afghanistan scheme.</p><p>In contrast, we have had a Ukrainian woman living with us for the last six months. It took a mere 12 hours for her visa to be granted. That is great, of course, but what about all the other poor souls? I have absolutely no faith in the UK’s asylum system.

<p>The ensemble is lauded across the classical world. The BBC Singers inspire, educate and entertain, and their closure matters to us all. Here is why</p><p>I won’t let this one go. My professional home for more than 13 years, where I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/01/brindley-sherratt-singing-advice-opera-bass-der-rosenkavalier">learned my craft</a>, where I learned to just turn up on time, sit down and do my job,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/07/bbc-singers-choir-to-close-as-part-of-corporations-major-review-of-classical-music"> is to be axed</a> in favour of something newer, shinier, more “agile” and slightly cheaper.</p><p>The BBC has decided to abolish what the composer Pierre Boulez once called the “jewel in its crown”: the BBC Singers. I joined this illustrious group fresh out of college. The audition was rigorous and the competition was intimidating, so I was delighted to make the cut. I was cocky and could already sing and sight-read pretty well but nothing could have prepared me for the level of musicianship of my new colleagues or the speed at which they could rattle through the most fiendish composition at sight and go on to record, broadcast or perform it two days later. I spent the first 18 months singing a split second behind my seasoned chums, and trying to not sing in the rests. This was fast, powerful, beautiful choral singing and professional musicianship on another level. It still is today.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/09/axing-bbc-singers-vandalism-comment-brindley-sherratt">Continue reading...</a>

They’re not even FFs, although they have been known to effing eff at one another on the touchline. In January 2018, while Manchester City were charging towards the title at record speed, Conte and Mourinho passed the time by slinging thinly-disguised abuse back and forth via the medium of press conferences. The insults included “clown”, “fake” and “demenza senile”, and the whole thing peaked when Mourinho, reaching a heroic level of gratuitous pettiness, referenced Conte’s historical ban for failing to report match-fixing. “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/05/antonio-conte-jose-mourinho-chelsea-manchester-united">Did he? Not me.</a>” In other news, both were sacked before the end of the year. And while they’d never admit it, like many enemies they have plenty in common. They’re winners, for one thing, but heaven help the rest of the world when they realise they’re fighting a losing battle. That’s where another shared quality comes in; when it comes to conscientious, passive-aggressive pursuit of the sack, Conte and Mourinho are world leaders.</p><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our daily football email … Football Daily.

<p>The retained EU law bill is an outrageously undemocratic attempt to transfer law-making powers from parliament to Whitehall</p><p>The House of Lords may be doomed, so reformers say, but it has a last chance to redeem itself. It is currently being asked to approve a Boris Johnson legacy, the <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3340">retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill</a>. This bill is so outrageously undemocratic that it would have been flushed down the loo by any parliament before the gutless one that Johnson ushered in after the 2019 election. It blandly states that some 3,000 to 4,000 statutes passed by parliament over half a century of Britain’s EU membership must now be rewritten by ministers, not parliament, or they will lapse at “sunset” on 31 December this year.</p><p>This is astonishing. At the time of Brexit, it was agreed that, in general, regulatory harmonisation with the EU would remain for the time being so that trade could continue.

Production began in 2002. The last scenes were shot in summer 2013. Since then, we have grown older while the film has stayed the same. “I haven’t talked about Boyhood in years,” Linklater says, laughing, as if he is recalling an old high-school buddy or the one who got away.</p><p>Now, Boyhood is back in the form of a commemorative Blu-ray, nine years after its theatrical release. It’s good to see it returned and enshrined, although I prefer to imagine it’s still out there somewhere, living and breathing and remaking itself on screen. The director describes it as a life project, a time sculpture – weathered by the years and showing how people change. It’s strange, he admits, that the characters in his movie aren’t changing any more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/09/richard-linklater-boyhood-80s-before-midnight">Continue reading...</a>

It feels especially surreal for me. When I was growing up, Barbie offered a narrow ideal of beauty: she was thin and blonde, with straight hair and blue eyes, and she didn’t look a bit like me. But times have changed. I’ve been lucky enough to receive a number of awards in my career, but I think having a Barbie role model made in my image may be one of<strong> </strong>the most important.</p><p>It’s funny how you don’t realise that you’ve been missing something until you see it in the flesh. Today, I play with Barbies with my 12-year-old daughter. Over the years, we have been able to collect dolls with curly hair like hers, and dolls that look like me, too. Now, she has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-64867924">the ultimate Barbie</a> that truly captures my likeness: she’s wearing big gold earrings and has her hair in twists – and, best of all, she comes with her own realistic telescope.

Or it may just as well be because you were living under it. Because the 1988 Local Government Act essentially decreed that councils and schools kept silent on homosexuality and enshrined in law a refusal to acknowledge gay and lesbian existence as normal.</p><p>This fizzing, fiery musical tells the story of that legislation and how its effect brought shame, secrecy, loneliness, trauma and abuse on those growing up gay under it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/09/after-the-act-review-thatcher-section-28-musical">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Growing numbers of environmentalists in northern Europe are embracing technology to combat the climate crisis, but in Britain ‘ecomodernist’ ideas have had a so-far frosty reception</p><p>On 21 May 2022, after hours of impassioned debate, members of Finland’s Green party voted to make theirs the first in the world to back nuclear power. Greens in Finland would now campaign not only for the lifespan of current reactors to be extended but also for new plants, with the technology recognised by their manifesto as “sustainable energy”.</p><p>It was a decision that upended decades of environmentalist orthodoxy – by campaigners who, in many cases, cut their teeth in opposition to nuclear.

<p>California’s monumental desert sculpture jamboree, which features billboards of photos taken by Tyre Nichols, is questioning water use and the climate crisis. What a shame it requires so much driving</p><p>A mountain-shaped cage of yellow metal mesh stands in the desert near Palm Springs, California, looking like a sinister border detention pen. Herds of people mill around inside, as if trying to find their way out of the tortuous enclosure, squeezing their bodies through the narrow passages of this wiry labyrinth as the midday sun beats down. One intrepid figure finally breaks free and begins teetering across the sand in snakeskin heels, back towards the minibus. These are not immigrants trapped in a Trumpian processing centre, but art world luminaries, here to sample the latest edition of the biennial outdoor sculpture jamboree, <a href="https://desertx.org/">Desert X</a>.<br /><br />The chainlink ziggurat is the work of the British-Bangladeshi artist Rana Begum, whose ethereal installations of crumpled metal mesh more often <a href="https://www.pitzhanger.org.uk/whatson/rana-begum-dappled-light/">evoke innocuous pastel clouds</a>. Here, she has taken inspiration from the ubiquitous fencing material of the American landscape, used to enclose everything from suburban front yards to high-security military compounds, and crafted something altogether more unnerving. It feels like a monument to the settler urge to enclose the pristine desert landscape, an endless fence twisted into a disorienting spiral, waiting to confound all who enter.</p><p>This is one of the more powerful of this year’s 11 projects, which are scattered across the sprawling landscape around Palm Springs, two hours’ drive east of Los Angeles. The desert region is an unreal fantasyland of golf courses, gated communities and country clubs, a sprinklered mirage of sun-kissed leisure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/29/two-pools-13-bathrooms-and-300-for-dinner-the-modernist-fun-palaces-of-palm-springs">rising improbably from the parched sands</a>. As an urban phenomenon, it is itself a miraculous work of land art, a paean of man’s determination to bring manicured lawns and swimming pools to the most extreme and environmentally inappropriate contexts.<br /><br />Founded in 2017, Desert X is an attempt to inject some culture into the area, giving people something to do in between sipping Mai Tais by the pool. It is strategically positioned in the calendar between Modernism Week and the Coachella music festival, and aims to appeal to visitors from both, as well as to locals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/09/desert-x-review-california-tyre-nichols-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This week the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, promised to ‘stop the boats’ and announced a new hardline stance on immigration. This familiar language shapes familiar policy. The inability to seek asylum, forcible boat turnbacks, offshore and indefinite detention led to an immeasurable human toll in Australia.

<p>With its revenge-on-an-ex lyrics and Europop backing, the UK offers a standardised, slightly naff song after the glam-rock belting of Sam Ryder last year</p><p>For decades, Britain’s behaviour towards the Eurovision song contest followed a reliably set pattern. First, it involved behaving as though the nation was somehow above the whole thing, disdainfully entering any old rubbish: TV talent show runners-up, manufactured pop bands years past their sell-by date, songs so unmemorable it seemed a miracle the benighted souls charged with singing them didn’t just forget what they were doing midway through the performance and distractedly wander offstage. Then, when the other countries failed to behave accordingly – awarding us <em>deux points</em> or ignoring us altogether, as if they somehow weren’t grateful for our weary magnanimity – we got angry about it: muttering about conspiracies and block voting, digging up ancient enmities as proof positive we weren’t being treated fairly.</p><p>Then last year, things went dramatically off-piste: we entered a decent song. Whatever you made of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/19/cool-is-the-enemy-eurovision-hero-sam-ryder-on-how-he-ditched-his-ego-and-found-his-joy">Space Man and its ebullient vocalist Sam Ryder</a>, its vaguely glam-inspired, Elton/Bowie-invoking balladry was clearly a vast improvement on the stuff we’d previously inflicted on our European neighbours. You could tell by the fact that the British public actually went out and bought it. Based on purchases rather than streams, it was the third-biggest single of 2022 – as opposed to, say, Joe and Jake’s 2016 entry You’re Not Alone, which got to No 81 in the charts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/09/mae-muller-i-wrote-a-song-review-uk-eurovision-entry-alexis-petridis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Potter’s 1992 adaptation of Virginia Woolf’s book remains trance-inducingly strange, stuffed full of style and stars</p><p>After 31 years, Sally Potter’s Orlando is re-released, a dreamy, swoony reverie of shapeshifting sexual identity; “gender” isn’t the word used. It is the film that confirmed Tilda Swinton in the arthouse-icon status that Derek Jarman had given her (Hollywood prestige was to come eight years later, in Danny Boyle’s The Beach). The movie concludes with a rapturous closeup on Swinton’s face: sublime, seraphic, enigmatic, while Jimmy Somerville serenades her from heaven, a cheeky falsetto cherub fluttering in the sky.</p><p>Potter adapted the 1928 novel by Virginia Woolf, a fantasy adventure inspired by her love affair with Vita Sackville-West; it was also inspired by Woolf’s slightly snobbish reverence for Sackville-West’s centuries-spanning aristocratic genealogy, and by their deliciously exciting patrician-bohemian disregard for bourgeois hetero-normality. With this film, Potter single-handedly upgraded this book from mere <em>jeu d’ésprit</em>, giving it literary canonical status and making it a key text for gender studies. She also established a tradition of casting a female actor rather than a male in the lead in future adaptations – although <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/05/orlando-review-emma-corrin-garrick-theatre-virginia-woolf">Emma Corrin, starring in the recent</a> London West End stage revival, is non-binary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/09/orlando-review-tilda-swinton-is-magnetic-in-sally-potters-swoony-reverie">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Fueled by Ramen)<br /></strong>The Florida trio have funny and relatable lines, so it’s a shame that their songs aren’t distinct enough to give them impact</p><p>Gen Z has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/23/there-are-no-rules-now-how-gen-z-reinvented-pop-punk">spearheaded a resurgence in pop-punk</a> – one of the many periodic moments in the sun the sub-genre has enjoyed since its late-70s birth, somewhere between the release of the first Ramones album and Pete Shelley becoming lead singer of Buzzcocks.

Their debut album, Past//Present//Future, features scratching effects on opener Say It (To My Face) and a tendency, during faster songs, to drop into half-speed tempos that carry nu-metal’s lumbering gait. The band clearly grew up during pop-punk’s early-00s Disneyfication, an era that saw Lindsay Lohan’s character in the 2003 remake of Freaky Friday front a band called Pink Slip. Meet Me @ the Altar picked John Fields as Past Present Future’s producer specifically because he’d worked with the Jonas Brothers, whose early albums stretched the definition of pop-punk to the point where “punk” became a very moot descriptor indeed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/09/meet-me-at-the-altar-past-present-future-review-pop-punk">Continue reading...</a>

Litton Das meanwhile shrugged off the horrors of his recent ODI series (three innings, two ducks, seven runs) to just about keep pace. The first three overs went for 10, 11 and 11 again, at which point Buttler gave the ball to Adil Rashid, so often England’s white-ball salvation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/09/bangladesh-cruise-to-t20-victory-over-england-with-thrilling-batting-display-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Eventim Apollo, London<br /></strong>The slippery singer-songwriter remains bewitching, as sprightly brass-tinged arrangements deepen his songs’ darkness and brighten their romance</p><p>Father John Misty’s gospel, if the slippery singer-songwriter had one, would be comically uninspiring. Love transforms you, but not much. Progress comes, not for long. When the times call for great social responsibility, such defeatism might sound convenient, but the indie-rock playboy born Josh Tillman takes cynicism all the way to the pulpit. He has faith in his non-belief, and summons you along with him.</p><p>A sold-out Eventim Apollo follows this dubious commentator into the dark. Tillman strides out in a trim suit and black shoes so sleekly polished they seem to reflect nonexistent chandeliers. He opens with a bleakly beguiling synth ballad (The Next 20th Century), before spending nearly two hours juggling screeds of social calamity with odes to romantic joy. He patrols the stage, taunting a spotlight’s cusp. Then his hips loosen. He primps for the front row, drops to his knees and theatrically pricks the air, cuing a cymbal crash.

The Hanover State Opera’s ballet director Marco Goecke confronted the Frankfurter Allgemeine ballet critic Wiebke Hüster in the theatre foyer and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/16/hanover-state-opera-ends-contract-marco-goecke-ballet-director-dog-faeces-incident">smeared dog excrement in her face</a>.

It’s devastating.”</p><p>Sure. Many critics are as innocent as children about the effect their negative writing has on the people involved, just as they do not dare to dream that these mythologised stars are actually reading their good reviews – that these A-listers, so far above them in the media firmament, might, for a fraction of a moment, know who they are. My own view is that the people who owe critics the most are the ones who hate them the most. Hollywood blockbuster players, whose career self-worth has nothing to do with broadsheet-press school reports, shrug at bad notices.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/09/good-film-reviews-bad-ones-seth-rogen">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Shakespeare North Playhouse, Prescot<br /></strong>This cartoonish update of Shakespeare’s reunion tale, gleefully mixing in Madonna and modern language, has a great sense of fun</p><p>The Wars of the Roses are back. Trade between Lancashire and Yorkshire comes at a punishing price. Regional loyalty is high. Make the wrong choice between an eccles cake and some parkin and you could meet a sorry end. For no compelling reason, it is also the 1980s, but best not to ask too many questions of this larky Shakespeare rewrite – it is hardly as if the playwright took his comedy too seriously.</p><p>Taking its cue from Isobel McArthur’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/01/pride-and-prejudice-sort-of-review-tron-jane-austen-karaoke">Pride and Prejudice* (*sort of)</a>, which gave an irreverent pop-culture spin to Jane Austen, this version of Shakespeare’s early comedy of confusion mixes in modern language and hit songs to play to the spirit if not to the letter of the original. As director Paul Robinson says in his programme note, “English is the only language that you can’t translate Shakespeare into,” which means it takes guts – or at least a degree of cheek – to set this 400-year-old play in the language of today.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/09/the-comedy-of-errors-more-or-less-review-prescot-shakespeare">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The British actor is up for best actress at the Oscars this Sunday for her role in To Leslie. But how does that compare with her other key turns?</p><p>There’s a fascination in seeing an actor of Andrea Riseborough’s class cast as the straight woman in a wacky comedy but she deadpans it out with style. Richard Thorncroft, played by Julian Barratt, is a washed-up actor who in the 80s played a cop with a mind-reading bionic eye called Mindhorn. Now in the present day, a crazed serial killer who thinks Mindhorn is real demands to negotiate with him, and so Thorncroft gets back into character – and all this to the exasperation of the real investigating officer played by Riseborough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/09/andrea-riseboroughs-10-best-performances-ranked">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Playhouse, Sheffield<br /></strong>A strong cast and plenty of physicality bolster Eve Leigh’s hour-long, plane-set takedown of climate-crisis apathy</p><p>As we arrive, so do the actors. On stage, passengers gradually take their seats for a flight. Their actions are not dissimilar to ours as they fiddle on phones or glance around. But you’d be advised to buckle up, too, for Eve Leigh’s turbulent hijacking drama, which nosedives into collective responsibility for the climate emergency.</p><p>A steady flow of theatregoers becoming one audience and a gaggle of characters assembling a cast: Leigh is interested in how individual lives are subsumed into group behaviour and how the actions of one country can affect another. This is a playwright, too, who is refreshingly interested in bodies as well as words and Laura Keefe’s highly physical production, with movement direction by Carl Harrison, uses a choreography of collectivity. The flight attendant’s safety demonstration builds into a larky chorus line, there is a flash mob of headbanging to Rage Against the Machine and terror grips the passengers, so that they contort as one panicked mass.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/events/wildfire-road">the Playhouse, Sheffield</a>, until 18 March</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/09/wildfire-road-review-playhouse-sheffield">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Ovo Hydro, Glasgow</strong><br />Theatrical, emotional, hilarious, the full range of a multi-hyphenate talent is on show tonight – no wonder she has changed the face of pop</p><p>Lizzo treats every song like it’s a grand finale. Opening her first UK tour since 2019, she bursts on stage in a sequinned nude illusion catsuit, poker-straight blond hair cascading down her back. After high-kicking through The Sign, the cheeky opener to 2022’s Grammy-nominated album <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/15/lizzo-special-review">Special</a>, she storms through 2 Be Loved (Am I Ready), a synth-pop powerhouse packed with hand claps and key changes and a euphoric call-and-response chorus. Four neon-clad dancers arrive (then eight, then 10!) and Lizzo conducts them like a ringleader from atop glamorously curved, glowing risers. Even the highest tiers of the arena are dancing in the aisles, and when the song is over Lizzo holds both fists in the air like she’s just won gold. It feels overwhelmingly triumphant – and there’s still two hours left on the clock.</p><p>A true multi-hyphenate, Melissa Jefferson is a rapper-singer-songwriter-dancer-flautist-CEO. Over a decade she’s metamorphosed from being a leftfield rapper in Minneapolis to being a globally adored superstar who has changed the face of pop. But even with four Grammys on the mantelpiece, there’s no trace of complacency: tonight’s show is relentlessly aerobic, theatrical, emotional, hilarious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/09/lizzo-review-a-euphoric-display-of-true-superstardom">Continue reading...</a>

## The election-denying Republicans who aided Trump’s ‘big lie’ and got promoted

<p>In 2022, many Republicans who embraced election denialism were re-elected and, in some cases, elevated to higher office</p><p>Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election brought the US to the brink of a democratic crisis. Refusing to concede his loss to Joe Biden, he attempted to use every lever available to try and throw out the results of the election, pressuring state lawmakers, Congress and the courts to declare him the winner.</p><p>Those efforts didn’t succeed. But Trump nonetheless created a new poison that seeped deep in the Republican party – a belief that the results of US elections cannot be trusted. The belief quickly became Republican orthodoxy: it was embraced by Republican officeholders across the country as well as local activists who began to bombard and harass local election officials, forcing many of them to retire. The January 6 attack on the US Capitol – in which thousands stormed the building, and five people died – was the starkest reminder of the potential violent consequences of this rhetoric.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/09/trump-big-lie-2020-election-republican-supporters-congress">Continue reading...</a>

Bands who sang of passion, rage, anxiety and dislocation found they were right in the middle of an undreamt-of new zeitgeist; knocked sideways by the attack on the World Trade Center, they found themselves part of an exodus away from Manhattan to then down-at-heel Brooklyn, so kicking off the gentrification and hipsterfication of that borough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/09/meet-me-in-the-bathroom-review-pouting-pomp-from-new-yorks-indie-rockers">Continue reading...</a>

But anti-abortion advocates had other plans.</p><p>Hagstrom Miller was considering purchasing a building in the border town of Hobbs when, last November, the city passed an ordinance banning abortion and declaring itself “a sanctuary city for the unborn”. Earlier this year, the towns of Clovis and Eunice followed suit, as did the counties of Roosevelt and Lea. Hagstrom Miller and her team decided instead to open their new clinic in Albuquerque, a more progressive city about 200 miles from the Texas border, where they hope providers and patients will feel more welcomed.

<p>The cast is inconsistent, the satire is shallow and the twists are laughable – but somehow this hottest of televisual messes is impossible to resist</p><p>In a 2014 episode of the US sitcom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/apr/10/community-sitcom-classy">Community</a>, a character named Abed is driven round the bend by his quest to determine whether Nicolas Cage is “good or bad”.

<p>Latest updates: Bridget Phillipson, shadow education secretary, says Labour will overhaul childcare system as reports show high costs and lack of availability</p><p>Good morning. One of the arguments being used by the Tories against Labour in recent days is that Keir Starmer did not make stopping small boats one of his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/23/keir-starmer-labour-already-planning-second-term-in-government">top five priorities</a> (or “missions”). It’s true; he didn’t. But Starmer has included childcare in his five missions (it is part of breaking down the barriers to opportunity), and this topic, which does not feature on Rishi Sunak’s list of five pledges, is top of the news agenda today.</p><p>There are two reports out essentially saying the same thing; provision in England is dreadful.</p><p>The median pre-tax cost of an hour of childcare in England is just under a third of the average hourly wage. <strong>London</strong> is England’s affordability blackspot where an hour of childcare in some London boroughs costs nearly half the average hourly wage. Pressure from the cost of childcare is not restricted to London, however. An hour of childcare in <strong>Manchester</strong>, <strong>Leicester</strong> and <strong>Herefordshire</strong> costs significantly less than an hour of childcare in London, but the median wage is also lower. As a result, childcare in these areas is as expensive relative to income as some of the most affluent parts of the capital.</p><p>The childcare model the Conservatives have built fails everyone, denying parents the ability to work the jobs they’d like, to give their children the opportunities they’d like, and is not of the quality that staff want to provide.</p><p>In the Britain the Conservatives will leave behind, tweaking the system we have will not deliver the ambition or scale of reform we are going to need.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/mar/09/labour-keir-starmer-childcare-free-hours-rishi-sunak-election-pledges-conservatives-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>

Despite these unusual credentials, Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom runs on pretty familiar, even traditional lines, although its likability and humour – and almost childlike faith in the power of singing to overcome melancholy and adversity – means you’ll find yourself smiling along.</p><p>Ugyen (Sherab Dorji) is a young man in the Bhutanese capital, Thimphu; since his parents’ death, he lives with his formidable grandmother who is exasperated at his aimlessness and shiftlessness. He is four years into a five-year teacher training course, but only wants to hang out with his girlfriend and other friends, and nurtures a dream to go out to Australia and make it as a singer. But a stern government official informs him that he must do a season teaching at the village school of Lunana in the country’s mountainous north-west. It’s the most remote school anywhere in the world, she tells him, with lipsmacking satisfaction. Ugyen whines that he has an “altitude problem”. More like an attitude problem, snaps the official.

<p>From Tolkien to Marvel – the huge influence of Norse myths on modern culture </p><p>In the lands of the north, where the black rocks stand guard against the cold sea, in the dark night that is very long, the men of the Northlands sit by their great log fires and they tell a tale … ” So began each episode of the 1950s and 1960s children’s TV programme The Saga of Noggin the Nog – one of countless iterations of old Norse myths that have filtered down to us, from the early 13th-century versions written down by the Icelandic scholar Snorri Sturluson all the way to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, via Jacob Grimm, Richard Wagner, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/jrrtolkien" title="">JRR Tolkien</a>, Narnia, video games and death metal.</p><p>Greek myths may be having a moment in modern fiction, but The Norse Myths That Shape the Way We Think reminds us that Thor, Asgard, Valhalla and the Valkyries are as much a part of western literature and legend as are Athena and Achilles. As a professor of medieval European literature at the University of Oxford and a translator of Snorri’s texts, author Carolyne Larrington is an expert guide to the origins of the stories and an opinionated interpreter of their modern descendants. She explains how an incorrect translation of “drinking horns”, via Latin, resulted in the “madly impractical” idea that Vikings drank mead from their enemies’ skulls, and fulminates about HBO’s decision to have the villainous Euron Greyjoy slay a dragon in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/game-of-thrones-episode-by-episode" title="">Game of Thrones</a>: “An outrageously subversive recasting of the greatest of heroic achievements.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/09/the-norse-myths-that-shape-the-way-we-think-by-carolyne-larrington-review-thor-blimey">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Before Manchester United tie the striker discusses football’s social responsibility, admiration for Rashford and dealing with anxiety</p><p>The lights are out and everyone’s gone, even the kit man whose job it is to pack away and lock up. Well, <em>almost</em> everyone. Borja Iglesias is still at the Benito Villamarín, ice on his knee, bandage on his wrist, in his training kit. The teammate waiting to go to dinner has left – sorry, Andrés – and the entrance is locked but he’s inside talking about, well, everything really. The goal that brought <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/24/real-betis-valencia-copa-del-rey-final-match-report">Real Betis’s first trophy in 17 years</a> and how it’s good getting kicked, pressure, popularity and being called the Panda, plus painting his nails and why more footballers should speak out.</p><p>There’s a lot to say. Fond of his Leica and rolls of 35mm film, when Iglesias finally heads towards an empty, silent dressing room where only his stuff remains, he pauses to ask the photographer whether they can go and take pictures together. “Just not this week; this week’s busy,” he says. “I’m going to Old Trafford.” And with that, he cracks up again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/09/real-betis-borja-iglesias-interview-manchester-united-europa-league">Continue reading...</a>

## Cuddy by Benjamin Myers review – a visionary history

<p>An Anglo-Saxon saint speaks down the centuries in a sensational piece of storytelling about Britain’s past and present</p><p>Cuddy is the affectionate name for Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (c634-687), a shepherd boy born in the Border country who rose to become prior of Melrose Abbey and who ended his life as a hermit on a tiny, inhospitable island off the coast of Northumbria. Cuthbert is one of Britain’s most popular saints, widely venerated for his affinity with animals, his sympathy for ordinary working people and his association with the landscapes and holy places of the north of England. At the time he died, Christianity was a relatively new religion in Britain. Following his interment on Lindisfarne, Cuthbert’s remains were removed to the mainland in order to prevent their desecration by invading Danes. Loyal monks and shifting bands of followers conveyed Cuthbert’s coffin to Chester-le-Street, where it remained until 995, when Viking invaders again made it necessary to move it to safety. It is on the final leg of this journey that Benjamin Myers’s novel opens, with the great cathedral, founded in Cuthbert’s honour in 1093 at what will later be Durham, still nothing but a holy vision of his most fervent disciples.</p><p>Cuddy is divided into four parts, with an additional prologue and interlude. In order to fully disentangle the mostly factual from the possibly fictional, you would need to immerse yourself in the surfeit of sources liberally quoted by Myers in his construction of this literary edifice. You may well be inspired to do so, if only to prolong your acquaintanceship with its landscapes and people; but you might equally embark on this journey as I did, knowing next to nothing about the titular figure, and find yourself swept along on a tide of pure literary sensation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/09/cuddy-by-benjamin-myers-review-a-visionary-history">Continue reading...</a>

## Why Amazon’s Daisy Jones and the Six is missing that star quality

<p>An ambitious adaptation of Taylor Jenkins Reid’s hit novel tries to involve us in a  tale of stardom but something is off</p><p>There’s a moment about halfway through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/03/daisy-jones-the-six-review-not-even-elviss-grandkid-can-save-this-70s-rocknroll-saga">Daisy Jones &amp; the Six</a>, Amazon’s sprawling adaptation of Taylor Jenkins Reid’s bestselling book, in which the show achieves the emotional jolt it so often mimes. It’s the mid-1970s, and the Six, a combustible rock band loosely inspired by Fleetwood Mac, are performing at a music festival in Hawaii; Daisy Jones (Riley Keough), the ethereal Stevie Nicksian singer-songwriter who helped deliver the band’s first hit, is supposed to join them four songs in. But she jumps the gun, traipsing on stage after the opener on pills and a swig of whiskey, much to the chagrin of territorial frontman Billy Dunne (Sam Claflin).</p><p>It’s a rare unpredictable scene in a show rife with rock’n’roll cliches and 70s facsimiles. The ensuing rendition of Look at Us Now (Honeycomb), a clear homage to Fleetwood’s The Chain that did get stuck in my head for several days, was palpably stressful, in the way that people being chaotic and potentially embarrassing in front of other people makes me immediately reach for the pause button. There’s a shiver of excitement – not for the music, which is just fine, nor for the first “performance” of Daisy Jones &amp; the Six, which plays out as you’d expect (serviceable to us, catnip to the fans) and which band members promptly tell us was special, but for a fleeting glimpse of the mercurial, magnetic, destabilizing thing that is star power.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/09/amazon-daisy-jones-and-the-six-missing-review-tv-show">Continue reading...</a>

There’s a Pride flag hung on a picnic bench, where a cluster of people have gathered. The location is appropriate: this West Yorkshire town is sometimes referred to as “the lesbian capital of the UK”. The 2021 census, meanwhile, cemented Hebden Bridge’s status as a rural hub for the LGBTQ+ community more generally: it <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/identity/sexual-orientation/sexual-orientation-4a/lesbian-gay-bisexual-or-other-lgb?msoa=E02002247">revealed</a> that 9% of its residents are lesbian, gay or bisexual – around three times the national average.</p><p>From the off, the atmosphere is friendly. I’m greeted by Ben Beckwith, who is leading today’s seven-and-a-half-mile route up Stoodley Pike, a 400-metre hill in the south Pennines. After introductions, we set off in overcast weather, with Beckwith setting a gentle pace along the canal path. There are almost 30 of us; some have come with friends while others are here to meet new people in the LGBTQ+ community.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/mar/09/pennines-trail-walking-collective-queer-out-here-lgbtq">Continue reading...</a>

A riveting piece, which you doubtless remember. It was on Gower, during a long walk, when a knackered old stile by a patch of wild garlic<strong> </strong>proved no match for my bulk. I still sport the scar. Two years on from this unhappy incident I was stopped while out shopping in Sketty, a suburb of Swansea. This nice woman told me that her husband, being in charge of paths for Swansea council, had read the piece, worked out where the now-destroyed stile was, and got it fixed.</p><p>I expressed my gratitude, but my first, thrilling thought was this: there is a head of paths? That’s an actual thing? How wonderful. I want that job. I want to get up every morning, sift through reports of poor signage, overgrown-ness and death-trap stiles, consult my maps and then go out and rectify. I believe <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2020/jul/30/my-idea-of-happiness-a-strimmer-and-a-bramble-choked-path">I have also written about an encounter with some path-clearers</a>. I’m serious about this. I left the woman my number for the path man to call me so we could talk for hours, but he didn’t. If he was worried I’d want his job off him, he was on the right, well, track.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/09/dream-job-countryside-walkers-stiles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new operating model for the global economy is upon us – its success will depend on how policymakers adapt </p><p>For three decades, businesses and governments around the world operated under the assumption that economic and financial globalisation will continue apace. As the international order has come under strain in recent years, however, the concept of deglobalisation – the delinking of trade and investment – has increasingly gained traction with households, companies, and governments. But the available data suggest that globalisation is not ending so much as it is changing.</p><p>Not too long ago, it seemed that there were no limits to global economic and financial integration. For decades, globalisation’s benefits appeared to be obvious and unassailable. The interconnectedness of production, consumption, and investment flows provided consumers with a wider range of choices at attractive prices, enabled companies to expand their markets, and improved the efficiency of their supply chains. Global capital markets expanded access to credit and lowered its cost for private and public borrowers alike. The world’s governments engaged in what seemed to be a series of win-win partnerships. And technology – including, most recently, the accelerating shift toward remote work – made national borders seem largely irrelevant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/09/from-near-shoring-to-friend-shoring-the-changing-face-of-globalisation">Continue reading...</a>

But as my daughter grows older, I have come to see our relationship in a different light</p><p>For a short time in 2020, when my daughter, Elena, was four, we lived in France.

I propped her up on a counter and read her the French menu items, as she giggled into my shoulder. “Mummy, the French are so funny!” A few weeks later, we ran into a boy from her school. He said “<em>Coucou</em>, Elena!” She waved coolly at him, then grinned at me. “Isn’t that so funny?”</p><p>Her secret laughter reminded me of my first glimpse of family life in the west. I was nine and we had just escaped from Iran, because my mother was a Christian convert – an apostate. My mother, brother and I had been living in undocumented limbo in Dubai, and when the migrant hostel closed without notice we were taken in by a family of Australian missionaries. On our first night in their house, we three retreated to our room and giggled as we dissected their routines. We were grateful to have a comfortable room and a bed, but the family seemed so strange to us. There was also a thrill in scrutinising the habits of white people; we didn’t often get the chance. My mother’s eyes went wide when dinner arrived: plates of cold cuts, cold vegetables and leftovers. Each night, their son Nathan, a boy my age, got his private time, then official tuck-in with each parent, a bizarre ritual.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/mar/09/foreign-mothers-foreign-tongues-in-another-universe-she-could-have-been-my-friend">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three families share their struggles with finding and affording nursery places and childminders</p><p>“Before I even went to my first scan, my unborn baby’s name was down on a nursery waiting list,” says Laura Williams, 31. This was her second child and it had taken months to find a nursery spot for her first daughter, forcing her to take time off work. She had put in a request at five months pregnant but the waiting list had been a year long. “That’s crazy, seeing as a pregnancy is only nine months,” she says.</p><p>It’s a story that is playing out across England. A shortage of childcare places coupled with the huge costs of nurseries means women are questioning whether they should go back to work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/mar/09/its-cheaper-to-not-work-childcare-shortage-in-england-puts-strain-on-parents">Continue reading...</a>

The fourth ball from Shami starts wide, Khawaja gives it a wider berth and ended up being the widest wide of the series, piercing first and second slip and running away to the third man boundary. Khawaja takes a four of his own from the fifth, edging through the cordon. Lively start!</p><p>Time for the anthems… ‘Advance Australia Fair’ first.

<p>Bakhmut could fall in next few days, says Nato chief; Zelenskiy invites Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>The city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s east, could fall in the next few days, said Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. </strong>“What we see is that Russia is throwing more troops, more forces and what Russia lacks in quality they try to make up in quantity. They have suffered big losses, but at the same time, we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,” he said.</p><p><strong>The founder of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin,</strong> which has been leading the Russian assault on Bakhmut, has said Russian forces now fully control the east of the city. The claims have not been independently verified. The General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in its Wednesday morning report: “The enemy, despite significant losses, continues to storm the town of Bakhmut.”</p><p><strong>Russia is unlikely to capture significantly more territory this year, according to the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. </strong>She told a Senate hearing that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/russia-ukraine-us-intelligence-chief-avril-haines">the military will probably be unable to carry on its current level of fighting</a>, even with the possible capture of Bakhmut.</p><p><strong>The Pentagon has been accused of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/pentagon-international-criminal-court-russia-war-crimes">blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC)</a></strong> about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The defence department is said to be firmly opposed to using the Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine</strong> as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in an interview with CNN.</p><p><strong>Zelensky has also called for “democratic success” in Georgia</strong> where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/georgia-opposition-protests-tbilisi-law-parliament">thousands of protesters have rallied for a second day</a>, against a controversial “foreign agent” bill, reminiscent of Russian legislation used to silence critics. “There is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success,” he said in his evening address to the nation.</p><p><strong>The US obtained a warrant to seize a Boeing aircraft owned by Russian oil company Rosneft that is valued at over $25m,</strong> the Justice Department said. The District Court for the Eastern District of New York authorised the seizure, based on violations of export controls and sanctions against Russia, the Justice Department said.</p><p><strong>In a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, UN secretary general, António Guterres, told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> across the Black Sea be renewed,</strong> with Ukraine traditionally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/ukraine-and-un-chief-call-for-new-grain-deal-to-safeguard-global-food-supplies">being one of the world’s largest exporters of grain.</a> A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal.</p><p><strong>European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Wednesday he had suggested the bloc spend €1bn for the joint procurement of ammunition for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> and to refill their own stockpiles. </strong>“I propose to mobilise another €1bn,” Reuters reported he told the media after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Stockholm.</p><p><strong>Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said that it was still uncertain who carried out the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year, </strong>and that national investigations needed to be allowed to finish.</p><p><strong>German officials announced that they searched a ship in January</strong> that they believe many have been used to transport explosives used in the sabotage. Germany has the lead role in the investigation.</p><p><strong>Intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022,</strong> the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/nord-stream-pipeline-sabotage-ukraine.html">New York Times has reported</a>. There was no evidence President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, or his top lieutenants were involved, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials, said the report, citing US officials.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-379-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
