But as Foreign Minister <strong>[Penny] Wong</strong> said recently in a speech here in the United States, our job as friends, partners and allies of the United States, and as strategic partners with China, is to encourage both Beijing and Washington to move in the direction of a new strategic framework of managed strategic competition to build new strategic guardrails into their relationships <strong>so that we do not end up with a crisis, escalation and war by accident. That I think is a responsibility we share with all US allies around the world and partners of China</strong>.</em></p><p><em>Certainly what drives, I think, Australian strategic thinking is <strong>how do we deter our friends in China from taking premeditated military action against Taiwan</strong>, which will then be a fundamental destabilisation of the strategic status quo?</em></p><p><em>One of the reasons which Prime Minister <strong>[Anthony] Albanese</strong> explained to me why he and the foreign minister asked me to do this job is because <strong>we\u2019re all anxious about the current state of great power relations in the world</strong>. And therefore, if I can play some very small role in our own dealings with the administration in Washington in helping to provide advice on how things might be stabilised in one way or another, then I\u2019ll play that small role, but <strong>only on the basis of guidance and instructions from Canberra</strong>.

The story goes like this: last September, five men and one woman \u2013 a captain, two divers, two assistants, and a doctor \u2013 used professionally forged passports to rent a yacht from a Polish-registered company owned by two Ukrainians. The saboteurs set sail from the German city of Rostock, and made their way to two sites in international waters in the Baltic Sea.</p><p>The divers planted explosives on the Nord Stream pipelines connecting Russian natural gas supplies to western Europe. The bombs rendered three of the four conduits essential to Russia\u2019s future supply of gas inoperable.
