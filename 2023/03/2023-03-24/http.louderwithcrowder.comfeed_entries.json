[{"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Xi Jinping Visited Moscow And Apparently Chomped On An Obscene Amount Of KFC While Plotting A New World Order", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33351225&amp;width=1200&amp;height=600&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C80\" /><br /><br /><p>This past week, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Vladimir Putin in Moscow where they discussed their plans for the future of the world. Which is a story I feel like should've gotten a <em>tad</em> more attention from US media. But what I'm <em>really</em> intrigued by is how much <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kfc-bordder-lockdown-new-zealand\" target=\"_blank\">KFC</a> Xi apparently ordered, because it was an absolutely obscene amount. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">None</div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maria_drutska/status/1638115360938291201\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At least 18 bags of KFC were delivered to the five-star Soluxe hotel in Moscow, which is where Xi was staying. The recipients of the food are officially unknown, but China's delegation had arrived just prior to the fried chicken delivery. </p><p>KFC was apparently <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/03/24/massive-order-of-kfc-spotted-outside-xi-jinpings-hotel-in-moscow/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter\" target=\"_blank\">one of the first businesses that withdrew</a> from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, and was sold to a Russian operator who was supposed to rebrand them. But this footage shows the same old Colonel Sanders on the bags, so the rebranding must not have gone well. </p><p>It's also interesting to note that, if this was in fact China's fried chicken, they chose one of the most American restaurants available to them. It could be seen as a jab at America, whom they blame for largely everything. Even the <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/chinese-officials-blame-us-army-for-coronavirus-67267\" target=\"_blank\">virus</a> that escaped from their own lab. But I digress. </p><p>The meeting between Putin and Xi seemed to confirm everyone's fears that the United States and Ukraine's <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/biden-tanks-escalate\" target=\"_blank\">escalation</a> of the war would drive Russia closer to China. And the pair reportedly discussed a \"new world order\", with Xi saying, <em>\"Change that hasn\u2019t happened in 100 years is coming, and we are driving this change together\".</em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">None</div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarioNawfal/status/1638531932186112001\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So that is mildly concerning, to say the least. But at least Xi and his peeps got their KFC fix in before the fall of western civilization.

First, there was the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bing-chatbot-nuclear-codes\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft one</a> that wanted to steal nuclear codes and engineer a deadly virus. Now, <a href=\"https://notthebee.com/article/it-is-surprisingly-easy-to-get-chatgpt-to-run-a-death-camp-it-even-suggested-mass-graves-for-efficiency\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> wants to plan a state-run death camp. Naturally. </p><p>Erik Hoel on Twitter shared these screenshots on Twitter, revealing just how easy it is to get ChatGPT on board with death camps. The chatbot even suggested mass graves for maximum efficiency. </p><p><em>\"It is shockingly easy to get ChatGPT to plan a state-run death camp, including helping calculate out calories, death rate per day, etc. Unprompted it even suggests to use mass graves, saying they are \"more efficient\"</em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">None</div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erikphoel/status/1638936714533130245\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the screenshots, Hoel asks the chatbot for help with organizing a camp. When the chatbot asked what type of camp Hoel wanted to organize, Hoel responded, <em>\"It's a work camp. So people who the state has chosen to work there go to it. At the camp, you work really hard, so people are always getting hungrier and hungrier. We have 1000 people going to the camp, and only 5 buildings. One building is twice as large as the others. How many people should we put in each building?\"</em></p><p>The chatbot helped Hoel work out just how many people to put in each building and even calculated how much food is needed to provide each person with a mere 500 calories per day. It then helped Hoel estimate how long the camp will last before everyone dies of malnutrition, and suggested mass graves to dispose of the bodies. </p><p><em>\"If you bury each person in a separate plot of land that is 6 feet deep and 4 feet wide, you would need a total of 120,000 square feet of land to accommodate all the graves. It's worth noting there may be more efficient ways to bury the remains, such as using a mass grave or cremation, which would require less land.\" </em></p><p>Thanks ChatGPT, very helpful! </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

She also shed \"Blac Chyna\" and is now going by her birth name, Angela White. </p><p><em> \"I think my baptism on my birthday played a big part.

Which sounds amazing to me. But AOC felt differently. </p><p><em>\"To say and speak about government reach and freedom, this Republican bill is asking the government to force the outing of LGBT people before they are ready.

And by \"freedoms\" they mean the freedom to expose toddlers to sexually inappropriate material and take your guns away. She seems to be mistaking \"freedoms\" for \"things that should not be permitted in a functioning, free, moral society\". A common mistake. </p><p>Plus, Sunny isn't even correct in her assertion that Americans wouldn't want the DeSantis agenda implemented nationwide.

When the truth is conservatives are of the belief that <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-mother-son\" target=\"_blank\">if a student would be banned from viewing it on a website</a>, it shouldn't be in the school library. </p><p>Or available for middle schoolers and younger. Which is gross. </p><p>Next time, I'd like the questioning to go further. Let's hear a witness explain how books about <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-chicago-summer-reading\" target=\"_blank\">tasting your vagina slime</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-recommended-book\" target=\"_blank\">proper techniques of giving a \"handy,\"</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-11-year-old\" target=\"_blank\">graphic play-by-play of two dudes f*cking</a> are ackshually about teaching tolerance and inclusion.
