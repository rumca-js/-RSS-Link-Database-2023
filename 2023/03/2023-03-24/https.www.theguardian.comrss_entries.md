<p>Ecologists say some bodies of water may already have passed the tipping points from which they may never recover</p><p>As David Klee nosed his boat out into the channels of Whangamarino, he saw the birds were dying. Hundreds were already dead, floating, the sheen of their feathers dulling in the scum near the banks of the river. Others, he could tell, would be dead soon: flocks that should have been sent flapping in alarm by the boat’s passage sat placid, unmoving in the water.</p><p>Often, the bird’s legs go first, says Klee, the local game bird manager for Fish &amp; Game New Zealand. Instead of paddling, they start scooping their wings through the water to propel themselves forward, a grotesque butterfly stroke. The poison works on the extremities, attacking nerves that thread down the limbs and wingspan. Then, the muscles of the neck weaken and seize: unable to hold the weight of the head, they droop forward, slip underwater, and the birds drown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/25/like-youre-in-a-horror-movie-pollution-leaves-new-zealand-wetlands-irreversibly-damaged">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A leadership race has exposed the party’s divisions over how to pursue independence</p><p>Where the Scottish National party goes after the departure of Nicola Sturgeon matters not just to Scotland but to the whole of Britain. Ms Sturgeon has been an astonishingly successful politician. Under her guidance, the SNP has won eight elections since 2010 and stormed once impregnable Labour bastions. Yet Ms Sturgeon’s success concealed divisions within the party that have burst into view during the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/24/snp-leadership-contest-result-scotland-nicola-sturgeon" title="">leadership</a> race to replace her.

<p>Readers criticise the response of senior officers to a damning report on racism, homophobia and misogyny in the Met</p><p>Sir Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, accepts the findings of the Casey report that there are systemic failings in the force. Yet he would not use the term “institutional” because he finds it “a very ambiguous term”. He admits that “we’ve got systemic failings, management failings, cultural failings” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/21/metropolitan-police-institutionally-racist-misogynistic-homophobic-louise-casey-report" title="">Met police found to be institutionally racist, misogynistic and homophobic, 21 March</a>).</p><p>He should ponder the arguments of the great anthropologist Prof Mary Douglas in her 1986 book How Institutions Think.

One is the right of appeal to an independent tribunal. By contrast, there is no judicial oversight of decisions about work-related requirements made by work coaches; the new proposals leave claimants at the mercy of Department for Work and Pensions officials with no medical training. Another is the regulation whereby someone who does not otherwise satisfy the criteria can be exempted from work if there is a substantial risk that working would harm their health. There is no equivalent provision in the rules for personal independence payment (Pip), the disability benefit that would serve as the passport to the health-related top-up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/24/goodbye-fit-for-work-tests-but-what-comes-next-could-be-worse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Architect whose low-rise, high-density social housing offered a popular alternative to tower blocks</p><p>Not all social housing in the 1960s was about tower blocks. High-rise buildings were unpopular with tenants, lifts were costly and broke down, and the surrounding lawns were hard to maintain. Moreover, on the slopes around Hampstead Heath in London, towers would have blocked views towards St Paul’s Cathedral. This area became part of the newly created borough of Camden in 1965 and a visionary new chief architect, Sydney Cook, assembled a bright team of assistants to find an alternative form of housing. One of these young architects was Peter Tábori, who has died aged 83. The Whittington estate which he designed, originally known as Highgate New Town, exemplified a solution that was both innovative and successful.</p><p>Camden had identified an area of semi-derelict Victorian housing for redevelopment next to Highgate’s east cemetery, where Karl Marx is buried. Tábori realised that, on such a steep hillside, lines of flats and maisonettes could be stacked one above the other and entered from a common entrance at mid-level on the uphill side. Car parking could be set into the hill between these terraces and decked over with pedestrian walkways and children’s playgrounds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/24/peter-tabori-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

## Adapt and survive: why Dickens still endures on page, stage and screen

<p>The new version of Great Expectations is the BBC’s seventh, while A Christmas Carol is the most adapted English classic ever. What is it about these stories that keeps us wanting more?</p><p>What is it about Great Expectations? Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight’s new dramatisation of Dickens’s novel is the seventh BBC adaptation – the first appearing on screens in 1954. Cinema has loved it too. David Lean’s 1946 film remains the most celebrated but there were three earlier film versions and have been five more since. The 1974 adaptation starred a youngish Michael York as Pip, Dickens’s self-deluding protagonist, obsessed with the unattainable Estella; the most recent was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/29/great-expectations-review">Mike Newell’s 2012 version</a>, scripted by novelist and Dickens aficionado David Nicholls.</p><p>Dickens’s fiction has long proved irresistible to dramatisers. Armando Iannucci’s witty 2019 film, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/02/the-personal-history-of-david-copperfield-review-armano-iannucci">The Personal History of David Copperfield</a>, was the 12th major screen adaptation of that novel, yet managed to do new justice to the zaniness of its humour. A Christmas Carol, meanwhile, is the most frequently adapted literary classic in the English language, entertaining exactly because we know it so well. Largely via adaptations, both these novels have come to seem like shared national stories, in which laughter triumphs over mean-mindedness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/24/adapt-and-survive-why-dickens-still-endures-on-page-stage-and-screen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The blue camper on the cover of The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan summed up the free-spirited 60s. It was owned by a New York butcher and this is its hidden story</p><p>New York City’s Greenwich Village has always been a magnet for outsiders, artists and poets. In 1963, one of those types was Bob Dylan, a kid from Minnesota who had felt the pull of the Village and its cafes and nightclubs where young guitar players would plan their lives – alongside the old-school butcher’s shops, bakeries and other Village staples – as a new, anything-goes counterculture bubbled up.</p><p>Dylan was 21 years old when Don Hunstein, the great photographer for Columbia Records, dropped by his third-floor walkup at 161 West 4th Street one cold February day that year to shoot some pictures for The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan, his second album, which turns 60 years old in May. The cover shows the singer with then-girlfriend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/28/suze-rotolo-obituary">Suze Rotolo</a> holding tight to him arms as they walk along a snowy Jones Street just outside their apartment.

<p>Nobel prize-winning writer whose novels linked the personal and political in exploring fatherhood and the legacy of war in Japan</p><p>The Nobel prize-winning novelist and essayist Kenzaburō Ōe, who has died aged 88, made his name as a cult author for Japan’s rebellious postwar youth. His early fiction – titles such as Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids (1958), Seventeen (1961)<strong> </strong>and J (1963), peopled with juvenile delinquents, political fanatics and subway perverts – gave voice to an alienated generation who witnessed the collapse of their parents’ values with the defeat of the second world war. His wartime childhood fed a lifelong pacifism, and his scourging of resurgent militarism and consumerism. Yet his decisive rebirth as a writer came through fatherhood.</p><p>When Ōe was 28, his first child, Hikari, was born with a herniated brain protruding from his skull. Surgery risked brain damage, and doctors urged Ōe and his wife, Yukari, to let the infant die – a “disgraceful” time, he later wrote, that “no powerful detergent” could expunge. Then also working as a journalist, Ōe fled to report on a peace rally in Hiroshima. His encounters with <em>hibakusha</em> (atomic-bomb survivors) and doctors there convinced him his son must live – a moment he saw as a “conversion”. As he told me in Tokyo just after his 70th birthday – when I met him for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview9">a Guardian profile</a>– “I was trained as a writer and as a human being by the birth of my son.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/24/kenzaburo-oe-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

## The NHS can prescribe medical cannabis. So why are desperate patients forced to go private? | Kojo Koram

## Rainbow fur, £10,000 ballgowns and hounds in hats: inside LA’s canine couture show

<p>At ‘master pet couturier’ Anthony Rubio’s fashion show, humans take a back seat as all eyes are on the pampered pooches dressed to kill</p><p>Hairdryers whirr, curling irons sizzle and clouds of hairspray fill the air backstage at LA fashion week, as stylists riffle through clothes rails and make frantic adjustments to hemlines. Models are lining up to be photographed, moments before the show begins, but they all seem a little distracted. One doesn’t want to budge from their spot, another starts sniffing someone’s crotch, while a third makes a break for an open door.<br /><br />“The dogs are a lot easier than human models,” says designer <a href="https://anthonyrubiodesigns.com/">Anthony Rubio</a>, as he stitches a gold sequin on to a tiny pup-sized bedazzled jacket. “They don’t have opinions and they don’t compete with each other. They’re all about having a good time.”<br /><br />I have come to the hot, brightly-lit basement of a glitzy venue in downtown Los Angeles, for a behind the scenes look at Rubio’s 2023 Canine Couture show. It is billed as “the feelgood show of the season”, the one event in the fashion calendar “where the humans are the accessories”. After four months living in LA, I feel I may have found its true spiritual centre.<br /><br />Dogs are born with ready-to-wear fur coats, but that hasn’t stopped their owners from dressing them up further. From the simpler days of practical quilted jackets and waxed-cotton waterproofs, dog clothing and accessories has ballooned into <a href="https://artfulliving.com/inside-dog-fashion-industry">a $10bn industry</a> of designer pup ponchos, mutt-friendly miniskirts and hound-sized hats. Gucci, Celine and Hugo Boss produce luxury lines for four-legged friends, and even high-street brands such as H&amp;M now offer ranges of pooch-shaped plaid shirts and fluffy turtleneck sweaters.</p><p>But Rubio’s creations are something else entirely. As the self-styled “master pet couturier”, he was the first designer to put dogs on the catwalk at New York fashion week, crafting tailored tuxedos and bespoke ballgowns that can cost up to $10,000. It has been quite a journey for this high-school teacher of 33 years, who once studied womenswear and fell into the canine fashion world by chance.<br /><br />“Eighteen years ago, I adopted a dog that had been really beaten and abused,” says Rubio, as he fiddles with an embroidered cape backstage. “He used to shake and tremble. One day I decided to make him a jacket and it really calmed him down. Then we dressed him up as Elvis for Halloween and, before you know it, we were winning competitions all over New York. The rest is history.”<br /><br />Since then, Rubio has appeared on Good Morning America and says he has raised more than $4m for various animal rescue charities, but it’s the dogs themselves that are the real celebrities. As I mill around the room, trying not to step on fluffy tails and lacy trains, I am handed business cards and stickers from the dog owners – sorry, “pet parents” – each proud mum eager to tell me about their good boy’s list of achievements.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/24/inside-la-canine-couture-show-anthony-rubio">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Nineteen Eighty-Four’s Julia to Shakespeare’s Rosaline, the trend for a new perspective on a familiar tale is continuing apace. Authors and publishers explain what old stories tell us about today</p><p>From Circe to Medusa via Persephone, Electra and the women of Troy, it seems there are few characters from Greek mythology left who haven’t been the subject of a feminist retelling in recent years. This year, the world of such reimaginings is expanding beyond the Greeks – although there is a clutch of those retellings, too – with the publication of books about Julia from George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four (Katherine Bradley’s The Sisterhood), Rosaline from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet (Fair Rosaline by Natasha Solomons) and Morgan le Fay from Arthurian legend (Sophie Keetch’s Morgan Is My Name).</p><p>And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Looking at the number of books still to come – from Bea Fitzgerald’s Girl, Goddess, Queen to Jennifer Saint’s Atalanta – and those that have been released in the last couple of years, it seems there’s no end to these retellings. But are we close to reaching saturation point? And if a story is simply being retold, is there any creativity involved?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/24/two-sides-to-a-story-why-feminist-retellings-are-filling-our-bookshelves">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy drove audiences wild when it premiered in 2019, and is now set for an even bigger stage. Creator and cast discuss staying true to what made it so special</p><p>In 2011, when a 23-year-old Ryan Calais Cameron read Ntozake Shange’s 1976 choreopoem For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf, he was awakened to how theatre and storytelling could depart from traditional conventions. “I was like, this is incredible; I didn’t know you could create a play outside of the context of a finite structure, that was just non-linear, heartfelt, honest, raw,” he explains as we sit in the upstairs office of the Royal Court theatre in Sloane Square, central London.</p><p>While researching the theatre piece’s impact in 1970s New York, particularly on Black women, Cameron began to wonder what it might be like to have a production that spoke to the experience of young Black men. Being from south-east London, he considered the epidemic of knife crime in the early 2010s and the 2011 London riots, both of which indicated to him that there needed to be “another way to get through to us as young Black men”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/24/ryan-calais-cameron-interview-for-black-boys-who-have-considered-suicide">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall/Purcell Room, London<br /></strong>The clarinetist was utterly compelling for the premiere of Clyne’s Weathered while female composers showcased work inspired by American artists and poets</p><p></p><p>The third UK premiere of <a href="https://www.annaclyne.com/">Anna Clyne’s</a> residency as the Philharmonia’s featured composer was the rather incongruous centrepiece of a concert conducted by Pekka Kuusisto that, with works by Bellini, Tchaikovsky and Bernstein, otherwise had a Romeo-and-Juliet theme. Clyne’s Weathered, co-commissioned by the orchestra, is a clarinet concerto, a substantial five-movement work composed for <a href="https://www.harrisonparrott.com/artists/martin-frost">Martin Fröst</a>, who was the soloist. It is a superb showcase for Fröst’s spectacular virtuosity, making use of all the tricks and extended techniques that he has made his own.</p><p>As the title suggests, Weathered carries an extra-musical programme. Clyne has said that the movements relate in turn to “a rusted bridge, a broken heart, a wind-worn castle, a majestic forest and a warming planet”, but it would make perfect musical sense without any knowledge of those associations. The writing for the soloist and the orchestra is strikingly vivid and colourful, from the opening moments, with their sombre, plainchant-like references, to the end of the finale almost half an hour later when the plainchant returns to usher in the quiet, desolate close.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/24/anna-clyne-philharmonia-review-">Continue reading...</a>

## Arts-world activism saved BBC Singers. Let’s take the same fight to government cuts | James Weeks

<p>The surge of support for choral group is proof that we have the power to take a stand against savage Arts Council cutbacks</p><p>So it’s over – for now. After two weeks of unprecedented protest, the BBC has bowed to the inevitable and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/24/bbc-singers-u-turn-decision-scrap-chamber-choir-public-outcry"> suspended immediate plans to disband the BBC Singers</a>. There are caveats, though: the funding to keep them afloat has been offered by external organisations, which would be a new model entirely for a BBC ensemble and raises a number of questions. These options are only being “actively explored” – no done deals yet. And let’s not forget the orchestras, over whom the axe of redundancy still looms. But we can be cautiously optimistic. The BBC is committed to the Singers and “still plans to invest more widely in the future of choral singing across the UK”.</p><p>If this all works out then – a big if – we could be looking at a win-win for choral singing in this country. That we have got to this point is testimony to the extraordinary surge of activism over the last fortnight, uniting protest across the musical world and forging unlikely common cause across the political spectrum: when did all major newspapers – even the Spectator and the Morning Star – last agree on anything? It’s worth taking a moment to recall the breadth of opponents to the BBC’s plans: a worldwide coalition of conductors, composers, choral directors; music teachers and academics; professional, amateur and children’s choirs; most major UK music organisations and colleges; and 150k petition signatories. Nor was this opposition behind closed doors, but played out in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/22/britain-arts-institutions-cuts">furious newspaper columns</a> and most of all in the bear pits of social media, where ingenious methods of coordinating action and awareness delivered huge responses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/24/arts-world-activism-saved-the-bbc-singers-lets-take-the-same-fight-to-government-cuts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I worry that the fuss about fraudulent election claims will overshadow the real story. It’s love at fifth sight</p><p>“I was very nervous. I dreaded falling in love.” Ah, there goes newly affianced Rupert Murdoch, sounding for all the world like a widow who has previously lost her home and life savings in a romance scam to a guy falsely claiming to be an airline pilot. Dare she allow herself to open her heart again? Dare she, who has been hurt before, permit herself one last surrender to the possibility of completeness? Dare she, 15 minutes after <a href="https://www.mailplus.co.uk/showbiz/197628/exclusive-heartbroken-jerry-blames-murdoch-children-for-end-of-marriage">divorcing Jerry Hall</a> by email, clap eyes on a former dental hygienist, model, singer-songwriter, Bay area socialite and prison chaplain – and declare simply: “I want it”?</p><p>Reader, she dares. She <em>dreaded </em>falling in love, but she got back on the horse that bucked her and rode off. If not into the sunset, then certainly into the Delaware courtroom that is gearing up for a blockbuster libel trial against Rupert’s Fox News for airing false and incendiary claims that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulently stolen from Donald Trump. Murdoch <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/feb/28/rupert-murdoch-deposition-fox-news-dominion-voting-systems">recently admitted</a> he had known his hosts were endorsing lies, yet allowed them to continue.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/24/lies-fox-news-rupert-murdoch-married-election">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We lived on our nerves’: how Belfast cop show Blue Lights captured a changed Northern Ireland

<p>As the rattling police drama launches, its stars talk about the legacy of the Troubles, living with bomb blasts and gunfire – and showing the real people behind the stab vests</p><p>As we approach the 25th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/good-friday-agreement">Good Friday agreement</a>, you’ll find little on television that says as much about a changing Northern Ireland as Blue Lights. A new drama written by two local lads, ex-journalists Adam Patterson and Declan Lawn, this BBC One show focuses on a trio of new recruits to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), the peace-era force that in 2001 succeeded the militarised Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Entertaining cop-show staples – thrilling car chases, tense hostage negotiations, off-duty banter – are all present and correct, but what makes the show stand out is the way they’re set among Belfast-specific realism.</p><p>Police procedurals can be found on almost every channel every evening of the week, but most are propelled by mystery investigation plots, concerning the comparatively glamorous activities of plain-clothed detectives. Not since ITV’s The Bill aired its last in 2010 have beat coppers been front and centre. Yet unlike that predictable and usually plodding drama, Blue Lights’ story of uniformed rookies and their training officers grips from start to finish. This is partly because of the show’s textured depiction of Belfast – a place with complex, particular policing issues – and partly because the characters are so rounded and believable. The series’ emotional pay-off, when it comes, hits hard because it’s so well earned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/24/belfast-cop-show-blue-lights-changed-northern-ireland-bomb-gunfire">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Leeds Playhouse<br /></strong>Amy Leach’s production evokes a very current crop of anxieties with the castaways excellently played by a young cast</p><p>In many ways, Lord of the Flies is safe programming, certain to attract school groups. William Golding’s novel is a staple of the curriculum – a rite of passage for generations of teens. It could easily feel tired and overdone. Yet Leeds Playhouse makes a compelling case for this as a story that still has new things to say.</p><p>There’s a distinctly modern flavour to Amy Leach’s production. Without littering the stage with 21st-century signifiers, she manages to bring the piece right up to date. It has the pacy, dynamic quality that Leach excels at, right from the first beats of the opening movement sequence. We see the kids ripped from home, clutching bags of belongings, before they are thrust headlong into disaster. Their plane crash lands in what seems like a paradise, but Max Johns’ monochrome landscape of black trees and white stone is immediately foreboding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/24/lord-of-the-flies-review-leeds-playhouse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Nickleodeon star describes a dysfunctional childhood spent trying to please her narcissistic mother in this darkly comic autobiography</p><p>Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she began her career as an actor. She was talked into going to auditions by her mother, Debra, whose own acting aspirations were thwarted by her disapproving parents. “I want to give you the life I never had, Net,” Debra would tell her. “I want to give you the life I deserved.” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/sep/10/jennette-mccurdy-interview-memoir">McCurdy</a> went on to land roles in the Nickelodeon sitcom iCarly and later in Sam and Cat, alongside Ariana Grande. But her comic turns on screen masked a malaise that manifested in disordered eating and alcohol abuse. It was only later that McCurdy understood how Debra, who forced her to diet and wouldn’t allow her to shower on her own until her late teens, was not like other mothers.</p><p>Read by the author, I’m Glad My Mom Died finds McCurdy reassessing her childhood and voicing her mother as only marginally less deranged than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/christina-crawford-on-life-after-mommie-dearest-my-mother-should-have-been-in-jail">Joan Crawford in Mommie Dearest</a>. The book opens with the adult McCurdy and her brothers crowded around a hospital bed where Debra, who has cancer, is in a coma. In an effort to rouse their mother, each sibling fills her in on family news. When it is McCurdy’s turn, she leans in to deliver the bombshell that will surely jolt her mother into consciousness: “Mommy, I am … so skinny right now.” McCurdy’s memoir is full of these comic moments, expertly placed to counterbalance the bleakness elsewhere. The title is provocative but don’t be deceived: rather than a flippant chronicle of childhood resentment, McCurdy’s memoir an insightful portrait of narcissism, familial dysfunction and the ways cruelty can be mistaken for love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/24/im-glad-my-mom-died-by-jennette-mccurdy-audiobook-review-a-painfully-funny-memoir">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Minuscule portions of exquisite pleasure that linger in your mind</p><p><a href="https://musumcr.com/">Musu</a> is very possibly the most expensive restaurant in Manchester. Freshly opened with a £3m-plus fit-out, it resembles nothing so much as the Starship Enterprise, albeit one with geishas on the walls and a £110 seven-course menu (or £150 for 11) cooked by Michael Shaw, formerly of Gordon Ramsay Inc and Raymond Blanc’s <a href="https://www.belmond.com/fr/hotels/europe/uk/oxfordshire/belmond-le-manoir-aux-quat-saisons/">Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons</a>.</p><p>Abandon reading this review here, all who have already taken terrible umbrage that Musu even exists. Personally, I am rather cheered that there are still people north of Watford who have the faith and gumption to open places as pointedly bonkers as this.

<p>Tolkien-inspired mythology has taken over our screens while a treasure chest of epic fantasy tales lies unused </p><p>The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King will be back in North American cinemas next month, to celebrate 20 years since Peter Jackson first debuted his Oscar-winning film. Its return to the multiplexes comes at a time when we seem to have more JRR Tolkien-inspired fantasies to choose from than a 1980s branch of Games Workshop. As well as Gollum and co returning to the big screen, we have the baffling, utterly superfluous yet sumptuously filmed and geekily delightful small screen The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/31/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-review-so-astounding-it-makes-house-of-the-dragon-look-amateur">Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</a> TV show. Then next year there will be The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, an animated venture with Brian Cox as Helm Hammerhand and Jackson alumnus Miranda Otto as Eowyn (who will take the narrator’s role for the forthcoming prequel about the legendary warrior king of Rohan).</p><p>We are also promised <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/24/new-lord-of-the-rings-films-in-the-works-at-warner-bros">several new live-action movies based on Tolkien’s Middle-earth</a>, after a deal struck by rights holder Embracer Group and studios Warner Bros and New Line. Jackson and his two closest Lord of the Rings collaborators, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, have said they are being kept in the loop “every step of the way” about the new films.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/24/hits-and-myths-why-has-hollywood-abandoned-ancient-greece">Continue reading...</a>

The European Championship qualifier <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/27/england-lithuania-european-championship-match-report">against Lithuania</a> at Wembley; 27 March 2015. The centre-forward’s script writers had been busy that season, the one in which he broke through so suddenly at Tottenham, and they were never going to disappoint.</p><p>On as a 71st-minute substitute for Wayne Rooney, Kane took only 79 seconds to score, a far-post header from Raheem Sterling’s cross. The TV cameras cut to Rooney on the bench, smiling broadly and applauding. Afterwards, he would sign Kane’s shirt along with the rest of the team. “Well done mate, 1st of many,” he wrote. Rooney knew that there would be many, many more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/24/harry-kane-reels-in-rooney-for-england-goals-record-like-a-hunter-with-its-prey">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The BBC is about to screen yet another adaptation of Great Expectations – and enough is enough. It’s time they focused on new stories, rather than constantly making the same show</p><p>Television needs to stop rolling out Charles Dickens adaptations – and this is coming from someone whose lockdown project was writing an Oliver Twist prequel about Nancy (binned after three chapters due to insufficient oom-pah-pah). There’s no argument here against these being some of the greatest novels by one of the most important writers who ever lived. But after having been adapted at least 28 times across TV, film and stage, the BBC is about to launch yet another take on Great Expectations.</p><p>The latest version of bright orphan Pip’s (Fionn Whitehead) dreams of escaping life as a blacksmith’s apprentice to become a proper gentleman – due to air on BBC One this weekend – is the second dark Dickens adaptation from Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight. It follows his 2019 adults-only take on A Christmas Carol – which at a quick count was only the 128th adaptation of the novel. <a href="https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/entertainment/2020/05/13/news/steven-knight-to-adapt-more-dickens-despite-previous-controversy-1937649/">Knight says he chose Great Expectations next</a> because it is “a story of class mobility and class intransigence” that remains “very timely”. This is a fair point – these are Dickensian times indeed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/24/why-we-never-need-to-see-a-dickens-novel-on-tv-ever-again-great-expectations-bbc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What exactly is ‘ageless’ dressing? Is it self-hating to worry about the size of my bum in jeans? Viv Groskop<em> </em>(nearly 50) navigates the daunting world of midlife fashion</p><p>When I was growing up in the 1970s, I would not have given much thought to fashion for the over-50s and what I might wear if I had the good fortune to live to see such obscene decrepitude. But if I had, I would have imagined wearing what my late grandmother called “slacks” (elasticated-waist trousers), long-line ribbed cardigans with large ornate buttons and comfortable shoes from Clarks.</p><p>My grandma, Vera – who was 52 when I was born – liked to be what she termed “smart”, but definitely conformed to standards of what was “acceptable” at the time. She bought most of her clothing from charity shops or Marks &amp; Spencer. The charity shop dream was to find secondhand items from Jaeger, Windsmoor, Planet or – the holy grail – Dannimac.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/24/how-to-decode-fashion-in-your-50s-women">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I will never recover the years spent worrying about my outfits while I was dancing – or about whether my body was the right shape while having sex</p><p>At 32 years old, while getting dressed one very normal morning and already in my comfiest black trousers, I noticed my favourite navy sweater on the bed and I shuddered. I realised, in that moment, that it was not in fact a scientific truth that these colours – navy and black – could not be worn together as I had somehow believed since I read it in a magazine, age 18. Next to the article, there had been photographs of celebrities wearing these colours together in public, giant red crosses slashed across their grotesque choice of outfit to highlight the disgusting faux-pas.</p><p>Never, the article said, <em>never </em>wear navy with black. The message was written with such confidence, as if this rule was akin to “never put your fingers in a plug socket” or “never masturbate after chopping chillies”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/24/my-biggest-regret-why-did-i-listen-to-all-those-oppressive-terrible-fashion-rules">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor’s new documentary series salutes 50 years of African American creativity, from Sidney Poitier and Stevie Wonder to Beyoncé and Black Panther</p><p>I have been lucky enough to live through an era of extraordinary creativity. As a kid growing up in Birmingham, it was often to the other side of the Atlantic that I looked for my role models. Harry Belafonte and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitiers-grace-and-style-shaped-my-life-david-harewood" title="">Sidney Poitier</a> were my screen heroes, films such as Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner had a big impact. Soul music, and Stevie Wonder in particular, were the soundtrack to my youth, and the likes of Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes and Marvin Gaye provided the backing to the so-called “blaxploitation” films that blew me away in the 1970s and showed me a racier side of African American life. Later on, the likes of Spike Lee and the Hughes brothers took film-making in whole new directions, combining hip-hop, politics and social commentary to electrifying effect. Today, many of the biggest phenomena in entertainment – Beyoncé, Bridgerton, Black Panther – are the products of largely Black American creativity.</p><p>Now, with new BBC documentary series <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0f5162t">Get on Up: The Triumph of Black America</a>, I’ve been given the chance to explore how, across the span of my own lifetime, this creativity has come to dominate popular culture, and changed the entertainment landscape right around the world. In previous documentaries I have looked at some pretty tough subjects – race, racism, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/14/mental-illness-breakdown-david-harewood" title="">mental health</a>. But a series celebrating Black creativity, exploring what makes African American culture so dynamic and globally successful?

<p>I cannot support laws that defend those who destroy the planet, and criminalise those who try to protect it. This is a principle I will stand by.</p><ul><li>Jolyon Maugham KC is the director of the Good Law Project</li></ul><p>The cab rank rule expresses a beautiful idea: that access to the law – society’s great leveller – is for everyone, whoever they are and whatever they are said to have done. The rule remembers that for a lawyer to say “I will not act” appropriates a role the system gives to judges or juries. And it recognises that if lawyers are tainted by association, the criminal justice system is jeopardised. It risks, or even ensures, miscarriages of justice.</p><p>What it says is that we barristers act for whomever seeks our services – in the same way taxi drivers in a rank take whoever is next in the queue – whether we like the look of them or not. And it is not just an idea, it is also a professional conduct obligation. If we breach it, decide we will not act for someone because we don’t like who they are or what they do, we commit professional misconduct – and face disciplinary sanction. We could be fined, or suspended – even struck off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/24/100-lawyers-prosecute-climate-protesters-laws-planet-criminalise">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a breath of fresh air</p><p>For those of you – for those of us – who have been broken on the wheel of secondhand embarrassment over the last few hundred years (or whenever reality TV and singing etc competitions began), My Kind of Country will come as balm to the soul. All the contestants have the goods: they can sing, they can play, they can perform and have in many cases years of experience under their belts. And the judges (country singer-songwriters Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and Orville Peck), who have scouted and champion four contestants each, are there to help not humiliate them. The relief is tremendous, even if you do have to hear an awful lot about hopes, dreams, journeys and other guff.</p><p>Nevermind. It’s worth it, overall. The show – executive produced by Reese Witherspoon and country star Kacey Musgraves – is designed to find country singers who do not fit the traditional Nashville mould. Allen and Guyton, who are both Black, each auditioned for American Idol early in their careers but were cut before the voting rounds and have had to negotiate the intangible barriers that stood between them and mainstream success. Peck, a gay South African musician, has had his troubles within a notably conservative and white genre, too.</p><p>My Kind of Country is on Apple TV+</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/24/my-kind-of-country-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Andrew Bailey appeals to businesses to avoid price rises because higher inflation ‘hurts least well-off in society’</p><p>The jump in retail sales came as consumer confidence improved slightly. GfK’s consumer confidence index rose by two points to -36 in March.</p><p><strong>Joe Staton</strong>, client strategy director at GfK, said:</p><p>A small improvement in the overall index score this month masks continuing concerns among consumers about their personal financial situation. This measure best reflects the financial pulse of the nation and it remains weak, with the figure for the coming year down three to -21 and an unchanged score for the past 12 months of -26.</p><p>Forecasts that headline inflation will fall this year have proved premature, given Wednesday’s announcement of an unexpected increase. Wages are not keeping up with rising prices and the cost-of-living crisis remains a stark reality for most.</p><p>The UK is finding its shopping habit hard to kick it would seem. Retail sales volumes have come in stronger than expected for the second month this year despite the cost of living squeeze.</p><p><strong>But beneath that headline, there’s clear evidence that shoppers are being careful with their money.</strong> Growth in non-food sales was driven by discounters and second hand shops, while the rise in food volumes is attributed to people choosing to eat in and avoid pricey meals out. Shoppers may be more willing to spend, but only when there’s a bargain to be had.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/mar/24/bank-of-england-chief-warns-further-rate-hikes-firms-raise-prices-council-tax-retail-sales-business-live">Continue reading...</a>

## Don’t look down: 100 years of Harold Lloyd’s Safety Last!

<p>Harold Lloyd’s stunts in Safety Last! make it one of the most heart-in-mouth films of all time. On its 100th birthday, his granddaughter remembers his mastery, inspiration – and the real-life love at the film’s heart</p><p>It is one of the most famous images in film history: a bespectacled man dangles from the hands of a broken clock, 12 storeys above the Los Angeles traffic. The climax of Harold Lloyd’s slapstick suspense masterpiece Safety Last!, which is about to celebrate its centenary, is also a defining image of the city, much like the construction workers perched on a steel beam in the 1932 news photograph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch_atop_a_Skyscraper">Lunch Atop a Skyscraper</a> is for New York. They share a sense of the giddy dangers of 20th-century urbanism, and the precarity of the working man.</p><p>Harold, the hero of Safety Last!, is just such an ordinary joe: a department store sales clerk struggling to keep his job, while boasting of a big promotion in letters home to his sweetheart, Mildred. When he spends his entire pay cheque on a gift for Mildred, Harold forlornly imagines his lunch disappearing dish by dish. Mildred surprises him by coming to visit, which is when he has the brainwave of “climbing” to the very top of the building as a romantic stunt – emphasis on the stunt as he plans to use his agile friend “Limpy Bill” as a double. In the film’s perfect final 20 minutes, Harold makes the ascent alone, beset by perils including a flock of birds, a barking dog, a broken flagpole and even a gunshot. It amounts to some of the most nerve-racking funny business ever put on screen. Variety announced: “It will make all of the nation laugh.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/24/dont-look-down-100-years-of-harold-lloyds-safety-last">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kasparov says ‘the world championship match should include the strongest player on the planet, and this match [Ian Nepomniachtchi v Ding Liren] doesn’t’</p><p>Garry Kasparov, who held the world title from 1985 to 2000 and is regarded as Magnus Carlsen’s rival as the greatest player of all time, said next month’s Ian Nepomniachtchi v Ding Liren world title match “should include the strongest player on the planet, and this match doesn’t … It’s a kind of amputated event … The match between Nepo and Ding is a great show, but it’s not a world championship match.”</p><p>Comments on Kasparov’s assertion have been mostly negative, pointing out that the match is actually between the two highest rated players who are ready to participate, which Carlsen is not. There is also a direct recent precedent in the Vishy Anand v Boris Gelfand 2012 world title series, which took place at a time when Carlsen was already the world No 1, but had declined to take part in the qualifiers because he objected to the candidates being played as a knockout rather than an all-play-all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/24/chess-garry-kasparov-calls-aprils-world-title-match-amputated">Continue reading...</a>

## Humanly Possible by Sarah Bakewell review – the meaning of humanism

<p>An skilful examination of seven centuries of thought that deftly combines philosophy, history and biography</p><p>“Man was formed of dust, slime and ashes … conceived from the itch of the flesh, in the … stench of lust, and worse yet, with the stain of sin.” So wrote Pope Innocent III in his 12th-century On the Misery of the Human Condition. In 1452 Giannozzo Manetti answered Innocent point by point in his own On the Dignity of Man. But as early as the 1300s, Italians were enthusiastically quoting Psalm 8: “Man is only a little lower than the angels.” The passion for finding, collecting and imitating ancient Greek and Roman texts had readjusted moral priorities – away from arduous obedience to supposedly God-given rules and towards celebrating and fostering human happiness. Increasingly, morality’s concern was to alleviate suffering, not to justify God for inflicting it.</p><p>To date the rise of “humanism” to the early Renaissance is, strictly speaking, anachronistic; there was no such term until the 19th century. But Humanly Possible traces a lineage, less of theories than of kindred spirits, over seven centuries in Europe. This runs from medieval <em>umanisti</em> (students of humanity), who remained Christian even while resurrecting “the flowering, perfumed, fruitful works of the pagan world spring” (as John of Salisbury called them), to today’s (more secular) self-declared humanists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/24/humanly-possible-by-sarah-bakewell-review-the-meaning-of-humanism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Juliette Lewis is sublime, Christina Ricci finds her perfect co-star and you’re constantly kept on your toes with parallel timelines and tons of creepy thrills. What a follow-up!</p><p>After the 2021 press tour <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/08/halloween-kills-review-john-carpenter-david-gordon-green">for the slasher movie Halloween Kills</a>, a video <a href="https://twitter.com/gay_reactions/status/1456693963591618561?s=20">of Jamie Lee Curtis went viral</a>, highlighting just how many times she uttered the word “trauma”. She was speaking about one of the most common problems with “elevated horror” – genuine suspense and terror being sidelined to give room to heavy-handed metaphors for trauma. What truly elevates Yellowjackets above most contemporary horror is that it provides space for the psychological impact of spending 19 months starving while your friends die around you, without forgoing nauseating gore, gruelling tension and acerbic wit.</p><p>There was so much to recommend the first season of Yellowjackets, a word-of-mouth hit that switched between the past and the present with two sets of cast members – one playing the younger characters, the other playing their more mature incarnations. It followed the 1996 plane crash of a high school football team, who ended up stranded in the wilderness and doomed to come of age battling the elements (and one another) before rescue. In the present, the survivors face blackmail, addiction, murder and PTSD. Supernatural elements continue to keep things ambiguous; it’s never entirely clear what was created by paranormal forces and what was the result of hallucinatory mushrooms or fractured psyches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/24/yellowjackets-season-two-review-this-wonderfully-imaginative-sequel-is-even-better-than-last-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One in five pupils in England were reported as persistently absent during the last school year </p><p>Anne’s daughter is just nine, but feels constantly overwhelmed by school. Like many children, she found the pandemic very difficult, her mother explains. “She would stop talking for periods of time – we’d find her curled up and feeling low. I don’t think she’s ever really recovered from that.”</p><p>The nine-year-old struggled with returning to her primary school, and Anne has become increasingly concerned about her daughter’s mental health. “In school holidays, she’s a different person – there’s a lightness and fun about her.

<p>Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker are three of the best – and most obsessed-over – songwriters today.

They are queer-identifying, vocal about issues from abortion to trans rights to colonialism, while their songwriting, which tends to be smart, introspective and somewhat melancholic, has handed each of them the peculiar charge of articulating the feelings of a generation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/24/indie-supergroup-boygenius-phoebe-bridgers-lucy-dacus-julien-baker-stuff-of-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Asylum/Atlantic)</strong><br />Teaming with Taylor Swift’s recent producer, Aaron Dessner of the National, Sheeran strips things back – but only a little, and the chorus of this new single is as insistent as ever</p><p>Earlier this week, on a day when the former prime minister of the UK faced the House of Commons privileges committee in a hearing that could theoretically end his political career, one tabloid newspaper decided that the biggest story of the day was that Ed Sheeran no longer takes drugs (an admission he’d made during a lengthy interview with the US Rolling Stone magazine). That perhaps tells you something about said paper’s political allegiances and news values, but it also tells you something about Ed Sheeran: 12 years after his album + catapulted him into the mainstream consciousness in no uncertain terms – it ended up in the UK’s bestselling albums of the year chart for eight years in a row – he’s still an exceptionally big deal, big enough that a tabloid newspaper can just about get away with filleting a few quotes from a magazine feature and sticking them on the front page as a distraction tactic.</p><p>Times have changed, so have tastes – sweeping away a lot of the Sheeran-alikes that did good business in the wake of his initial success – but the definite article’s popularity seems almost impregnable. Carping voices, of which there are many whenever Sheeran’s name is mentioned, might point to the fact that his last album, =, didn’t sell as well in the US as its predecessors, but such things are very relative indeed: it went straight to No 1 there, sold 1.3m copies in 2021 alone and spawned five platinum or multi-platinum singles. Faced with failures that profitable, even the aforementioned carping voices might be forced to admit that Sheeran clearly has something the public want: a knack of writing songs that get under millions of skins, an innate understanding of mass taste, a formula for success.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/24/ed-sheeran-eyes-closed-review-the-most-unradical-of-reinventions">Continue reading...</a>
