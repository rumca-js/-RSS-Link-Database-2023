The 11.58 million Chinese college students graduating in 2023 are about to have the toughest employment season in history. According to the latest statistics involving 2022 graduates, released by China's career development platform, Zhi Lian Recruitment, the contracting rate of engineering graduates, which has been high for years, is only 17.3%, and the contracting rate of liberal arts graduates is as low as 12.4%, which indicates one becomes unemployed upon graduation.
In the past two years, more and more young people have joined the unemployment army, and many of them are college students who graduated just a few short years ago.
