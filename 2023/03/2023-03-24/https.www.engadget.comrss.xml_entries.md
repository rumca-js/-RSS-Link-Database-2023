<p>Blue Origin now has an explanation for the booster failure that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-ns-23-032202728.html">cut a New Shepard flight short</a> last September. Jeff Bezos' company has <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/ns-23-findings/">determined</a> that a &quot;thermo-structural failure&quot; in the NS-23 rocket's engine nozzle was to blame. Operational temperatures for the nozzle climbed higher than expected following cooling system design changes, creating fatigue that misaligned the thrust and activated the crew capsule's escape system.</p><p>Engineers are already taking &quot;corrective actions&quot; that include redesigning the combustion chamber and operating conditions. Blue Origin has also tweaked the nozzle design to improve its structural integrity. The capsule wasn't damaged and will fly again, Blue Origin says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company says it hopes to resume flights &quot;soon,&quot; but hasn't provided an exact date. It intends to restart operations by re-flying the research payload from the aborted mission. The Federal Aviation Administration has to accept the incident findings before Blue Origin can move forward.</p><p>There's plenty of pressure on Blue Origin to address the issues. The company recently obtained a NASA contract to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-blue-origin-new-glenn-escapade-science-mission-mars-110049165.html">fly a science mission to Mars</a> using its yet-to-launch New Glenn rocket, and has been pushing for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-nasa-lunar-lander-moon-artemis-172023096.html">lunar lander agreement</a>. The sooner Blue Origin can prove that its rocketry is trustworthy, the sooner it can secure customers that include governments and space tourists.</p><p>Rivals are facing problems of their own. Relativity Space's first 3D-printed rocket <a href="https://www.engadget.com/relativity-space-launched-its-3d-printed-rocket-but-failed-to-reach-orbit-153502328.html">failed to reach orbit</a> earlier this month. SpaceX, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-full-static-fire-test-results-221636780.html">has yet to successfully fire</a> all of Starship's engines at the same time. That's not including past problems like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rocket-lab-20th-electron-mission-failure-150652708.html">Rocket Lab's setbacks</a>. Private spaceflight remains difficult, and Blue Origin is just the latest to illustrate that fact.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-pins-last-summers-ns-23-rocket-failure-on-a-faulty-engine-nozzle-195714293.html?src=rss

## Levi’s will ‘supplement’ human models with AI-generated fakes

<p>Levi’s is partnering with an AI company on computer-generated fashion models to “supplement human models.” The company frames the move as part of a “digital transformation journey” of diversity, equity, inclusion and sustainability. Although that sounds noble on the surface, Levi’s is essentially hiring a robot to generate the <em>appearance</em> of diversity while ridding itself of the burden of paying human beings who represent the qualities it wants to be associated with its brand.</p><p>Levi Strauss is partnering with Amsterdam-based digital model studio Lalaland.ai for the initiative. Founded in 2019, the company’s mission is “to see more representation in the fashion industry” and “create an inclusive, sustainable, and diverse design chain.” It aims to let customers see what various fashion items would look like on a person who looks like them via “hyper-realistic” models “of every body type, age, size and skin tone.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Levi’s <a href="https://www.levistrauss.com/2023/03/22/lsco-partners-with-lalaland-ai/">announcement</a> echoes that branding, saying the partnership is about “increasing the number and diversity of our models for our products in a sustainable way.” The company continues, “We see fashion and technology as both an art and a science, and we’re thrilled to be partnering with Lalaland.ai, a company with such high-quality technology that can help us continue on our journey for a more diverse and inclusive customer experience.”</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot from the Lalaland.ai website, showing an AI-generated fashion model wearing customized clothing." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/87a76de0-ca73-11ed-8f79-5e3f62229cf9" style="height: 1400; width: 2102;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lalaland.ai</div></figure><p>Levi’s claims, “AI will likely never fully replace human models for us” (note the qualifying “likely”). But I can’t help but see this as the first step in a dystopian slow walk toward automating the industry. As AI-generated “photography,” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-open-ai-dall-e-2-images-111840375.html">art</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">writing</a> grow ever more convincing, we would be naive to take corporations at face value when they insist moves like this are about PR-friendly principles like celebrating diversity and looking out for the environment. At the very least, it’s awfully convenient that those high-minded motives also let them mass-produce something that previously required hiring people.</p><p>Levi Strauss <a href="https://www.sent-trib.com/2022/03/16/levi-strauss-to-eliminate-about-800-jobs-2/">reportedly</a> began a 12-to-19-month process of cutting around 800 jobs — almost 20 percent of its corporate workforce — last year. It was part of a restructuring plan to save about $75 million to $100 million annually.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/levis-will-supplement-human-models-with-ai-generated-fakes-190011557.html?src=rss

## France bans TikTok (and Candy Crush) from government phones

<p>It's no shock to see another <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-zealand-is-the-latest-country-to-ban-tiktok-from-government-devices-143539571.html">country banning TikTok</a> from government phones, but France is taking the restrictions a step further. <em>Le Monde</em><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/03/24/tiktok-netflix-et-autres-applications-recreatives-interdites-sur-les-telephones-professionnels-des-fonctionnaires-d-etat-francais_6166825_4408996.html">reports</a> the French government is banning &quot;recreational&quot; apps like TikTok, Twitter, Netflix and even <em>Candy Crush</em> from public servants' devices. The apps represent cybersecurity risks that could jeopardize data for both the employees and the administration, according to the office of public service minister Stanislas Guerini.</p><p>The government hasn't provided an exact list of banned apps. However, Guerini said certain there could be some exceptions for the sake of necessary communication. This won't prevent a social media team from posting content, in other words. The ban takes effect immediately, but the penalties for defying the rule can be decided at the &quot;managerial level,&quot; Guerini's office says. The approach doesn't affect personal devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The clampdown comes after the US <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-us-government-ban-devices-omnibus-bill-funding-nasa-234803320.html">federal government</a>, dozens of states, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canada-is-reportedly-banning-tiktok-from-government-issued-devices-170230648.html">Canada</a>, the European Commission and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-bans-tiktok-from-government-devices-with-immediate-effect-142516712.html">the UK</a> have banned TikTok on their workers' devices. In those cases, the rationale has been similar: officials are worried the Chinese government could collect data about important individuals, spread propaganda and compel ByteDance (TikTok's parent company) to hand over sensitive information.</p><p>TikTok has repeatedly denied collaborating with the Chinese government. In testimony <a href="https://www.engadget.com/heres-what-tiktoks-ceo-told-congress-about-the-apps-ties-to-china-and-teen-safety-201657076.html">before a House committee</a> yesterday, CEO Shou Chew said ByteDance was &quot;not an agent of China&quot; and that American user data wouldn't be accessible to staff in other countries by the time a migration project wraps up later this year.</p><p>The French policy, however, isn't aimed at any one country or app category. Instead, it represents a general concern that entertainment apps may put government data at unnecessary risk. That's not so hot for employees hoping to watch Netflix during lunch, but it may reassure politicians worried employees might inadvertently expose info through their social media accounts.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/france-bans-tiktok-and-candy-crush-from-government-phones-170434409.html?src=rss

## OpenAI says a bug leaked sensitive ChatGPT user data

<p>OpenAI was forced to take its wildly-popular ChatGPT bot offline for emergency maintenance on Tuesday after a user was able to exploit a bug in the system to recall the titles from other users' chat histories. On Friday the company announced its <a href="https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage">initial findings from the incident</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-briefly-went-offline-after-a-bug-revealed-user-chat-histories-115632504.html">In Tuesday's incident</a>, users posted screenshots on Reddit that their ChatGPT sidebars featured previous chat histories from other users. Only the title of the conversation, not the text itself, were visible. OpenAI, in response, took the bot offline for nearly 10 hours to investigate. The results of that investigation revealed a deeper security issue: the chat history bug may have also potentially revealed personal data from 1.2 percent of ChatGPT Plus subscribers (<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus">a $20/month enhanced access package</a>).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;In the hours before we took ChatGPT offline on Monday, it was possible for some users to see another active user’s first and last name, email address, payment address, the last four digits (only) of a credit card number, and credit card expiration date. Full credit card numbers were not exposed at any time,&quot; the OpenAI team wrote Friday. The issue has since been patched for the faulty library which OpenAI identified as the Redis client open-source library, redis-py.</p><p>The company has downplayed the likelihood of such a breach occurring, arguing that either of the following criteria would have to be met to place a user at risk:</p><blockquote><p>- Open a subscription confirmation email sent on Monday, March 20, between 1 a.m. and 10 a.m. Pacific time. Due to the bug, some subscription confirmation emails generated during that window were sent to the wrong users. These emails contained the last four digits of another user’s credit card number, but full credit card numbers did not appear. It’s possible that a small number of subscription confirmation emails might have been incorrectly addressed prior to March 20, although we have not confirmed any instances of this.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>- In ChatGPT, click on “My account,” then “Manage my subscription” between 1 a.m. and 10 a.m. Pacific time on Monday, March 20. During this window, another <strong>active</strong> ChatGPT Plus user’s first and last name, email address, payment address, the last four digits (only) of a credit card number, and credit card expiration date might have been visible. It’s possible that this also could have occurred prior to March 20, although we have not confirmed any instances of this.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The company has taken additional steps to prevent this from happening again in the future including adding redundant checks to library calls, &quot;programatically examined our logs to make sure that all messages are only available to the correct user,&quot; and &quot;improved logging to identify when this is happening and fully confirm it has stopped.&quot; The company says that it has also reached out to alert affected users of the issue.</p><p>This news follows <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html">a costly public faux pas committed by Google's rival Bard AI in February</a> when it incorrectly assured Twitter that the JWST was the first telescope to image an exoplanet, as well as revelations that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-gets-caught-playing-ai-mad-libs-with-its-financial-news-coverage-001026432.html">CNET had surreptitiously used generative AI to write financial explainer posts</a> (a week before <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/cnet-laying-off-10-staff-150432669.html">laying off a sizable chunk of its editorial department</a>). Whether OpenAI will suffer the same market-based repercussions as its competitors remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/openai-says-a-bug-leaked-sensitive-chatgpt-user-data-165439848.html?src=rss

## How to get your grill ready for the outdoor season

<p>As winter’s chilly grip thaws, it’s time to spend our days on porches, patios or in the backyard. A key part of those warm weather activities is showing off your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-grilling-gear-143011296.html">outdoor culinary skills</a> to friends and family. During the cold months, your grill has likely been dormant, so it’s time to give it a thorough cleaning before it gets fired up several times a week. Some of us keep the grill going<a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-fall-outdoor-tech-gear-150041103.html"> year-round</a>, but spring is a great time to do a deep clean before the <em>official</em> outdoor cooking season starts. Here are a few tips and tricks that will hopefully make things easier.</p><h2>Disassemble, scrub, reassemble</h2><figure><img alt="Weber's first pellet grill has potential to be a backyard powerhouse, but the smart features need work." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/f0a27240-8048-11ea-be9f-d105b1dd0197" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>A good rule of thumb when it comes to cleaning anything you haven’t used in a while is to take it apart as much as you feel comfortable and give it a thorough wipe down. For grills, this means removing the grates and any bars or burner covers – basically, anything you can take out that’s not the heating element. This gives you a chance to inspect the burners of your gas grill or the fire pot of a pellet model for any unsightly wear and tear. If those components are worn out or overly rusted, most companies offer replacements that you can easily swap out with a few basic tools.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once all the pieces are out, start by scraping excess debris off all sides of the interior – with the help of some cleaner if needed. For a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-connect-smart-gas-grills-171237945.html">gas grill</a>, this likely means pushing everything out through the grease trap. On a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-24-traeger-ironwood-650-review-wifi-pellet-grill-smoker.html">pellet grill</a>, you’ll want to scrape the grease chute clear and out into the catch can, but you’ll also need to vacuum the interior with a shop vac – just like you would after every few hours of use. And while you’re at it, go ahead and empty the hopper of any old pellets that have been sitting since labor day. Fuel that’s been sitting in the grill for months won’t give you the best results when it comes time to cook so you might as well start fresh.</p><p>Thankfully, pellet grill companies have made easy cleaning a key part of their designs. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-2022-grill-lineup-genesis-smokefire-weber-connect-140518150.html">Weber’s SmokeFire</a> has a set of metal bars on the inside that can be removed quickly to open up the bottom of the chamber. This is also a design feature of the company’s gas grills. Simply vacuum or push the debris out the grease chute. The catch pan where all of the garbage ends up is also easy to access from the front of the grill, and you can remove the aluminum liner and replace it with a new one in seconds.</p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmFlZ2VyLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk4ODMyNDEyLWYzYTUtNDJhYS05MDhkLTJiMGI4MTk2MjEzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaOy26feYRyVGE3q22Xfxbai-H40GjL2djeOj2pF2r3U&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.traeger.com%2F">Traeger’s most recent pellet grills</a> were also redesigned to improve cleaning. Most notably, grease and ash end up in the same “keg” that’s easy to detach from the front of the grill. The company also allows you to quickly remove all of the interior components, though they’re larger than what you find on the SmokeFire. Lastly, Traeger moved the pellet chute to the front of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/traeger-timberline-2022-smart-grills-announced-price-specs-163043089.html">new Timberline</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/traegers-redesigned-ironwood-grills-pack-touchscreen-controls-and-more-efficiency-150010372.html">Ironwood</a>, making it a lot more convenient to swap out wood varieties or empty an old supply.</p><p>You’ll want to get as much of the food leftovers out of your grill as possible for a few reasons. First, that stuff is old and lots of build-up over time can hinder cooking performance and might impact flavor. The last thing you want is old food or grease burning off right under an expensive ribeye. Second, in the case of pellet grills, not properly clearing out grease and dust can be dangerous. It’s easy for grease fires to start at searing temperatures and if there’s enough pellet dust in the bottom of your grill, it can actually ignite or explode. That’s why companies tell you to vacuum it out after every few hours of use.</p><figure><img alt="Weber's first pellet grill has potential to be a backyard powerhouse, but the smart features need work." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/ea7b7250-804c-11ea-9bfb-fd9b562f1be3" /><figcaption>All of that dust, grease and debris should be removed before you fire the grill back up.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>To actually clean the surfaces, you’ll want to get an all-natural grill cleaner. There are tons of options here, and it may take some time to find one you like. I typically use <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UcmFlZ2VyLUJBQzQwMy1OYXR1cmFsLUNsZWFuZXItQWNjZXNzb3JpZXMvZHAvQjA3MVpQUTNUNj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1xMi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTg4MzI0MTItZjNhNS00MmFhLTkwOGQtMmIwYjgxOTYyMTMwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdhdCIHwteLxh4GkAauRsDlv6FhsHHkHISYKS12Ub7Pb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTraeger-BAC403-Natural-Cleaner-Accessories%2Fdp%2FB071ZPQ3T6">Traeger’s formula</a> since it’s readily available at the places I buy pellets and I’ve found it works well cutting through stuck-on muck. You want an all-natural grill cleaner over a regular household product as it’s safe to use on surfaces that will touch your food. They’re also safe to use on the exterior of your grill without doing any damage to chrome, stainless steel or any other materials.</p><p>Spray down the inside and give things a few minutes to work. Wipe it all clean and go back over any super dirty spots as needed. Ditto for the grates, bars and any other pieces you removed. I like to lay these out on a yard waste trash bag (they’re bigger than kitchen bags) so all the stuff I scrape or clean off doesn’t get all over my deck. You can use shop towels if you want to recycle or paper towels if not, but just know whatever you choose will be covered in nasty black grime so you won’t want to just toss them in the clothes washer when you’re done. A pre-wash in a bucket or sink is needed to make sure you don’t transfer gunk from your grill to your business casuals.</p><p>In terms of tools, you don’t need much.

Sure, any damage done would be on the inside, but it’s still not a great feeling to knick up your previous investment.</p><h2>Check for updates before your first cook</h2><figure><img alt="Traeger WiFire app" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/02b4acd0-7e75-11ea-9d76-2cf5e5007634" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Traeger</div></figure><p>If you have a smart grill from the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/traeger-grills-app-redesign-video-guides-personal-customization-191141115.html">Traeger</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-24-weber-smokefire-weber-connect-behind-the-scenes.html">Weber</a> or another company, you’ll want to plug it in and check for software updates well in advance of your first grilling session. Chances are you haven’t cooked much since last fall, which means companies have had months to push updates to their devices. Trust me, there’s nothing worse than spending an hour trimming and seasoning a brisket only to walk outside to start the grill and it immediately launches into the update process. This could extend the whole cooking time significantly depending on the extent of the firmware additions and strength of your WiFi.</p><p>Thankfully, checking for updates is quick and easy. All you need to do is turn on your grill and open up the company’s app on your phone. If there’s a download ready for your model, the mobile software will let you know and it’s usually quite prominent. If there’s not a pop-up alert that displays immediately, you can check the settings menu just to make sure. Sometimes for smaller updates, a company might not beat you over the head to refresh. However, starting a fresh slate of firmware is always a safe bet and will ensure your grill is running at its best when it comes time to cook.</p><h2>For a good time every time, clean after each use</h2><figure><img alt="Traeger Ironwood 650" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/8df54c60-1537-11eb-9d1a-4bc7636e8980" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>I’ll be the first to admit I don’t adhere to my own advice here, but it’s nice to have goals. I will also be the first to tell you every single time I smoke a Boston Butt or some other super fatty cut of meat that I wish I would’ve done at least a quick cleaning right after the meal. Grease buildup is not only highly flammable but it’s much harder to clean once it cools and solidifies. Ditto for stuck-on sauce or cheese that’s left on your grates after chicken or burgers. It’s best to attack these things while the grill is still warm, but cooled down from the cook.</p><p>You don’t necessarily have to break out the shop vac each time for your pellet grill or empty the grease bin. But you’ll want to make sure that stuff is away from the main cooking area for safety and so any burn off won’t impact the flavor of your food. A few cups of hot water can cleanse the grease run-off while that wire brush I mentioned is best for the grates. It also doesn’t hurt to do a light wipe down with an all-natural cleaner so everything is ready to go when you want to cook again.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-clean-your-grill-for-summer-outdoor-season-spring-cleaning-140040826.html?src=rss

<p>Do you like the features that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-4000-characters-tweets-205319437.html">come with Twitter Blue</a>, but not the image it conveys of an Elon Musk superfan? There might be a solution in the near future. As <em>Boing Boing</em><a href="https://boingboing.net/2023/03/23/twitter-blue-subscribers-will-be-able-to-hide-their-checkmarks-to-avoid-shaming-and-mockery.html">notes</a>, developer Alessandro Paluzzi claims to have <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1638275630428049411">spotted</a> Twitter testing an option to hide the Blue checkmark on your profile. Unless you write a very long tweet or otherwise flaunt Blue-only features, other users might never know that you're paying for perks. You'd still need to verify your government ID to use the features.</p><p>Twitter isn't available for comment as it disbanded its communications team after Musk's purchase. The test comes as Twitter says it will start <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-says-its-killing-legacy-verified-checkmarks-starting-on-april-1st-035927238.html">removing legacy verified checkmarks</a> on April 1st.

You may not want to give the impression that your tweets represent the views of your employer. And if you share the same name as a celebrity, you might not want to risk confusing users.</p><p>There's no guarantee Twitter will make the checkmark-hiding option widely available. If the company presses ahead, though, this might (further) diminish the value of the blue tick by making it inconsistently visible. On top of this, Twitter now has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-colored-badges-verified-accounts-094651616.html">gold and grey checkmarks</a> for business and government accounts respectively — those are the true upper-echelon badges.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-may-let-you-hide-the-fact-you-pay-to-use-twitter-160015039.html?src=rss

As always, you can't upgrade the Mac Mini's internals after you buy it, so it's likely worth <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3Nob3AvYnV5LW1hYy9tYWMtbWluaS9hcHBsZS1tMi1jaGlwLXdpdGgtOC1jb3JlLWNwdS1hbmQtMTAtY29yZS1ncHUtNTEyZ2IiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjcxYzY1M2NiLWM2MGItNDRjZS05YTU4LTBkMDhlNGIwMDViNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAY9udu0QrWeM0MKivf7KgHcWro6IlsSeZ6lGL-9fTpXR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini%2Fapple-m2-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-512gb">buying a model</a> with more RAM, storage or that M2 Pro chip if you plan on doing development work or heavy media editing and must have this smaller form factor.</p><h2>Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5e0bed65-d2f8-4b34-9b8f-955218c0e37a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Best+Buy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZTBiZWQ2NS1kMmY4LTRiMzQtOWI4Zi05NTUyMThjMGUzN2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVzdGJ1eS5jb20vc2l0ZS9hc3VzLXJvZy16ZXBoeXJ1cy0xNC13cXhnYS0xMjBoei1nYW1pbmctbGFwdG9wLWFtZC1yeXplbi05LTE2Z2ItZGRyNS1tZW1vcnktYW1kLXJhZGVvbi1yeC02NzAwcy0xdGItcGNpZS00LTAtc3NkLzY0OTQ2MzgucD9za3VJZD02NDk0NjM4IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MWM2NTNjYi1jNjBiLTQ0Y2UtOWE1OC0wZDA4ZTRiMDA1YjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbjgoScRqnG9JflCko8sYmEAUgkPAP7fByG6jAk0bY7t&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-14-wqxga-120hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-16gb-ddr5-memory-amd-radeon-rx-6700s-1tb-pcie-4-0-ssd%2F6494638.p%3FskuId%3D6494638">Asus' ROG Zephyrus G14</a> is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming laptops, and a configuration with a Ryzen 9 6900HS CPU, Radeon RX 6700S GPU, 14-inch 120Hz display, 1TB SSD and 16GB of RAM and is currently down to $1,100 at Best Buy.

## Amazon sale knocks the Kindle Paperwhite down to $100

<p>If you're on the market for a new e-reader, Amazon's latest discounts on Kindles may have exactly what you've been looking for at a lower-than-expected price. Key among the sale items is the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhLVFo4MjQ5P3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcHotMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZjMjVkMWM3LWE5MDItNGJjOC1hNTVmLWVkOTY4MDc3ODM1YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWIpxswGNXgKhcKxT1-gQo7iyn3wXmby7wbiO0S_76VX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08KTZ8249%3Fth%3D1">Kindle Paperwhite</a>, which is down to $100. That's only $5 more than its record-low price, and it's the same price as the standard Kindle, which doesn't have as many extra features as the Paperwhite.</p><p>While we did not review the Paperwhite, we did <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-2021-review-130037090.html">test</a> the Paperwhite Signature Edition, which is only different thanks to its auto-adjusting front light, higher storage capacity and its wireless charging capabilities. You should get a very similar experience going with the regular Paperwhite, and it should be a great one. The latest version of Amazon's ubiquitous e-reader has a 6.8-inch, 300 ppi glare-free screen with 17 front LEDs, including a new adjustable warm light that will make it easier to read in dark environments (and after a full day of staring at a computer screen).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><p>The design of the Paperwhite hasn't changed drastically over the years, but Amazon has refined it. This model's screen is flush with its bezels, giving it a cleaner look, and it's also IPX8-rated, so it won't be in danger if it takes an accidental dunk in the pool or bathtub. This Paperwhite also has Audible support, so if you have audiobooks through the Amazon-owned outlet, you can listen to them directly from your Kindle as long as you have a pair of Bluetooth headphones to do so.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhQNTJSMlBMP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcHotMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZjMjVkMWM3LWE5MDItNGJjOC1hNTVmLWVkOTY4MDc3ODM1YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAX0kw0p95Hi1o9L61o_UDOYPSlPrbQQBidlR44cV5n8a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08P52R2PL%3Fth%3D1">Kids version</a> of the Paperwhite is also on sale for $110, and we sometimes recommend this model even for adults. You're getting the same hardware as the non-kids model, along with a longer warranty and a protective case. The Kids version is also touted to have no ads, but that's only if you stick to the kid-friendly UI that's preinstalled on the e-reader.</p><p></p><p>Also included in this sale is the new <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlCUzI2QjhCP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXB6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmYzI1ZDFjNy1hOTAyLTRiYzgtYTU1Zi1lZDk2ODA3NzgzNWEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYNFRb2xx8jsWTZEj5oz9KXRBo-Y6IvWU9B5TLw_z-Wk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09BS26B8B%3F">Kindle Scribe</a>, which is down to a new all-time-low price of $290. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-scribe-review-e-ink-reader-tablet-pen-drawing-price-battery-life-140019784.html">Scribe</a> is Amazon's first jump into the e-ink tablet space, and the model on sale includes 16GB of storage and a basic pen. As a tablet, the Scribe is a basic but fairly well-executed device: there's little to no latency when writing on the display, there are a decent number of brush options to choose from and you can organize multiple notebooks pretty easily. As an e-reader, it's a little on the large size with its 10.3-inch display, but the screen is crisp and responsive and we like the wider side bezel that makes the device easier to grip.</p><p>You can't actually take notes in the margins of Kindle books on the Scribe, but you can add sticky notes to your books and jot down ideas that way. And if you like the idea of keeping your notes on the same device that holds most of your reading material, the Scribe will be a good option for you. That goes for those who have big Kindle e-book libraries, but also those who have PDFs and ePUBs they want to mark up, too, as the Scribe supports a number of <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9oZWxwL2N1c3RvbWVyL2Rpc3BsYXkuaHRtbD9ub2RlSWQ9VE50U20xM2szdHhGSTRFdkRWJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXB6LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmYzI1ZDFjNy1hOTAyLTRiYzgtYTU1Zi1lZDk2ODA3NzgzNWEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAa0kmgfqooZg60n-Cqc3Q85Q22ETclr9zDnjIxLBH6uc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fhelp%2Fcustomer%2Fdisplay.html%3FnodeId%3DTNtSm13k3txFI4EvDV">different file types</a>.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-sale-knocks-the-kindle-paperwhite-down-to-100-150513073.html?src=rss

## How to clean all the screens in your home

<p>Display technology has come a long way in recent years. OLED and LCD screens are brighter, more colorful and responsive than ever before, but at some point, they all still succumb to dust, dirt and grime. There are a plethora of cleaning products out there that claim they can make your screen sparkle again, but we’ve found that the simplest route is actually the best. If you want to refresh all of the screens in your home, from TVs to smartphones, we'll outline the best methods that will help you do so properly without damaging any of your gear.</p><h2>How <em>not</em> to clean your screens</h2><figure><img alt="Igor's desktop" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/d56485d0-a559-11ec-bda7-9cc80207d3ff" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>Before we get to how to clean a screen, there are a few ways you <em>don’t</em> want to go about the process. The first, and most important, is that you don’t want to clean a display using substances like isopropyl alcohol or Windex. Alcohol- and ammonia-based cleaners can damage your screen’s anti-reflective coating. Using those substances repeatedly can lead to clouding and the coating becoming uneven.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Companies like <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9XSE9PU0gtQXdhcmQtV2luaW5nLVNjcmVlbi1DbGVhbmVyLVNtYXJ0cGhvbmVzL2RwL0IwNzZIRllHTFI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcHktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIyNTA5MzFlLWUzNmUtNDQ5YS1hNWUwLWI3ZWZmYTdjNjI3ZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT9drJlGEWgjN0rNaxSwGf-b1BpxEiDdyczo2WPjddzB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWHOOSH-Award-Wining-Screen-Cleaner-Smartphones%2Fdp%2FB076HFYGLR">Whoosh</a> make cleaning agents that won’t damage your screen, but in my experience, you’re best off using distilled water. It’s more affordable than a dedicated cleaning agent and more versatile too since you can use it on a variety of surfaces. It also won’t leave behind any residue on your display, which is something I’ve seen products like Whoosh do occasionally.

## UK watchdog no longer thinks Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard merger is a threat to console competition

<p>The UK is softening its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uks-competition-watchdog-says-microsofts-activision-merge-could-harm-uk-gamers-132410352.html">objections to Microsoft's buyout</a> of Activision Blizzard. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-narrows-scope-of-concerns-in-microsoft-activision-review">revised</a> its findings and determined that the merger won't lead to significantly reduced competition in the console space. While the evidence remains the same, the watchdog now finds that Microsoft's ownership of franchises like Call of Duty would &quot;not materially affect&quot; Sony's ability to compete with PlayStation systems. Microsoft could &quot;degrade&quot; the PlayStation's appeal, the CMA says, but Sony's platform has a strong-enough catalog that the damage would be limited.</p><p>The Authority also reconsidered its view that Microsoft might benefit from shutting out Call of Duty's PlayStation audience. More recent Microsoft data suggests the company could suffer substantial losses in &quot;any plausible scenario&quot; by making the game franchise Xbox-only or offering exclusive perks, according to the CMA. Not enough gamers would switch from PlayStation to Xbox to make that strategy work, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The CMA makes clear that the updated findings don't change its concerns about cloud gaming services. In February, the regulator said Microsoft represented up to 70 percent of the worldwide cloud gaming market, and completing the Activision Blizzard purchase could harm gamers who can't afford an expensive console or PC.</p><p>We've asked Microsoft and Sony for comment. Activision Blizzard tells Engadget in a statement that the CMA now has an &quot;improved understanding&quot; of the console market, and that Microsoft already has solutions in place for remaining issues. Activision maintains that Sony is only trying to &quot;protect its dominance&quot; by contesting the acquisition.</p><p>Sony has long opposed the deal and calls it a &quot;threat to our industry&quot; that could <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-concerned-call-of-duty-will-be-worse-on-playstation-if-microsoft-buys-activision-201212041.html">hurt the quality of Call of Duty</a> on PlayStation. Microsoft has made a number of concessions in hopes of clinching the Activision Blizzard takeover, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-makes-its-10-year-call-of-duty-pact-with-nintendo-official-091655095.html">10-year multi-platform promises</a> for Call of Duty as well as arrangements to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-will-bring-call-of-duty-and-its-pc-games-to-a-cloud-service-youve-probably-never-heard-of-171502988.html">bring games to rival cloud platforms</a>.</p><p>The UK overseer's change of heart doesn't overcome resistance to the merger in other countries. The US Federal Trade Commission is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html">suing to block the union</a>, and points out that Microsoft made future titles like <em>Redfall</em> Xbox-exclusive on consoles despite assurances to European Union officials. Objectors can also comment on the findings before the end of March. However, the new stance still improves Microsoft's chances of completing the acquisition — a major regulatory body just dropped its main point of contention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/uk-watchdog-no-longer-thinks-microsofts-activision-blizzard-merger-is-a-threat-to-console-competition-140206114.html?src=rss

<p>Later today, Blizzard will open the gates to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-diablo-4-preview-this-feels-worryingly-good-160026475.html"><em>Diablo IV's</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>long-awaited<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-open-beta-begins-on-march-24th-185933773.html">open beta</a>, allowing anyone to play the action RPG before its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-release-date-030739148.html">June 6th</a> release date. I had a chance to check out the beta during the early access window the studio offered last weekend and came away more excited than ever to play the final game. Nearly three months from release, there's a lot to like about <em>Diablo IV</em>. Combat is fun and impactful, and the game gives you a lot of freedom to play your character the way you want to play them. Add to that a compelling world with top-notch art direction and sound design, and you have what could be the best Diablo game yet. Still, there's more work Blizzard could do around the user interface, and some dungeons could use more variety.&nbsp;</p><div id="635dddabc0e2403097b54aaf9acbcce9"></div><p>If you're jumping into the beta today, Blizzard has <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/expectations-for-the-diablo-iv-open-beta-march-24-26/6276">said</a> players should be ready for lengthy queue times, particularly on Friday afternoon.

## The best eco-friendly phone cases for 2023
 - [https://www.engadget.com/best-eco-friendly-phone-cases-150016494.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/best-eco-friendly-phone-cases-150016494.html?src=rss)

<p>No modern smartphone is completely carbon neutral. Even the most eco-conscious phones are only partially made out of recyclable materials. But you can help cut back on plastic usage by at least purchasing an eco-friendly case to protect your phone from dings and scratches. There are plenty of them, from those that are completely compostable to ones made from ocean-based plastic. Best of all, eco-friendly cases are often just stylish and durable as their mainstream counterparts. Here are our favorites.</p><h2>Pela</h2><p></p><p>Without a doubt, our favorite eco-friendly phone cases are those made by <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BlbGFjYXNlLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjViYzRjMmViLWYyYzQtNGM0Zi05ODk4LTlhNDFlZmVhYzdmNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWL1XLUzxiJWhDQVRbd6nOxiU_W3Lj-SONanCPqj2NGg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpelacase.com%2F">Pela</a>. We absolutely love their colors and designs, plus the fact that the entire line is 100 percent plant-based and compostable. The case material is called “Flaxstic,” which the company says is made from flax straw and compostable bioplastic elastomer. Importantly, it's also free of BPA, phthalates, cadmium and lead. If you ever decide to get rid of it, you can indeed just chuck in a compost bin and it’ll be completely biodegradable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What’s more, Pela cases are available for a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BlbGFjYXNlLmNvbS9wYWdlcy9vdXItcGVsYS1jYXNlLWNvbGxlY3Rpb25zPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWJjNGMyZWItZjJjNC00YzRmLTk4OTgtOWE0MWVmZWFjN2Y0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdUDXH9nIhCENpnx3JwnP6EETXJ-AsTtEj3b0XXs3ZZN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpelacase.com%2Fpages%2Four-pela-case-collections%3F">wide array of handsets</a>. They can accommodate iPhones (from iPhone 5 onwards), Samsung Galaxies (Galaxy S8 and newer), Google Pixels (from the Pixel 3a on) and even some OnePlus and Huawei models.</p><p>For iPhone users, we should note that Pela cases are not MagSafe-compatible by default. Strangely, too, you can only purchase an additional <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BlbGFjYXNlLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9tYWdzYWZlLW1vZHVsZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWJjNGMyZWItZjJjNC00YzRmLTk4OTgtOWE0MWVmZWFjN2Y0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdncKSo3XYQoxLe9Rm2xeMhZPFjtAvBXUk6qWwdAUGtY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpelacase.com%2Fproducts%2Fmagsafe-module">$13 MagSafe module</a> for the iPhone 13 and 14, and not the iPhone 12. Applying it to my phone was pretty straightforward, so that’s not a big concern, but it’s something to keep in mind. And, obviously, the MagSafe module with all its magnets is not compostable; you’ll have to take it off and dispose of it separately.</p><h2>Otterbox LifeProof Wake</h2><p></p><p>LifeProof is a phone case brand that specializes in recycled materials, with each of its products being at least partially made from them. But the most eco-friendly option is the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=bd89df68-d794-46df-9d47-227b1088ae2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OtterBox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiZDg5ZGY2OC1kNzk0LTQ2ZGYtOWQ0Ny0yMjdiMTA4OGFlMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3R0ZXJib3guY29tL2VuLXVzL3dha2Utc2VyaWVzLXJlY3ljbGVkLWNhc2VzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1YmM0YzJlYi1mMmM0LTRjNGYtOTg5OC05YTQxZWZlYWM3ZjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUx0Wt7qeFDsXv-Ph_zIOuBtdlH5VtiHICp1m5DL15u4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fwake-series-recycled-cases">LifeProof Wake</a>, which is made from 85 percent ocean-based recycled plastic. According to the company, a lot of that comes from discarded fishing gear, which would otherwise be a fatal hazard for marine life like sharks and turtles.</p><p>In addition, we’re big fans of the Wake’s design. It comes in four different colors, and features an attractive sculpted wave pattern. It feels sturdy and durable, and LifeProof says it’s drop proof from two meters (roughly six and half feet). Plus, it’s MagSafe-compatible by default. The LifeProof Wake is available for iPhones (iPhone 11 onward), Samsung Galaxies (Galaxy S20 and newer) and Google Pixels (Pixel 4a and up).</p><h2>Casetify Ultra Compostable</h2><p></p><p>Casetify is mostly known for making durable yet stylish phone cases, but it has several eco-friendly options, too. The latest is its <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=881a07b4-2543-4833-9cef-796aa25ceb07&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CASETiFY&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4ODFhMDdiNC0yNTQzLTQ4MzMtOWNlZi03OTZhYTI1Y2ViMDciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FzZXRpZnkuY29tL2Nhc2UtdHlwZS91bHRyYS1jb21wb3N0YWJsZS1jYXNlPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWJjNGMyZWItZjJjNC00YzRmLTk4OTgtOWE0MWVmZWFjN2Y0In0&amp;signature=AQAAASJkJSDAdao9ruUsADoGiTNKwwim7l-Q7FYzyy6vWTQU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.casetify.com%2Fcase-type%2Fultra-compostable-case%3F">Compostable line</a>, which is made with a 100 percent compostable and plant-based material called “Ecotify.” Basically, it’s a blend of bamboo, biopolymers and starch.</p><p>The regular Compostable line has a drop-protection of around four feet, while the Ultra Compostable line, with its extra corner bumpers, has a drop-protection of about 6.6 feet. My recommendation would be to go with the more durable Ultra Compostable option, even if it does cost a bit more.</p><p>Unfortunately, Casetify’s Compostable line is only available for iPhones the (iPhone 7 and up). Casetify does make other kinds of sustainable cases for both the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy handsets (Galaxy S20 and newer), but they’re not compostable. Instead, they’re made from 65 percent recycled materials. Plus, Casetify offers the option to return your old case, which they’ll then reuse or up-cycle to create a new one, thus reducing waste.</p><p>The biggest perk of Casetify’s cases is that they’re very customizable. Not only can you pick out your favorite bumper colors and designs (Casetify regularly partners with brands and illustrators to come up with unique styles), but you can actually add engravings to them too. You can also choose to add even more protection with thicker bumpers (Casetify says the “<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=881a07b4-2543-4833-9cef-796aa25ceb07&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CASETiFY&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4ODFhMDdiNC0yNTQzLTQ4MzMtOWNlZi03OTZhYTI1Y2ViMDciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FzZXRpZnkuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3QvcGhvbmUtY2FzZS1jdXN0b21pemF0aW9uP3V0bV90ZXJtPWJvdW5jZSZrZXl3b3JkPWJvdW5jZSYjLzE2MDA0NzYxIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1YmM0YzJlYi1mMmM0LTRjNGYtOTg5OC05YTQxZWZlYWM3ZjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaf3sK91cT45rS96wm2UP6KSPMp43q-xvkeukvbR-B8U&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.casetify.com%2Fproduct%2Fphone-case-customization%3Futm_term%3Dbounce%26keyword%3Dbounce%26%23%2F16004761">Bounce Case</a>” offers a 13-foot drop protection).</p><h2>Incipio Organicore</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c818c9f6-c244-44c6-b497-a88f415f1bd8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Incipio&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODE4YzlmNi1jMjQ0LTQ0YzYtYjQ5Ny1hODhmNDE1ZjFiZDgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmNpcGlvLmNvbS9wYWdlcy9vcmdhbmljb3JlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1YmM0YzJlYi1mMmM0LTRjNGYtOTg5OC05YTQxZWZlYWM3ZjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZ3CkW9QPjBakEE5O0pBz3OEXJg_Fm5ngGQE1PW6ah-T&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fincipio.com%2Fpages%2Forganicore">Incipio’s Organicore line of cases</a> is one of the most attractive we’ve seen, plus they are 100 percent compostable.

Most Organicore cases will protect your handset from drops from up to eight feet, and we like the way their raised edges defend against accidental bumps and dings. There are also MagSafe options available, so you can still use your iPhone with magnetic accessories without taking your case off.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-eco-friendly-phone-cases-150016494.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: What TikTok's CEO told Congress about the app’s ties to China

<p>It turned into a five-hour <a href="https://www.engadget.com/heres-what-tiktoks-ceo-told-congress-about-the-apps-ties-to-china-and-teen-safety-201657076.html">showdown</a> between TikTok CEO Shou Chew and US lawmakers, who have found suspicion of TikTok to be a rare source of bipartisan agreement. It comes as US officials told the company they could ban the app if it doesn’t separate itself from ByteDance.</p><p>As with previous hearings with social media executives, lawmakers pressed Chew for often impossible yes-no answers to complex questions and grew frustrated when he declined to give one. In one exchange, Representative Tony Cardenas asked Chew whether ByteDance was a Chinese company. He would only admit it was a “global” firm with a Chinese founder. The hearing was also notably different from previous hearings with other social media company CEOs because the vast majority of lawmakers are not active on TikTok. Not all of their questions were nuanced, either: Representative Richard Hudson demanded to know if TikTok can “access the home WiFi network.” TikTok’s future remains uncertain, Chinese officials said Thursday they opposed a sale of the social network.</p><p>– Mat Smith.</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

According to the SEC, eight celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, Soulja Boy, Ne-Yo and Akon, illegally promoted the tokens online without disclosing they were paid to do so.

## PayPal launches passkey logins for Android web in the US

<p>PayPal is <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-03-23-Secure-Payments-with-Passkeys-Is-Now-Available-on-PayPal-for-Google-Android-Devices">expanding access</a> to passkey logins to Android users in the US, so long as they access the website on the Chrome browser. The payment processor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paypal-adds-passkey-support-150043721.html">first introduced passkey logins</a> for Apple's computers and tablets running macOS Ventura and iPadOS16 in October last year. Google had yet to release stable passkey support for Android and Chrome at the time, but PayPal promised to make the password alternative available to other platforms and countries in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>By December last year, passkeys rolled out to stable Chrome. Now PayPal is making good on its promise, with some limitations. The login option isn't available for the payment processor's Android app yet, and users can only activate it if they're using Chrome on a device running Android 9.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new authentication technology allows users to access websites and services that support it without having to type in usernames and passwords. While it can use biometric authentication to verify a user's identity, it's not quite the same as current login tech that auto-populates login boxes using facial or fingerprint recognition. The technology creates a cryptographic key pair — one public and one private — that becomes associated with a user's account. Apps and services that support passkeys use the public key to confirm a person's identity by matching it to the private key, which is kept in the user's device. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23653501/paypal-passkey-login-android-chrome"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, some password managers can now sync passkeys between devices, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>To activate passkeys for PayPal on Android, eligible users have to log in the traditional way on a Chrome browser first. Then, the option to &quot;create a passkey&quot; will appear, and they will be prompted to verify their identity using their biometrics or their phone's passcode. After they're done setting up, they'll find that they'll no longer have to type in anything to quickly check out purchases with PayPal on Chrome. Passkeys also provide stronger security, since they're resistant to phishing. And, since one of the key pairs is kept on the user's device, people's login information won't be compromised in case of an app or service data breach.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/paypal-launches-passkey-logins-for-android-web-in-the-us-070157855.html?src=rss

To keep your blue checkmark on Twitter, individuals can sign up for Twitter Blue here: <a href="https://t.co/gzpCcwOpLp">https://t.co/gzpCcwOpLp</a><br /><br />Organizations can sign up for <a href="https://t.co/RlN5BbuGA3">https://t.co/RlN5BbuGA3</a>…</p>— Twitter Verified (@verified) <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1639029459557679104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Now, it seems the time has come for legacy verified users to lose their blue ticks — that is, if Twitter isn't merely laying groundwork for an April Fools' joke. Musk, after all, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/musk-says-he-thinks-he-s-funny-gets-tesla-free-press-with-humor?sref=10lNAhZ9">thinks he's funny</a>. It's also unclear if the website plans to yank their verified checkmarks all at once or in batches. We'd reach out to the company to ask for clarification, but then all we'd get back in response is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/twitter-elon-musk-poop-emoji">poop emoji</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter's announcement for legacy verified user came just as Blue subscriptions became <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-subscriptions-are-now-available-worldwide-211835305.html">available worldwide</a>. Previously only accessible within certain regions, this rollout brings the service within reach of most people. In addition to getting a blue tick next to their usernames, paying subscribers will be able to make 4,000-character tweets, edit their posts and enjoy higher reply rankings. Expanding Blue's availability is necessary if Twitter wants to achieve Musk's goal of getting half its revenue from subscriptions. We'll just have to wait and see whether enough people around the world are willing to pay $8 per month (or $11, if they pay through the iOS app) for its perks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-says-its-killing-legacy-verified-checkmarks-starting-on-april-1st-035927238.html?src=rss
