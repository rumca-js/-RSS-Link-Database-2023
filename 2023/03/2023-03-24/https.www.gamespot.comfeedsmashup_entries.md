<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4116409-fortnitecreative2uefndemo.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>After a long wait and multiple delays, the Unreal Editor for Fortnite and Fortnite's Creative 2.0 are finally very real and in the wild. We're still in the extremely early days of this, of course, with most creators only just getting started with the new UEFN tools. But Epic did allow some creators access to the tools early, and it also put together a few Creative 2.0 tech demos of its own to show off what UEFN can do--so we've got a few maps that are ready for you to try out right this moment.</p><p dir="ltr">Again, though, we're still in the very early days of this. So you're not going to see anything too mindblowing just yet. Most of what we have for you today are simply much nicer, cleaner, and better versions of the kinds of things folks have been building in Creative mode for years: individual deathmatch maps, competitive Cookie Clicker-style games, and a fancy Color Switch map. With a much higher memory limit and the ability to include custom assets, these old modes feel new again.</p><p dir="ltr">But we've also got some peeks at the greater potential of Creative 2.0, like some 2D platformers, a rough recreation of the original Chapter 1 Battle Royale island, and a couple of demos from Epic that feature far better graphics than we've ever had in Fortnite before.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, nothing made in UEFN offers battle pass XP yet, but it's still worth it to see what Epic hopes is the next big step toward its metaverse vision. Below you'll find all the new UEFN maps we think are worth checking out for at least a few minutes. Frankly, there are already more than we expected, and that's a very good thing.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Atlas OG Battle Royale by AtlasCreative</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4116414-atlasogbattleroyalefortnite.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Island code: 2179-7822-3395</p><p dir="ltr">Probably the most talked about new map is Atlas's attempt to recreate the Chapter 1 Battle Royale island as it existed when Battle Royale mode first launched in 2017. They couldn't really do a 1:1 recreation within the memory limits of Creative 2.0, and, frankly, that original island is so much worse than pretty much every iteration that we've had since then anyway. And also this recreation is super buggy and doesn't actually work most of the time--I've only been able to play two real rounds out of more than a dozen attempts.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, it's pretty amusing to be able to drop in on the old stomping grounds and see how far we've come since then--the team also removed modern quality-of-life features like sprinting and sliding. I just hope you're excited to get boxed up by some OG players who never moved off build mode. As somebody who moved to Zero Build a year ago and never looked back, that's how all my rounds on this map have ended.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4116422-fortnitecreativecolorswitch.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Island code: 1415-7321-0392</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite Creative folks love a game of Color Switch, where players stand on a grid of colored squares and the game tells them which color to stand on--if you're on the wrong color, you lose. But while this is a bog-standard Creative map from a gameplay perspective, this Katamari-esque giant playroom map is much cooler and more elaborate looking than anything they could have built in the past.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pirate Adventure by 3D Lab</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4116415-fortnitecreative2pirateadventure.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Island code: 2810-0903-5967</p><p dir="ltr">This chill little crafting RPG game is about a pirate (you) who crashes on a deserted island and has to build up a little town, visit other islands and do quests, hang out with skeleton people, find treasure, and do various other pirate-related things. It's surprisingly robust and impressively seamless--Pirate Adventure is a great example of how much more stable UEFN levels can be. Unfortunately, you can't save your progress yet, so it's best if you don't tool around with it too much until that feature is added--which the team said is in the works. But you should at least mess with it long enough to start exploring the other islands, which will only take a few minutes.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Gemstone Tycoon by Infinity.Studios</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4116426-fortnitegemstonetycoon.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Island code 6265-7588-5080</p><p dir="ltr">This is a classic Creative mode: Get your Cookie Clicker-esque factory auto-mining resources while you fight with competing factory workers for special items. There's nothing special about this at all in terms of gameplay, but the presentation here is on a whole new level with the factory actually operating, with automated assembly line animations and everything, and it increases in speed and efficiency as you upgrade it. If you don't normally hang out in Creative maps then this little aesthetic bonus won't mean much to you, but I promise this is a very cool quality-of-life improvement.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Deserted: Domination by Epic</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4116411-fortnitecallofduty.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Island code: 8035-1519-2959</p><p dir="ltr">A simple deathmatch with control points and a comical 2007 grim-and-gritty filter giving the whole thing a very Call of Duty look, Deserted is a legitimately fun map for shooting folks on. And also hilarious because of how dramatically it departs from the normal Fortnite aesthetic--which is the point, of course.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Reclamation by TeamAlliance</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4116412-fortnitereclamation.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Island code: 1135-0371-8937</p><p>This one features many of the same ideas as Deserted, but with only a single control point that periodically moves--and also a completely different aesthetic, with a more mossy ruins kind of vibe.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ninja Battles 5v5 by BrendannnD</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4116410-fortniteninjabattles.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Island code: 5227-8658-2604</p><p dir="ltr">Ninja Battles is a simple melee-based control point mode, but what's really interesting about it is the way it has a sort of custom weapon system. You use the signal remotes to turn yourself into a whirlwind that has a special combat ability based on which ninja type you choose. It's a bit janky and unintuitive, but this is the only current UEFN map that even tries something like that--so it's worth taking a look at.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2D sidescroller proof-of-concepts maps</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4116413-fortnitecreativeuefnsidescroller.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Pyramid Platformer Demo by spankysully: 0762-7326-5726</p><p>Droopy Flops by Infinity.Studios: 3638-6410-4991</p><p dir="ltr">There are two maps featuring arcade cabinets (and nothing else interactable) that will let you play some 2D sidescrollers that were made in UEFN. Neither of them--Pyramid Platformer is a standard 2.5D platformer, and Droopy Flops is a Flappy Bird clone--is actually much of a real game, but rather proof-of-concept creations that make us excited for the future.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Gorgeous tech demos</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4116419-fortnitenarutovsdragon.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Forest Guardian: 0348-4438-3263</p><p dir="ltr">The Space Inside: 9836-7381-5978</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, we've got these two tech demo walking simulator-type games with hyper-realistic graphics. Each is just a few minutes long and contains no meaningful gameplay, but they're both exciting looks at how great it'll be to wear our stupid skins in all the new types of experiences that UEFN will eventually bring us. These two demos make me feel a little better about all the money I've spent on this game.</p></h3></p><br />

## Funko Has Laid Off Most Of Mondo, Killing Off Its Movie Poster Business - Report

<p>It's the end of an era for movie fans, as Mondo will reportedly no longer produce unique and stylish movie posters. Mondo's parent company, Funko, has apparently laid off most of the staff at the Austin-based company and killing off its poster division.</p><p>According to sources who spoke to <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/funko-mondo-layoffs-posters-cease-production/">TheWrap</a>, Mondo co-founders Rob Jones and Mitch Putnam were also laid off and the company's division for cutting-edge experiences and products, The Lab, has been shut down. Only the toys and records divisions remain, but as the sources explained, it's not clear how long they'll be around for.</p><p>Funko purchased Mondo less than a year ago from Alamo Drafthouse, adding a brand to its portfolio that had built a cult following over the years by producing cinematic fine art across limited-edition movie posters, vinyl records, and licensed action figures. Some of Mondo's movie posters have become highly sought-after in the collector's community, and the company's recent venture into records saw it put an artistic spin on famous movie soundtracks, packing these discs in beautifully designed slipcases.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/funko-has-laid-off-most-of-mondo-killing-off-its-movie-poster-business-report/1100-6512702/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Why Xbox Game Pass Is So Attractive For Devs, Whether It Cannibalizes Sales Or Not

<p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass has quickly taken hold in the industry, representing a strategic shift for Microsoft that eschews a key part of the traditional model of console competition: namely, directly buying games. The subscription service offers an all-you-can-eat buffet of games from Microsoft itself, as well as third-party developers that Microsoft has partnered with to host its games. But how much does it benefit developers?</p><p dir="ltr">That question hasn't been answered clearly, especially since the answer seems to vary by studios and the terms of agreements are not disclosed. Microsoft has not specified exactly how it makes deals, but comments from various developers suggest that it tailors the terms of each deal individually. Xbox head Phil Spencer told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast">The Verge</a> that the deals are "all over the place."

<p>The max level in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> beta is 25, which might not seem like too high of a cap at first glance. However, as you go through the game's prologue and start to complete main story quests and dungeons, you'll quickly realize that your XP bar trudges along quite slowly as you begin to increase your character's level. As a result, players might be curious if there is anything they can do on their end to earn more XP and reach max level quicker in the Diablo 4 beta. In this guide, we'lll be going over the best ways to earn XP in the beta so you can max out your character, earn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-beta-cosmetics-titles-guide/1100-6512482/">all beta rewards and cosmetics</a>, and start to take on the harder tasks in Diablo 4.</p><h2>Complete the main story missions</h2><p>We're starting off with an obvious one, but it's a tip that some players do tend to forget. There aren't too many main story quests in the Diablo 4 beta, but there are enough to keep you busy for several hours. When you make it to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-kyovashad-hub-city-guide/1100-6512473/">hub city of Kyovashad</a>, parts of you may be tempted to go out and explore the region of Fractured Peaks while putting the main story off.</p><figure style="width: 2560px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4116360-diabloiv.exescreenshot2023.03.24-13.29.56.90.png"><img alt="Main story missions are a great source of XP.

By completing all of the main story missions quickly, you not only get to explore the world and discover different waypoints and dungeons, but you'll be earning a ton of XP along the way. In addition to that, the main quests reward you with gold and unique gear, which can help you get through the first 15 levels or so before you start unlocking better gear.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-level-up-fast-best-ways-to-earn-xp/1100-6512696/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Druid has finally been unlocked in the Diablo 4 beta after being locked for the first weekend. Now, all players have access to the shape-shifting class, which has not been available in the series since Diablo 2. As such, many players have likely never gotten to experience life as an animal whisperer in Sanctuary. Of course, the Druid's skills and abilities have seen an overhaul since the class was last seen in the series, so even veterans will need to re-learn how to play as the Druid.</p><p>In this guide, we will be providing a full overview of all of the skills available to the Druid class in the Diablo 4 beta.</p><h2>Diablo 4 Druid Basic Skills</h2><p><strong>Earth Spike - </strong>Sunder the earth, impaling the first enemy hit.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-druid-skills-guide/1100-6512695/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>All it took was one bad night to reawaken the Bogeyman, but three films and scores of dead bodies later, John Wick has cemented his legacy as one of the deadliest killers in all of cinema. So just how many people has one enraged assassin put six feet under?</p><p>According to the calculations at Fandom, Wick's various killing sprees since he came out of retirement have resulted in 302 people killed <em>or </em>defeated in combat across the first three films in the series. The second film has the highest kill-count, with 123 people meeting their end, and 70% of all kills came from a well-executed headshot.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">'Tick Tock, Mr. Wick'<br />We calculated <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JohnWick?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#JohnWick</a>'s insane kill stats and more, ahead of 'Chapter 4's release<br />🔫 <a href="https://t.co/gn9TLnEhU9">https://t.co/gn9TLnEhU9</a> <a href="https://t.co/ptBV4hK08Q">pic.twitter.com/ptBV4hK08Q</a></p>  — Fandom (@getFANDOM) <a href="https://twitter.com/getFANDOM/status/1639295137321996288?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">March 24, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>26 types of different guns were used to reduce the assassin gig economy to single digits, 22 people died from sword, knife, and pencil attacks, and for unique weapons, Wick managed to get a single kill each with a book and a horse.

## How Long To Beat Resident Evil 4 Remake

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> will have you battling numerous hostiles, amassing countless treasures, solving tricky puzzles, and discovering new secrets. But you might be wondering just how much time you need to invest for a single clear. Here's our guide to help you find out how long it takes to beat Resident Evil 4.</p><h2>How long is Resident Evil 4?</h2><p>Resident Evil 4 Remake adds a lot to the groundbreaking original game, but <strong>those who are just interested in the critical path can expect a playthrough of about 12 hours, </strong>roughly the same as the 2005 game's runtime. With many optional side quests, collectibles, and upgrades to chase off the beaten path, however, a 100% playthrough could take considerably longer--closer <strong>25 hours or more</strong>--while a playthrough that consists of the main story plus <em>some</em> but not all side content on Standard difficulty--the way most players will likely play--will come in around <strong>15-20 hours</strong>.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4116321-4116170-residentevil4howlongtobeat-1.jpg"><img alt="Your runtime through Resident Evil 4 Remake depends on how often you stray from the main path." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4116321-4116170-residentevil4howlongtobeat-1.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Your runtime through Resident Evil 4 Remake depends on how often you stray from the main path.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it's worth noting that Resident Evil 4 also has challenges to keep players engaged. One of these, Sprinter, requires you to <strong>complete the game in eight hours</strong>. It's fairly lenient for a speedrun, especially when you consider that you can unlock New Game Plus, as well as powerful bonus items, down the line. As such, a 15- to 20-hour run on your first attempt, at Standard difficulty, is perfectly fine. And, if you wish to rush through everything in subsequent playthroughs, maybe eight hours or less for the challenge, you can do just that.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign/1100-6512671/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Shazam! Fury of the Gods has only been out a week and the backstage goings-on have brought out numerous discussions about what exactly went wrong.

Actor Zachary Levi went on the defensive blaming <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/dwayne-johnson-black-adam-shazam-dc-universe/">Dwayne Johnson for sabotaging Shazam's proposed post-credit</a> sequence of his character joining the Justice Society--and that's just the start.</p><p>The actor took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CqJt04RoW90/">Instagram live</a> and soon clarified what he meant and confirmed the plans, listing DC films higher-ups, including former president Walter Hamada, and how this was the original scenario set in place, but was "thwarted" and couldn't use certain characters used in Black Adam.</p><p>"I may or may not have, you know, reposted something in my stories about a story that I had nothing to do with, that [The Wrap] had reported on," Levi said (via <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/zachary-levi-shazam-2-plans-thwarted-comic-book-films-serious-1235563593/">Variety</a>). "And then I got flack about it because people were saying, 'What are you doing? You're trying to blame this guy because your movie's not doing well' Listen, I haven't blamed anybody. There's not one single person that I have blamed for anything about the way that our movie has performed."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zachary-levi-says-shazam-2-credits-scene-was-thwarted/1100-6512693/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Quicksilver Storm, one of the more versatile Exotic weapons in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>, has been broken since the launch of the Lightfall expansion.

And you tie him to these amazing visuals. You can already tell from the John Wick films that I love color and I love composition," Stahelski told <a href="https://discussingfilm.net/2023/03/23/chad-stahelski-on-raising-the-bar-in-john-wick-chapter-4-exclusive-interview/">Discussing Film</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Root of Nightmares raid is one of the more mechanically challenging PvE activities in the game, but it's also one with a surprisingly easy final encounter provided that your team has a Warlock who can activate their Well of Radiance Super. Thanks to an issue in the raid, using that Super will result in Nezarec not always responding to a fireteam when they stand inside of that empowering zone, and fireteams can easily take down the raid boss in one or two turns when they concentrate their attacks.</p><p>Bungie plans to address that issue in a future update, as the developer explained that Nezarec will live up to his title as the Final God of Pain once his behavior has been adjusted. "While it is our philosophy to avoid making dramatic tuning changes to an activity once it is live, we feel it better to address the responsiveness of the boss and accept that it may alter current strategies and increased the level of challenge," <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab_03_23_23">Bungie explained</a>.</p><p>Bungie added that a jump pad issue, specifically in the second Scission encounter, has been unintentionally eliminating players, with the culprit behind this bug being high frame rates. This issue is currently being investigated and will be addressed in a future patch.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-raid-root-of-nightmares-gets-master-difficulty-and-a-tougher-nezarec-boss-fight-soon/1100-6512672/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> has several weapons that you can acquire throughout the course of the campaign. They'll be of great use to you when you take down hordes of infected. Likewise, they can be upgraded, including some exclusive perks that provide nifty boosts.

Most can be purchased from the Merchant as you progress further in the campaign. You can either buy them using pesetas, or exchange the Spinels you acquire via request completions. Likewise, some weapons allow certain attachments to be slotted in, which are equipped by selecting them in your inventory and clicking on the Parts option.</p><p>As for upgrades, the most common types are power (i.e., damage dealt), rate-of-fire, ammo capacity (i.e., how much ammo is in the mag), and reload speed. Once you've maxed out all upgrades, you can unlock the unique boost for that weapon. Alternatively, you can get the <strong>Exclusive Upgrade Ticket </strong>from the Merchant, which costs 30 Spinels. This, along with some pesetas, will let you unlock the weapon's unique perk regardless of the armament's overall level.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-weapons-guide/1100-6512557/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a>, much like the rest of the franchise, emphasizes the use of herbs to heal your characters. Yellow Herbs, in particular, tend to be very important, as they're the only way for you to increase your maximum HP. Here's our Resident Evil 4 Yellow Herbs guide to help you find all the possible health upgrades in the campaign.</p><h2 id="Resident_Evil_4_Yellow_Herbs_guide">Resident Evil 4 Yellow Herbs guide</h2><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Resident Evil 4 Yellow Herbs guide</a></li></ul></div><p>The Resident Evil 4 Yellow Herbs can't be used on their own. Instead, you'll have to mix them with a concoction, preferably one that already has a Green Herb and Red Herb mixed in. This is because a Green and Red Herb combination will heal you to almost full HP and, <strong>when a Yellow Herb is added, you'll also be granted its permanent max HP boost segment</strong>.</p><p>Likewise, you'll want to pay attention to the Merchant's Trade panel, since he also sells a Yellow Herb in exchange for 3x Spinels (a currency obtained by completing requests). In any case, we've divided our Resident Evil 4 Yellow Herbs guide into several sections depending on the main zones and areas.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-yellow-herbs-guide/1100-6512556/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

This leads to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-del-lago-boss-guide/1100-6512577/"><strong>Del Lago boss fight</strong></a>.

Make sure you sell it to the Merchant to complete the sidequest. You'll receive 3x Spinel for your troubles. Likewise, don't forget to pick up some other stuff in this location, such as some regular eggs (which can be used for a bit of healing), as well as a Velvet Blue item (for selling).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-gold-chicken-egg/1100-6512573/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> has many valuable items that you can sell to earn pesetas. While some are out in the open, others will require a bit more work, such as Locked Drawers. You might see one early on in the Village Square, which you won't be open until you find a Small Key. Here's our Resident Evil 4 Locked Drawers and Small Keys guide to help you find them in the campaign. Likewise, you can learn more in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-treasures-gemstones-guide-hub/1100-6512562/"><strong>Treasures and Gemstones hub</strong></a>.</p><h2 id="Resident_Evil_4_Locked_Drawers_and_Small_Keys_guide">Resident Evil 4 Locked Drawers and Small Keys guide</h2><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Resident Evil 4 Locked Drawers and Small Keys guide</a><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Locked Drawer locations</a></li></ul></div><p>As mentioned above, the Resident Evil 4 Locked Drawers each require a Small Key so they can be opened (each key will be discarded upon a single use).

<p>The Mural Cave is one of the locations in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a>. You'll stumble upon this area after beating the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-del-lago-boss-guide/1100-6512577/"><strong>Del Lago boss</strong></a>, whereupon you'll have to find a couple of important items. This will, eventually, lead you to the Church proper. Here's our Resident Evil 4 Mural Cave Puzzle and Church Puzzle guide to help you complete this section of the campaign.</p><h2>Resident Evil 4 Mural Cave Puzzle and Church Puzzle guide</h2><p>As mentioned above, the Resident Evil 4 Mural Cave Puzzle is accessed once you're done with the Del Lago encounter. This will take you to a pier where you have to run from a couple of enemy mobs. Soon, you'll reach the Mural Cave. The shrine in the center has the key you need, but you still need to find two items. A nearby drawing on the cave wall will mark the two locations on your map.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4115547-residentevil4muralcavepuzzlechurchpuzzleguide-1.jpg"><img alt="Mural Cave and puzzle locations map" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4115547-residentevil4muralcavepuzzlechurchpuzzleguide-1.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Mural Cave and puzzle locations map</figcaption></figure><h3>Location #1</h3><p>Before you do anything else, return to the Dockyard, the one with the Merchant and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-shooting-gallery-charms-guide/1100-6512581/"><strong>Shooting Gallery</strong></a>. You'll want to do a manual save in case things go awry. Anyway, once you're ready, head to the nearby location and dock at the pier. The gate is locked, so you'd have to circle around while battling numerous cursed villagers.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-mural-cave-church-puzzle-guide/1100-6512567/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> is comprised of 16 chapters, spread across three major zones. As you progress, you'll battle enemies, collect loot, and discover secrets. However, once you have to go to the next zone, you won't be able to return to the previous one. Here's our Resident Evil 4 points of no return guide to help prepare you for these important sections in the campaign.</p><h2>Resident Evil 4 points of no return guide</h2><p>The Resident Evil 4 points of no return can be categorized into two types: <strong>soft lock and hard lock</strong>. Yes, we're using these terms as they feel appropriate. Basically, a soft lock is when you'll be unable to return to a specific area, but you can still freely explore the rest of the zone. A hard lock, meanwhile, will completely prevent you from returning to the previous zone.</p><p>As such, we've outlined these segments in our Resident Evil 4 points of no return guide. Make sure you have a manual save in case you miss out on any treasures, requests, or other notable challenges. <strong>Take note that this guide necessarily contains spoilers</strong>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-points-of-no-return-guide/1100-6512670/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> has the Shooting Gallery activities. These minigames can be found in several areas that you'll visit during the campaign, often right next to one of the Merchant's hubs. Each particular area has its own challenges where you get to use specific weapons and, if you meet the target scores, you'll earn tokens that can be exchanged for rewards. Here's our Resident Evil 4 Shooting Gallery, Charms, and Gold Tokens guide to help you with these minigames.</p><h2>Resident Evil 4 Shooting Gallery, Charms, and Gold Tokens guide</h2><p>The Resident Evil 4 Shooting Gallery minigames are found in specific sections in major zones. These are denoted by an elevator next to the Merchant and, when you ride it, it'll take you to the activity area. Here's what you need to know about the mechanics:</p><ul><li>Each Shooting Gallery has three challenges, with specific weapons that need to be used. In some cases, two or more weapons are provided. For instance, you'd have to rapidly shoot a line of hostiles with the TMP, then switch to the shotgun if enemies are bunched up next to each other.</li><li>Weapons have unlimited ammo, and they won't affect your normal ammo count while you're normally exploring.</li><li>The goal is to shoot the cutouts of enemies that appear (i.e., pirates, dogs, and the like) within the time limit. You'll also earn bonus points if you shoot any skulls attached to targets.</li><li>If a cutout has a stick of dynamite, you can shoot that to instantly destroy all targets.</li><li>From time to time, civilians will also appear, which are meant to trick you. Avoid shooting them or you'll be penalized (-500 points).</li><li>When you reach a new Shooting Gallery, the previous challenges will still be selectable.</li></ul><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4115884-residentevil4shootinggallerycharmsgoldtokensguide-1.jpg"><img alt="Shooting the skulls will take out that target, while also netting you some extra points.

<p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> Verdugo boss presents two options: fight or flight. As you make your way through the Castle's Depths/Underground Laboratory, this creature will stalk you. You can either do everything you can to avoid it, or finish it off for good. Here's our Resident Evil 4 Verdugo boss guide to help you defeat this opponent.</p><h2>Resident Evil 4 Verdugo boss guide</h2><p>The Resident Evil 4 Verdugo boss guide is primarily about understanding the layout of the area. The Underground Laboratory has winding corridors, and around four <strong>liquid nitrogen canisters</strong>. Make note of their locations, since they'll be important later on. Halfway through, a short cutscene will play, where you'll see that the Verdugo is stalking you. Then, at the very end, there are two instances where you have to press Circle/B on your gamepad to dodge its tentacle attacks. Once you turn on the power for the elevator, an autosave will trigger. Soon, the Verdugo will show itself.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4116035-residentevil4verdugoguide-1.jpg"><img alt="Every liquid nitrogen pipe you see in the tunnels will be integral for the upcoming battle." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4116035-residentevil4verdugoguide-1.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Every liquid nitrogen pipe you see in the tunnels will be integral for the upcoming battle.</figcaption></figure><h3>Verdugo's attacks</h3><p>Technically, you don't need to kill the Resident Evil 4 Verdugo boss. If you want, you can simply wait until the elevator arrives to ride it back to the surface. But this is easier said than done due to your opponent's relentless nature.

<p>There are many valuable items that you can discover in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a>. Some are seen out in the open and others drop as loot. Likewise, there are also those that are found in ornate containers, requiring a specific key or contraption before they can be unlocked. Here's our Resident Evil 4 Wayshrines and Cubic Device guide to help you with these mechanisms.

That's because these contraptions pertain to two of the zones in the game world: Wayshrines are found in the Village, whereas Cubic Devices are found in the Castle. While you'll stumble upon these containers early on, you'll only acquire the keys later in your run. The difference here is that, unlike the Small Keys that open <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-locked-drawers-small-keys-guide/1100-6512563/"><strong>Locked Drawers</strong></a>, the Wayshrine and Cubic Device items won't be consumed with just a single use.</p><h3 id="Village_Wayshrine_locations_and_rewards">Village Wayshrine locations and rewards</h3><p>The Resident Evil 4 Wayshrines can be opened by the Old Wayshrine Key.
