In today's Daily Fix:

Resident Evil 4 Remake arrives today and if you blow through the game's story by Monday, you'll have more to play in just a few weeks. The game's Mercenaries mode is arriving via a free update in April. In the ongoing drama between Microsoft and Sony regarding Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority are now saying they're convinced Microsoft will not make Call of Duty console-exclusive to Xbox. The CMA still has other worries regarding the buyout, but that's one significant step in Microsoft's favor. And in Diablo news, the public beta is live this weekend, but don't be surprised if you get stuck in a long queue. According to the devs, the queues are intentional, as they're needed to stress test parts of the game.

We are playing the original GameCube release of Resident Evil 4 split between a modern television for capture and a CRT to recreate the original experience.

Check out the teaser for Amityville: An Origin Story, an upcoming four-part horror documentary series premiering on MGM+ on April 23, 2023.

Amityville: An Origin Story tells the story behind the world’s most infamous haunted house tale: the Amityville murders. The project is the first elevated look at every aspect of this wildly layered story about the heinous murder of a family of six that became eclipsed by paranormal controversy.  

The 1979 blockbuster film, The Amityville Horror, inspired by the book of the same title by Jay Anson spawned an ever-expanding universe of movies, books, supernatural theories, and horror superfans. But the mass murder behind the hauntings—and its alleged ties to organized crime—left a long trail of questions that have never been fully explored. 

Rooted in the dark cultural undercurrents of the 1970s, the series features firsthand accounts from witnesses, family members, and former investigators appearing on-camera for the first time. Exclusive archival footage, newly unearthed images, and original photography are woven together for a compelling and comprehensive telling of the Amityville story. The series is executive produced by Lesley Chilcott, Blaine Duncan, Brooklyn Hudson, Amanda Raymond, Rhett Bachner, and Brien Meagher. It is directed and executive produced by Jack Riccobono.
