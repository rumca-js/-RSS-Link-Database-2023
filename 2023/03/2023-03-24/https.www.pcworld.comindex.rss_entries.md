<p>The Nacon Rig 800 Pro HX is a gaming headset with a prominent bass profile and Dolby Atmos support for immersive 3D audio that sounds especially great in FPS games. It&rsquo;s also lightweight, comfortable, and comes with quick 2.4GHz wireless connectivity and a convenient base station for charging.</p>



<p>Despite having an all-plastic frame, it feels very robust and sports a modern look you&rsquo;re never going to tire of. With its only two main drawbacks being fiddly ear cups and no dedicated software app, it&rsquo;s a solid option for serious or causal gamers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/820791/best-wireless-gaming-headsets.html">best wireless gaming headsets</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a wireless gaming headset, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="nacon-rig-800-pro-hx-design-and-build">Nacon RIG 800 Pro HX design and build</h2>



<p>The Nacon Rig 800 Pro HX is made from a selection of materials that seem quite contradictory. On the one hand it sports a plastic frame instead of a metal one and an unassuming mesh material for its outer ear cups, yet the rims are surrounded by a plush, premium leatherette that&rsquo;s remarkably tactile.</p>



<p>Was this an arbitrary decision by Nacon? A cost-cutting venture, perhaps? Admittedly, those thoughts did cross my mind, but any reservations completely melted away as soon as I put it on&mdash;it was just so comfortable and practical for gaming.</p>



<p>The biggest selling point for me was its light weight&mdash;the plastic keeps it down to a lowly 290 grams, which means it&rsquo;s almost imperceptible on your head, even during marathon gaming sessions&mdash;which is precisely what Nacon intended it for.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Gamers who play FPS titles like <em>Halo Infinite</em>, <em>Metro Exodus</em>, and newer titles in the <em>Battlefield</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em> franchises, are in for a treat, since they&rsquo;ll reap the full benefit of this headset&rsquo;s Dolby Atmos support.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The mesh fabric too was a nice addition that you just don&rsquo;t see in headsets with leatherette ear cups. It felt cool against my ears and prevented my cups getting all sweaty and greasy through a few stinking-hot 86-degree days.</p>



<p>The other various components deserve praise too; features like the self-adjustable headband that distributes weight horizontally across the whole width of your scalp rather than centering it uncomfortably at one point&mdash;and the controls on the left ear cup, which have just the right amount of tension for precise tuning. &nbsp;</p>



<p>My review unit had a volume wheel, a game/party wheel for use with Xbox, an on/off button, and a mute mic button, so there was plenty of on-ear control at my fingertips when I needed it.</p>



<p>The ear cups are a little different from the slide-down type you see in some headsets. They don&rsquo;t swivel and come fully detachable. To adjust them, you have to take them out then slot them into one of three holes in the headset&rsquo;s outer frame.</p>



<h2 id="nacon-rig-800-pro-hx-connectivity-and-microphone">Nacon RIG 800 Pro HX connectivity and microphone</h2>



<p>My 800 Pro HX review unit&rsquo;s packaging came with the iconic green and white Xbox logos denoting its compatibility with Xbox One and Xbox X/S, as well as PC, all with Dolby Atmos support. But you can also purchase a version that&rsquo;s compatible with PC and PlayStation, or one with PC, Mac, and PlayStation compatibility.</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity is via a low-latency 2.4GHz USB-A Wi-Fi adapter that you can either connect directly to your device or insert into the headset&rsquo;s multifunction base station. Both options gave me a signal that was quick and responsive and worked up to 10 meters away.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nacon RIG 800 Pro HX" class="wp-image-1656616" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230314_162923.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The RIG 800 Pro HX&rsquo;s base station charges the device between games.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The base station also charges the headset&rsquo;s 1,800mAH battery, or alternatively you can plug the USB cable directly into the headset itself. Charging takes approximately seven hours to reach full capacity, which gives you roughly 24 hours of playtime.</p>



<p>A uni-directional noise-cancelling microphone is located on the left ear cup and has flip-to-mute functionality, which I found really useful for switching between my team chats and speaking to family. I was pleased to see the mic has a really clean signature, keeping distortion to an absolute minimum. The end is made from a flexible material so you can position it exactly where you want it.</p>



<h2 id="nacon-rig-800-pro-hx-software">Nacon RIG 800 Pro HX software</h2>



<p>Regrettably, the Rig 800 Pro HX doesn&rsquo;t have its own dedicated app, but you can download the Dolby Atmos software app, which gives you some control over how the headset sounds. For example, you can make footsteps more prominent by switching the <em>Performance Mode</em> setting from off to on, or optimize sounds in the high-, mid-, or low-frequency range by choosing one of the <em>Intelligent Equalizer</em> settings in the app&rsquo;s main page. It&rsquo;s relatively easy to use and definitely worth the effort. </p>



<h2 id="nacon-rig-800-pro-hx-performance">Nacon RIG 800 Pro HX performance</h2>



<p>While some headsets do 3D audio as a kind of side-act, the 800 Pro HX makes it a main event. Nacon says the 40mm drivers have been precisely tuned for Dolby Atmos 3D audio, so that you can react faster and more accurately to what&rsquo;s going on around you. The headset&rsquo;s bass has also been enhanced, and these two things were really noticeable in my playtesting.</p>



<p>For example, in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em>, most of the audio sounded clear and refined, but deeper sounds like explosions and the thudding of weapons firing really stood out, resonating with a heaviness that really got my attention. The audio also circled around my ears in a full 360 arc, giving me a precise positional awareness that made it easier to locate foes and keep my character alive for longer.</p>



<p>That said, gamers who play FPS titles like <em>Halo Infinite</em>, <em>Metro Exodus</em>, and newer titles in the <em>Battlefield</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em> franchises, are really in for a treat, since they&rsquo;ll reap the full benefit of this headset&rsquo;s Dolby Atmos support. Getting it working is a piece of cake, too&mdash;you just plug it in and it automatically engages with the software to optimize your sound.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nacon RIG 800 Pro HX" class="wp-image-1656659" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230314_184226.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Nacon RIG 800 Pro HX has detachable ear cups that slot into holes in the headset&rsquo;s frame.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Switching to a game of <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, I listened for any distortion, but I didn&rsquo;t hear any. In this game too, the 3D audio was sublime, bringing to life the sounds of the forest with an eerie realism that I&rsquo;ve seldom heard with other headsets.</p>

<p>As to the controls, I really like the vertical orientation that made finding my volume wheel super quick. The base station, too, is a great addition&mdash;it&rsquo;s so compact that it didn&rsquo;t take up much space on my desk and helped keep my headset safe when I wasn&rsquo;t using it.</p>



<p>The only thorn in this headset&rsquo;s side, if I have to mention one, is that the ear cups are kind of fiddly to adjust&mdash;I wish they had been the simple pull-down kind like in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1533230/logitech-g-astro-a30-wireless-headset-review.html">Logitech Astro A30 Wireless</a>, which would have prevented me having to detach and reattach them all the time. That said, the holes in the frame look awesome, giving the 800 Pro HX its trademark fighter pilot look that I never got tired of seeing.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-nacon-rig-800-pro-hx">Should you buy the Nacon RIG 800 Pro HX?</h2>



<p>Gamers of all types will be impressed by the Rig 800 Pro HX&rsquo;s clear and refined sound, but we&rsquo;d especially recommend it for FPS gamers because of its prominent bass and sublime 3D Dolby Atmos support. Plus, the Rig 800 Pro HX&rsquo;s light weight will keep you super comfortable those times when a few minutes gaming turns into many, many hours.</p>

## This rare mouse ushered in modern computing. It just sold for $178K

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>The very first computer mouse, something that we&rsquo;d recognize as an ancestor of modern pointing devices, was invented in 1964 at the Stanford Research Institute. Douglas Engelbart and his team crammed two metal discs (one for horizontal tracking, one for vertical) into a wooden block and added a button on top for selection. The team refined both their hardware and their input devices for the &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos&amp;xcust=2-1-1670741-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mother of All Demos</a>&rdquo; in 1968, which laid the foundation for graphical user interfaces and much of modern personal computers. </p>



<p>Early examples of Engelbart&rsquo;s mouse design are museum pieces and coveted collector&rsquo;s items. For example, a slightly refined three-button mouse and its accompanying five-key coding input tool were <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/346972906608043-douglas-engelbart-x-y-axis-mouse-and-coding-keyset&amp;xcust=2-1-1670741-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sold on March 16th</a> by the RR Auction House, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://metro.co.uk/2023/03/20/mouse-that-inspired-steve-jobs-sold-for-147000-at-auction-18471256/&amp;xcust=2-1-1670741-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as reported by Metro</a>. This combination of serial inputs was essential to the famous demonstration that revolutionized the way computer input was imagined. It&rsquo;s easy enough to draw a line between this mouse design and the one included with the Xerox Alto as the first consumer model, though by 1973 various engineers had figured out how to track vertical and horizontal movement with a ball instead of two discs. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Engelbart mouse bottom with discs" class="wp-image-1670878" height="1093" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/engelbart-mouse-bottom.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1000" /></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/346972906608043-douglas-engelbart-x-y-axis-mouse-and-coding-keyset&amp;xcust=2-1-1670741-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RR Auction</a></div>



<p>Though the auction house had estimated the final price at around $15,000, the lot sold for $178,936. It was part of a series of auctions titled &ldquo;Steve Jobs and the Apple Computer Revolution,&rdquo; easily outpacing other items like an original Apple Lisa (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/347095406608013-del-yocam-39-s-apple-lisa-with-twiggy-drives-and-original-boxes/?cat=0&amp;xcust=2-1-1670741-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$81,251</a>) and a sealed first-generation iPhone (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/lot-detail/346864406608036-apple-iphone-first-generation-sealed-/?cat=0&amp;xcust=2-1-1670741-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$54,904</a>). It should be pointed out that Engelbart&rsquo;s famous demonstration wasn&rsquo;t actually attended by Jobs &mdash; it went on to inspire Xerox&rsquo;s early 1970s designs, which would then result in a partnership that helped create the initial Apple machines of the early 80s. </p>



<p>But I guess &ldquo;The stuff that would eventually end up influencing Steve Jobs, and pretty much every piece of personal computing for half a century,&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really roll off the tongue. </p>

## ‘Legacy’ Twitter checkmarks will vanish on April Fool’s Day as Blue subs go global

<p>Ah, Twitter. What can I say about the social media platform these days? From <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448100/twitter-leaked-data-on-over-200-million-users-heres-how-to-check-if-youre-affected.html">massive data leaks</a> to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479844/twitter-officially-bans-third-party-apps.html">banning third-party clients</a>, it&rsquo;s a place where chaos thrives. Well, Twitter has added something else to the roster now. The company recently announced that it&rsquo;ll start removing &ldquo;legacy verified checkmarks&rdquo; on April 1st, the biggest day of the year for pranksters and evil doers. It&rsquo;s weirdly fitting, no? This announcement arrives hot on the heels of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1638988196380827651&amp;xcust=2-3-1670645-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Twitter Blue subscriptions rolling out on a global scale</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>These &ldquo;legacy checkmarks&rdquo; are the verification badges that were under Twitter&rsquo;s former rules (prior to CEO Elon Musk&rsquo;s takeover). If you want to keep your checkmark, you&rsquo;ll need to subscribe to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue&amp;xcust=2-3-1670645-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Twitter Blue</a>, which costs $8 a month or $84 a year. Special features include the ability to edit or undo your Tweets, compose Tweets that exceed the usual 280 characters, and more. Is it worth the additional cost? Well, that&rsquo;s for you to decide. Personally, it&rsquo;s not.</p>



<p>This bit of news isn&rsquo;t all that surprising. Musk has been talking about getting rid of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1590757322149998592?s=20&amp;xcust=2-3-1670645-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;legacy verified checkmarks&rdquo;</a> for quite some time now. Although the Twitter CEO feels like those badges were given out in a &ldquo;corrupt and nonsensical&rdquo; way, they&rsquo;re actually quite useful, as they&rsquo;re a good indicator of an authentic account. The old verification badges were often used by celebrities, brands, and journalists. Government accounts can apply for a grey checkmark <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1638998382562910208&amp;xcust=2-3-1670645-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p>April Fools Day is a real bold choice, though. Some of you may be wondering if Musk is just trolling his followers. The thought had crossed my mind, too. At this point, it&rsquo;s entirely possible, especially because Musk likes to include the numbers 69 and 420 in his business. That said, the announcement did come from the Twitter Verified account. So, it has to be legitimate, right? Only time will tell.</p>

This sort of thing has been associated with gym memberships and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_House#Negative_option_billing_practice&amp;xcust=2-3-1670691-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&ldquo;music club&rdquo; subscriptions</a> for decades, but recently it&rsquo;s become much more prevalent online, where you can sign up for something with a few clicks but getting rid of it requires a call to the company or an email to support. The US Federal Trade Commission is as sick of it as the rest of us. </p>



<p>In a 3-1 vote, the FTC has proposed to amend a statute first put in place in 1973 to make unsubscribing from services easier and more consistent in the modern world, as reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/click-to-cancel-rule-would-penalize-companies-that-make-you-cancel-by-phone/&amp;xcust=2-3-1670691-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ars Technica</a>. Called the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/federal-trade-commission-proposes-rule-provision-making-it-easier-consumers-click-cancel-recurring&amp;xcust=2-3-1670691-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;click to cancel&rdquo; provision</a> to the original Negative Option Rule, the Commission wants to &ldquo;require businesses to make it at least as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to start it.&rdquo; So, if it takes three clicks from the Amazon home page to subscribe to Amazon Prime, it should take no more than three clicks to cancel it. </p>



<p>Crucially, this rule would demand that the same method be available for signing up or canceling: no more &ldquo;call our support line to confirm your cancellation.&rdquo; The proposed changes would also limit the kinds of offers that businesses can make before confirming the cancellation, giving consumers the option to turn down even looking at the pitches for, say, a month of free service. Finally, the FTC proposes a requirement for an annual reminder before a customer is automatically charged for a renewing subscription. These changes might mean that Googling for &ldquo;how the hell do I cancel my Peacock Plus subscription?&rdquo; might be a thing of the past. </p>



<p>The FTC will be accepting public comment on the Click to Cancel provision. You can expect a bitter fight from the companies that benefit most from free trials that suddenly become hard to cancel. But with a 3-1 vote from the Commission&rsquo;s chairs and a general pro-consumer slant under the current administration, the changes have a decent chance of making it into federal guidelines. </p>

## Windows PCs reveal hidden ‘Acropalypse’ screenshot info, but a fast fix is coming

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>The built-in screenshot tool in Windows has been given a major upgrade in the last few years. Initially the Snipping Tool was part of the PowerToys collection, before getting a major boost and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406858/how-to-take-screenshots-in-windows-10.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">becoming the default screenshot interface in Windows 10 and 11</a>. But it seems like the current version of the tool might be sharing a lot more than intended, albeit in highly specific scenarios. </p>



<p>A few days ago security researchers found that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://9to5google.com/2023/03/18/pixel-markup-screenshot-vulnerability/&amp;xcust=2-3-1667615-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">screenshots taken and cropped on Google Pixel phones</a> could be analyzed with specialized recovery tools, making at least some of the cropped portion of the images visible again. This &ldquo;Acropalypse&rdquo; caused users to take a good, hard look at other default screenshot tools. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-snipping-tool-privacy-bug-exposes-cropped-image-content/&amp;xcust=2-3-1667615-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">As Bleeping Computer reports</a>, several researchers found similar issues with the Windows 11 Snipping Tool and the older Snip &amp; Sketch interface for the same function. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>Update: </em></strong>Less than a week after the screenshot cropping story broke, it looks like Microsoft is preparing a fix for the Snipping Tool. A build of Windows 11 &ldquo;Canary,&rdquo; the bleeding-edge testing release that goes out to Windows insiders, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-acropalypse-privacy-bug-in-windows-11-snipping-tool/&amp;xcust=2-3-1667615-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was spotted with a repaired version of the tool</a>. That means that it should be a matter of weeks, perhaps a month or two at most, before the update goes out to most Windows 11 users. Since the tool is essentially the same on Windows 10, it should (hopefully) get a similar update, too. Our original coverage continues below.</p></blockquote>

<p>The issue stems from the way in which the tools save PNG files, specifically the way they overwrite files with the same name after an initial file has already been saved. As it turns out, the screenshot tools are incorrectly truncating the saved file, possibly leaving portions of the original, uncropped image behind. Recovery tools can be used to make part of the original image visible again. Full, perfect recovery of the original file doesn&rsquo;t appear to be possible at this time, but corrupted versions of the full-sized file could still show enough to recover sensitive text or images. </p>



<p>The issue gets into some pretty heavy technical jargon. But if you need a <em>Star Trek</em>-style metaphor, it&rsquo;s the difference between physically cutting out a photo from a newspaper with scissors, or merely covering it up with a sticker. In the latter example, the photo is still there and possibly damaged, and with careful work you can still see it. </p>



<p>There is some good news. While it&rsquo;s fairly easy to expand a cropped image back to its original dimensions, that doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean all the cropped data is restored. And the recovery method only works after a fairly lengthy sequence of events: The image has to be saved with the Snipping Tool (or Snip &amp; Sketch), then cropped within the tool&rsquo;s interface, <em>then saved again</em> to the same file with the same filename. It doesn&rsquo;t appear to work if you simply press Print Screen and crop a full screenshot, then save that file or paste it into another program. </p>



<p>Microsoft representatives have responded to stories posted on multiple technology sites, indicating that the company is aware of the problem and working on a solution. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a reasonably priced yet impressively fast gaming monitor, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to scope out this deal. Newegg is currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/black-lg-ultragear-24gn650-b-24/p/N82E16824026176&amp;xcust=2-1-1670604-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">LG 24GN650-B UltraGear gaming monitor for $176.99</a>, which is a savings of $73. Let&rsquo;s not waste anymore time and dive right into the specs.</p>



<p>The 24-inch monitor features a resolution of 1920&times;1080, a response time of 1ms, and a refresh rate of 144Hz. You can expect smooth, ultra-responsive visuals and gameplay. It also has AMD FreeSync Premium, which syncs up your PC&rsquo;s graphics card with the monitor. This results in reduced screen tearing issues, which can be incredibly annoying to deal with in faster paced games. Not only is it borderless (meaning you&rsquo;re getting more screen), but the stand is adjustable, so you can tilt and pivot it to your heart&rsquo;s delight.</p>



<p>According to Newegg, this is the lowest price in 30 days, so you better jump in and pick this peripheral up now before it&rsquo;s gone.</p>

## I switched from Xbox to PlayStation because Microsoft loves the PC

<p>Video games have been a massive part of my life for as long as I can remember. My love of games began with watching my mom traverse the lush and mysterious lands of Hyrule in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em>. From that point on, I was hooked. When it comes to games, I love having a wide array of game choices at my disposal. A big reason why I switched from Xbox to PlayStation was because of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397667/get-3-years-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-tip.html">Xbox Game Pass</a> being available on PC. </p>



<p>The pressure of choosing between consoles so you don&rsquo;t miss any of the big games used to be nerve-wracking. Microsoft acquiring Xbox and taking it to the PC changed all of that and made the decision so easy for me. Now, I have access to almost any game. You can really have your cake and eat it too. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in making a similar switch, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397667/get-3-years-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-tip.html">how to get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for insanely cheap</a>.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="having-xbox-game-pass-on-pc-fills-in-those-game-gaps">Having Xbox Game Pass on PC fills in those game gaps</h2>



<p>My Xbox had been my go-to console for years, so it was weird for me to consider switching to PlayStation. That said, PlayStation exclusive games like <em>The Last of Us</em> had me feel like I was missing out. Fortunately, the Xbox Game Pass is available on PC, which means I can still play all of my old favorites while still enjoying PlayStation exclusives. No more missing out on upcoming games because I chose the wrong console. </p>



<p>My gaming PC actually has more storage and better graphics than the Xbox Series X console. Playing Xbox titles on a better equipped machine makes for a seamless and beautiful gaming experience. The app features, at the time of this article, a total of 438 games. I haven&rsquo;t run into an instance where there&rsquo;s a title I&rsquo;d like to play on PC, but need an Xbox to do so. The app also has a good selection of Indie games. Variety is the spice of life, after all.</p>

<p>The S<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1533048/sony-dualsense-controller-review-a-gamepad-from-the-future.html">ony DualSense wireless controllers</a> really impact the gaming experience in the biggest way. They&rsquo;re comfortable to use for long periods of time and, as much as I try to avoid the buzzword, they&rsquo;re really immersive. Some games are designed to have sounds play through the controller. The lights around the rectangular touch button can also indicate certain conditions depending on the game you play. I truly didn&rsquo;t realize what an impact these small details would have until I experienced them all together.</p>



<p>Although you can use the DualSense controllers on PC, the little extras don&rsquo;t translate to PC play. For example, the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback don&rsquo;t work for most PC games. This may be the only downside to the controller and it&rsquo;s only because it&rsquo;s designed to respond to the PlayStation system and not PC. However, you can customize the LED light around the touch button for Steam games. If your PC has Bluetooth or you have an adapter, you can choose to connect that way or wired via USB. The connection process is pretty simple.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="graphically-a-good-fit-all-around">Graphically a good fit all around</h2>



<p>The difference between the graphics of the two consoles is negligible, but if you&rsquo;d rather <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423753/how-to-build-a-pc-a-step-by-step-comprehensive-guide.html">build your own PC</a>, you can pick and choose which pieces of equipment to run your Xbox games on. This gives you the best visuals.</p>



<p>The interface you see when you start up the PS5 is well organized and user friendly. I like that my Netflix isn&rsquo;t mixed in with my games and has its own dedicated space. It&rsquo;s also fun to see the achievements progress and mission status for recent titles at the startup of the machine. It inspires me to get back into a game and go at it with a goal.</p>

<p>The games that have been released on the PS5 have been visually stunning. It&rsquo;s a true escape and pleasure to see what&rsquo;s possible in video games now. The power of the console is proven in the short loading screens and incredible detail. My favorite example of this is the beauty of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. Although it was a PS4 title originally, the thrill of seeing it on my PS5 for the first time will never be forgotten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be able to play titles like that, which aren&rsquo;t available without a console, has been well worth it, especially at the fraction of the price of a souped-up gaming PC. However, I&rsquo;m definitely looking forward to more title drops from Sony. I&rsquo;m especially excited about the remake of <em>Final Fantasy</em> <em>VII</em> and <em>Spider-Man 2</em>. While there may not be many PS5 exclusives out yet, the games that have been released are definitely ones I wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss.</p>



<h2 id="xbox-on-pc-has-been-worth-the-change">Xbox on PC has been worth the change</h2>



<p>My favorite part about deciding to leave the physical Xbox console for the PC experience coupled with a PS5 is that most of my games are now mobile. I play primarily on my gaming laptop, which is the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372718/lenovo-legion-5i-review-cranks-nvidias-rtx-3060-up-to-11.html">Lenovo Legion 5i</a>. If I&rsquo;m traveling somewhere, as long as I have my laptop, I have my games with me. I can also cuddle up in my bed and play surrounded by pillows and blankets. Finding games in the app is easy and the load times are similar to what they would have been on console anyway. </p>



<p>As a PC gamers, switching from Xbox to the PlayStation 5 and subscribing to Xbox Game Pass on my computer truly enables the best of all worlds. Whether I&rsquo;m sitting on the couch, wandering the world, or curled up in bed, I have virtually all of today&rsquo;s best games available at my fingertips, regardless of what platform they were released for. It&rsquo;s great.

<p>The Acer Predator X32 FP rides a wave of new Mini-LED monitors that reduce the number of dimming zones in order to lower pricing. It stands out from the pack for two reasons: It has gobs of connectivity and delivers 4K resolution at up to 160Hz. These features keep the X32 FP&rsquo;s price above $1,000, however&mdash;so, is it worth the cash?</p>

<h2 id="acer-predator-x32-fp-the-specs">Acer Predator X32 FP: The specs</h2>



<p>The Acer Predator X32 FP might appear similar to older 4K gaming monitors at a glance. However, its features are fairly unique: It has a 4K panel, an enhanced refresh rate, and a Mini-LED backlight, but it keeps the backlight restrained to 576 dimming zones instead of the 1,152 zones found on more expensive monitors like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/810180/asus-rog-swift-pg32uqx-monitor-review.html">Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Display size: 32-inch</li><li>Native resolution: 3,840 x 2,160</li><li>Panel type: IPS LCD with Mini-LED backlight and 576 dimming zones</li><li>Refresh rate: Up to 160Hz</li><li>Adaptive-Sync: AMD FreeSync Premium Pro</li><li>HDR: Yes, VESA DIsplayHDR 1000 Certified</li><li>Ports: 1x USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 90 watts Power Delivery, 4x HDMI 2.1, 1x DIsplayPort 1.4, 1x 3.5mm audio-out</li><li>Stand adjustment: Height, swivel, tilt</li><li>VESA mount: Yes, 100x100mm</li><li>Speakers: Yes, two 7-watt</li><li>Price: $1,499.99 MSRP</li></ul>



<p>Acer throws a ton of connectivity at this monitor. It has numerous HDMI ports but also supports DisplayPort and USB-C. Many high-end monitors offer USB-C, but it&rsquo;s still somewhat uncommon in a gaming monitor.</p>



<p>The monitor&rsquo;s MSRP is $1,499.99. However, it sometimes retails below that price. It&rsquo;s currently around $1,275 on Amazon and $1,099.99 at Micro Center.</p>

<p>The Acer Predator X32 FP&rsquo;s design feels like a blast from the past&hellip;if you, like me, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Predator-Desktop-GeForce-AG6-710-70016/dp/B01M0P3R96&amp;xcust=2-1-1658523-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">remember what Acer was producing eight years ago</a>. There was a time when Acer&rsquo;s Predator line went for a tank-like, armor-clad appearance. The X32 FP riffs on that with a tread-like pattern down the stand&rsquo;s neck and thick, beefy plastics that cross to form an X-shape along the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an aggressive look, but one that doesn&rsquo;t hold up to much scrutiny. I&rsquo;m particularly annoyed by the use of silver stickers around the puck-like element near the bass of the stand. It looks and feels unworthy of a monitor in this price range. To be clear, the X32 FP feels fine, even sturdy, at least by the standards of most monitors. However, it&rsquo;s no more impressive than <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1528866/aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-monitor-review.html">AOC&rsquo;s Agon Pro AG274QZM</a>, which sells for hundreds less.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acer makes the common mistake of opting for a wide, aggressive stand. It feels hefty, and the legs seem to be made of solid metal, but the stand consumes more desk space than it should. On the plus side, the stand includes several elements that can be used as handles, which makes the monitor easy to adjust or move. A 100mm VESA mount is included for use with third-party monitor stands and arms.</p>

<p>The Acer Predator X32 FP sets itself apart from competitors with extensive connectivity. It includes a total of four HDMI 2.1 ports, plus one DisplayPort 1.4, and a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 90 watts of power delivery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s a total of six video inputs. The DisplayPort 1.4 port is the only option to support the monitor&rsquo;s maximum refresh rate of 160Hz, but the rest can handle 144Hz, which is more than adequate for a 4K gaming monitor (remember, consoles only support up to 120Hz).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The USB-C port also extends to four physical USB-A ports, two on the back of the monitor and two on the left flank. This makes the X32 FP <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html">a useful USB-C to USB-A hub</a>. The USB-A ports can also be driven by a USB-B connection if your computer doesn&rsquo;t support USB-C.</p>



<p>Acer&rsquo;s &ldquo;whoops, all ports!&rdquo; approach gives owners options. You can connect a desktop tower PC, a laptop, a PlayStation 5, a Xbox Series X|S, a Nintendo Switch, and a streaming box simultaneously. That&rsquo;s excellent news if you plan to use the Acer Predator X32 as your main display in a small entertainment room, gaming den, or studio apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The on-screen menu is accessed through a joystick on the right flank. It works with several buttons that control features. This arrangement is quick and easy to understand, though I did find the power button a bit too close to the other menu buttons and, as a result, easy to hit on accident.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator X32 FP" class="wp-image-1660397" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/acer-predator-x32-fp-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Acer&rsquo; on-screen image-adjustment menu for the Predator X32 FP.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Acer provides a healthy range of image-quality adjustments. This includes gamma and color temperature adjustments, six-axis color calibration, and support for several color gamut profiles including sRGB. The monitor also includes an uncommon &ldquo;max brightness&rdquo; option, which is turned off by default. This restrains the maximum brightness of the display to a more manageable level for SDR content. It&rsquo;s a useful toggle, as dialing in brightness on HDR monitors can be fussy due to their wide range of luminance.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-x32-fp-sdr-image-quality">Acer Predator X32 FP: SDR Image Quality</h2>



<p>The Acer Predator XP32 FP is one of several new Mini-LED monitors rushing to market after CES 2023. It achieves a lower price by limiting the number of dimming zones to just 576 (some earlier models had 1,152), but it doesn&rsquo;t compromise in other aspects of image quality.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator X32 FP" class="wp-image-1660399" height="838" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/acer-predator-x32-fp-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Acer provides a maximum SDR brightness of 461 nits. This is quite a bit less than some competitors, and certainly not the highest the monitor can achieve, as I&rsquo;ll touch on when explaining its HDR performance. The Acer&rsquo;s SDR brightness falls behind some recent Mini-LED monitors including the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1511598/viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-review.html">Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K</a> and AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM.</p>



<p>Whether this matters is up for debate, as 461 nits should be more than enough for comfortable viewing in a bright, sunlit room. Still, I prefer to see monitors offer a higher level of brightness if the monitor is capable of achieving it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator X32 FP" class="wp-image-1660400" height="847" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/acer-predator-x32-fp-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The monitor&rsquo;s maximum contrast ratio came in at 3230:1. That&rsquo;s a good result for an IPS monitor, and on par with the AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM, but less than some other monitors with a Mini-LED backlight such as the Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K, which has more dimming zones. OLED also outperforms thanks to its ability to achieve an essentially perfect black level with zero luminance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, the XP32 FP looks good in real-world conditions. Dark scenes generally appear deep and rich, with far less of the IPS glow found on standard IPS monitors. Vivid, bright scenes seem to leap out of the display thanks to its high maximum brightness.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator X32 FP" class="wp-image-1660401" height="842" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/acer-predator-x32-fp-color-gamut.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Acer knocks the color gamut out of the park, delivering a color gamut that spans 100 percent of sRGB and 96 percent of DCI-P3. This performance is on par with the very best monitors available today, including OLED alternatives, and should be suitable for high-end professional content creation. In real-world use, the wide color gamut offers an alluring and over-saturated look I suspect most owners will enjoy.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator X32 FP" class="wp-image-1660402" height="911" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/acer-predator-x32-fp-color-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The X32 FP doesn&rsquo;t knock color accuracy out of the park, but this level of color accuracy remains adequate in nearly any situation you&rsquo;ll throw at it. Still, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that a trend is forming: new Mini-LED monitors aren&rsquo;t performing as well in color accuracy as OLED monitors and IPS monitors that lack a Mini-LED backlight.</p>



<p>I measured a default gamma curve of 2.2, right on my preferred target. The default color temperature was 6100K, a bit warmer than the target of 6500K, and much warmer than most monitors sold today. I prefer this look, personally, but it may look a bit off if you prefer a color temperature above 6500K. The monitor offers gamma and color temperature adjustments, so both can be adjusted.</p>



<p>Sharpness is a high point. The Acer Predator X32 FP has a 4K panel, which sets it apart from less expensive options like the AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM and Cooler Master Tempest GP27Q, both of which stick to 1440P resolution. The added pixels produce an extremely crisp, attractive experience no matter how the monitor is used, and makes the monitor better for content creators (especially video creators) who need to work at 4K resolution.</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-x32-fp-hdr-image-quality">Acer Predator X32 FP: HDR Image Quality</h2>



<p>The Acer Predator X32 FP is VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified. I verified a maximum sustained brightness of 946 nits, which is excellent, and well-suited to HDR content on a PC. Highlights that should appear truly searing, like a bright noon sun, seem to burst from the screen. The monitor also provides good detail around bright highlights.</p>



<p>I was a bit disappointed by the monitor&rsquo;s contrast ratio, as it didn&rsquo;t budge in HDR content. This is different from the AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM, which offered an improved contrast ratio of 4190:1 in HDR. I noticed that dark scenes didn&rsquo;t look as deep and foreboding on the X32 FP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This, however, should be kept in context. The X32 FP did not outperform other Mini-LED monitors, but it absolutely demolishes IPS LCD displays without a Mini-LED backlight. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1478644/acer-predator-xb273u-f-monitor-review.html">Acer Predator XB273U F</a>, for example, has a maximum contrast ratio of 980:1 and looks dreary in HDR by comparison.</p>



<p>Blooming, a problem that causes bright halos around bright objects, can be an issue. This occurs because the Mini-LED dimming zones are larger than small, bright objects that might need to be displayed. This doesn&rsquo;t impact most scenes, but it&rsquo;s obvious when bright objects move across an otherwise mostly dark performance (or vice versa). Mini-LED monitors with more dimming zones, like the Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K, do better here.</p>



<p>What about OLED? It can&rsquo;t hope to compete with the X32 FP&rsquo;s peak brightness, but delivers better results in dark scenes. This makes them better suited to dark content. If you like to play <em>Valheim</em> more than <em>Overwatch 2</em>, for example, OLED is the better choice.</p>



<p>While the X32 FP wasn&rsquo;t a top-tier HDR performer, mostly due to its contrast ratio, it remains a good monitor for HDR. It has the brightness and color gamut needed to deliver oomph in HDR scenes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-x32-fp-motion-performance">Acer Predator X32 FP: Motion Performance</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator X32 FP" class="wp-image-1660403" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/acer-predator-x32-fp-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>At only 160Hz via DisplayPort, the refresh rate on the Predator X32 FP is good, but not great.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The Acer Predator X32 FP supports refresh rates up to 160Hz. This is only available over DisplayPort, however&mdash;the other ports are restricted to 144Hz. I don&rsquo;t find this to be a problem, as I can&rsquo;t notice any difference between 144Hz and 160Hz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Motion clarity is solid thanks to the refresh rate and the monitor&rsquo;s low pixel-response times. Test images of <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>DOTA 2 </em>show that character silhouettes and health bars are legible while scrolling across the map. Character names, however, are difficult to read. This is typical performance for a 144Hz monitor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMD FreeSync Premium Pro is supported. G-Sync support is unofficial, though it worked with an MSI Titan with RTX 4090. The monitor also offers an overdrive mode, which, in an odd decision, is forced on when FreeSync is in use. It slightly improves clarity at the expense of minor overshoot, a problem that causes the image to look a bit over-sharpened and noisy in motion. There&rsquo;s also an Extreme overdrive mode that further increases clarity at the expense of image quality. Some competitive gamers might want to use it, but I&rsquo;d expect most gamers will avoid it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The X32 FP&rsquo;s motion clarity doesn&rsquo;t stand out. A 240Hz or 360Hz monitor will certainly look better in motion. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s disappointing. Motion is reasonably clear and crisp, with good detail and smooth frame pacing when AMD FreeSync is in use.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-acer-predator-x32-fp">Should you buy the Acer Predator X32 FP?</h2>



<p>The Acer Predator X32 FP is a good Mini-LED monitor, but its appeal depends on your priorities. Those who want the best image quality for their buck will be a bit underwhelmed. The X32 FP looks great in both SDR and HDR, but the monitor&rsquo;s nearly $1,500 MSRP puts it up against tough competitors including OLED monitors and Mini-LED monitors with more dimming zones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acer fights back with extensive connectivity that includes six video inputs, USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 90 watts of power delivery, and four USB-A ports. That&rsquo;s ideal for multi-device users who want to connect a bunch of computers and game consoles to the same display. The X32 FP also has a very wide color gamut with a respectable range of calibration options. Though sold as a gaming monitor, the X32 FP is a smart choice for content creators who want one monitor to handle both high-end content creation and HDR games.</p>

<p>Over the last two decades, Amazon has grown from an online bookstore into one of the largest tech brands on the planet. No longer just dealing in paperbacks and printing runs, Amazon now sell everything from TVs to wholefoods to clothing.</p>



<p>And a huge part of their business model hinges on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://amazon.com.au/tryprimefree?tag=pcworldanz-22&amp;xcust=2-1-1469141-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Amazon Prime</a>. You may have heard of it. It&rsquo;s a subscription service that incentivizes and rewards shopping through Amazon. Prime Members get access to exclusive deals and bonus perks, like access to Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Video streaming service.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re considering signing up for Amazon Prime in Australia, here&rsquo;s everything you need to know before you pull the trigger.</p>



<h3 id="how-is-amazon-prime-different-in-australia">How is Amazon Prime different in Australia?</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1469144" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/amazon-stock-4-100667896-orig-100695962-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Martyn Williams</p></div>



<p>In the US, Amazon Prime has an enormous presence. However, the logistical and infrastructure realities involved mean that what Australian Amazon Prime members get for their subscription fee is slightly different to what American Amazon Prime members do.</p>



<p>For one, the amount of items on Amazon US that are covered by the free and fast shipping bonuses that your Prime subscription gets you is much larger than those on Amazon&rsquo;s Australian storefront.</p>



<p>Expedited deliveries are also a lot faster for US-based Amazon Prime members. In select cities, Amazon offers delivery times of as little as one hour. It&rsquo;s frighteningly fast.</p>



<p>Amazon Prime members in the US also get access to free audiobooks via Audible Channels, the ability to shop using their voice using Amazon Alexa and unlimited photo cloud storage through Amazon Photos.</p>



<p>Amazon US members also usually get more and more frequent discounts and lightning deals when it comes to events like Prime Day and Black Friday than Australian Prime members do. There are several reasons for this but the main one is that, since Amazon Australia only launched in 2017, the local storefront lacks the scale of its international counterparts in terms of brands and products, but it&rsquo;s growing every year.</p>



<h3 id="how-much-does-amazon-prime-cost">How much does Amazon Prime cost?</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1469148" height="370" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1053628_us_prime_day_7_cg_750x375_2.png" width="740" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Amazon</p></div>



<p>In Australia, a standard Amazon Prime subscription costs AU$6.99/month. You can sign up for Amazon Prime here.</p>



<p>You can also sign up for a year in advance to save money by paying AU$59/year. Doing so shaves about AU$24 off the regular cost of a 12-month Amazon Prime subscription. If you&rsquo;re looking at locking in for the long haul, the 1-year plan is definitely worth considering. </p>



<p>Regardless of which payment plan you go with, new Amazon Prime subscribers also get their first month free. If you&rsquo;re looking to get the best value, it might be worth making use of that offer to see how much use you get out of the subscription before dropping the $59 on the Prime Yearly plan.</p>



<p>You can sign up for a 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://amazon.com.au/tryprimefree?tag=pcworldanz-22&amp;xcust=2-1-1469141-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<h3 id="what-does-an-australian-amazon-prime-subscription-include">What does an Australian Amazon Prime subscription include?</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1469152" height="399" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_2019-05-29_introducing_echo_show_5_-_alexa_voice_service_with_screen_-_amazon_com_au.png" width="734" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Amazon</p></div>



<p>Signing up to Amazon Prime in Australia gets you free One-Day domestic delivery on eligible products. Not every item on Amazon Australia is covered by this but the selection of products here is steadily increasing over time.</p>



<p>Amazon Australia claim that this speedy delivery option will be possible for &ldquo;nearly 90 percent of Australians&rdquo; so if you desperately need a specific cable or dongle on short notice, Amazon Prime&rsquo;s One-Day domestic delivery can be a great perk to have. Same goes for the discounted priority deliveries for both domestic and international orders.</p>



<p>An Amazon Prime subscription in Australia also includes free standard international delivery on eligible orders over $49. In practice, this works similarly to the free domestic shipping. It only counts items that are marked as Prime-eligible and you do have to spend a baseline of $50 in a single order for the discount to kick in.</p>



<p>You also get full access to Amazon Prime Video. Although Amazon&rsquo;s streaming service has yet to amass anywhere close to the volume of original content available on Netflix, it&rsquo;s also significantly cheaper.</p>



<p>Of course, if binge watching the latest TV shows and movies isn&rsquo;t your jam. There&rsquo;s a good chance at least one of Amazon Prime&rsquo;s other goodwill inclusions will be.</p>



<p>Readers get access to over a thousand eBooks, comics and more through Prime Reading. Meanwhile, musically inclined Amazon Prime subscribers get the benefits of access to Amazon Prime Music &ndash; which includes access to over 2-million songs.</p>



<p>Neither of these are as comprehensive as a dedicated music streaming services like Spotify or Amazon&rsquo;s own Kindle Unlimited but they are bundled into the $6.99 Prime subscription for no additional cost &ndash; which is pretty nifty.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s also Twitch Prime. In addition to offering several cosmetic perks when it comes to the regular Twitch livestreaming experience, Twitch Prime members also get regular free bonuses that include downloadable content, special deals, exclusive livestreams and sometimes entire games, free to download.</p>



<p>Last but not least, an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://amazon.com.au/tryprimefree?tag=pcworldanz-22&amp;xcust=2-1-1469141-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Amazon Prime subscription</a> also gets you free release-date delivery on eligible items with metro areas. Assuming you pre-order the eligible book, game, movie or music two days ahead of release, you&rsquo;ll get it the day it comes out.</p>

## Mesh Wi-Fi vs Traditional Routers: Which is better?

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>When it comes to setting your home up with Wi-Fi it&rsquo;s easy to get stumped on the question of which Wi-Fi type is best: A traditional home router, or one of the new Wi-Fi mesh systems? Here are the basics to help you make the right decision.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-mesh-wi-fi">What is Mesh Wi-Fi?</h3>



<p>Mesh Wi-Fi (also known as Whole Home Wi-Fi) systems are home networking solutions that opt for a more decentralized approach to the problem of local connectivity.</p>



<p>Rather than force every device in your home to wirelessly connect to the internet through the same router, Mesh Wi-Fi systems rely on multiple Wi-Fi nodes. They start from a place of accepting that your regular router probably isn&rsquo;t located in the perfect spot to serve every connected device in your house and work forward from there.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1450269" height="524" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-2-CP_-Linksys.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="720" /><figcaption><p></p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Linksys</p></div>



<p>In a mesh Wi-Fi system, one node is designated the primary router and is directly wired into your gateway connection while the other nodes act as satellites. Collectively, these nodes behave like a single seamless network.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re in the living room, you&rsquo;ll connect to the closest Wi-Fi node. If you&rsquo;re in the kitchen, you&rsquo;ll connect to the closest Wi-Fi node. If you&rsquo;re in the backyard, you&rsquo;ll connect to the closest Wi-Fi node. It&rsquo;s all the same network but your devices will connect in the way that makes the most sense. This allows for better performance and less network congestion.</p>



<p>In some situations, mesh Wi-Fi can allow for faster speeds, better reliability and greater wireless coverage of your home than a conventional router would. As systems, they&rsquo;re also very scalable and quick to customize. If you&rsquo;re having trouble with one corner of your home, it&rsquo;s easy to expand a Mesh Wi-Fi network and build the home networking solution that makes the most sense for your circumstances.</p>



<h3 id="what-are-the-differences-between-mesh-and-traditional-wi-fi-routers">What are the differences between Mesh and Traditional Wi-Fi Routers?</h3>



<p>The key difference between mesh systems and traditional routers is that the former is centralized while the latter is not.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1450271" height="396" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pic-3-CP-Linksys.png" width="821" /><figcaption><p>Linksys Velop</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Linksys</p></div>



<p>With an old-school router, all wireless traffic is going to rely on that single point-of-access. Your router is connected to your NBN or ADSL connection and then passes that connectivity on to however many devices you connect to it. Devices that are further away will often experience worse quality of service than those closer to your router.</p>



<p>Recent advances like MU-MIMO and Wi-Fi 6 have addressed these shortcomings to a limited degree but have done little to tinker with the inherently centralized structure that comes as part of this style of home network.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re not fussed about getting Wi-Fi in the most remote parts of your home, but still want a fast, and reliable connection, an affordable Wi-Fi 6 router like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/3FjGZmZ&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">ASUS RT-AX55</a> will do the trick.</p>



<p>Meanwhile: a mesh Wi-Fi system gives you multiple points of access. This fundamental difference can allow mesh-based networks to offer better real-world coverage and speeds in some &ndash; but not all &ndash; situations. If you live in a large home or one with multiple floors, you&rsquo;re going to notice more of a difference than you would in a small, single-storied locale.</p>



<p>It should be said that, compared to many modern routers, Mesh Wi-Fi systems tend to have slower processors and less antennas. Even if they&rsquo;re sometimes more efficient or effective at handling connections from multiple devices, that can mean that you&rsquo;ll get worse performance from them compared to a top-line traditional router like the<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/3FjaDIZ&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"> Netgear Nighthawk RAXE500</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tp-link.com/au/home-networking/wifi-router/archer-ax90/&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">TP-Link&rsquo;s Archer AX90</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-you-look-for-in-a-mesh-wi-fi-router">What should you look for in a Mesh Wi-Fi router?</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Design</strong> &ndash; Since you&rsquo;re going to be throwing several of these Mesh Wi-Fi nodes around your house, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt for them to look visually appealing or, at the very least, innocuous. While in 2022 there was a trend toward minimalism, in 2023 the incorporation of Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E means some unit sizes have slightly increased. As a consequence, rather than finding the smallest possible design, aim to find a product that integrates seamlessly into your home environment.</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1450275" height="466" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pic-5-TP-Link.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="700" /><figcaption><p>TP-Link Deco</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">TP-Link</p></div>



<ul><li><strong>Speed</strong> &ndash; When it comes to any sort of wireless connectivity, it&rsquo;s always better to have more speed than the opposite. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are no different in this regard. Having greater speed allows for more bandwidth-intensive things like 4K media streaming. It also allows more devices to do those things on the same network without infringing on one another. Selecting the fastest possible Wi-Fi system will also help future-proof your purchase.</li><li><strong>Coverage</strong> &ndash; While it&rsquo;s good to know that you can always get more mesh nodes to deal with any blind spots, it&rsquo;s equally good to get away with using less mesh nodes where you can. The better the coverage offered by each mesh node in your mesh Wi-Fi system, the less mesh nodes you&rsquo;ll need to cover your house overall.</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1450289" height="228" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pic-6-TP-Link.png" width="700" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">TP-Link</p></div>



<ul><li><strong>Software</strong> &ndash; A big part of the appeal of mesh Wi-Fi systems is their ease of use and many come with software apps that help this to be the case. Once you purchase your mesh system, you&rsquo;ll be locked into using that particular system&rsquo;s official app, so it&rsquo;s best to make sure it includes the features you care about. For example, parental controls, high-traffic priority markers and built-in cybersecurity scanning.</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1450292" height="361" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pic-7-TP-Link.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="700" /><figcaption><p>TP-Link&rsquo;s Deco app</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">TP-Link</p></div>



<ul><li><strong>Ease of setup</strong> &ndash; If you&rsquo;re none too technically minded, having an app-assisted installation and setup instead of a browser-based one can greatly simplify the process. Preferably, installation should be as simple as navigating to your Apple Store or Google Play Store, downloading the supplier&rsquo;s app, and then following a step-by-step process. Ideally, your Wi-Fi should be up and running within 15 minutes after unboxing.</li></ul>



<h3 id="how-many-mesh-wi-fi-systems-are-out-there">How many mesh Wi-Fi systems are out there?</h3>



<p>These days, there are plenty of options in the mesh networking space to choose from.</p>



<p>Most traditional networking brands like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/3JqKFlD&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Netgear</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/3LUyBLr&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Linksys</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/38CKcjR&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">TP-Link</a> and<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/37oOJFU&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"> D-Link</a> incorporate mesh Wi-Fi systems into their wider product portfolio in one way or another.</p>



<p>In 2023 we&rsquo;re seeing new releases from these brands featuring upgrades, the biggest of which is Wi-Fi 6E functionality. Wi-Fi 6E not only delivers faster Internet, but it also allows more Wi-Fi devices to connect to your router without affecting your Wi-Fi connectivity. However, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/3gR0tWR&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Wi-Fi 6E capable mesh systems</a> are quite expensive compared to Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems.</p>



<h3 id="mesh-wi-fi-smart-devices">Mesh Wi-Fi smart devices</h3>



<p>Brands like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/3UoFvwi&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> and Google are also making in-roads into the mesh Wi-Fi space. These companies are less interested in power users and more interested in customers who want their mesh home networking experience to integrate into a wider smart ecosystem.</p>



<p>A while back, we were introduced to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/3Vpl9UT&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google Nest</a>, a mesh Wi-Fi device that provides Wi-Fi to your whole house but also incorporates a smart speaker that allows you to play music, manage your Wi-Fi network, and control other connected devices simply by using your voice.</p>



<p>Similar devices are growing in popularity, with other companies producing products that link into the smart ecosystems these companies have created. A number of products on market like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/36ncFpe&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">TP-Link&rsquo;s Deco M9</a> already include some kind of connectivity technology that allows them to communicate with smart home products. Late last year TP-Link also released a new product the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/3lDQ3fy&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Deco X50</a>, which is a mesh Wi-Fi product with Amazon Alexa functionality built-in. Deco X50 allows users to do things like turn the lights on and off and play music with simple voice commands.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1450294" height="418" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Pic-8-TP-Link.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="640" /><figcaption><p>TP-Link&rsquo;s Deco Voice X20 Mesh Wi-Fi with Amazon Alexa built-in</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">TP-Link</p></div>



<p>In our view, these technologies can provide an exceptional level of functionality for regular home use. However, they may not be ideal for gaming. For example, in our review of the Nest Wi-Fi, we said that &ldquo;Google&rsquo;s latest foray into home networking is likely a natural fit that&rsquo;ll make smart and easy Wi-Fi seem effortless. Whether it performs at a high enough level to sate the needs of gamers is another question entirely.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Regardless of whether you&rsquo;ve got a Google Home or not, the Nest Wi-Fi system excels at delivering a clean and painless mesh networking experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, if you&rsquo;re living on your own or care a lot about gaming or 4K content streaming and want the fastest speeds possible, there are still good reasons to consider a<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amzn.to/3Y2ViE7&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"> traditional network router</a> instead. These routers tend to offer higher speeds and offer more heavy-duty specs than mesh systems do. If you&rsquo;re the kind of power user in need of that extra grunt, it&rsquo;s easy to make the case for them being the better option.</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;ve mainly been discussing the differences between mesh Wi-Fi and traditional router Wi-Fi, there is now another option that blurs the lines between these two categories. A number of suppliers have technologies that allow you to convert multiple routers into a mesh-like Wi-Fi system. Asus&rsquo; conversion technology is called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.asus.com/au/content/aimesh/&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">AiMesh</a>, while most of TP-Link&rsquo;s new routers include software called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tp-link.com/au/onemesh/&amp;xcust=2-2-1450268-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">OneMesh</a> that allows users to create a mesh-like system with the help of a range extender and a firmware update. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little bit more configuration involved than a true mesh system, but it can be a good option if you&rsquo;ve gone and bought routers and want the benefit of mesh without losing any of the performance benefits,&rdquo; says Sean Fletcher, marketing manager for TP-Link Australia.</p>



<p>However, if you decide on going down this route, there&rsquo;s a caveat: &ldquo;With OneMesh Wi-Fi performance tends to be better if you have your router in the center of the house and extenders at the ends, whereas with a traditional mesh you can put one router at one end of the house and then daisy chain the others throughout the home and it&rsquo;ll always talk to that closest connection. So, you&rsquo;re a little bit more free in your placement if you use traditional mesh like Deco,&rdquo; he says.</p>
