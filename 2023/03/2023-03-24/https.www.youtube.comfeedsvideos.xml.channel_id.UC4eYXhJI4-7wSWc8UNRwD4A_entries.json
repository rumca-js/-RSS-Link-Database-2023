There's the cookbook for the much-beloved restaurant The Grit, Jason Thrasher's Athens Potluck \u2014 a collection of photos and reflections from local musicians \u2014 and paintings by Athens artists like Terry Rowlett, Jill Carnes and even one by Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff Mangum.\n\nBut this four-song set should feel magical to anyone who loves the loose intimacy you get when a group of friends play in their parents' basement, jamming together while dreaming that it's really for a stadium-sized rock show. The Bad Ends members, all longtime veterans, capture the spirit of their earliest days when anything seemed possible.\n\nThe songs they perform here are from the band's debut album, The Power And The Glory, including the closer, a wistful instrumental called \"Ode to Jose,\" which features Bill Berry on acoustic guitar. This is the first band Berry has been a member of \u2014 and the first album he's made \u2014 since leaving R.E.M. in 1997. Watching him play, lost deep in his thoughts, it's a moment that says, \"We've been on this road a long time, but the journey isn't over.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"All Your Friends Are Dying\"\n\"Left To Be Found\"\n\"The Ballad of Satan's Bride\"\n\"Ode to Jose\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMike Mantione: vocals, guitars\nBill Berry: drums, 12-string guitar\nGeoff Melkonian: keyboards, background vocals, shaker, bullhorn\nDave Domizi: bass, background vocals\nJay Gonzalez: guitar, mandolin\nJohn Neff: pedal steel guitar\nAnne Domizi: harmony vocals\nEddie Glikin: djembe\nOwen Lange: mellotron, purple cowbell\nBennett Evans: electric sitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Marc Pilvinsky, Philip Wages, Larry Justice\nAudio: David Barbe, Henry Barbe\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Desk Team: Bobby Carter, Suraya Mohamed, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Hazel Cills, Marissa Lorusso, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galv\u00e1n, Jill Britton, Sofia Seidel\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #thebadends", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcGJtLNZxYE", "date_published": "2023-03-24 09:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
