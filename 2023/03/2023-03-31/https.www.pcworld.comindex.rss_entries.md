<p>If you can&rsquo;t remember when the first discrete graphics cards hit the market, overclocking might not seem like a big deal to you. Diminishing returns are a fact of life with modern hardware, but two or three decades ago, tweaks and overclocks might get you as much as a 50 percent performance boost. Just ask Charles Wirth. These days he&rsquo;s a member of the team at UL Solutions, the publisher of the Futuremark suite of benchmarking software. But if you&rsquo;re part of the overclocking community, you know him simply as the legendary &ldquo;Fugger.&rdquo; </p>



<p>Charles took some time to talk with Gordon on the floor of the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, ostensibly to talk about the latest UL benchmarking software, but really to shoot the breeze about the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.fudzilla.com/news/pc-hardware/13536-fugger-breaks-world-records-at-idf&amp;xcust=2-1-1679286-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">glory days of PC overclocking</a>. Check it out in the latest PCWorld YouTube video. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Is there anything left for the layman overclocker in today&rsquo;s PC market? Wirth thinks so. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still more technology coming, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff with AI technology, and the integration of AI into the new processors. We&rsquo;re actually trying to get ahead of that, and actually develop for the manufacturers to showcase those new features.&rdquo; </p>

## Please don’t watch Xzibit promise to pimp your browser

<p>&ldquo;Now, you can pimp your mother******* browser.&rdquo; </p>



<p>This is a real line from what might be the most polarizing software ad of 2023: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsWRd-kXn7c&amp;xcust=2-3-1679338-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Opera&rsquo;s team-up with rap legend Xzibit</a> to promote &mdash; er, pimp &mdash; Opera GX&rsquo;s GX Mods, custom modifications to the Opera GX browser. </p>



<p>What mods? According to Opera, unique looks (animated wallpapers and themes), sounds (keyboard and UI) and shaders (GPU-driven effects that render in real-time while browsing the web). In the words of my colleague Michael Crider, this looks like something you&rsquo;d see 15 years ago. Well, to be fair, so does Xzibit.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397610/opera-gx-browser-gamers.html">Opera GX debuted a few years ago</a>, promising CPU and GPU optimizations for gamers, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/399322/operas-gx-gaming-browser-integrates-discord-adds-hot-tab-killer.html">later adding features like Discord to the GX browser</a> as well. Over time, Opera began customizing it more and more for gamers.</p>

<p>To this aging reporter, the whole thing sounds more than a little cringe, capitalizing on the nostalgia of the &ldquo;Pimp My Ride&rdquo; series, a three-year run that began <em>*checks notes*</em> 21 years ago on a channel that&rsquo;s now known for catfishing, RuPaul, and whatever &ldquo;Ridiculousness&rdquo; is. That would be MTV, which <em>*checks notes again*</em> was once known to play music videos.</p>



<p>But hey, Xzibit probably was paid about what the average journalist makes in a year just for posing and (hopefully) toking up while animated characters bounce around. Good for him. After all, if we made a series of videos where Gordon Mah Ung <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://youtu.be/0XsfYV2CxEs&amp;xcust=2-3-1679338-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">screams about the awesome power of the GeForce GTX 1080</a>, can we really be too critical?</p>

## Windows 11’s Search may let you download apps directly soon

<p>Yesterday, Microsoft previewed a brand spanking new Insider preview build of Windows 11 in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1532952/windows-11s-new-canary-channel-could-be-a-test-bed-for-windows-12.html">Canary channel</a>. This channel, which is intended to be experimental, allows you to try out new features long before they become widely available on Windows 11. The new build (aka build 25330) gives you the option to install apps or games directly from Windows Search results. </p>



<p>This is good news, as it cuts down the time it takes to install these things. In the screenshot below, which I nabbed from the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/03/30/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25330/&amp;xcust=2-3-1679290-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Insider blog</a>, you&rsquo;ll see how downloading an app directly from the search results actually works.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft Store Update" class="wp-image-1679296" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-15-20.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>If you hover your cursor over a free app or game on the search results page, you&rsquo;ll find the install button, which is highlighted in a red box in the screenshot above. This allows you to install the app or game without having to go to the product page itself. This feature is only available for free apps and games, though. Normally, you&rsquo;d be sent to the Microsoft Store, where you&rsquo;d then need to activate the install button to download the selected app or game. This new feature eliminates the extra step of opening the Store and going to the product page, resulting in faster installation. It&rsquo;s just plain convenient. </p>



<p>There are a few other improvements, too. First, Microsoft gave the purchase page for buying apps a bit of a facelift. According to the company, this updated look fits &ldquo;better with Windows 11.&rdquo; The company also refreshed the UI for rating apps, further meshing the look with Windows 11&rsquo;s current style. The wheel page has also been redesigned, which has to do with devices like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-dial/925r551sktgn?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&amp;xcust=2-3-1679290-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Surface Dial</a>, an artist-focused device that also lets you physically scroll through news articles without touching your mouse or keyboard. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Wheel settings" class="wp-image-1679363" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-15-21.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>These new features are no doubt exciting, especially if you love convenience as much as I do. The ability to quickly download free games and apps may boost downloads as well as improve workflow.  For additional information, be sure to check out the aforementioned <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/03/30/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25330/&amp;xcust=2-3-1679290-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Inside blog post</a>, which goes over the various changes in the new build.</p>

## 5 badass games to play after watching John Wick: Chapter 4

<p>As a middle-aged dude who grew up watching anime, kung-fu films, and <em>The Matrix</em>, inject the <em>John Wick </em>series straight into my veins, please. I&rsquo;ve spent the last couple of weeks re-watching the entire collection to get pumped for <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em> on the big screen and now that I&rsquo;m caught up, I don&rsquo;t want to hop off this vibe train.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I also grew up playing a heaping helping of video games, and there are several kick-ass ones that are absolutely <em>perfect</em> to pick up and play to feel like the man, the myth, the devil himself. Boot these up and become an absolute badass. Better yet? They&rsquo;re all pretty cheap!</p>



<h2 id="the-hong-kong-massacre">The Hong Kong Massacre</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em> includes an awe-inspiring top-down scene of Mr. Wick clearing out a French building with extreme, fiery prejudice. It almost felt like a video game&mdash;and that&rsquo;s because it was inspired by a rad one. Director Chad Stahelski told <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.slashfilm.com/1224205/john-wick-4-director-breaks-down-that-fiery-top-shot-sequence-interview/&amp;xcust=2-3-1679369-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">SlashFilm</a> the scene was directly inspired by <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/741510/The_Hong_Kong_Massacre/&amp;xcust=2-3-1679369-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Hong Kong Massacre</a>, </em>a top-down shooter that released in 2019.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I had seen this video game and I&rsquo;ll throw a shout-out &mdash; I think it was called &ldquo;Hong Kong Massacre&rdquo; &mdash; they did this top shot and we had been doing so much with the big muzzle flashes and it just kind of clicked like, &lsquo;Well, if I&rsquo;m above, we shoot like this and we shoot like this, and it draws these cool lines with the muzzle flash, and if I get the right flicker effect, it&rsquo;s like Etch A Sketch. It looks really cool,&rsquo;&rdquo; Stahelski said. &ldquo;And it was a different way to amp up the action and keep you in that video game mode that John Wick&rsquo;s kind of known for, that first-person shooter kind of thing.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 id="superhot">Superhot</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Speaking of first person shooters, the legendary <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/322500/SUPERHOT/&amp;xcust=2-3-1679369-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Superhot</a></em> (sorry, SUPERHOT. SUPER. HOT.) remains the best <em>John Wick</em> action simulator to date, especially if you&rsquo;re able to play it in VR. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/419799/superhot-review-the-most-innovative-shooter-weve-played-in-years.html">our review</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a first-person shooter, except time only moves full-speed when you move. Stand still and everything slows to a crawl. Bullets hang in the air, red trails stretching out behind. People are practically motionless, frozen mid-charge.</p><p>Lucky for you, because the odds are overwhelming. You&rsquo;re a one-man army, taking out anonymous red enemies en masse, watching bullets idly twirl past your skull, exchanging shots with statues. Pause. Running out of ammo and then throwing your gun at the nearest foe, putting him off guard just long enough for you to sneak in a punch. Pause. Grabbing his pistol out of the air as he falls. Pause. Spinning and shooting two more who&rsquo;d snuck up behind. Pause. Dodging out of the way of two bullets arcing your direction. Pause.</p><p>This start/stop rhythm is the core of&nbsp;<em>Superhot</em>&mdash;more puzzle game than first-person shooter, more&nbsp;<em>The Matrix&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Equilibrium</em>&nbsp;than&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>



<p>If you haven&rsquo;t played <em>Superhot</em>, fix that mistake now. And if you&rsquo;ve played <em>Superhot</em>, it&rsquo;s time to play <em>Superhot </em>again. It&rsquo;s always time to play <em>Superhot</em>.</p>



<h2 id="hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>But back to top-down, hyper-violent shooters with all the vibes. Before <em>The Hong Kong Massacre</em>, there was <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/219150/Hotline_Miami/&amp;xcust=2-3-1679369-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Hotline Miami</a></em>, a retro-tinged masterpiece with possibly the most absolutely <em>banging</em> soundtrack of all time. Here&rsquo;s how we described it once:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&ldquo;<em>Hotline Miami</em>&nbsp;is still one of the best arcade-style experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had. It was basically a tight, well-crafted version of&nbsp;<em>Hitman</em>&nbsp;on cocaine&mdash;blasting music, brutal murders, and adrenaline. As you played, you&rsquo;d feel yourself gradually lose yourself in the experience. You&rsquo;d allow yourself to slip into &ldquo;the flow,&rdquo; a sort of Zen state of unfeeling efficiency where your murders became almost reflexive.</p><p>It was crazy. It was disturbing. It was addictive as hell.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>



<p>That&rsquo;s <em>John Wick </em>af. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/432399/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number-review-going-against-the-flow.html">Skip the sequel, though</a>.</p>



<h2 id="sifu">Sifu</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>More into fists than guns? You <em>definitely </em>want to check out <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138710/Sifu/&amp;xcust=2-3-1679369-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Sifu</a></em>, which calls itself &ldquo;a realistic third-person brawler with tight Kung Fu combat mechanics and cinematic martial arts action embarking you on a path for revenge.&rdquo;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s true and <em>Sifu </em>absolutely slaps. It&rsquo;s also <em>John Wick </em>af, just without all the shooty bangs.</p>



<h2 id="john-wick-hex">John Wick Hex</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Finally, the actual John Wick game <em>has </em>to make this list, of course. But <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1405790/John_Wick_Hex/&amp;xcust=2-3-1679369-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">John Wick Hex</a> </em>is very, very different from the movies and the other games highlighted here. It&rsquo;s not an action game whatsoever. Instead, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;a satisfying strategy game that aptly captures the feel of the films in a way no true action game could,&rdquo; as we said in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398194/john-wick-hex-review.html">our review</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&ldquo;A hybrid of real-time and turn-based, the timeline governs all in John Wick Hex. Every action takes a set amount of time. Walk one hex? Maybe a second. Pick up a gun? Two seconds. Bandage your wounds? Four.</p><p>Your enemies are ruled by their own timelines, of course. And given the nature of the system, their actions aren&rsquo;t necessarily in sync with yours. As I said, one enemy is simple. Wick tends to act slightly faster than his opponents, so you can almost always handle a single foe. When&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>&nbsp;throws more enemies at you though, it starts to play out almost like a dance. Almost like the films, really.&rdquo;</p><p><em>John Wick Hex</em> stumbles to the finish line thanks to an insane difficulty spike and too-frequent deaths. But if you&rsquo;re open to a new kind of experience&mdash;or simply want to step in the shoes of the genuine Mr. Wick rather playing through games that match his vibes&mdash;it&rsquo;s well worth playing. &ldquo;I wish more tie-in games were executed with this level of craft, and with premises this creative,&rdquo; we said. &ldquo;If they were, perhaps we&rsquo;d see more of them&mdash;or at least more worth playing.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>



<p>Happy hunting, Mr. Wick!</p>

## Microsoft tests adaptive brightness on more Windows 11 PCs – even desktops
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677931/adaptive-brightness-is-coming-to-more-windows-devices.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677931/adaptive-brightness-is-coming-to-more-windows-devices.html)

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Adaptable screen brightness isn&rsquo;t a new idea &mdash; it&rsquo;s one of those little pieces of technology that runs in the background of your phone, for example, making it easier to use in bright sunlight or darkened rooms. And automatic brightness adjustment has been available on some high-end laptops for a long time. But if a peek at the latest Windows Insider build is any indication, you&rsquo;ll be seeing it more often on Windows 11 laptops, and maybe even desktops, in the near future. </p>



<p>The updated functionality is all about Content Adaptive Brightness Control, a Windows 11 feature that automatically adjusts your screen brightness not based on the ambient lighting around you, but on what&rsquo;s actually displayed on the screen itself. So for example, if you go from moving some files around in Explorer with dark mode enabled, to an all-text web page with white background in Chrome, the display might ratchet down the brightness several notches to save some battery and give your eyeballs a break. </p>



<p>Content Adaptive Brightness Control (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/content-adaptive-brightness-control-in-windows-292d1f7f-9e02-4b37-a9c8-dab3e1727e78&amp;xcust=2-1-1677931-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CABC</a>) was previously enabled on laptops only when running on battery, with obvious longevity savings. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/03/30/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23424/&amp;xcust=2-1-1677931-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Starting with Windows 11 build 23424</a> (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-testing-adaptive-brightness-on-more-windows-11-devices/&amp;xcust=2-1-1677931-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bleeping Computer)</a>, CABC will be available on both laptops while plugged in, and even on desktop PCs. Note that, because the brightness is being adjusted based on what&rsquo;s displayed on the screen and not the ambient light level of the environment, it should work even if your monitor doesn&rsquo;t have a built-in light sensor. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Content aware brightness control settings menu" class="wp-image-1679148" height="830" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CABC-power-change.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>In addition to reducing eye strain, Microsoft says that this will reduce power consumption even for devices that are plugged in. But obviously it&rsquo;s going to need a little tweaking, which is why it&rsquo;s getting tested out in Insider builds before going out to the general public. If you&rsquo;re testing preview builds of Windows 11 and you&rsquo;re annoyed by constantly shifting brightness levels, you can disable the CABC feature in the Settings menu under System&gt;Display. The feature can be turned on, off, or only enabled when running on battery. </p>



<p>Microsoft is asking for testers to leave it on and provide feedback on the feature&rsquo;s tuning, however. &ldquo;For most users, this change won&rsquo;t be noticeable and should reduce energy consumption,&rdquo; it says.</p>

<p>The Kingslim D6 offers better, more detailed captures than the company&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1383830/kingslim-d4-dash-cam-review.html">D4 (which we reviewed in January)</a>. There are still some of the rough edges you&rsquo;d expect from a company new to the game, however in toto, it&rsquo;s much more worthy of consideration than its D4 predecessor. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/428348/best-dash-cam-reviews.html">best dash cams</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a dash cam, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="kingslim-d6-features-and-specs">Kingslim D6: Features and specs</h2>



<p>The D6 melds both a 4K UHD (2160p), 140-degree field-of-view front camera and a 120-degree FOV 1080p interior camera with infrared into a single unit. It makes for a minimal footprint on your windshield&mdash;i.e., it doesn&rsquo;t block your view much. The interior camera doesn&rsquo;t swivel but captures enough of the cabin regardless. The D6 is attractively styled in black with red highlights and sports a sharp, colorful 2-inch display.</p>



<p>Four function buttons on the bottom correspond to the icons on the display and are used for navigating and selecting settings. The power adapter is an auxiliary port/Type-C cable with a GPS module inline. Our D6 shipped with a suction mount but the GPS adapter, which is meant to be mounted near the camera, uses semi-permanent adhesive. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1662065" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71iCla41-QL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=900" width="900" /><figcaption>The D6 has all the goodies, but the Night Vision isn&rsquo;t what it should be.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One drawback to the GPS mounted inline on the power cord is that it&rsquo;s not available when you use another power source such as a hardwire kit or OBDII power cord. My other power-related complaint is that the D6 defaults to not recording at power on. If you&rsquo;re like me, you might not remember to turn this on every time.</p>



<p>On the left side of the D6 are the micro SD card slot and the Type-C connector. Other than that, there&rsquo;s just ventilation grating.</p>



<p>Software features include parking mode and fatigue alerts. I do like that the screen saver doubles as a large, easy-to-read clock. You can also have the display simply turn off. </p>



<h2 id="kingslim-d6-usage-and-app">Kingslim D6: Usage and app</h2>



<p>Using the D6 was easy enough outside of the pesky record issue. The buttons on the bottom are easy enough to reach, and the display is easy to read. The camera connects to your phone via Wi-Fi, so you&rsquo;ll only have cellular internet while it&rsquo;s in use. </p>



<p>One oddity: When connected via Wi-Fi to the app, changing the network on the phone left the D6 still powered on even without the power cable connected. I only noticed this after about 15 minutes&mdash;a testament to the D6&rsquo;s tremendous battery life (280mAh), but not a great behavior.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1654926" height="842" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kingslim-app-melded.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>The app features a live view, as well as access to some settings, saved videos, and the album where you can permanently store videos. Why Kingslim hasn&rsquo;t implemented all the settings in the app, I can&rsquo;t tell you, but things such as GPS can only be set on the camera.  All in all, the D6 isn&rsquo;t my favorite physical/app interface combo of all time, but it&rsquo;s certainly workable.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s nice that the D6&rsquo;s interior camera actually captures in color during the day. Many interior cameras default to monochrome under all circumstances.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="kingslim-d6-performance">Kingslim D6: Performance</h2>



<p>The D6&rsquo;s captures are vastly improved from the previously reviewed D4. While they aren&rsquo;t the sharpest 4K UHD (2160p, 3840&times;2160) captures I&rsquo;ve seen, there&rsquo;s enough detail to distinguish the characters on a license plate, which is the bar any dash cam needs to clear.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1535796" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kingslim-D6-5.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Though hardly the sharpest captures we&rsquo;ve seen, the D6&rsquo;s are good enough for legal use and the color is rich and accurate.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Night captures weren&rsquo;t as good. But, while lacking detail in the surrounding areas, the D6 cleared the &ldquo;readable license plate&rdquo; bar. Alas, flare from headlights was not dealt with well (as shown below), blowing out the area around them and helping to kill detail in darker areas. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1535797" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kingslim-D6-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>At least we can make out the license plate numbers in this capture. We could not with the older D4. Headlight flare is an issue, however.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s nice that the D6&rsquo;s interior camera actually captures in color during the day. Many interior cameras default to monochrome under all circumstances. Detail is good, though the color is a bit cold in temperature (I don&rsquo;t have yellow fever!). Overall, however, very nice interior day captures. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1535799" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kingslim-D6-8.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Interior captures during the day were colorful and offered lots of detail. Yes, that&rsquo;s a dog and I really drink Coca Cola.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Night captures switch to monochrome, but still offer decent detail. Note that even the action out the rear window is captured in some detail. And yes, that&rsquo;s me standing outside to avoid having my mug on display in every image.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1535798" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kingslim-D6-7.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Interior night captures  are roughy equivalent to those made during the days, sans color.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I already marveled at the run time of the 280mAh battery, but that wasn&rsquo;t while recording, which Kingslim claims can proceed for a full 10 minutes. I believe it, and that&rsquo;s more than enough to capture most post-event action should power be interrupted due to the event.</p>



<p>Overall, I&rsquo;d rate the D6&rsquo;s exterior captures as very good during the day but merely passable at night. Interior captures are very good in any lighting condition. Again, the captures are a vast improvement over the D4.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-kingslim-d6">Should you buy the Kingslim D6?</h2>



<p>Kingslim improved capture quality for the D6, so it&rsquo;s worth considering. If you can live with the cons listed at the top of the article, you&rsquo;ll get decent bang for the buck, especially if you can find it at a discount on Amazon.</p>

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>For the better part of my career, I&rsquo;ve had to pay attention to desk ergonomics. (Don&rsquo;t naively work 14-hour days for months in your first job, folks.) Keyboards, mice, chairs&mdash;I&rsquo;ve tried a lot.</p>



<p>I took one key component in my setups for granted: the humble keyboard tray. Having one at the office kept my mouse and keyboard at the right height for relaxed shoulders and elbows with proper angles. When the pandemic hit, I gave up my office desk and its keyboard tray and instead engaged in awkward workarounds. (Keyboard in my lap? Sure, why not. Close enough.) But eventually I started leaving the keyboard on the desk rather than having it on my lap (it&rsquo;s weird balancing a tented keyboard on one&rsquo;s thighs) and it was the wrong height for my needs. I started developing periodic shoulder pain.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Looking for a new keyboard? You should check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/414972/best-wireless-keyboards.html">best wireless keyboards</a> available today.</p></blockquote>



<p>I just lived with it. I couldn&rsquo;t drill holes in my table, so a keyboard tray seemed out of the question. I did know that no-drill keyboard trays existed, but my recollection was of limited options. As I remembered them, they weren&rsquo;t very sturdy, didn&rsquo;t slide back under a desk, came in ugly brown woodtone colors, and&mdash;most damning&mdash;had low clearances. Designed for standard keyboards and mice, these cheap trays didn&rsquo;t have enough room between the bottom of the desk and the tray for my tented Goldtouch keyboard.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that you shouldn&rsquo;t impose your memory of the mid-to-late 00s on the current day, especially when it comes to the availability of useful overseas products on Amazon.</p>



<p>A whole array of useful no-drill keyboard trays exist and they&rsquo;re <em>affordable</em>. You all should have seen my face when I learned this&mdash;after finally getting a table compatible with a standard drill-mounted keyboard tray, I stumbled upon all the no-drill ones simply by typing &ldquo;keyboard tray&rdquo; into Amazon&rsquo;s search box. (An excited if vehement set of curse words might have tumbled out of my mouth.)</p>



<p>To my surprise, these models attach easily with clamps&mdash;some with big, sturdy ones&mdash;and include features like sliding, pivoting, and/or pitch adjustments. The only shortcoming of these no-drill trays is a lack of higher-end models with the ability to raise or lower the tray, as you&rsquo;d find on the drilled side. And, as for aesthetics, black and white colors are both easily found. (Begone, ugly mid-90s vibe.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1671354" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-11.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Just look at all the options for no-drill keyboard trays. (Even more pop up when you specifically search that term.) There&rsquo;s even some for corner desks!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The options were so good&mdash;for just $50 to $70 dollars, too&mdash;that I ended up buying a no-drill keyboard tray rather than one with a standard mount. The advantages were strong: I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about (in)accuracy while drilling holes. I could reposition the tray if I ever changed my monitor configuration or swapped desks. And I could get the necessary clearance for my ergo keyboard without having to spend $100 or more for the kind of drilled-in tray I wanted.</p>



<p>The model I bought was a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083S8HNPS/&amp;xcust=2-1-1671343-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$60 Japanese offering</a> with a single clamp that allows 360-degree pivoting. Unlike other keyboard trays that use two smaller clamps and slide out, this one sits fully in front of the desk, guaranteeing I won&rsquo;t have any height or depth conflicts with my tented keyboard and roller mouse combo. When I&rsquo;m not using the tray, I just spin it around so everything&rsquo;s tucked under the desk. And the shoulder issues I&rsquo;d developed during the pandemic have calmed down and mostly disappeared.</p>



<p>So, if you&rsquo;ve been at your desk as often as I am and have been suffering from some ergonomic issues, this kind of keyboard tray can up your comfort considerably. It&rsquo;s very low commitment with extremely fast set up, which leaves you more time to contemplate other ways of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1443810/work-from-home-tech-products-for-a-better-home-office.html">upgrading your work-from-home arrangement</a>.</p>

<p>There are lots of fancy numbers and specs you can use to describe Corsair&rsquo;s radical Xeneon Flex 45WQHD240&nbsp;monitor. Roughly 5 million individually lit pixels, each capable of flipping off at a moments notice to deliver the deep, inky blacks OLED is famous for, paired with HDR capabilities. An immersive 3440&times;1440 ultrawide resolution, stretched across an even more immersive 45 diagonal inches&mdash;this is a <em>big</em> display. Blazing-fast 240Hz refresh rates, bolstered by near-instantaneous pixel response times for the ultimate in motion clarity. And did I mention this is the world&rsquo;s first bendable display, allowing you to fine-tune the perfect curve for <em>your</em> individual setup (or no curve whatsoever)?</p>



<p>All of that matters, and the Xeneon Flex wouldn&rsquo;t be the Xeneon Flex without it. But the second I booted up <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> and witnessed lush Mexican hills stretched out before me, exotic supercars roaring past in perfect motion as the vibrant sun slowly settled into a pitch black night, none of those numbers and specs mattered. What mattered was my monkey brain shutting off and whispering: <em>Whoa</em>. What mattered was the <em>experience</em>.</p>



<p>The Corsair Xeneon Flex delivers a vivid, truly immersive gaming experience unlike any I&rsquo;ve had before&mdash;and I play a <em>lot </em>of games on a <em>lot </em>of monitors. A couple of those spec choices prevent this beast from being a truly do-it-all display&mdash;discerning spreadsheet warriors will want to look elsewhere&mdash;but if you&rsquo;re willing to spend $2,000 for jaw-dropping immersion and image quality, the Xeneon Flex will leave you grinning from ear to ear.</p>



<p>Just be sure to wipe the drool off your chin when you shut down Steam.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-corsair-xeneon-flex-specs">What are the Corsair Xeneon Flex specs?</h2>



<p>Okay, <em>fine</em>, we really should talk about the numbers. They&rsquo;re damned impressive. Virtually any gaming-related spec you could ask for is supported (and often maxed out):</p>



<ul><li>Display size: 45-inch ultrawide</li><li>Native resolution: 3,440 x 1,440 (21:9 aspect ratio)</li><li>Panel type: Bendable LG OLED with matte coating</li><li>Refresh rate: 240Hz</li><li>Adaptive-Sync: AMD FreeSync Premium, Nvidia G-Sync Compatible</li><li>HDR: Yes, HDR10, rated for up to 1000 nits</li><li>Ports: 2x HDMI 2.1, 1x DisplayPort 1.4, 1x USB Type-C with DP Alt-Mode, 2x USB-A, USB Type-C with upstream (for powering USB ports) on rear | 2x USB-A and 3.5mm audio on front</li><li>Stand adjustment: Tilt only</li><li>VESA mount: No</li><li>Speakers: No</li><li>Price: $2,000 MSRP</li></ul>



<p>This is a big, badass panel&mdash;almost staggeringly so. You&rsquo;re going to need a hefty desk to house it. (In fact, it&rsquo;s so big that I couldn&rsquo;t easily take pictures of the display in my tiny office, so I&rsquo;ve had to use Corsair-supplied pictures throughout this review.) It measures about 42 inches wide and 22 inches tall when flattened, or a bit less when curved, with a thick, sturdy stand that houses much of the display&rsquo;s electronics and comes with a substantial footprint&mdash;both wide and deep&mdash;of its own. Brace thyself.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair Xeneon Flex" class="wp-image-1677764" height="972" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/corsair-xeneon-flex-8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>One of the Xeneon Flex&rsquo;s highlights has to be its namesake flexibility. In a radical move, Corsair designed its OLED stunner to bend to fit your needs. It ships flat, but you can pull a pair of plastic handles out from the sides, adjust the screen up to an aggressive 800R curve, then slide the handles back into place to lock in your chosen form factor.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a terrifying prospect&mdash;doubly so because you need to apply some force to wrestle it into place, while the handles feel cheap and wobbly, and did I mention this monitor is $2,000?&mdash;but it works well in practice. Corsair rates the Xeneon Flex for 10,000 to 15,000 bends. Even if you adjust the panel a few times a day, that means it should last years without issue (in theory).</p>



<p>The bendable display is an exceptional feature, however.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair Xeneon Flex" class="wp-image-1677759" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/corsair-xeneon-flex-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Xeneon Flex&rsquo;s wobbly plastic handles pop out, let you bend the panel to your desired curve, then slide back into place to lock the position.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>I work on my monitor all day and game on it all night. When I&rsquo;m working in Office, editing photos, or have multiple windows open for general productivity work, I prefer a flat display, as curved monitors produce some distortion. That&rsquo;s especially true with the Xeneon Flex. Its curve isn&rsquo;t quite uniform, seemingly from the mechanisms needed to support bending the display&mdash;it&rsquo;s flatter in the middle and curves more aggressively towards the edges. It doesn&rsquo;t bother me, but I could see it infuriating some folks&mdash;and it reinforces my desire to handle my work with the screen flat.</p>



<p>But when it comes to gaming, <em>nothing</em> beats the immersion an ultrawide monitor can provide&mdash;and that goes doubly so with the huge, all-encompassing OLED panel on the Corsair Xeneon Flex. I felt like David Bowman in <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> the first time I gamed on this thing, with OLED&rsquo;s inky blacks and HDR&rsquo;s vibrant lights only adding to the effect. I quickly found myself flattening the panel during working hours, then bending it to my ideal ratio (about 75 percent of the possible curve) and flipping on HDR to game and watch movies and TV shows by night. (Activating HDR mutes normal Windows desktop colors on most machines, so I prefer to leave it off when I&rsquo;m slinging spreadsheets.) It&rsquo;s a wondrous capability, and one that lets you find the perfect curvature for <em>you</em>&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s none whatsoever.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair Xeneon Flex" class="wp-image-1677758" height="660" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/corsair-xeneon-flex-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>Corsair also loaded the Xeneon Flex with connectivity. The rear inputs include dual HDMI 2.1 connections (perfect for connecting modern consoles), DisplayPort 1.4, a USB Type-C connection with 30W of power delivery DisplayPort Alt Mode support for use with USB-C monitors, and a USB-C input/upstream port for sending USB signals to and from your computer. That upstream port powers two USB-A cables on the rear and two more in the front of the stand, for a total of four. You&rsquo;ll also find a handy-dandy 3.5mm audio jack up front, alongside the power button and other monitor controls.</p>

<p>Having the controls integrated in the front of the hefty stand is a nice ergonomic touch that prevents you from needing to reach around the back of the monitor to make adjustments, like you do with most displays&mdash;an endeavor that could be tricky with the big, wide Xeneon Flex.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair Xeneon Flex" class="wp-image-1677757" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/corsair-xeneon-flex-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>Packing so much functionality into the monitor&rsquo;s stand somewhat limits its adaptability, however. You can&rsquo;t adjust the height or swivel, and can only tilt the monitor by 22 degrees. You also can&rsquo;t remove the stand and mount the Xeneon Flex to a VESA monitor arm. This is best used as a singular primary display. Fortunately, the default height should feel comfortable for most people, though plopping a webcam atop the massive monitor results in an oddly high (but pretty good!) viewing angle. Folks of average height will need to slightly crane their necks to look directly into a top-mounted webcam, which can prove fatiguing during especially long videoconferencing calls.</p>



<p>But who cares about Zoom meetings? This is a gaming monitor through and through, and it <em>rocks</em> for that.</p>



<h2 id="corsair-xeneon-flex-a-truly-next-gen-gaming-and-multimedia-monitor">Corsair Xeneon Flex: A truly next-gen gaming and multimedia monitor</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair Xeneon Flex" class="wp-image-1677763" height="734" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/corsair-xeneon-flex-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>All those fancy numbers and specs align in a truly special way once you start gaming on the Corsair Xeneon Flex. This luxurious display offers image-quality and immersion excellence.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Corsair Xeneon Flex immerses you in ways that tangibly elevate the PC gaming experience. I&rsquo;ve never played on a monitor that made me feel truly <em>inside</em> game worlds the way this one does.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It starts with the form factor, of course. Having a 45-inch ultrawide panel engulf your field of view is a truly engrossing experience. Of all the monitors I&rsquo;ve ever tested, this is the only one that ever prompted friends and family to express sheer amazement at the panel&mdash;and four different people had such a reaction. Playing games like <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> and <em>Star Wars: Squadrons</em> on the mammoth display feels truly immersive in ways you can&rsquo;t get short of spending thousands upon thousands to build a dedicated sim station. And you can see <em>so much</em> of the map in <em>XCOM 2</em>.</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s about more than raw size. This is an OLED monitor, with all the benefits that technology provides. The most striking benefit is the wonderful contrast and deep, inky blacks provided by OLED&rsquo;s per-pixel light dimming. Dimming pixels individually rather than relying on backlighting results in virtually perfect black levels, with no &ldquo;light bloom&rdquo; halos appearing around bright objects on dark backgrounds, like you can witness on standard displays. It makes games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>and <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em> look more delicious than ever, while atmospheric titles like <em>Metro: Exodus </em>and <em>Blair Witch</em> absolutely dripped with deep, dark vibes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><em>Cyberpunk</em>&rsquo;s neon lights dazzled as much as the darkness thanks to the Xeneon Flex&rsquo;s exceptional color performance. The panel covers 100 percent of the sRGB color gamut, 97 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and 92 percent of AdobeRGB, and comes pre-calibrated from the factory with certification paperwork (complete with performance graphs) in the box. It&rsquo;s also a 10-bit display, so it can display a wider color range than typical 8-bit panels.</p>



<p>But that&rsquo;s not all. Thanks to the panel&rsquo;s blistering 240Hz refresh rate (remember to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394663/how-to-change-your-monitors-refresh-rate-and-why-gamers-should-check-pronto.html">manually change it in Windows</a>!) and the virtually instantaneous gray-to-gray pixel response times OLED provides, the Corsair Xeneon Flex offers truly elite motion clarity. Even fast-paced games like <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> look crystal clear on this beast, and fine text like character names looked impeccable in <em>Dota 2 </em>at high speeds. (MOBAs are a common trouble area for motion clarity, and often used by GPU vendors to showcase motion clarity improvements.) I set up a 120Hz ultrawide with an identical resolution next to the Flex and the difference was apparent.</p>



<p>Corsair also equipped the monitor with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html">AMD Free Sync Premium Pro and Nvidia G-Sync Compatible certification</a>. Paired with the excellent motion clarity, gaming on the Xeneon Flex is as smooth and impressive as it gets.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair Xeneon Flex" class="wp-image-1677760" height="723" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/corsair-xeneon-flex-7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>Corsair didn&rsquo;t get a VESA DisplayHDR certification for the monitor but claims it supports up to 1,000 nits. In practice, the Xeneon Flex didn&rsquo;t hit anywhere near that peak brightness, appearing a bit dim with the lights on in my room. Smaller areas of brightness do manage to hit vivid levels, especially with the lights off, but its HDR performance excels nonetheless thanks to OLED&rsquo;s inky blacks and per-pixel dimming. The contrast in HDR movies, shows, and games looks absolutely amazing, though the limited brightness does hold it back slightly.</p>



<p>The one area where the Xeneon Flex doesn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> nail image quality? Sharpness. By stretching the standard 3440&times;1440 ultrawide resolution out to a massive 45 inches, up from the usual 34 inches, sharpness takes a bit of a hit. It&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;ll notice while gaming or watching videos in motion, especially if you&rsquo;re running antialiasing (as most games should), but I noticed it a bit on far-away stairs in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>&rsquo;s Embassy level. It&rsquo;s a bigger problem when you&rsquo;re working on the desktop, though.</p>



<h2 id="how-is-the-corsair-xeneon-flex-for-productivity">How is the Corsair Xeneon Flex for productivity?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Corsair Xeneon Flex" class="wp-image-1677761" height="577" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/corsair-xeneon-flex-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>The Corsair Xeneon Flex isn&rsquo;t a bad productivity monitor by any means&mdash;looking at a spreadsheet stretched out on this thing is awe-inspiring&mdash;but a couple of those specs and numbers that make it so majestic for gaming make it less appealing for people who work on their computer all day.</p>



<p>The biggest issue is sharpness. The massive LG-made OLED panel sticks to the standard 3440&times;1440 ultrawide resolution despite its humongous size, giving it a paltry 82 pixels per inch. That&rsquo;s roughly comparable to a 27-inch 1080p monitor, which don&rsquo;t provide the crispest images. By comparison, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/new-philips-445-inch-double-qhd-curved-monitor-comes-with-pop-up-webcam&amp;xcust=2-1-1677744-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Philips&rsquo; new 44.5-inch ultrawide</a> bumps the resolution up to 5120&times;1440 for a tighter 119ppi, which is comparable to most high-end gaming monitors. It&rsquo;s unfortunate for general-purpose tasks that LG (and thus the Xeneon Flex) didn&rsquo;t follow suit, especially given the panel&rsquo;s superb color accuracy.</p>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="Text ghosting on Corsair Xeneon Flex" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-1677776" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC02108.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="Text ghosting on Corsair Xeneon Flex" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-1677777" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC02101.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="Text ghosting on Corsair Xeneon Flex" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-1677778" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC02106.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>



<p>Those sharpness concerns are exacerbated by LG&rsquo;s decision to opt for a RWBG subpixel layout rather than the standard RGB. As <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631720/pentile-displays-and-oled-clarity.html">we&rsquo;ve explained before</a>, using non-standard pixel layouts causes Windows to freak out and harms text clarity. Fine text on the Xeneon Flex looks a bit spindly and pixelated, and you can often see some red or green &ldquo;ghosting&rdquo; around many characters, especially larger ones, as shown in the slideshow above. My eyes adjusted to it a bit after a couple weeks of daily use, but I still notice it. My standard dual 4K monitor setup provided a much crisper productivity experience, and the Xeneon Flex&rsquo;s ultrawide resolution couldn&rsquo;t scale across software quite as well, even using Windows Snap to segment different applications around the spacious screen.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395110/ultrawide-vs-dual-monitors.html">Ultrawide vs. dual monitors: Which should you choose?</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Corsair also applied a matte anti-glare coating to the panel, and some people loathe matte displays. That said, it&rsquo;s a fairly good application that looks great in bright rooms, without much diffusion or blur, but you <em>can</em> notice the grain if you look closely. It didn&rsquo;t bother me at all.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair Xeneon Flex settings" class="wp-image-1677783" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC02109.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>If you use the Xeneon Flex for productivity, activating the brightness stabilizer option in the monitor&rsquo;s OSD menu can help prevent sudden changes in luminosity while you&rsquo;re working on the desktop.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>What <em>did</em> irk me was the aggressive way the Xeneon Flex handles luminance stability on the desktop. Moving or resizing light-colored windows results in drastic brightness fluctuations, which drove me absolutely mad while working. I wound up enabling a brightness stabilizer option in the monitor&rsquo;s menu and it fixed the issue, albeit while also darkening the display. Enabling HDR also reduces the color gamut and contrast when you&rsquo;re on the desktop. That&rsquo;s a common problem with Windows and HDR displays, but these tweaks meant that each day before work I needed to disable HDR, enable the brightness stabilizer, and bend the monitor flat before work, then reverse the actions for an optimal gaming and video-watching experience at night.</p>



<p>Pixel burn-in is also a concern for OLEDs, and it may give people who work more than play pause, since productivity programs and the Windows desktop hold much more static imagery than games and movies. Corsair imperceptibly shifts on-screen imagery and offers a three-year zero burn-in and zero dead-pixel guarantee to alleviate potential concerns, but between this and the overall sharpness and text-clarity issues, people who need to spend all day being productive should look elsewhere.</p>



<h2 id="is-the-coresair-xeneon-flex-45wqhd240-worth-it">Is the Coresair Xeneon Flex 45WQHD240 worth it?</h2>



<p>The Corsair Xeneon Flex 45WQHD240 immerses you in ways that tangibly elevate the PC gaming experience. I&rsquo;ve never played on a monitor that made me feel truly <em>inside</em> game worlds the way this one does. Its delectable combination of blisteringly-fast speeds, elite motion clarity, sterling image quality, perfect blacks, and lush HDR will make your jaw drop, especially enveloped within the custom-tuned curvature of its uniquely bendable display. The connectivity is top-notch, too.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair Xeneon Flex" class="wp-image-1677765" height="668" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/corsair-xeneon-flex-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>Yes, its $2,000 price tag (currently discounted to $1,800) might make you clutch your chest. But if you&rsquo;re already rocking a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">GeForce RTX 4090</a> and a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html">Ryzen 9 7950X3D</a>, the Xeneon Flex will be the ultimate cherry on top. Sticking to a standard 3440&times;1440 resolution means less powerful hardware can also put this drool-worthy panel to good use.</p>



<p>A couple of design decisions from Corsair and panel-maker LG keep the Xeneon Flex from being the ultimate do-it-all display, though it comes <em>so close</em>. Below-average sharpness and text clarity prevent us from being able to recommend it for heavy productivity use, especially since you need to tinker with software settings to achieve acceptable brightness on the desktop. (As an office worker I can attest that it&rsquo;s definitely <em>fine enough</em> for productivity, though.) The massive stand, steep price, and lack of VESA mounting options may serve as roadblocks to others, though I consider them minor. The mechanism (and handles) used to manipulate the bendable display could also feel sturdier and easier to use.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t let that dissuade you if you&rsquo;re a deep-pocketed enthusiast who wants one of the pinnacle PC gaming experiences when you come home at night, though. When it comes to multimedia, this monitor oozes excellence. The Corsair Xeneon Flex is one of the very best gaming monitors we&rsquo;ve ever seen, full stop. The idea of sending it back to Corsair is already making me sob.</p>



<p>If any of those drawbacks&mdash;including the price&mdash;are dealbreakers for you, there are plenty of other <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1439692/best-ultrawide-gaming-monitors.html">superb ultrawide gaming monitors available today</a>, including compelling OLED options like the $1,100 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html">Alienware AW3423DWF</a>. But don&rsquo;t get it twisted: The Corsair Xeneon Flex&rsquo;s blend of colossal size, elite speed, impeccable image quality, and customizable curvature are unmatched by any other display, though <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-45gr95qe-b&amp;xcust=2-1-1677744-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">LG&rsquo;s 45-inch UltraGear OLED</a> (which uses the same panel) does everything but bend for $1,700. If you want to enjoy the best immersion possible in PC gaming, you&rsquo;ll need to pay up for this fantastic bleeding-edge display.</p>
