A bipartisan group of senators has <a href=\"https://www.lee.senate.gov/2023/3/the-america-act\">introduced</a> the AMERICA Act (Advertising Middlemen Endangering Rigorous Internet Competition Accountability \u2014 yes, it's overwrought) with the intention of breaking up the ad businesses of tech giants like Google and Meta.</p><p>Large digital ad firms (those handling more than $20 billion in transactions) wouldn't be allowed to own both an ad exchange as well as either a demand- or supply-side platform.

They need to be transparent and provide fair access to technical capabilities and data. If they do run businesses on two sides of the market, they have to establish &quot;firewalls&quot; to minimize abuse and conflicts of interest.</p><p>The bill is sponsored by a seemingly unlikely mix of senators that includes Mike Lee, Amy Klobuchar, Ted Cruz and Elizabeth Warren, among others. They aren't subtle about the ultimate goal: they expect Google and Meta to divest &quot;significant portions&quot; of their ad businesses to comply with the would-be law. Amazon and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-app-store-today-tab-ads-152249659.html\">Apple</a> might also have to take the AMERICA Act into account, the politicians say.</p><p>The sponsors single out Google as the bill's main target. As with lawsuits from the Justice Department and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-texas-antitrust-lawsuit-project-bernanke-165300880.html\">multiple states</a>, the measure's creators accuse Google of manipulating the ad market in ways that unfairly disadvantage competitors.

They've previously fought bills and lawsuits meant to restrict their ad operations.</p><p>If the AMERICA Act passes, it would deal a significant financial blow. Google and Meta still rely on ad sales as their main sources of revenue, and in some cases use it to prop up other projects. Meta is sinking billions into its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-meta-flunked-its-first-year-as-a-metaverse-company-150049067.html\">metaverse ambitions</a>, as an example.

But Twitter users have already been finding interesting details in the code itself. For example, Jane Manchun Wong noted that \u201cTwitter\u2019s algorithm specifically labels whether the Tweet author is Elon Musk.\u201d That may offer yet <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitters-secret-vip-list-is-the-reason-you-see-elon-musks-tweets-so-often-181735784.html\">another explanation</a> for why Musk\u2019s tweets appear so often.

California approved the mandate in 2020 but needed an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waiver because it exceeded federal standards.</p><p>The rule aims to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/we-have-three-years-to-curb-emissions-to-avoid-climate-catastrophe-un-report-finds-204058474.html\">reduce greenhouse gas emissions</a> from the transportation sector. By 2035, it requires 55 percent of delivery vans and small trucks sold in California to be entirely electric-powered. Similarly, 40 percent of tractor-trailers and 75 percent of buses and larger trucks must be all-electric by the same deadline.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>California Governor Gavin Newsom sees the mandate as a bellwether for the nation. \u201cThis is a moment to mark because it\u2019s a preview of the order of magnitude of the change in the industry,\u201d Newsom told <em>The New York Times</em>. \u201cThere\u2019s a power in these waivers and that power is emulation. We adopt through these waivers the principles and policies that lead to innovation and investment.\u201d Given the size and centrality of California\u2019s economy (it would be the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy if it were a sovereign nation), the rule would, in practice, essentially apply nationwide \u2014 similar to the state\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html\">ban on sales of gas-powered vehicles</a> by 2035.</p><p>The trucking industry has criticized the move for its costs and infrastructure requirements. \u201cDrivers don\u2019t want to work in California anymore,\u201d said Jay Grimes, director of federal affairs for the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association. \u201cThey\u2019re skeptical of the rapid timeline on this transition to electric trucks. Can a trucker get a charge that will take them on a highway for two or three days? Is the technology ready for prime time?\u201d He adds that batteries for electric trucks can weigh thousands of pounds more than combustion engines, potentially limiting hauls. Other truckers have questioned whether the charging station rollout will be adequate for long trips. Finally, electric trucks are more expensive, starting at around $100,000 and stretching into high six figures (although the pricing discrepancies compared to gas trucks could drop over time).</p><p>Unsurprisingly, attorneys general from 17 Republican-led states are suing to block the legislation. That list includes (among others) Texas AG Ken Paxton, who has <a href=\"https://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=6599313\">received</a> over $3.9 million in fossil fuel donations since 2002, and Louisiana AG Jeff Landry, who has <a href=\"https://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=12050617\">raked in</a> over $875,000 from oil and gas industries. Their lawsuit is scheduled for the US Court of Appeals for Washington, DC, later this year and could move to the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court afterward.</p><p>Clean energy groups acknowledge the mandate\u2019s difficulties but strike an optimistic tone. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of challenge with the electrification of heavy-duty vehicles,\u201d said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation. \u201cBut there are elements that lead to optimism.\u201d For example, he points out that government tax incentives and savings from not having to buy gasoline will help with long-term costs. \u201cCompanies like FedEx look at the bottom line over the total life span of a vehicle. And when they look long-term, the calculations for this become more optimistic.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/california-will-require-half-of-heavy-truck-sales-to-be-electric-by-2035-200313559.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/california-will-require-half-of-heavy-truck-sales-to-be-electric-by-2035-200313559.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-31 20:03:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "GOG's Spring Sale deals include 'Cyberpunk 2077' for $30", "description": "<p>GOG is winding down its annual <a href=\"https://adtr.co/egb9Ao\">Spring Sale</a>, and this is a good opportunity to score some hit games at steep discounts.

Although the new guidelines add more confusion than clarity, it\u2019s evident that fewer EVs will be eligible.</p><p>The updated rules target mineral sourcing in EV batteries, stating that they must be sourced from the US and approved trading partners.

Battery components must be 50 percent made or assembled in North America to qualify for a $3,750 credit; critical minerals must be 40 percent sourced from the US or free trade partners for another $3,750 credit. The requirements grow stricter over time, as batteries must be made 100 percent in North America by 2029.</p><p>Although some EVs may qualify for partial credits, it\u2019s unclear which models will be eligible after the deadline. \u201cSome EVs will certainly qualify for a partial credit,\u201d said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, in a <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2023/03/31/ev-tax-credit-rules-treasury-department/\">statement</a> to <em>Autoblog</em>. \u201cGiven the constraints of the legislation, Treasury's done as well as it could to produce rules that meet the statute and reflect the current market.\u201d However, US officials admit some models will either be reduced or eliminated from the program. The government will publish a revised list of qualifying models by April 18th.</p><p>The US and Japan signed a <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2023/march/united-states-and-japan-sign-critical-minerals-agreement\">trade agreement</a> on Tuesday that could help long-term by adding the Pacific power to the list of approved partners. In October, the Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/biden-doe-2-8-billion-ev-battery-mineral-production-190544545.html\">announced $2.8 billion in grants</a> for 20 companies to spark domestic EV battery materials and production.

The low-light capabilities are excellent as well. You can adjust the settings to get everything looking just how you want, with options in the app for brightness, contrast, color intensity, white balance, HDR, and image ratio. The microphones are loud and clear, and the design is a little more attractive than other cams thanks to the sleek and rounded build. We noted the color saturation was intense and the autofocus was finicky, but those were the only drawbacks, other than the (usual) list price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Eero Pro 6</h2><p></p><p>If you've been thinking about improving your home's WiFi coverage, you may want to check out the discount Wellbots is running on the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f14f6b23-c078-4e53-8011-5b872f886d6b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Wellbots&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmMTRmNmIyMy1jMDc4LTRlNTMtODAxMS01Yjg3MmY4ODZkNmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2VsbGJvdHMuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2Vlcm8tcHJvLTYtdHJpLWJhbmQtd2ktZmktcm91dGVyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1NTMyZDFmOS1mODJkLTQ0YzUtOGZmNi1jOGIzNTg1ZTg5ZjkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXC2yISsOdRi4gjRq19R3vjkvioNQszAMF0n3lq9D8Hy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Feero-pro-6-tri-band-wi-fi-router\">Eero Pro 6 mesh Wifi router</a>.

Watsons' simulated voice read portions of the Mein Kampf aloud, while other deepfaked voices made openly racist and transphobic statements, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7mww/ai-voice-firm-4chan-celebrity-voices-emma-watson-joe-rogan-elevenlabs\">according to </a><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7mww/ai-voice-firm-4chan-celebrity-voices-emma-watson-joe-rogan-elevenlabs\"><em>Vice</em></a>.</p><p>Carey's AI voice wasn't perfect: It sounded a tad robotic, it didn't have the inflections his fans have grown to love over the years, and the ChatGPT-written script was noticeably simplistic.  But if you were driving down the highway late at night, and you just wanted a bit of company alongside some classic rock, it's possible you wouldn't notice the DJ wasn't human. In fact, ElevenLabs <a href=\"https://blog.elevenlabs.io/super-hi-fi-partners-with-elevenlabs/\">recently partnered with Super HI-Fi</a> to create \"fully customized and personalized\" AI driven radio stations.</p><div id=\"undefined\"></div><p>\"I was just playing with it, and I wanted to show what it was capable of,\" he said. \"Plus, I thought, oh, I don't want to show everybody how to make an exact copy of my voice right now. I thought it might screw me over somehow. So I had that little fear in the back of my head.\"</p><p>It took a weekend for Carey and a friend, who already had experience training ChatGPT and other AI tools, to create his AI voice. ChatGPT wrote 99 percent of his radio show's script, though Carey made a few tweaks of his own. Funny enough, when he asked the chatbot to write a joke about how easy it was to use, it wrote the line \"even Drew Carey can use it.\" (Perhaps ChatGPT is just trying to snag a spot on the inevitable <em>Whose Line Is It Anyway?</em> revival.)</p><p>Carey envisions AI being used in the future for the grunt work of radio and other production. Perhaps it could read a script late at night, or churn out some ad copy. When I asked if that's a potential problem for newcomers, he noted, \"There are no blacksmiths anymore... If you're a mechanic that works on internal combustion engine cars, if you don't make the switch to electric soon, you're out of a job.\"</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/tech/chatgpt-ai-automation-jobs-impact-intl-hnk/index.html\">a recent Goldman Sachs report</a>, up to 300 million jobs around the world could be automated thanks to recent advancements in AI. But the bank's economists also point out that major innovations that replace some jobs typically lead to the creation of new roles. And for those who are only partially impacted by AI, they'll likely be able to complement their work with generative intelligence.</p><p>For celebrities like Carey, AI could also be a way for them to continue working indefinitely, long after they've retired or passed on. James Earl Jones's voice has <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/james-earl-jones-retires-darth-vader-ai-201559553.html\">already been reconstructed</a> for the Disney+ series <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em>, and he's approved future work to \"keep Vader alive.\" Eventually, actors (and their estates) could sign off on AI clones that entertain us for generations to come.</p><p>Carey isn't afraid of such an outcome. \"You know what, if the price is right, anything can happen,\" he said when I asked if he'd ever sell his digital likeness. \"I'm not worried about CGI Drew Carey taking over, because people want to see me, they want some kind of host. They want that interaction.\"</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/drew-carey-made-a-radio-show-with-ai-fans-werent-pleased-143014038.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/drew-carey-made-a-radio-show-with-ai-fans-werent-pleased-143014038.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-31 14:30:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Italy to block ChatGPT over data protection issues", "description": "<p>Italians might not have access to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html\">ChatGPT</a> for much longer.

The regulator claims there's no &quot;legal basis&quot; for OpenAI's bulk collection of data for training ChatGPT's model. The sometimes-inaccurate results also indicate the generative AI isn't processing data correctly, the Guarantor says. Officials are particularly concerned about a flaw <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/openai-says-a-bug-leaked-sensitive-chatgpt-user-data-165439848.html\">leaked sensitive user data</a> last week.</p><p>The data agency also says OpenAI isn't doing enough to protect children.

OpenAI's <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use\">terms</a> forbid use by children under 13, while the policy says the company doesn't &quot;knowingly&quot; gather personal info from those underage users.</p><p>Italy's action comes just a day after a nonprofit research organization filed a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hoping to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/openai-may-have-to-halt-chatgpt-releases-following-ftc-complaint-172824646.html\">freeze future ChatGPT releases</a> until OpenAI meets the agency's guidelines on transparency, fairness and clarity.

That could be set to change, however, after Google CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed on <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy8zMS9wb2RjYXN0cy9oYXJkLWZvcmstc3VuZGFyLmh0bWw_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0MDg3MzIzMS0wZTU5LTQyMzgtYTFiZi02MzFkNjU0ZDg1ZjQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ3n0j-iPb8123ASlbBd16kmExTWDxf8fJiYenMlfWwv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F03%2F31%2Fpodcasts%2Fhard-fork-sundar.html%3F\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> podcast \"Hard Fork\" that Bard will soon be moving from its current LaMDA-based model to larger-scale PaLM datasets in the coming days.</p><p>When asked how he felt about responses to Bard's release, Pichai commented: \"We clearly have more capable models. Pretty soon, maybe as this goes live, we will be upgrading Bard to some of our more capable PaLM models, so which will bring more capabilities, be it in reasoning, coding.\"</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To frame the difference, Google said it had trained LaMDA with <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-google-lamda-works/442064/\">137 billion parameters</a> when it shared details about the language-based models last year. PaLM, on the other hand, was said to have been trained with around <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html\">540 billion parameters</a>. Both models may have evolved and grown since early 2022, but the contrast likely shows why Google is now slowly transitioning Bard over to PaLM, with its larger dataset and more diverse answers.</p><p>Pichai claims not to be worried about how fast Google's AI develops compared to its competitors. When Bard first debuted in February, he acknowledged its reliance on LaMDA gave it a smaller scale, but framed having less computing power as a benefit, giving more users the change to test it out and provide feedback. Pichai also ensured that Google would be doing its own analysis of Bard's safety and quality once provided with real-world information.&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, Pichai expressed that Google doesn't want to release a \"more capable model before we can fully make sure we can handle it well. We are all in very, very early stages. We will have even more capable models to plug in over time. But I don\u2019t want it to be just who\u2019s there first, but getting it right is very important to us.\"&nbsp;</p><p>That thought is on the minds of over 1,800 people (including tech leaders and AI researchers) <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tech-leaders-and-ai-experts-demand-a-six-month-pause-on-out-of-control-ai-experiments-114553864.html\">who have signed an open letter</a> calling for a minimum six month pause on the development of AI technology \"more powerful than GPT-4.\"</p><p>Pichai doesn't think this can be effectively done without involving the government, but agrees with the need for guidance: \"AI is too important an area not to regulate. It\u2019s also too important an area not to regulate well. So I\u2019m glad these conversations are underway.\"&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-is-switching-to-a-more-capable-language-model-ceo-confirms-133028933.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-is-switching-to-a-more-capable-language-model-ceo-confirms-133028933.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-31 13:30:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Solo Stove fire pit bundles are over 45 percent off right now", "description": "<p>Solo Stove is back with another holiday sale, this time on its fire pit bundles.

Based on the limited examples we've seen, the GPT-4-powered chatbot embeds relevant ad links in response to users' actual questions. Ads don't seem to appear for most people (including us) yet, but they'll most likely pop up more frequently and in more places soon. In a post on the Bing blog, Microsoft Corporate VP for Search and Devices Yusuf Mehd, explained that ads would come in the form of a linked citation, along with additional links in a \"Learn More\" section below Bing's response to their query. In the future, Microsoft could add functionality where hovering over a link from an advertiser would display more links from its website to drive more traffic to it.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-reveals-how-its-putting-ads-in-bings-ai-chatbot-052014029.html https://www.engadget.com/...\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/midjourney-ends-free-trials-of-its-ai-image-generator-due-to-extraordinary-abuse-153853905.html\">Midjourney ends free trials of its AI image generator due to 'extraordinary' abuse</a></h2><h3>The tool had been used to fake images of Trump and the Pope, among others.</h3><h3></h3><p>Midjourney CEO, David Holz, announced on Discord that the company is ending free trials due to \"extraordinary demand and trial abuse.\" New safeguards haven't been \"sufficient,\" and you'll have to pay at least $10 per month to use the image generator going forward.

According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-31/netflix-restructures-film-group-as-it-scales-back-movie-output?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the streaming giant is restructuring its movie division and releasing fewer movies overall. Netflix will combine the team working on small projects with a budget $30 million or less and the unit that produces mid-budget films that cost $30 million to $80 million to make. The restructuring will result in a &quot;handful&quot; of layoffs \u2014 the company didn't specify a number \u2014 and the departure of two notable executives. Lisa Nishimura, who oversees documentaries like <em>Tiger King</em> and small budget films, as well as VP for film Ian Bricke are both leaving the company after over a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>As <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, Netflix ramped up its film development efforts after studios started building their own streaming services instead of licensing their movies to the company. In addition to the units working on small and mid-budget films, Netflix has one more division developing big-budget projects. It's unclear if the last group is also affected by the restructuring.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Despite the sheer number of titles Netflix previously released, only a few had won accolades, had reached millions of hours of streaming, or had the kind of cultural impact some of the biggest blockbusters had achieved. (According to the company's <a href=\"https://top10.netflix.com/\">Top 10 page</a>, its most watched movies for 2021 and 2022 include <em>Red Notice</em>, <em>Don't Look Up</em> and <em>Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery</em>.) Netflix Film chief Scott Stuber reportedly decided to cut down on the titles the service is releasing this year so he could ensure that the division is producing more high-quality projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Stuber didn't say how many people are losing their jobs from the shakeup, but the numbers are supposed to be smaller than the layoffs that happened at the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/netflix-layoffs-182102221.html\">last year</a>. Netflix implemented job cuts before many of its rivals in the film, TV and entertainment space did. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-layoffs-reality-kids-programming-184222650.html\">HBO and HBO Max</a> had to let some production staff members go as part of a larger Warner Bros. Discovery restructuring back in August, while Disney recently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/disney-reportedly-shuts-down-its-metaverse-division-103151157.html\">announced that it's laying off 7,000</a> workers, including those involved with media and distribution.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netflix-hopes-making-fewer-original-movies-will-make-them-better-075456182.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/netflix-hopes-making-fewer-original-movies-will-make-them-better-075456182.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-31 07:54:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
