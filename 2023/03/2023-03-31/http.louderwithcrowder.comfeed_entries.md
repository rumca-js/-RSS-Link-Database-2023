As a refresher, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/big-tech-banned-andrew-tate" target="_blank">Tate</a> and his brother, as well as two Romanian women, were arrested back in December on suspicion of human trafficking, rape, and crime gang offenses. </p><p>Tate has maintained his innocence the entire time, updating his Twitter audience while <a href="https://twitter.com/Cobratate/status/1617276420513726464?s=20" target="_blank">apparently</a> in solitary confinement. I wasn't aware they allowed you to have your phone in solitary, but I guess that's how they do it in the modern age. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Earlier this month, the four appeared at a bail hearing and their bail applications were rejected. However, they appealed the decision, and the appeals court overturned it today. All four will be placed under house arrest as the investigation continues. None have been formally charged yet.  </p><p>Just before the news broke, Tate tweeted, <em>"</em><em>In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends." </em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Back in February, wiretaps that purportedly proved Tate and his brother were framed began circulating on social media. According to the alleged wiretaps, the women who accused Tate planned on setting him and his brother up by pretending to be in love with them, and planned to play dumb if they were caught in a police raid. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Whether Tate and his brother were framed for this specific allegation remains to be seen. Regardless, it <em>does</em> seem that Tate was running some type of brothel in Romania. His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220108225827/https://www.cobratate.com/phd-program" target="_blank">own website</a> used to describe his business model, which is...questionable, to say the least. </p><p><em>"I've been running a webcam studio for nearly a decade, I've had over 75 girls work for me, and my business model is different than 99% of webcam studio owners. Over 50% of my employees were actually my girlfriend at the time and, of all my girlfriends, NONE were in the adult entertainment industry before they met me."</em></p><p><em>"Literally, that was my job. My job was to meet a girl, go on a few dates, sleep with her, test if she's quality, get her to fall in love with me to where she'd do anything I say, and then get her on webcam so we could become rich together."</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cAndrew Tate\u2019s website was straight up just like \u201cWhy am I an expert in this? Because I am a successful sex trafficker\u201d\u201d</div> — worms cited (@worms cited)

<p>Now, I'm no <em>legal</em> expert but that sounds...bad. I guess we'll just have to wait and let the courts decide if the Top G will be freed permanently. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Where an angry father is addressing a school board. Context is missing, but I can gather the school board knows of the alleged assignment that the father is at the meeting to address.

There has been a teacher who made students read a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/teacher-leave-assignment-tenth-grade" target="_blank">story about nine-year-olds watching grown men masturbate</a>. High school students were <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/high-school-students-sex-worksheet" target="_blank">asked to grade how comfortable they were with anal sex</a>. Kindergarten students -- KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS -- were <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kindergarten-outrage-homework-assignment" target="_blank">assigned to draw a picture of where the best place in their home is to masturbate</a>.<br /></p><p>The resolution tends to be some version of the same: a suspension pending an investigation, plausible deniability by administrators, and the teacher not heard from unless it also involves a perp walk. What I want to know is what this teacher's (and his peers) excuse/rationale/thought process is.</p><p>Is it a simple case of sexual deviancy and needing to be 500 yards away from playgrounds at all times? Or in the teacher's twisted mind, do they think there is educational value in these assignments? I'd like to hear the teacher have to explain in front of parents why they assigned these assignments, what the goal was, and what ideology went into deciding these were appropriate assignments for school children.</p><p>Then they can be fired and kept 500 yards away from playgrounds.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Nancy Pelosi gets fact-checked into oblivion over ignorant Trump indictment tweet

The political communication professionals, all of who had to sign off on this talking point, also don't understand basic civics.</p><p>Or, none of them care about basic civics. And think that because they hate Trump and he's their political opponent, he doesn't deserve to be treated fairly.</p><p>That's fine. It's the new norm now. It's the new rules.

## LOL: Nancy Pelosi says the quiet part out loud about Trump's indictment and 'proving innocence'

And also be concerned about the criminal justice system in our country. But let's focus on the laughs. </p><p>After news of the indictment broke, Pelosi tweeted out,<em> "The Grand Jury has acted upon the facts and the law. No one is above the law, and everyone has the right to a trial to <strong>prove innocence</strong>. Hopefully, the former President will peacefully respect the system, which grants him that right."</em></p><p>Wait, what was that? "Prove innocence?" That doesn't sound right...</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThe Grand Jury has acted upon the facts and the law. \n\nNo one is above the law, and everyone has the right to a trial to prove innocence. \n\nHopefully, the former President will peacefully respect the system, which grants him that right.\u201d</div> — Nancy Pelosi (@Nancy Pelosi)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1641594971462541315">1680221715</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Thankfully, Twitter readers added some helpful context as to what Pelosi might've meant:<em> "Ms. Pelosi mistakenly says that Trump can prove his innocence at trial. Law in the US assumes the innocence of a defendant and the prosecution must prove guilt for a conviction." </em></p><p>However, I'm not so sure this was a mistake. Since Trump announced he was running for President the first time, all investigations launched against him seem to be based on the assumption that he is guilty. Over and over again, his political opposition alleged both criminal and impeachment charges against him, only to have them completely unravel when they couldn't meet the burden of proof. Like the disastrous Mueller Report, which might as well been a doodle from my 5th grade math notebook. </p><p>This is especially evident with the current indictment, since we still have no idea what charges Trump is facing. It's not illegal to pay a porn star to keep quiet about an affair. Immoral, sure - but not illegal. Not to mention the 2018 letter that came out last week showing Michael Cohen lied to federal election officials about the payments to Stormy Daniels, and that the Trump campaign was not involved. </p><p>From the <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/22/2018-letter-shows-michael-cohen-lying-to-federal-officials/" target="_blank">NY Post:</a> </p><p><em>"In [the letter] Cohen told the Federal Election Commission that he 'used his own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Ms. Stephanie Clifford,' aka Daniels, in 2016.</em></p><p><em>'Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment directly or indirectly,' Cohen lawyer Stephen Ryan wrote on Feb. 8, 2018."</em></p><p>So it'll be interesting to see how this whole thing shakes out. But right now, it looks like they're just making even more of a martyr out of Donald Trump. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: MSNBC slimes Rom DeSantis as antisemitic for stating facts about district attorney behind Trump's indictment

But somehow, that means DeSantis is an antisemite. Because lefty math is weird. </p><p>In DeSantis's statement on the indictment of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/donald-trump-arrested-tuesday" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>, DeSantis wrote, "<em>The Soros-backed Manhattan District Attorney has consistently bent the law to downgrade felonies and to excuse criminal misconduct. Yet, now he is stretching the law to target a political opponent."</em></p><p>The "Soros-backed" attorney he's referring to is Alvin Bragg, who is in fact "Soros-backed". But we'll get to that later. First, watch as MSNBC accuses DeSantis of being a rabid antisemite for *checks notes* stating a fact. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201c@JoyAnnReid @GovRonDeSantis .@JoeNBC on DeSantis saying DA Bragg is "Soros-backed": "They\u2019re attacking Jewish international bankers.

<p>And there's more! NBC Senior Reporter Ben Collins claimed on Twitter that since George Soros has never personally <em>met</em> with Alvin Bragg, there's simply NO WAY he could be Soros-backed! CheckMATE Republicans. </p><p>Obviously, this is very silly. As Joe Cunningham over at RedState pointed out. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cWhether or not Soros met with a politician has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not the politician is \u201cSoros-backed,\u201d and Ben knows this.\u201d</div> — Joe Cunningham (@Joe Cunningham)

<p>Now, about that Soros funding. In May 2021, Soros <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/soros-family-helped-push-manhattan-da-bragg-power" target="_blank">donated $1M </a>to the Color Of Change PAC, a group "focused on building independent Black political power, amplifying Black voices, electing progressive candidates and holding them accountable". Alvin Bragg's campaign then <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11878893/How-billionaire-George-Soros-funded-NYCs-woke-DA-Alvin-Bragg-tune-1million.html" target="_blank">received over $1M</a> from the Color of Change PAC. And George Soros's son Jonathan and his wife both donated directly to Soros's campaign. </p><p>Soros has funded <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10894581/George-Soross-groups-spent-40-million-elect-75-progressive-prosecutors-decade.html" target="_blank">at least 75</a> progressive prosecutors nationwide, either directly or funneled through various progressive organizations, many of which are connected to his Open Society Foundations. Notably, Soros has funded the defense attorneys of Manhattan, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Portland. Soros's DAs all enact soft-on-crime policies like eliminating cash bail. Oh, and Soros also backed the DA of Loudon County, Virginia, where a biologically male student in a skirt allegedly sexually assaulted a girl in the bathroom at school. The father of the girl was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/soros-da-thrown-off-another-case" target="_blank">convicted</a> of "disorderly conduct" for criticizing the school board. </p><p>In conclusion, yes, the Manhattan DA is Soros-backed, as are many DAs across the country. But don't repeat this, lest you be labeled an antisemite and shunned from polite society. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>It is unclear what the security guards were saying to Ricardo as they rubbed his face into the first. Safe to assume at least one of them was divorced and was telling the romantic Dodgers fan that prostitutes are cheaper in the long run. All while Ramona stands in the bleachers confused, awkward, and noticing way too many smartphones in her face.<br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>It worked out for all involved. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/mlb/article-11924401/Baseball-fan-goes-viral-proposal-goes-wrong-Dodger-Stadium.html" target="_blank">The DailyMail reports</a> Ramona said yes to Ricardo's bold proposal before he was handcuffed.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Don't let anyone tell you love is dead. At least, not at a baseball game. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/new-york-islanders-proposal" target="_blank">At a hockey game maybe</a>. But definitely not baseball.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## CBS bans word "transgender" while reporting on trans Nashville shooter, another outlet praises shooter's artistic skills

And our media, since the shooter doesn't fit their preferred shooter profile of a MAGA-American, appears invested in humanizing this murderer.</p><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/30/cbs-execs-bar-the-word-transgender-from-reports-on-audrey-hale/" target="_blank">CBS News sent out a memo</a> ordering people to not refer to the transgender shooter as "transgender." There has been confusion since the shooting as to which way he/him identifies, and CBS News would like to not hurt anyone's feelings. </p><blockquote>“The shooter’s gender identity has not been confirmed by CBS News,” the network’s executives insisted in a Tuesday memo obtained by The Post. “As such, we should avoid any mention of it as it has no known relevance to the crime. Should that change, we can and will revisit.”</blockquote><p>In CBS News's defense, had the shooter yelled "Allah Akabar" before shooting, the network would not think that was relevant to the crime either. Other media outlets believe Hale (he/him) being trans is VERY relevant to the crime. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/feeds/%E2%80%9CThe%20shooter%E2%80%99s%20gender%20identity%20has%20not%20been%20confirmed%20by%20CBS%20News,%E2%80%9D%20the%20network%E2%80%99s%20executives%20insisted%20in%20a%20Tuesday%20memo%20obtained%20by%20The%20Post.%20%E2%80%9CAs%20such,%20we%20should%20avoid%20any%20mention%20of%20it%20as%20it%20has%20no%20known%20relevance%20to%20the%20crime.%20Should%20that%20change,%20we%20can%20and%20will%20revisit.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">It's their excuse to blame conservatives for it</a>.</p><p>Then you have The Mirror, who felt Hale -- who murdered children - having "childlike" and "whimsical" artistic skills was necessary information for us to have.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Nashville school shooter Audrey Hale could have been a children's illustrator as their artwork was "whimsical" and "childlike", a former teacher has revealed.<a href="https://t.co/ksXeOyPWzw">https://t.co/ksXeOyPWzw</a><br />— The Mirror (@DailyMirror) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyMirror/status/1641769811431636992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>While the tweet still exists, the article has since been deleted. The Mirror seconded guessed themselves and decided a child murderer's former art professor isn't a voice we needed to be hearing from right now. That this article even passed editorial approval in the first place says much about the state of our media.<br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Ron DeSantis leaves no doubt, unloads on Manhattan DA over Trump indictment, political witch hunt

Trump's biggest (eventual) rival in the GOP presidential primary Ron DeSantis joined the chorus of people denouncing this bitterly partisan witch hunt.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda turns the rule of law on its head. <br /><br />It is un-American. <br /><br />The Soros-backed Manhattan District Attorney has consistently bent the law to downgrade felonies and to excuse criminal misconduct. Yet, now he is…<br />— Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) <a href="https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1641575007552778243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>This part is key since Trump is a Florida resident:</p><blockquote>Florida will not assist in an extradition request given the questionable circumstances at issue with this Soros-backed Manhattan prosecutor and his political agenda.</blockquote><p>At issue is Trump allegedly cheating on his third wife while she was pregnant with porn star Stormy Daniels. Then, money allegedly exchanged hands so Daniels would shut up about it. If all things were true (for sake of argument), it's at best a slap on the wrist and a fine. This is where Soros-backed Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg comes in. He bumped up a misdemeanor to a felony and that is what Trump was charged with.</p><p>It's the same Alvin Bragg who routinely bumps felonies down to misdemeanors. <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/26/convictions-plummet-downgraded-charges-surge-under-manhattan-da-bragg/" target="_blank">Convictions have plummeted and charges have been downgraded</a> for a host of crimes (committed by actual criminals) since Bragg took over. Bragg has <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/26/convictions-plummet-downgraded-charges-surge-under-manhattan-da-bragg/" target="_blank">refused to seek prison sentences for violent criminals</a>. And <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bodega-stabbed-during-altercation" target="_blank">on a related note</a>, NYC <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nypd-slain-officer-manattan-da" target="_blank">has turned into</a> a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/michael-rapaport-rite-aid-nyc" target="_blank">crime-infested suck hole</a> since he ascended to office. Not unlike other progressive cities where progressive DAs have done similar.</p><p>Yet we're indicting Trump just because...Trumpity Trumpy Trump Trump. I think Bragg wins a trophy and a $100 gift card to Applebee's for being the first progressive douche to do so.</p><p>At the end of the day, if this is the game the left wants to play...fine by me. These new rules about arresting political opponents on politically motivated trumped-up charges being the norm will be fun to play with in two years during a Republican administration.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Wannabe thief is such an epic failure, he's too weak to break a jewelry case with a brick

Ever since Mel Brooks came down the mountain with the Fifteen Commandments, "Thou Shall Not Steal' was one of them. Don't take things that don't belong to you. Okay? Okay.</p><p><em>HOWEVER</em>, I can see someone sitting at home watching <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/smash-grab-new-jersey" target="_blank">viral video</a> after <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shoplifting-smash-grab-los-angeles" target="_blank">viral video</a> of people getting away with stealing things and saying to themself, "Self, I can do that." Even if <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shoplifters-jewlery-store-smash-grab" target="_blank">the employees fight back</a>, you can still grab a handful of watches. As one dinkus from Wisconsin learned, it's not as easy as it looks.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Shoplifter fails to break jewelry case with rock and gets chased out <a href="https://t.co/D5scV6BUGi">pic.twitter.com/D5scV6BUGi</a><br />— Clown World ™ 🤡 (@ClownWorld_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClownWorld_/status/1641642343156834305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Our man here walks into a Kay Jewelers, not even a high-end joint. It appears to be in broad daylight. He looks like he just finished an afternoon shift working at Target, which could have very well been in the same strip mall. So, before he even attempts his epic fail, we have a clear description of him.<br /></p><p>He then tries to put a brick through the glass case. Maybe the glass case has been fortified. Maybe he is a vegan and a steady diet of soy has left him without any upper body strength. Whatever the excuse, the brick fails to penetrate the glass.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Right away, our dude's plan has been foiled. Anyone with half a brain would run. But he KEEPS TRYING to put the brick through the glass and KEEPS FAILING TO DO SO! The employee had enough time to put down her sandwich, look to see what the commotion was, walk over and say, "hey, you, stop doing that."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="777fc" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=30131692&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>If you have any details on this man's whereabouts, after calling the authorities, please point at him and laugh on behalf of a grateful internet. He helped give future thieves a masterclass in what not to do. He helped give those of us who hustle content for a living a hearty chuckle. The only thing he didn't do was pull off a successful heist. Danny Ocean this man is not. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
