<p dir="ltr">Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said he's not a big fan of traditional advertising and prefers for marketing in Fortnite to take the form of brand collaborations like themed cosmetics and branded concerts.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/i-hate-advertising-in-games-qa-with-epic-games-tim-sweeney-and-saxx-persson-on-the-future-of-fortnite-unreal-engine/">Digiday</a>, Sweeney said, "The best moments in Fortnite have been other brands entering the world of Fortnite--fashion companies, the Ferrari dropping into the world, Marvel and Star Wars crossovers."</p><p dir="ltr">"I think brand presence is a much healthier way for companies to get involved in the metaverse than advertising. Playing an ad is just annoying.

<p>CD Projekt Red, the studio behind Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher series, has announced it will now offer menstrual leave for employees experiencing menstrual-related pain. The company publicly announced the new policy on March 30 via <a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1641442087051862018">Twitter</a>, writing:</p><p dir="ltr">"We're proud to offer menstrual leave to employees! Team members can now focus on their comfort &amp; health by taking time off when suffering from period pain. It’s all about inclusivity &amp; fostering a supportive workplace."</p><p dir="ltr">The policy comes after CD Projekt Red's sister company, GOG, introduced the benefit last year. According to CD Projekt Red public relations representative Ola Sondej, the studio spent the last few months observing GOG's experience with the policy before ultimately deciding to follow its steps. Sondej said the team ultimately found the benefit boosts "an environment where menstruating team members can feel more comfortable and supported to achieve their individual potential." In addition, the benefit represents "another step in creating an inclusive work environment."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-the-witcher-developer-cd-projekt-red-introduces-menstrual-leave-for-employees/1100-6512887/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Streamer Discovers You Can Use Golden Eggs To Kill A Tough Resident Evil 4 Boss

<p>It's widely known that you can purchase expensive rocket launchers to one-shot most bosses in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a>, but what if you could take down a particularly challenging boss using something from a chicken's butt? Well, good news--one streamer took to Twitter to show that you can do exactly that.</p><p>Twitcher streamer LARXA posted a clip to Twitter on Thursday showing them defeating late-game boss Salazar using only two Golden Eggs. They go on to point out that simply hitting the boss with one egg on the weak part of his body takes off around 70% of his health, so you could technically weaken him a bit with other means and then finish him off with some yolk to the noggin.</p><p><em><strong>Spoilers for Resident Evil 4 below.</strong></em></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/streamer-discovers-you-can-use-golden-eggs-to-kill-a-tough-resident-evil-4-boss/1100-6512885/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Roguelite Endless Dungeon Spices Up Its Tower Defense Levels With A Character-Driven Story

<p>In Endless Dungeon, developer Amplitude Studios returns to its primarily 4X strategy franchise. This time, however, the studio is opting for a twin-stick tower defense game with both hero shooter and roguelite elements. It makes for what looks to be an amusing sci-fi romp through a long-abandoned space station, especially if you have a few friends on hand to play with in three-player co-op.</p><p dir="ltr">The game sees you play as one of many survivors trapped on a seemingly inescapable space station. The only way out is in the furthest depths of the station. To get there, you'll need to fight through waves of enemies, erecting defenses in the hallways you clear so that you can more easily escort a fragile crystal from checkpoint to checkpoint. Pushing the crystal forward summons a brand-new wave of enemies to defeat, and if they destroy the crystal (or you), it's back to the station's hub area (a saloon) for you.</p><p dir="ltr">During a preview event for the game, I spoke to narrative director Jeff Spock and lead game designer Arthur Prudent about Endless Dungeon's story and how the game centers its narrative elements and hero characters within its roguelite structure. Endless Dungeon is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC on May 18.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roguelite-endless-dungeon-spices-up-its-tower-defense-levels-with-a-character-driven-story/1100-6512883/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Survival-horror games that allow me to fight back against whatever is trying to kill me are my jam. I like to exert a certain amount of control over my environment when trapped in frightful situations--it's how I cope. I don't dislike horror games where the main threat is an unkillable monster you just have to run away from. I'm just usually paralyzed with indecision and fear and wish I were literally anywhere else when trying to play them.</p><p dir="ltr">It made checking out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker/">Amnesia: The Bunker</a> at GDC particularly difficult. But I persevered. For you.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Bunker, you play as a French soldier during World War I who, after becoming trapped in a German bunker, discovers its hallways are being stalked by an unkillable snake-meets-gorilla monster. Whatever the creature is, it loves the dark, so keeping the generator in the bunker running is your best bet. The lights won't fully stop the monster, though. They only slow the creature enough that you can more easily land a shot on it to temporarily scare it off. In a surprising showcase of compassion, the game has you use only one of the two bullets you start off with, affording you <em>a whole single bullet</em> to defend yourself from the jump. Wow. So generous.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amnesia-the-bunker-is-too-stressful-for-me-but-an-interesting-shift-away-from-the-series-linear-roots/1100-6512881/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Microsoft Office 2021 is currently on sale for $40 through GameSpot Deals (via StackCommerce). This deal is available for both PC and Mac users. On PC, you'll get <a href="https://deals.gamespot.com/sales/microsoft-office-pro-plus-2021-for-windows-lifetime-license-email-only">Microsoft Office 2021 Professional,</a>   whereas Mac users will receive a key for the <a href="https://deals.gamespot.com/sales/microsoft-office-home-and-business-for-mac-2021-lifetime-license">Home and Business edition.</a>   The $40 price is active from March 22 through April 3, making this the perfect time to grab the software. </p><p>It's a particularly good deal for students and those who don't have much of a need for a consistently evolving productivity suite.

## 6 People WWE Needs In Its Hall Of Fame

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4119481-wwe-hall-of-fame-logo.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This year's WWE Hall of Fame inductees include wrestling legends, a manager, and an iconic comedian. It's the smallest class in recent years with only five inductees: Rey Mysterio, the Great Muta, Stacey Kiebler, referee Tim White, and Andy Kaufman. This is the 24th overall class, which started in 1993, with Andre the Giant being the sole inductee. Since then, it's become part of Wrestlemania weekend, usually seen as a torch-passing with the current generation and to give a chance to celebrate former stars. Last year's class included the Undertaker, Queen Sharmell, Vader, and the Steiner Brothers. </p><p>These individuals will join the other 234 inductees which include names like Bret Hart, Hulk Hogan, "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, Trish Stratus, and Jushin "Thunder" Liger, but there are still huge names that have yet to be inducted. Let's take a look at some notable performers who have yet to take their place among the other immortals in the WWE Hall of Fame which include dominating champions and pop culture figures that brought wrestling to the mainstream.</p><p>This year's ceremony will take place on March 31, 2023 at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, the day before Night One of Wrestlemania 39. It will air live at 7 PM PT / 10 PM ET on Peacock in the United States and on the WWE Network internationally, immediately after the airing of WWE's regular Friday night program, SmackDown.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Rock</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4119497-the-rock.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Debuting at Survivor Series 1996, the then-Rocky Maivia had big things in store, but a cultural shift and an injury threw things momentarily off course. First billed as a constantly smiling blue chipper, fans returned his shining charisma with chants of "die, Rocky, die." He soon won the Intercontinental Championship and even defended it successfully against the likes of Bret Hart and Hunter Hearst-Helmsley--both future WWE Hall of Famers. A knee injury would take the budding star out for four months, but he would return with a new attitude, and a moniker he would later become synonymous with for decades to come: The Rock. Now going by his real name, Dwayne Johnson, he was a staple of the Attitude Era and quickly became a legend in his own and became a pop culture icon before he was 30. Johnson has left wrestling behind for the most part, making brief appearances once every few years or so, but he cemented his legacy years ago.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Paul Heyman</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4119550-paul_heyman_bio.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Wrestling fans may forget that Paul Heyman's start in the wrestling business happened when he was in high school, being a published photographer for Pro Wrestling Illustrated at the age of 14. From there he was seen as a manager in numerous territories before helping found ECW, Extreme Championship Wrestling, after rechristening Eastern Championship Wrestling in 1994, becoming the sole owner just a year later. Although he's forever tied to ECW, his WWE career has also been the stuff of legend, being a manager to six world champions, while also providing commentary, writing, and booking Ohio Valley Wrestling (WWE's developmental branch at the time), resurrecting ECW, and writing Smackdown. For the past two years, he's provided "counsel" to Roman Reigns, leading him to the longest championship reign in the modern era at almost 1,000 days. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bam Bam Bigelow</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4119551-c65f4759ba534c3f72da31f9800a808a_crop_north.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Beast from the East. Bret Hart once described Bigelow as "possibly the best working big man in the business." During his career, Bigelow wrestled for the biggest promotions of the time, capturing championship gold in most of them. His only award won in WWE is a Slammy Award, but that didn't stop Bam Bam from main-eventing in the first Survivor Series, King of the Ring '93 and '95, and Wrestlemania XI. Bigelow is a one-time ECW World Champion, ECW TV Champion, IWGP Tag Team Champion with WWE Hall of Famer Vader, and two-time WCW Tag Team Champion with Kanyon and DDP as part of the Jersey Triad. With his trademark flaming head tattoo, Bigelow established himself early in his career as a big man who could do it all and deserves his place among some of the greatest of all time.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Demolition</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4119552-demolition_bio.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Having their names already carved in tag team champion history as holding the record for the most combined days as reigning champions (before the Raw and Smackdown tag titles were split), Demolition's absence in the Hall of Fame is truly mind-boggling. Often compared to the Road Warriors, Demolition was garbed in Mad Max-esque gear resembling Lord Humungus, with makeup similar to KISS underneath their masks. A pillar of WWF's tag team scene for years, eventually winning the tag championship three times, Ax and Smash would continue to team up years later across different promotions.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bull Nakano</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4119554-l-intro-1678477141.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Often imitated, never duplicated. For American wrestling fans, Nakano might be best remembered for her rivalry with Alundra Blayze, with Nakano defeating Blayze for the title in the Tokyo Dome in 1994. The event was part of a working agreement between WWE and All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling. Nakano also wrestled several times for WCW in the '90s, again being the antithesis of what women's wrestling was usually showcased as. However, when she joined the then-WWF, she was already an almost 10-year veteran. Nakano captured her first championship in Japan at the age of 16, just a year later capturing the AJW (All Japan's Women) Championship. Beth Phoenix recently paid homage to Nakano's iconic makeup and hair when she teamed with Edge at this year's Royal Rumble. Already an inductee of the All Japan Women's Hall of Fame (Class of 1998) and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter's Hall of Fame (Class of 2001), Bull Nakano needs to be a part of the WWE Hall of Fame as well. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cyndi Lauper</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4119574-097177cb42f4dd60e308da723ece4760_crop_exact.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>How is Cyndi Lauper not in the Hall of Fame already? She was integral to the crossover appeal with WWF and the MTV generation it was trying to attract. Her time in the company started by accident after meeting "Captain" Lou Albano on a plane. She invited the wrestler-turned-manager to appear in the music video for her hit song "Girls Just Want To Have Fun." From there, Lauper appeared many times on WWF television and had a colossal presence at the first Wrestlemania. The pop megastar even accompanied Wendi Richter to ringside as Richter defeated Leilani Kai for the Women's Championship. Lauper, alongside Mr. T, were huge celebrity factors that brought wrestling into mainstream pop culture. There's definitely an argument to be had about if she belongs in the celebrity wing, or in the proper Hall of Fame. It should be noted that she's one of the very few people from Wrestlemania I not to be inducted yet. </p></h3></p><br />

<p>The new fantasy movie Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves makes its official debut this weekend, but ahead of its wide Friday release, the movie made millions from Thursday previews in the US. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/03/box-office-dungeons-dragons-1235314579/">Deadline</a>, the movie pulled in $5.6 million from the total of its preview screenings, including $4.1 million for Thursday alone. The other $1.5 million came from screenings that took place earlier in other places.</p><p>Deadline said a comparable film to Honor Among Thieves is Sony's Uncharted, starring Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg. That film made $3.7 million for its Thursday previews in 2022. The $4.1 million in Thursday previews is tracking ahead of the Thursday preview numbers for Mad Max: Fury Road ($3.7 million) and slightly behind A Quiet Place ($4.3 million).</p><div>          </div><p>Honor Among Thieves is getting great reviews and has a cast of big names including Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez, but it's expected to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-honor-among-thieves-expected-to-have-slow-start-at-the-box-office-this-weekend/1100-6512828/">only as much as $40 million in the US for its first weekend</a>. That's a good chunk of change, but the film carried a reported $150 million budget before marketing expenses. Globally, Honor Among Thieves is projected to earn $65 million for its first weekend, which suggests the film will need to continue to perform well in the weeks to come to turn a profit.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-honor-among-thieves-lifts-off-with-better-thursday-numbers-than-tom-hollands-uncharted/1100-6512877/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The film is a bit of a mystery, and now Aster has described it in a way few could have expected.</p><p>In a behind-the-scenes featurette, Aster said Beau is Afraid about a man's quest, not unlike The Lord of the Rings. "It's like a Jewish Lord of the Rings, but he's just going to his mom's house," Aster said.</p><div>          </div><p>He went on to say that his aim with Beau is Afraid is to "put you in the experience of being a loser" through the eyes of Beau, who is played by Oscar-winning actor Joaquin Phoenix.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horror-director-ari-aster-says-new-movie-beau-is-afraid-is-like-a-jewish-lord-of-the-rings/1100-6512866/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Will Retail At $599 - Report

<p dir="ltr">GPUs are getting pretty expensive these days, and it seems that the new GeForce RTX 4070 will continue that trend. According to a report from <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-to-retail-at-599">VideoCardz</a>, Nvidia plans to price the not-yet-announced RTX 4070 at $599.</p><p dir="ltr">The $599 price point corresponds to the price of last generation's RTX 3070 Ti at launch, which was one of the most successful cards of that era. It's worth noting that the RTX 4070 Ti is already out, and retails for $799. That card was briefly known as the RTX 4080 12 GB and was set to launch at a $899 price point, but a backlash from consumers ultimately made Nvidia "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-unlaunches-rtx-4080-12gb-saying-its-name-is-confusing/1100-6508316/">unlaunch</a>" the card. The report also suggests that the 4070 RTX has a launch date of April 13. All of this information is reportedly based on internal Nvidia plans, so they may be subject to change.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that VideoCardz filed this report as a rumor, but the outlet has been quite reliable on GPU news in the past. The 4070 RTX will feature 12 GB of memory and 5888 CUDA cores, compared to 7680 CUDA cores in the Ti version. Though fans decried the $599 price point, Nvidia has repeatedly claimed that rising costs will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-gpu-prices-to-go-down-nvidia-boss-says/1100-6507748/">keep prices high</a> for a long time.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-will-retail-at-599-report/1100-6512871/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Hot Wheels: Rift Rally Makes A Race Track Of Your House And A Competitor Of Your Pets

<p dir="ltr">Hot Wheels has been one of the most dominant toy brands for more than 50 years, meaning generations of kids grew up with them, and in many cases became generations of adult collectors and/or parents of new fans. In that span, the brand has expanded beyond physical cars and tracks to offer mobile apps, RC cars, console games, and more. By now, Hot Wheels has been reinvented in nearly every way it could be. But teaming with Velan Studios, creators of Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, has emblazoned the iconic flame logo on a new landscape: mixed reality. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hot-wheels-rift-rally/">Hot Wheels: Rift Rally</a> carries on from what Velan did with its Nintendo collaboration to give Hot Wheels fans of all ages a novel way to burn rubber.</p><p dir="ltr">Being an augmented, or "mixed," reality experience, Hot Wheels: Rift Rally is both a traditional video game in that you download software to play it, and a physical toy that you unbox from its package. Out of that box, you'll get one camera-equipped car, dubbed the Chameleon, and pieces of plastic and cardboard that are easily assembled in about three minutes, allowing you to make a forever-customizable track.</p><p dir="ltr">Rift Rally's Chameleon hides a sync button on its unique exterior that you use in combination with a QR code presented on their screen, be that your TV if playing on PS4/PS5, or via iOS on a range of iPads and iPhones that go back several years. As a result, most players will already have the device they need, which makes for a nice step up on the team's Mario Kart game, which is confined to just the Switch. Setup is quick and can be done via Wi-Fi on either platform or by connecting directly to the PS5. The Wi-Fi option is preferred according to in-game text, and I'd agree after spending time with both, though in smaller spaces, a direct-to-console connection can be enough, though it may not be as reliable. Occasionally, the console connection left my car stuttering at times, as though the signal was noticeably weak when it moved far away or around walls.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hot-wheels-rift-rally-makes-a-race-track-of-your-house-and-a-competitor-of-your-pets/1100-6512856/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Nearly three months ahead of its scheduled release date, Square Enix has announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi/">Final Fantasy XVI</a> has gone gold, meaning the game is ready to be pressed onto discs--though development will still continue.

There have been a few other Final Fantasy games released in the years since then, such as Final Fantasy VII Remake, but the release of a core numbered entry in the series has become a rare occurrence.

<p>Bungie has released an in-depth preview of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-smgs-arent-getting-nerfed-but-other-weapons-are-getting-buffed-soon/1100-6512483/">upcoming mid-season weapons update</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>, featuring substantial buffs to a number of primary weapons. The Exotic SMG Tarrabah and Legendary Ikelos SMG will see PvP nerfs in this update, with a number of other tweaks and balances on the cards.</p><p>The major focus of this weapons balance pass is to shore up the sometimes lacklustre primary weapons class, especially as PvE content gets more challenging. Auto Rifles, Pulse Rifles, Hand Cannons, Sidearms, and Scout Rifles will all be getting buffs in the update. Bungie explained that SMGs and Bows have been used for the "benchmark" for these buffs, with the intention being to bring other weapons up to the same level of effectiveness.</p><p>Auto Rifles will see a 25% damage buff against red and orange bar enemies in PvE, Pulse Rifles, Hand Cannons, and Sidearms will get 20%, while Scout Rifles get a 10% buff. The weapons team has said that you should be more likely to one-shot red bar enemies in Heroic and Legendary content. In a comment on Twitter, Bungie clarified that the above buffs also apply to Exotic weapons, and will stack with the 40% damage boost against red bar enemies.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-previews-primary-weapons-buffs-for-mid-season-update/1100-6512859/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>CD Projekt Red has released its earnings report for 2022, and it's looking good for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/">Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> developer. The company boasted a 66% increase in net profit, driven by an increase in revenue, and a decrease in CDPR's overall operating costs.</p><p>The Polish company reported a revenue of 953 million PLN ($222 million USD) in 2022, up from 888 million PLN ($207 million USD) the previous year, and a net profit of 347 million PLN ($81 million USD), up from 209 million PLN ($49 million USD) in 2021. Despite the upwards trend, CDPR hasn't managed to hit the same level of success it saw in 2020, when Cyberpunk 2077's release caused a massive revenue spike that took its yearly profit to a massive 1.15 billion PLN ($268 million USD).</p><p>In its profit and loss breakdown, CDPR showed a 7% increase in revenue year-on-year, a modest figure that's nevertheless impressive two years after the company's last major game release. Despite its rough launch, Cyberpunk 2077 has seen solid sales after CDPR committed to fixing the game's initial issues and adding extra content, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-helped-cd-projekt-make-more-money-than-ever-before-in-a-q3/1100-6509534/">success of Netflix's Edgerunners anime</a> giving it an extra boost in late 2022.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-reports-major-profit-and-revenue-growth-year-on-year/1100-6512858/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
