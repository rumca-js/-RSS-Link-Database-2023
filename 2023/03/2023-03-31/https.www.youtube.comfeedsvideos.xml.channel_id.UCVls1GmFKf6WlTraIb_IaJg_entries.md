On this edition of HEY DT:

0:00 Intro
0:21 You say that you don't care if people use free software or proprietary software...
4:31 How best to set up a window manager so that it doesn't automatically shut off the monitors after 10 minutes?
6:11 Why don't you use 'printf' for ensuring the right amount of spaces ? That 'for' loop is actually ridiculous!
9:04 Could you do this for Alacritty? (neofetch, powerline, colorscripts)
11:10 Can you review FreeDOS?
12:26 Do you have pin-workspaces in the polybar config set to false? That may fix it?
15:30 By default my machine now has nouveau drivers and I need cuda to mine crypto...
17:28 I am just letting you know that I will never use a window manager because I am very happy with GNOME.
18:01 Why make DTOS a build script as opposed to a full distribution, with a Calamares installer etc?
23:03 Thanks to the Patrons.
