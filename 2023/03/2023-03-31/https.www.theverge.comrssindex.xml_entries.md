  <p id="353cCs">Another hoverboard is being recalled due to fire risk. According to a notice on <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2023/Jetson-Electric-Bikes-Recalls-42-Volt-Rogue-Self-Balancing-Scooters-Hoverboards-Due-to-Fire-Hazard-Two-Deaths-Reported?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">the US Consumer Product Safety Commission’s (CPSC) website</a>, the 42-volt Jetson Rogue is being recalled because the lithium-ion battery packs in the hoverboards can overheat. </p>
<p id="6M1ECd">A fire marshal in Pennsylvania determined that a Jetson Rogue was the point of origin for a fire that killed two children, the CPSC’s notice says. The parents of the children are suing Jetson and Target, where they say they purchased the hoverboard, alleging the two companies should have known of the risk of fire-related injuries due to the design of the Jetson Rogue. (The parents originally sued Walmart, but amended their complaint to sue Target.)</p>

  <p id="Llgyjc">Occasionally, people will (incorrectly) insist that Marvel’s comics and the cinematic stories inspired by them would be better off if they were somehow devoid of any political themes or ideas. But in <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/03/secret-invasion-marvel-exclusive">a recent interview with <em>Vanity Fair</em></a>, <em>Secret Invasion </em>executive producer Jonathan Schwartz likened the series to John le Carré’s classic Cold War-era spy thrillers and pointed to more recent shows, like FX’s <em>The Americans </em>and Showtime’s <em>Homeland, </em>as sources of inspiration.</p>
<p id="lPKOEs">“We often see Nick Fury doing the right thing,” Schwartz said. “We don’t always see him doing it in a perfectly morally correct way. All of those things have ramifications. Without getting too specific, the things that Nick Fury’s had to do to protect the Earth have costs.”</p>

  <p id="Fl3Xgf">It seems like some companies may not have to pay Twitter $1,000 a month for the privilege of retaining their verified status and checkmarks. Twitter is giving a free pass to the 500 advertisers that spend the most on its platform as well as the top 10,000 organizations by follower count, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/30/technology/elon-musk-ftc-chair.html">according to a report from <em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>
<p id="mLQ6Tg">The decision comes as Twitter is preparing to make major changes to the way verification works on Twitter. It’s said that it’ll start <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23654206/twitter-legacy-blue-verified-checkmarks-april-fools-day">winding down the legacy verified program</a> in April and announced plans for <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/twitter-verification-for-organizations.html">Twitter Verification for Organizations</a>. The latter is meant to let companies that are willing to pay $1,000 a month keep their verification as well as denote specific accounts as “affiliated.” </p>
