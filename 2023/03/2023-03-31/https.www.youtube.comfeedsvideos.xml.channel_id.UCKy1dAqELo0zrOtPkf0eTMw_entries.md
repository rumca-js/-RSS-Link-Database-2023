The Shazam sequel, Shazam: Fury of the Gods is out and it’s making news, but not so much about what’s in Shazam 2 itself. Following the Black Adam release, it was unclear if we’d ever see a Shazam vs Black Adam showdown, which in most cases would be the most natural thing to do. Well, turns out we are getting that face-off, except its more like Dwayne Johnson vs Zachary Levi in the battle of “why did these movies fail expectations?” We’re going back in the archives for this one– Does the Rock hate Shazam? Who does Zach Levi blame? Will either be back in the DCEU? We’ve done some digging and we think we’ve got an idea…

Join members of the cast and crew for a behind-the-scenes look at Fast X, as they reflect on the series, discuss family, and thank fans. Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious saga, stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jason Momoa, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Sung Kang, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior, Scott Eastwood, with Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, and Rita Moreno.

Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.
 
In 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price.
 
Dante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance.

Fast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis, and Mark Bomback.

Fast X, directed by Louis Leterrier, opens in theaters on May 19, 2023.

## MLB The Show 23 Review

MLB The Show 23 reviewed by Justin Koreis on PlayStation 5, also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

After a somewhat disappointing 2022, it’s amazing how far forward Sony San Diego has pushed MLB The Show 23. It seems like every element has received attention, whether its the improved scouting in Diamond Dynasty, updates to match the current MLB rulebook, or a vastly more helpful practice mode. This remains a gorgeous showcase for baseball, with some of the most lifelike sights and sounds to behold in a sports game. It remains to be seen if Sets and Seasons will frustrate in the long run, but the crowning achievement this year is the Negro Leagues mode. This playable piece of baseball history is a triumph, presented with care, grace, and attention to detail. It’s courageous and bold, like the pioneers it highlights, and it’s astonishing to experience something so affecting from a baseball game. If for nothing else, that alone makes MLB The Show 23 a must-play.

Forza Horizon 5: Rally Adventure reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X. Also available on Xbox One and PC.

"For long-time fans, Forza Horizon 5 Rally Adventure is a bit of a full-circle moment for this class-leading racing franchise. After all, the first DLC for the original Forza Horizon was a dedicated rally-themed add-on back in 2012. This new iteration on that idea may be a lot more conventional than last year’s outlandish Hot Wheels expansion, but fusing the open-world foundations of Forza Horizon with the arcade accessibility of offroad racing icon Sega Rally is still a winning combination."

In today's Daily Fix:
The ESA has officially announced that E3 2023 isn't happening. The writing was on the wall when Ubisoft, Sega, and a few other big name companies pulled out, so it isn't that surprising. Only time will tell if the ESA will try again next year, but that doesn't mean the summer is devoid of gaming events. Stay tuned to IGN where we'll be covering all the Directs, Showcases, and other events. February's game sales numbers are in, and Hogwarts Legacy topped the list with more than 12 million sold. Microsoft also revealed their Games with Gold lineup for April, and it's what you'd expect. In bummer news, EA is laying off around 6% of the company, which is about 775 employees. And a Nintendo exclusive is an exclusive no more, as Square Enix's Live A Live is coming to PC, PS4, and PS5 later this year.
