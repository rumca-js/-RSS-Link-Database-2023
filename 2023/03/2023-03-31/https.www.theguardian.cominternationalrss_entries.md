<p>Scientists responsible for monitoring the health of New Zealand's glaciers have revealed a trend of declining snow and ice. The 2023 survey was the 46th undertaken in a collaboration between the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa), Victoria University of Wellington, and the Department of Conservation. The longstanding project captures an aerial portrait of more than 50 Southern Alps glaciers at a similar time each year to track how they change. The team spent nearly eight hours travelling back and forth over the alps, taking thousands of aerial photographs of glaciers of differing sizes and orientations to use in various national and international research projects, including one that builds 3D models used to compare snow and ice year-to-year</p><ul><li><p>Tess's story here</p></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/apr/01/its-going-so-fast-the-decline-of-new-zealands-glaciers-video">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An attempt to force through an increase in the state pension age brought thousands of protesters out on to the streets and has left Emmanuel Macron facing his biggest crisis yet</p><p>When Emmanuel Macron was re-elected as France’s president last year, it was with a promise to bring in economic reforms after the damage done by Covid and what he believed was decades of failure to modernise. His platform was enough to defeat the far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, but she gained ground and a strong showing in the parliamentary election was enough to help deprive him of a working majority in the national assembly.</p><p>As the Guardian’s Paris correspondent, <strong>Angelique Chrisafis, </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>the French are no strangers to large-scale public protests, but the size and scale of the reaction to a planned increase in the retirement age has caught Macron off-guard. This week he was forced to cancel a state visit from King Charles, and police have been using increasing force to quell the protests in cities across the country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/mar/31/how-raising-the-retirement-age-set-france-on-fire-today-in-focus-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
