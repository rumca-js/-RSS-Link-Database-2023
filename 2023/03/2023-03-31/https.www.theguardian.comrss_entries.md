Exactly 34 weeks have passed since Arsenal kicked things off with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/05/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report" title="">a Friday night trip to Crystal Palace</a>, a week before temperatures in London hit 34 degrees, four months before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/qatar-2022-dishes-up-sporting-surprise-and-a-coronation-for-lionel-messi" title="">Lionel Messi was draped in a propaganda cape in Qatar</a>, a month before Liz Truss was sworn in as temp-to-perm prime minister. Is that story still this story? Is there an actual narrative arc here? Did somebody win the league in between and we’ve all just forgotten and carried on?</p><p>The good news, as March folds into April, is that we do now have some clarity. After that hungover summer start; after the fever dream of a northern winter World Cup, an entirely disjointed digression like an hour-long magic realist segue in an annoying arthouse film; after the jet-lagged Christmas restart, and now the weary what-now of a spring international break. After all that, the season is now primed not just for a genuine title race, but for an uncluttered run to the finish.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/31/two-months-two-teams-one-winner-premier-league-title-race-starts-here">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Acting head coach is set to be in charge of Tottenham for 10 crucial league matches and fans hope for a fresh approach</p><p>Cristian Stellini has been here before: a press conference now and then when Antonio Conte was unavailable; sometimes preparing to lead Tottenham into a game. But not like this. Not as the man in charge for a significant period – 10 Premier League matches to be precise, when the Champions League qualification push will be decided. Not as the face of the club, the de facto spokesman for anything and everything. And right now, it is everything. “A bit chaotic, absolutely,” Stellini said when asked to sum it up.</p><p>Stellini wants to focus on the football, starting at Everton on Monday night, having been shuffled into the manager’s job until the end of the season after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/26/antonio-conte-departs-tottenham-after-breakdown-in-relations-with-club">Conte’s departure on Sunday by mutual consent</a>.

There is much to agree with in his analysis, but I’d disagree with his statement that our efforts today “should focus on reducing inequalities, not on growing the economy”. Lower inequality is an important goal, but GDP growth will also be necessary to ensure that everyone worldwide has a decent standard of living.</p><p>I’d strongly agree with him that there is much <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Better-Development-Succeeding-Improve/dp/046503103X">more to life than economic growth</a> and that the World Bank’s international poverty line of $2.15 (£1.80) a day is an utterly inadequate consumption level for a high quality of life. But, whether the poverty line is set at $2.15 or $10 or higher, economic growth is going to be necessary to ensure no one lives below it – and the higher the poverty line, the more growth will be required. There isn’t a single low-income country that <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;series=SI.POV.DDAY&amp;country=">reports</a> $2.15 poverty below 13%, for example. Outside Ukraine, the lowest poverty rate at $6.85 a day in low- and lower-middle-income countries as a group is 16%. Historically, the only places we’ve seen the most extreme poverty reduced to fractions of a percentage point is in richer countries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/31/economic-growth-is-needed-to-reduce-global-poverty">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former president faces far more serious allegations than paying hush money to an adult film star. This is only the beginning</p><p>Donald Trump has built his career on brazenness. A man without shame, he has hurtled on apparently unstoppably, through serial scandals, two impeachments, electoral rejection and an armed insurrection by his supporters. Now he is setting another grim precedent, as the first former US president in history to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/30/donald-trump-indicted-stormy-daniels-hush-money" title="">charged with a criminal offence</a>. Half a century after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/30/trump-investigations-history/" title="">the first investigation</a> into his business dealings, a New York grand jury has voted to indict him. But even if he cannot bluster or bully his way out, he will keep fighting the law, and the law may not win.</p><p>That the case relates to paying hush money to the adult film actor Stormy Daniels is at once apt and disconcerting. Apt, in that its tawdriness and banality encapsulate the man. Disconcerting, in that it appears almost inconsequential beside the damage he has wrought upon the nation. He still faces multiple other civil and criminal cases: on the latter score alone, he is being investigated in relation to potential mishandling of classified documents; attempts to overturn his loss in Georgia in the 2020 election; and obstructing the transfer of power, as part of the justice department’s probe of the January 6 insurrection. Many would rather have seen charges brought against him on one of these grounds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/31/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-indictment-hell-fight-the-law-who-will-win">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer have both pledged to crack down on antisocial behaviour. But policing social problems won’t make them go away</p><p>Politicians have been calling for a return to neighbourhood policing ever since Theresa May decimated the service. This week, Rishi Sunak put forward plans for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-65086726" title="">“hotspot” patrols</a> as part of a draconian crackdown on fly-tipping and laughing gas (nitrous oxide).

<p>No oven required for this classic lemon tart</p><p>What I really like about this lemon meringue pie is that it doesn’t involve making a pastry base. Instead, it uses the biscuit crust of a cheesecake to form something quick, easy, crumbly, slightly salty and fun to house the zingy curd and soothing meringue.

## ‘Not just another game’: revenge in air as Rob Edwards’ Luton face Watford

<p>Manager was sacked by Watford after 10 Championship games but has his latest charges pushing for promotion before derby</p><p>Rob Edwards did not have long to dwell on the disappointment of falling victim to Watford’s infamous impatience earlier this season. His reputation as one of the brightest young managers in English football had survived his experience of working for the Pozzo family. After all Edwards had been in charge for only 10 league games before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/sep/26/watford-sack-rob-edwards-as-manager-and-appoint-slaven-bilic-to-replace-him">being fired</a> and, given how abruptly things had ended at Vicarage Road, there was no reason for him to worry about inflaming local tensions when he received an offer from Watford’s fiercest rivals.</p><p>It was the right fit for Edwards. Luton Town had a vacancy after losing Nathan Jones to Southampton last November and were quick to capitalise on Watford’s folly. Everyone had seen the former Wales international’s potential when he led Forest Green Rovers to the League Two title last season. It was why Watford, bruised after relegation from the Premier League, went for him. They were crying out for fresh ideas after Roy Hodgson’s pointless tenure and, when Scott Duxbury, Watford’s chief executive, insisted that Edwards would be backed “come hell or high water”, it seemed that a club who have been known to burn through three managers in a single campaign were about to usher in an era of stability.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/31/rob-edwards-luton-watford-championship">Continue reading...</a>

The UK has <a href="https://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/14102/1/PB052015_Onaran_etal.pdf">experienced</a> one of the sharpest falls in Europe, from a high of 49.9% in 1981 to a record low of the low 20s today. But while this captures the British picture, it’s not the whole story – look more closely at the constituent parts of the UK and you’ll see that in Wales, we’re doing things differently.</p><p>It’s well known that Wales has strong bonds with the trade union movement, with historically high union membership dating back to the times of heavy industry. Such bonds emerged from the heavily unionised mining industry that produced Welsh political heavyweights such as Aneurin Bevan. To this day, unions remain players in the political landscape to a far greater extent than in much of the rest of the UK, and are crucial to Welsh national and civic identity.</p><p>Auriol Miller is director of the Institute for Welsh Affairs, an independent thinktank.

## ‘The all-consuming orgasm’: how erotic thriller Obsession takes sex to the next level

<p>This tale of lust between a woman and her boyfriend’s dad is bringing BDSM to mainstream TV. Its stars Richard Armitage and Charlie Murphy discuss leather, ribbons and the truth about intimacy on screen</p><p>From everyone who has made the Netflix series Obsession – the writer, Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, the leads, Richard Armitage and Charlie “Happy Valley” Murphy – I want to know the following: when did they read the book on which it is based, Damage, by Josephine Hart; have they seen the film, starring Juliette Binoche and Jeremy Irons; and did they spend the whole early 90s talking about it? Lloyd Malcolm loves the book and has never seen the film. Neither appeared on Armitage’s radar at the time. And Murphy, well, she was only three when it was published in 1991.</p><p>Damage was the 50 Shades of its day – propulsive, original and extremely widely read. It had a similar lightning-rod impact to 50 Shades, as a breezy, middlebrow way in to quite a big conversation about sex. The plot centres on a respected surgeon – a rounded, well-liked man, yada yada – who meets his son’s girlfriend and immediately starts having an affair with her, with appalling consequences. It was distinctly of its time: a world still suffused with HIV anxiety, trying to build back taboos around sexual transgression that previous decades had destroyed with their permissiveness, by creating situations so unforgivable, and imagining punishments so radically disproportionate, that somehow Old Testament values might be restored.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/31/obsession-netflix-richard-armitage-charlie-murphy-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Home, Manchester<br /></strong>Writer-director Yusra Warsama relocates The House of Bernarda Alba from Andalucía to Manchester</p><p>What imprisons the characters of Federico García Lorca’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/08/the-house-of-bernarda-alba-review-kathryn-hunter-royal-exchange-manchester">The House of Bernarda Alba</a> is the stultifying Spanish heat and an equally unrelenting brand of Catholicism. What confines the sisters in Yusra Warsama’s new play, a free adaptation of the Lorca, is the fear of urban violence and the expectations of Islam.</p><p>The switch from Andalucía to Moss Side might sound like a stretch, but in Warsama’s hands as writer and director, it makes a lot of sense. Her all-female household lives somewhere near Manchester’s Great Western Street, next door to their dress shop and within earshot of every passing man and his every misogynistic remark. Their front room, with the plastic still on the sofa and one armchair significantly empty, feels like a refuge from danger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/31/of-all-the-beautiful-things-in-the-world-review-home-manchester">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 25-year-old says swapping Bath for Montpellier has helped him develop as a player and a person and he hopes to get back in the England frame when he becomes eligible in July</p><p>As far as Zach Mercer is concerned there is not even an argument. “A lot better,” he says, when asked to compare himself with the person and player who left Bath for Montpellier two years ago. “I feel like I’ve developed massively by playing in France. I wanted to be comfortable with being uncomfortable and I did that. I’ve had to mature and grow up.”</p><p>In many ways his cheerful demeanour as he drives home from training tells the story without him even needing to spell it out.

Yet Allen-Paisant makes the historical impasse an occasion for deep, generous interrogation of masculinity, and a linked elevation of the maternal that is at the heart of so many Caribbean and other families: “I’ve been leaning in- / to my mother tongue.” This book’s mother tongue belongs to “Mama”, a grandmother who raised the narrator. “Daddy”, meanwhile, remains a longed-for absence, “Un-Dad”. In this context of father-hunger, the “African soldier” who became the Moor of Venice at least stands for presence. Enriched by historical research, Self-Portrait As Othello celebrates representation, understanding and speech as acts of glorious resistance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/31/the-best-recent-poetry-review-roundup">Continue reading...</a>

## Toba, SW1: ‘The bliss is in the devilishly good detail’ – restaurant review

<p>This isn’t the Trump indictment we wanted, but it might be the one we deserve</p><p>Stormy Daniels didn’t seem to know what she had. In 2011, when The Apprentice was still getting decent ratings and Trump had drawn attention to himself for racist claims about the birthplace of Barack Obama, Daniels – also known as Stephanie Clifford – started asking around to see who she could sell her story to. Daniels, for years a successful porn performer, had met Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006. According to her, he invited her to his hotel room, offered her work on his TV show and then had sex with her. The two remained friendly afterwards; Trump invited Daniels to the launch of his Trump Vodka brand the following year. It’s the kind of thing you suspect that these two people would have written off as a funny story. Instead, it’s the impetus for one of the most politically volatile prosecutions in the nation’s history: the first criminal indictment of a former president, which was issued on Thursday by a federal grand jury in New York.</p><p>Stormy Daniels and the illegal, fraudulent machinations that the Trump campaign allegedly undertook to pay her off during the height of the presidential campaign in 2016 have always struck me as the most quintessential of Trump’s many scandals. Trump denies Daniels’ allegations, but in retrospect, with the hindsight of what we’ve come to learn of him, the scene she recounts is almost unbearably true to his character: the gathering of low-rent celebrities, the paltry quid pro quo offer, the golf and the sad, adolescent fantasy of sex with a porn star. The whole story drips with Trump’s defining attribute: the desperate and insatiable need to have his ego gratified. Which is why to me, at least, it seems obvious that Daniels is telling the truth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/31/hush-money-porn-star-trump-indicted">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The rise and rise of online fashion stores – and their generous returns policies – has created a new industry dedicated to dealing with our unwanted clothes. But what damage is being done – to our planet and to retailers – by our boomerang shopping habits? </p><p>In the past, the post office has been an embarrassing place for Megan Hitt. The 25-year-old nurse from south Wales recalls a time, a few years ago, when she had to approach the counter with six different Asos parcels in her arms, her “shopping addiction exposed for everyone to see”. Since university, Hitt has been a prolific online shopper – buying several outfits at a time, picking one to keep and returning the rest. This time, when she handed over her parcels to be scanned, she was ashamed that there were so many. Still, she knew she would be back soon – she already had another Asos order on the way.</p><p>Buying and returning clothes online is part of the fabric of modern life. For years, Hitt didn’t think much about it: “I used to buy and return like it didn’t matter.” At her worst, she’d order three parcels a week; sometimes, if she knew she’d wear something only once, on a night out, she’d keep the tags on and send it back. “It was something we all used to do,” Hitt says of her university days. “In a house of six girls, four did it all the time.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/31/what-happens-when-we-send-back-unwanted-clothes">Continue reading...</a>

This theatrical event itself looks like a terrifically enjoyable variety gang show: with naughty gags, brassy musical numbers, Hollywood homages and pop songs.

And one of the best ways to filter that water is oysters. Indeed, the European native oyster was so plentiful in Scotland that 30 million a year were harvested from oyster beds outside Edinburgh in the 1800s.</p><p>But today the species is almost extinct: populations <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283345">have dropped by 85%</a> over the past century, most likely because of overfishing from bottom trawling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/31/oysters-and-whisky-why-the-pairing-could-have-huge-benefits-for-wildlife-in-scotland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Precipitation has made the western US very cold and wet, with one ski lodge declaring this the snowiest season on record</p><p>Throughout the past several months there has been a recurring theme in weather news about how wet and unsettled western parts of the US have been, particularly for the normally sunny state of California. This has been due to frequent atmospheric rivers funnelling into western North America, and a recent analysis undertaken by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography found that over the course of this water year (1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023), a total of 31 atmospheric river events have affected the west coast of the USA so far.</p><p>This constant barrage of precipitation to the western US has meant that March in particular has seen precipitation anomalies far above normal, with widely at least two to three times more than usual. In addition, it has been exceptionally cold, with average temperatures for March widely at least 2-3C below normal, but with many places also having seen temperatures more than 5C below normal. Because of this, mountainous regions have seen precipitation falling mostly as snow throughout the month, this very heavy and frequent and has brought snow accumulations enough to bury an entire ski lodge in Rimforest, California. Mammoth Mountain ski resort has declared this the snowiest season on record with snow totals reaching 17.6m at their main lodge and a staggering 22.1m at the summit of the mountain peak. Cold and wet conditions are still expected to linger at least through the next week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/31/weather-tracker-cold-california-wet-snowiest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The city’s image of protest and rebellion obscures its links to slavery. But there is a push to acknowledge the Black radicalism in its past</p><p>On a sunny June evening last year, members of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society filed slowly into the Friends’ Meeting House, just off St Peter’s Square. When the neat white building tucked behind Manchester Central Library was built in the 1820s, it became the base for the Quakers who led the abolitionist movement in the city. Now, in the same hall almost 200 years later, the second oldest learned society in the world gathered to examine its own links to transatlantic slavery.</p><p>Images of mills flashed up on a projector screen as the academic Alan Rice described how cotton powered Manchester’s transformation into a booming industrial metropolis. “If you’re in the business of cotton in the 18th and 19th century, you’re connected very deeply to the slavery business,” Rice, who runs the Institute for Black Atlantic Research at the University of Central Lancashire, told the audience. His next slide featured portraits of three of Manchester’s most prominent 19th-century industrialists: Samuel Greg, George Hibbert and Sir George Philips. Greg and Hibbert campaigned to preserve slavery and all three “owned” enslaved people (Philips, whose contemporaries dubbed him “King Cotton”, was among the first funders of the Guardian). They were also members of the Lit and Phil – like many prominent Manchester men of this era, who gathered at the society for lectures on science and the arts. A number of the city’s leading abolitionists, such as the physician John Ferriar and the clockmaker Peter Clare, were also members.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/31/a-tale-of-two-cities-the-struggle-for-a-black-history-of-manchester">Continue reading...</a>

But the intricacy and audacity of the California-based artist’s third album reclaim the term for digital gear freaks and tinkering hermits: meticulous and introspective, but with a maximalist sweep that reflects the workings of a chaotic mind.</p><p>Gately’s avant-pop style, on her scatty 2016 debut and 2020’s punishing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/14/katie-gately-loom-review">Loom</a>, loosely presaged the rise of manic, internet-bred hyper pop. Her songwriting instincts on Fawn/Brute transcend that genre’s conceptual and melodic perversion, instead producing electro mini operas that whip up a maelstrom of dislocated voices, honking saxophone and roughshod, junkyard-style percussion. She wrote the album during a stressful but hyperactive pregnancy and the songs plot a trajectory from her daughter’s imagined childhood – sing-songy, frantic, bewildering – into the pandemonium of adolescence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/31/katie-gately-fawnbrute-review-beguilingly-disordered-pop">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s not just about payment. It is about engaging in good faith with the descendants of enslaved people and addressing inequalities – to make a better future possible</p><p><br /></p><p>All over North America and Europe, universities, businesses and other organisations are investigating their historical connections to slavery. Some of these institutions once owned plantations or enslaved people. Others were established or maintained through donations from enslavers or their descendants. When an institution uncovers such histories, a question arises: what should the institution do to address the wrongs of the past, wrongs with consequences that continue to be felt today?</p><p>Groups that advocate for reparations almost never seek only money … The social, the political and the economic are bound together and must be addressed together, creating the possibility of a better world.</p><p>After the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, British plantation owners were granted huge compensation for having their ‘property’ – enslaved people – taken from them.</p><p>Making clear the connections between the past and the low numbers of employees from minority ethnic backgrounds is central to the work of reparations. Without them, we can never have a full understanding of the consequences of slavery.</p><p><strong>$100m<br /></strong>Amount pledged by Harvard University to carry out recommendations from its 2022 report into its links to slavery</p><p>Other countries, led by Britain, refused to issue a formal apology, fearing that to do so could result in a legal obligation to pay reparations. Regret was deemed a safer response.</p><p>Those who have suffered most from the brutality of slavery and colonialism should determine the restorative justice agenda.</p><p>A post-reparations society could encourage us to rethink the notion of happiness, one that is not based on instant and individual gratification but on collective achievement.

<p>Business and trade secretary says claims deal will deliver limited economic boost are based on old data</p><p>Good morning. The globalist, economic case for Brexit (there were other arguments too, but this is the one that swayed Rishi Sunak) was based on the idea that the importance of the EU in global trade was declining over time and that the UK would benefit by hitching its wagon to other economies, particularly in the developing world. For a long time the free-trade Brexiters were investing all their hopes in a deal with the US. That is now off the table, but perhaps the next biggest prize in their eyes was joining the Asia-Pacific CPTPP trade bloc, and this morning that has landed.</p><p><strong>Kemi Badenoch,</strong> the business and trade secretary, tweeted about it in the early hours of the morning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/mar/31/rishi-sunak-kemi-badenoch-trade-deal-conservatives-tory-labour-keir-starmer-latest-politics-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston lift a lazy follow-up to their action-heavy Netflix comedy with genuine movie star charm</p><p>The curious wrestle between pratfalls and pathos that’s made Adam Sandler’s career so increasingly fascinating has erred toward a win for the latter with age. The aggressive forgettability of his early Netflix deal output slowly faded into something more worthwhile with last year’s surprisingly textured basketball drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/05/hustle-review-adam-sandler-scores-in-rags-to-riches-tale">Hustle</a> and simultaneously, we’ve seen the Safdies squeeze out his best work in Uncut Gems (the trio will collaborate again with a new film set in the world of sports memorabilia) and later this year he’ll star alongside Carey Mulligan in the offbeat sci-fi drama Spaceman. While a total ban on fart jokes is unlikely (he’s also set to star in a new Netflix comedy from the director of The Wrong Missy), his 10 for them, one for me ethos is definitely shifting.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/14/murder-mystery-review-netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston">Murder Mystery</a>, his most watched Netflix film to date was one that didn’t exactly straddle these two halves but made for a more acceptable use of his sillier side, thanks greatly to the appearance of Jennifer Aniston. It was a breezy action comedy about a wannabe detective couple trying to solve a murder while on vacation, a low-stakes Friday night watch with medium rewards. The same could be said about the totally adequate follow-up out this week, so similar in every way that it feels as if we’ve just clicked “play next episode”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/31/murder-mystery-2-review-netflix-sequel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former Labour leader’s appeal was his personality, but with the country on the rocks voters may overlook Starmer’s lack of charisma</p><p>Tony Blair’s triumphant time as opposition leader was more than 25 years and several political eras ago. But it still casts a huge shadow over our politics. Tories fear a repeat of the 1997 election. Pollsters try to work out whether such a rare and pivotal event could soon happen again. Centre-left voters of a certain age remember the mid-90s as a time of steadily growing hope and then pure elation, before Labour politics gradually went back to its usual divisions and disappointments.</p><p>But perhaps the people most fixated by Blair are Keir Starmer and his inner circle. In his use of former Blair speechwriters such as Philip Collins and Peter Hyman; of old Blair lines such as “Labour is on your side”; former New Labour ministers as advisers, including Blair himself; New Labour-style focus groups and charm offensives towards business; revived Blairite policies such as the asbo; and former New Labour strategists, spin doctors, party bureaucrats, fundraisers and donors. In all these ways, Starmer’s leadership often feels like a tribute to a form of politics many voters under 40 won’t even remember.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/31/labour-keir-starmer-tony-blair-playbook">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While some of this documentary following the making of the Scottish songwriter’s second album falls into cliched soul-baring territory, Capaldi’s wit and talent shine through</p><p>‘A global pandemic is only in the top three weird things that have happened to me in the last three years,” Lewis Capaldi notes at the start of this generically made but nonetheless startling Netflix documentary about his rise. After years strumming in Scottish pubs and clubs, his raw piano ballad Bruises went viral and lift-off was vertical: his debut album became the biggest seller in the UK in both 2019 and 2020, and its single Someone You Loved, a seven-week chart topper in the UK, made him the first Scottish solo artist to reach US No 1 since Sheena Easton in 1981. An endearing goofball on social media, Capaldi won even more fans by puncturing influencer culture with his blithely unglamorous image, but his japes disguised a man suffering from terrible anxiety, panic attacks and a shoulder twitch that would later be diagnosed as a Tourette’s symptom.</p><p>These highs and lows are documented by Joe Pearlman, using the same televised-therapy approach he used to great effect for his film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/09/bros-after-the-screaming-stops-review">Bros: After the Screaming Stops</a>. He follows Capaldi, now massively famous, to a studio in his Whitburn family home where he starts work on his second album. There’s a flash of typical Capaldi wit as he’s recognised by a woman sat in an optician’s far across the street: “You’re cured!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/31/lewis-capaldi-how-im-feeling-now-review-self-aware-star-struggling-with-weight-of-expectation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rooted in house, jungle and working-class London, the monstrous basslines and warped samples of speed garage spread into both pop and the underground. Its creators remember the chaos – and a stoned Wesley Snipes</p><p>In the early 90s, Omar Adimora had a curious Saturday night routine. A teetotal aspirant dance producer and devoted fan of US house music whose day job was in computing, he would cycle from his home in Islington to Ministry of Sound. “I would go in my cycling shorts,” he laughs, “and stand on a speaker for nine hours, watching <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/01/dave-morales-favourite-tracks">David Morales</a> do a marathon set, thinking: ‘I want some of this.’”</p><p>One week, someone mentioned an afterparty on the Old Kent Road that started when London’s most celebrated superclub kicked people out at 9am. “It was a pub, the Frog and Nightgown, but they had blacked out all the windows so it was eternal night. It was full of characters, people with all sorts of elaborate and exotic clothing, just ready to party. The music was US house – Masters at Work, MK, Smack, Roger Sanchez – but the DJs would pitch it up, so if people had been dancing to 125bpm most of the night, these guys were playing it at 130, 132. That became my addiction, it started to take over the thrill of Ministry of Sound. You’d get to Ministry later and later, so you’d have enough energy to last at the Frog and Nightgown.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/31/we-did-top-of-the-pops-with-a-track-made-in-our-kitchen-how-speed-garage-revved-up-club-culture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The oral storyteller’s autofictional account of inner and outer journeys blends memory, myth and nature</p><p>It may be easier to say what Bardskull is not. It’s not a memoir. It’s not poetry. It’s not a compendium of myths and ancient wisdom. It is, rather, all of these things, plus some faux-naive drawings, loosely structured around an autofictional account of several journeys that oral storyteller Martin Shaw seems to have undertaken on Dartmoor over the course of 101 days, a kind of wilderness journey. Or in Shaw-speak: “I walked out one summer morning and barely ceased till St George’s Day of the next year … These are words from the rough, from the stomp. Things hurtled through me, old things. I am not the same.”</p><p>There is certainly a tremendous urgency to the account. “I know we are moving fast here,” writes Shaw. “But this mad jumble is where I live. I abide in a place where a Greek hero will resemble my mother at the same moment magical sows from Welsh myth glower through the rain.” We get occasional glimpses of real, live other people – “Tony of Scorriton says you can’t trust cider without some cow shit in it, scudding around at the bottom of the glass” – but essentially this is a deep descent into Shaw’s inner self, into the murk of memory and ideas and reflections, mixed and blended into a kind of thick mystical soup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/31/bardskull-by-martin-shaw-review-a-mystical-voyage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A slew of new movies celebrate the boardroom mavericks of the 1980s and 90s – as well as the products they flogged. What’s behind this corporate nostalgia?</p><p>Steam trains, tuberculosis, sexual repression, the shadow of a coming war and Colin Firth: the stuff of a period piece was once unchanging. But history is not what it was. Now conjuring the past on screen means 8-bit graphics and Money for Nothing. And Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig will do a synchronised bop before the vintage logos of Pringles and Pepsi.</p><p>That last detail comes from the credits of White Noise, Noah Baumbach’s recent adaptation of the 1985 Don DeLillo novel. The book was, among other things, a droll study of the godly place of brands in the US during the 80s. But two giggly new movies now spotlight the same moment with hindsight. In Air, Ben Affleck directs himself and Matt Damon in the 1984 origin story of the Nike Air Jordan. With Tetris, the scene is four years later: Taron Egerton, star of the rum tale behind the video game, plays the video game designer Henk Rogers, drawing together a collapsing Soviet Union, feral press magnate Robert Maxwell and the marketing department of Nintendo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/31/in-business-how-brands-like-nike-blackberry-and-pop-tarts-became-films-hottest-stars">Continue reading...</a>

My specific target is the Lower Buck, because it’s the “real pub” – focusing on ales and socialising – where the other two have gone for food. That said, on this circular riverside amble along a historic county border you could, with a few short detours, easily have a pint in a different boozer for every mile traversed. Is that because Yorkshire and Lancashire are full of heavy drinkers, or because where there are rivers and bridges there are also inns?</p><p>We began at Chatburn – we being me and fellow walker, writer and historian Nick Burton. Nick has been a handy guide and friend since I moved to the Ribble Valley a couple of years ago and I knew he’d tramped the Ribble’s paths before. Chatburn is near where I live and since I’m still finding my feet, it made sense to start near home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/mar/31/walk-river-ribble-to-great-pub-the-lower-buck-lancashire">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The empire was built with the labour of my enslaved ancestors. Money can only ever begin to make amends for that</p><p>In countries touched by European colonialism, the subjects of enslavement and reparations suddenly seem to be on the agenda.

At last, these conversations are being had.</p><p>Reactions around the world to these declarations have been varied. Any outrage that there might have been about the Dutch announcement was smoothed over by the royal family’s visit to their Caribbean islands. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-11700045/Dancing-Queen-Maxima-Netherlands-wows-Aruba-crowds-moves.html">Queen Maxima dancing</a> with locals was a celebrity show as effective in demonstrating an enlightened, non-racist attitude to their colonial family as <a href="https://www.reggaeville.com/artist-details/rita-marley/videos/video/prince-harry-dances-in-jamaica-with-rita-marley/">Prince Harry’s two-step years ago</a> with Rita Marley’s dancers in Trenchtown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/commentisfree/2023/mar/31/king-charles-crown-jewels-slavery-jamaica-debt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brookline, Massachusetts, is barring those born after 2000 from buying the products.

As she got a little older, she would steal cigarettes from her brother and, by 15, she was buying her own packs – a proud Marlboro smoker.</p><p>“I smoked for 30 years,” she tells me. “I smoked when I was pregnant.” She was desperate to quit, or at least cut down the number of cigarettes, but nothing worked. “The guiltier I felt, the more I smoked,” she continues. “I would just hide my belly so that people couldn’t see.” Her younger son was born premature at only 5lb. “I cried because he was so tiny.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/31/cigarettes-tobacco-smoking-sales-ban">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The tranquilizer is increasingly mixed with the opioid in the US, giving rise to deadly overdoses and disturbing wounds</p><p>Fentanyl – the deadliest drug in the country – is getting even more dangerous. Across the United States, the opioid is increasingly being mixed with xylazine, a powerful tranquilizer that’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in animals such as horses. But on the streets it’s known as “tranq” or “tranq dope”, and it’s been linked to horrific side effects and a growing number of deadly overdoses across the country.</p><p>The substance was first found mixed with heroin in Puerto Rico as early as two decades ago. Today the national epicenter of the crisis is Philadelphia, where xylazine appeared in the drug supply as early as 2006, and was found in over 90% of the city’s lab-tested dope samples in 2021.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/30/xylazine-drug-overdoses-fentanyl">Continue reading...</a>

The truth is that sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn’t. You’d have to be a starry-eyed Euro-optimist, for example, to claim that European unity was really advanced by the 2015-16 refugee crisis.

## Philip Larkin: ‘writing in the language of ordinary people’ – archive, 31 March 1973

<p><strong>31 March 1973</strong>: Larkin talks about his approach to life and poetry as well as his efforts in editing the Oxford Book of Twentieth Century Verse</p><p>The University of Hull is literally redbrick: squat, square blocks unrelieved by black painted window frames and meticulous green swards of grass you could not possibly set foot on. The impression is of some council estate of learning. Dr Philip Larkin’s study is severely comfortable – polished wood, high ceiling, carpet, abstract still life, grotesque photograph of an ape. A desk, fit for six company directors, is set out with studied carelessness for the business of the day. White padded armchairs are set to one side for conversations which do not require the librarian to defend his status behind a dozen feet of pine. Tea is Lapsang Souchong and weak. The ambience is of impeccable gentility which constrains you to whisper although Dr Larkin, being a mite deaf, insists that you converse as though he were 20 feet away.</p><p>Once there was a host of golden daffs, now there are cycle clips and holy ends. Dr (honorary, Belfast) Larkin’s poem Church Going is among the most anthologised modern English verse, second only to The Whitsun Weddings, and he wrote that too. The poet supposes his second volume of poems, The Less Deceived, must have sold around 10,000 copies – and this is the man who pens three poems each year and takes nine years to fill a Faber volume. He has only read his poems publicly once and that was at a party when he might not have been quite sober. He gives an overwhelming impression of not much caring for the business at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/31/philip-larkin-interview-writing-in-language-of-ordinary-people-1973">Continue reading...</a>
