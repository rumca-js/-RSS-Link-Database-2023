I'm back from AdeptiCon 2023 and I've brought my booty! Check out the stuff I'll be using and building and painting and whatnot.

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Space Station Zero at http://www.spacestationzerogame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
