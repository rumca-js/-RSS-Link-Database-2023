In 2011, when The Apprentice was still getting decent ratings and Trump had drawn attention to himself for racist claims about the birthplace of Barack Obama, Daniels \u2013 also known as Stephanie Clifford \u2013 started asking around to see who she could sell her story to. Daniels, for years a successful porn performer, had met Donald Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006.

All over the world, teenage girls and young women start developing the power to create electricity within themselves. Sparks fly from their fingertips and suddenly a new world of possibilities opens up. Their power shifts the balance of society. Now women can defend themselves. Now they can fight on equal physical terms with men.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/31/the-power-review-toni-collette-naomi-alderman\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/31/the-power-review-toni-collette-naomi-alderman", "date_published": "2023-03-31 05:00:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war live: Turkey approves Finland Nato bid; Ukraine marks Bucha massacre anniversary", "description": "<p>Turkey, the last hold-out on Finland\u2019s Nato bid, has approved its membership; Volodymyr Zelenskiy says past year has been \u2018most horrific in their entire lives\u2019 for residents of Kyiv region</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance\">Russia-Ukraine war at a glance</a></strong></li></ul><p>Bucha, a leafy suburb of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, became synonymous with Russian brutality after a military retreat last March revealed ravaged streets littered with civilian bodies.

The impression is of some council estate of learning. Dr Philip Larkin\u2019s study is severely comfortable \u2013 polished wood, high ceiling, carpet, abstract still life, grotesque photograph of an ape. A desk, fit for six company directors, is set out with studied carelessness for the business of the day. White padded armchairs are set to one side for conversations which do not require the librarian to defend his status behind a dozen feet of pine. Tea is Lapsang Souchong and weak. The ambience is of impeccable gentility which constrains you to whisper although Dr Larkin, being a mite deaf, insists that you converse as though he were 20 feet away.</p><p>Once there was a host of golden daffs, now there are cycle clips and holy ends. Dr (honorary, Belfast) Larkin\u2019s poem Church Going is among the most anthologised modern English verse, second only to The Whitsun Weddings, and he wrote that too. The poet supposes his second volume of poems, The Less Deceived, must have sold around 10,000 copies \u2013 and this is the man who pens three poems each year and takes nine years to fill a Faber volume. He has only read his poems publicly once and that was at a party when he might not have been quite sober. He gives an overwhelming impression of not much caring for the business at all.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/31/philip-larkin-interview-writing-in-language-of-ordinary-people-1973\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/31/philip-larkin-interview-writing-in-language-of-ordinary-people-1973", "date_published": "2023-03-31 04:30:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018He is a bad-ass\u2019: Fox News makes amends with Trump as he faces indictment", "description": "<p>The relationship between the former president and the network had cooled but Fox offered a full-throated defence of Trump on Thursday night</p><p>A breaking news graphic rushes across the screen, as flashing amber lights illuminate the word \u201cFox News alert\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWe have just gotten word that former president Donald Trump has been indicted,\u201d the host begins, while a stunned gasp is audible from off-camera.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/31/donald-trump-indicted-reaction-how-fox-news-reported-indictment\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/31/donald-trump-indicted-reaction-how-fox-news-reported-indictment", "date_published": "2023-03-31 04:01:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Trump loses, Paltrow wins: Twitter marks a historic afternoon for America", "description": "<p>Social media highlights remarkable timing of verdicts in unusual cases that gripped a nation</p><p>An ex-president indicted for alleged hush money payments to a porn star.
