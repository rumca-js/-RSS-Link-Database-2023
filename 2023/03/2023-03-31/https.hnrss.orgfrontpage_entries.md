<p>Hi HN!<p>I made a tool that autogenerates simple, high-level explanations of concepts and organizes them in a somewhat university course-like structure so that it's easier to see how things are structured. Currently it has about 20,000 concepts on a range of topics but that's just what I generated so far, it should work with more obscure topics in the future.<p>I love learning about random topics where I don't have a good background in like history or linguistics, but it's hard to figure out what topics there (you don't know what you don't know) are in certain fields and what they are even about, so this was a way to get the high level idea about random things that I wanted to know about.<p>It also only uses the information in the GPT model at the moment, so obviously information can't be trusted completely and you should definitely double check any information you read here by Googling. I'm thinking of doing the Bing Chat approach for the next version and adding references, but don't have that yet<p>Hopefully someone else finds this useful even if it's not perfect!</p>

## Linux vs. Mac

<p>Have any long term Linux users here switched to Mac?
What problems did you have, what do better than expected?<p>I am seriously considering switching. I have been using Linux for like 10+ years, but this month have been rough. I was using Mint in the start of the month, but an upgrade broke so many things - even "Shutdown" and "restart" was not possible.<p>I switched to Ubuntu 22.10, and now every 30 minutes I get a crash. I bought a new Microphone that kinda works, but not really.</p>

## Show HN: Cadseer. a parametric solid modeling CAD desktop application

<p>Cadseer is in the same genre as: solidworks, inventor, freecad etc... Cadseer is alpha software, so lots of missing features, bugs, crashes, file incompatibilities etc...<p>About me: I spent 15 years designing stamping dies on a high end cad system. During that time, I also developed and marketed extensions/plugins toward that cad system. Through that experience, I came disillusioned with 'vendor lock-in' and proprietary software in general. I basically retired, took the vow of poverty and moved all my computing to open source. I have since, and continue to, try and improve the open source cad environment.</p>

## Launch HN: Inri (YC W23) – Wealthfront for Investing in India

<p>Hello everyone, I’m Nishad, cofounder at Inri (<a href="https://www.goinri.com/">https://www.goinri.com/</a>), an investment platform for Indian expats to diversify capital in India, without any taxation or repatriation hassles. Super excited to be launching on HN, the platform that I personally nerd on and has helped me discover some of my favorite products early.<p>My cofounder Hemant (@hemantgangolia) has been living in the US since 6 years and has tried multiple times to invest in India. He couldn't go ahead with the process because bank account opening was a challenge and the process after that wasn't clear. There is complexity around taxation, moving money back and a general lack of clarity on where to invest.<p>Even though there are currently over 30 million Indian expats, there are no digital, full-service solutions offered for them specifically. US solutions focus only on US investments and Indian solutions focus only on Indian customers—this makes the India <p> US belt underserved. Indian banks with overseas branches offer these services, but investors don’t trust these banks because of conflict of interest. There are other small players in the market but they expect customers to do their own service, which is not what customers want, based on our learnings.<p>We found a lot of other Indian expats in the same situation as us - wanting to invest in India for financial and emotional reasons, but unable to do so easily or consistently. We wished a simple product existed to solve for this online. We couldn’t find one, so we built it.<p>Inri is like Wealthfront for your India investments. It is a web platform that offers curated mutual fund portfolios and solves for all tax compliance and repatriation needs online. We have curated the funds based on performance, history and compliance based on your resident country, and funds are selected based on your risk preference, similarly to Wealthfront. We facilitate investments through central platforms like National Stock Exchange and show the holdings via a dashboard on the platform once the investments are done.<p>Just log in to the platform, upload your documents, approve the emails with details confirmation and you’re sorted. Currently, only people with a PAN card (Indian financial identity document) can invest.<p>Our early customers are all people who have tried doing this before, but gave up because of all the hassle. The fact that they could get invested in just 2 days vs weeks for traditional alternatives was unheard of to them.<p>We know this is a bit of a niche product for HN but we also know that there are quite a few Indian expats like us here, who could make use of it—and we hope it makes interesting enough reading for everybody else. We would love to get your feedback! Thank you!</p>

## Show HN: Multi-Display Screen Sharing with CoScreen by Datadog
 - [https://blog.coscreen.co/blog/coscreen-v5-0-a-new-way-to-share-your-screen/](https://blog.coscreen.co/blog/coscreen-v5-0-a-new-way-to-share-your-screen/)

<p>Good to be back on HN with all-new CoScreen, a little more than 3 years after it launched over here!<p>With CoScreen 5.0, you can now share your windows from multiple displays at the same time, a long standing request by our most avid users and impossible in other apps. It also has a lightning-fast, Rust-based window compositing, scaling, and streaming engine now.<p>CoScreen was always meant to be different so that you and your team can share your screens simultaneously and multi-directionally, and to be able to control what is being shared. We saw it as a natural extension and closely coupled with your OS — instant, fast, and seamless. A better way to pair program, debug tough incidents, or jam on great ideas by sharing multi-modal information like code, commands, graphs, or logs.<p>All that made a lot of sense conceptually but to be frank, it was hard to get it right. Now a part of Datadog and with major parts of our app rewritten in Rust, we feel we’re closer than ever.<p>Here’s what pair programmers liked about CoScreen, so we made it even better:
- High definition code sharing: Windows are video-streamed in real-time at their native resolution whenever possible. You never have to search for your IDE anymore or be anxious to share the wrong window. 
- Multi-directional collaboration: You can share, while Alice shares, while Bob shares. Side-by-side, across multiple displays. With built-in crisp audio and video chat.
- 60FPS+ super smooth mouse pointers. Type, click, and draw on any shared window as if it was your own.<p>What some of you did NOT like, so we fixed it in CoScreen V5:
- CPU utilization and latency have been reduced drastically as various parts of our desktop client are now implemented in Rust, building on crates such as cxx, rust-skia, iced, as well as Neon for our native remote control plugins.
- No more accidental clicking into remote windows through the new remote window toggles.
- You’re no longer bound by your displays, can share windows from multiple of them at the same time and even move them across displays while sharing without stopping.
- You’ll also soon be able to join meetings from your browser from any platform.<p>CoScreen runs on macOS (x64 and Apple Silicon), Windows, soon also on the web and is currently free. We’re planning to charge for larger teams and enterprise features in the future. Hopefully - finally - we’ll also have a Linux version one day. Tell us if you need it urgently and if you have any other requirements!</p>

## Finley (YC W21) is hiring for credit and fintech experts across all teams

<p>Imagine running a retail business without knowing how much you're paying your wholesaler for goods. Or running a restaurant without looking at the price of your ingredients. Or constructing homes without looking at the price of raw materials... you get the idea.<p>That lack of transparency would be frightening, but hey, things could still work out, right?<p>Well, let's up the difficulty.<p>Imagine that, on top of not knowing exactly how much you were paying for your <i>inputs</i>, you also didn't know if you would have consistent and continued <i>access</i> to your wholesaler, your food supplier, or your building materials. That would almost certainly induce high blood pressure, stomach ulcers, and mild insomnia.<p>In the world of private credit (this is basically business credit for the majority of companies), it's not only normal but <i>expected</i> that getting and maintaining access to debt capital (one of the key inputs for running any business!) will be opaque, error-prone, and hard to operationalize. In other words, capital uncertainty is the dismal reality in middle-market finance.<p>Private credit is enormous (add up all the VC dollars spent last year and you'd still be short of the amount of private credit issued over the same period), unavoidable, and broken.<p>That means credit access--the fuel or primary <i>financial input</i> for most medium-sized businesses--is hard to price, access, report on, and predict.<p>And yet it doesn't have to be that way; the data and operational issues of private credit have been solved in other domains (e.g., CRMs for Sales, infrastructure tooling for devs, EMRs for hospitals). What's missing is a software layer for business finance.<p>Finley has built the system of record for private credit. We plug into all borrower source systems and automate reporting and analysis for private credit lenders. The result is full transparency into the <i>cost</i> and <i>availability</i> of capital, which gives businesses newfound financial predictability.<p>We're a team of builders, designers, finance experts, engineers, and systems thinkers from top companies in finance and technology, and we're backed by leading investors like Y Combinator, CRV, and Bain Capital Ventures.<p>We're two years into our journey, recently raised a $17 million Series A, and already managing over $3 billion in private credit.<p>It's still Day 1, though. The challenges we're taking on will reshape the economy over the next decades, and we'd love to partner with team members who share our passion for innovation and company-building.<p>To learn more, check out our Careers page here: <a href="https://www.finleycms.com/careers/">https://www.finleycms.com/careers/</a></p>

<p>Some never stop telling people to read philosophy books because they can obtain intelligence from there. But then they reject the idea that AI also learnt a lot philosophy text.<p>The majority of people holds the belief that reading and understanding words cannot make AI equip with knowledge and intellence. But that is exactly the way how we learn.<p>Why is this contradiction?</p>

## Ask HN: How to you monetize a tech blog?

<p>I've had quite a few tech blogs and some did quite well. I'm in a country (South Africa) where stripe isn't available so I can't monetize it using medium.<p>Any ideas besides doing a paid substack on how I can monetize a tech blog?<p>Just curious how other people do it.
Only thing I could think of was to do adds on the site for a store where I sell tech related tshirts.<p>Thanks :)</p>

<p>Hi HN!<p>Sharing Random Airport<p>Inspired by RandomStreetView (which I find weirdly addictive), and a passion for air travel.<p>Probably not for everyone, but I hope some of you find it interesting!<p>Needless to say, open to feedback!<p>Enjoy clicking!<p>Further reading:<p>TECH: It's Build in React, NodeJS, with a Notion DB. The code is public on Github. It is spaghetti though ... Especially open to feedback here.<p>DB: The db is publicly available (and editable), I can add the link in comments if anyone would like to have a look .<p>KNOWN ISSUES: I would like to improve the design, pic loading performance and quality of (some) pics.</p>
