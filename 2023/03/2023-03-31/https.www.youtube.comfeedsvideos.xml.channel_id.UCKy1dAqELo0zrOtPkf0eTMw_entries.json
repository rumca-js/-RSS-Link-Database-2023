Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious saga, stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \u201cLudacris\u201d Bridges, Jason Momoa, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Sung Kang, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior, Scott Eastwood, with Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, and Rita Moreno.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they\u2019ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who\u2019s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything\u2014and everyone\u2014that Dom loves, forever.\n\u00a0\nIn 2011\u2019s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn\u2019t know was that Reyes\u2019 son, Dante (Aquaman\u2019s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price.\n\u00a0\nDante\u2019s plot will scatter Dom\u2019s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante\u2019s vengeance.\n\nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M.

It seems like every element has received attention, whether its the improved scouting in Diamond Dynasty, updates to match the current MLB rulebook, or a vastly more helpful practice mode. This remains a gorgeous showcase for baseball, with some of the most lifelike sights and sounds to behold in a sports game. It remains to be seen if Sets and Seasons will frustrate in the long run, but the crowning achievement this year is the Negro Leagues mode. This playable piece of baseball history is a triumph, presented with care, grace, and attention to detail. It\u2019s courageous and bold, like the pioneers it highlights, and it\u2019s astonishing to experience something so affecting from a baseball game.
