Seventh Son is a 2014 wannabe fantasy blockbuster uniting elements from fantasy material like Lord of the Rings, The Witcher and Dungeons and Dragons. And it's one of the most nonsensical and confusing movies you'll see, thanks to which it become a box office flop and lost a bunch of money. The fantasy elements are handled in a way that feels like a fever dream -- things just happen with no logic. And since that new fantasy movie, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is coming out, let's see what exactly made Seventh Son fail in the same category.
