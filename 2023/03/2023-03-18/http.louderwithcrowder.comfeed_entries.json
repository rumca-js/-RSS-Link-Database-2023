Y'know, that thing we've been assured never happens ever in America and is just a right-wing nut-job conspiracy theory. Except they need a law to ban it. </p><p>Anywho, a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tennessee-rally-teens\" target=\"_blank\">detransitioned</a> woman named Prisha Mosley testified before the Texas Senate Health Committee about her transition as a minor. At the time, she had already been diagnosed with anorexia, borderline personality disorder, and trauma disorder. She said her therapist told her a sex change would cure her. (Note: if hearing this makes your blood boil - you're not alone.) </p><p>She was also sexually assaulted at 14 and thought she would be \"safe\" from future assaults if she was no longer a girl.<span></span></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">None</div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/libbyemmons/status/1636889139336421376\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>\"What I don\u2019t understand is why they never offered me counseling, to help me with the depression, the trauma, the personality disorder, or my ongoing self harm.\u201d</em></p><p>She started taking testosterone at 17, which caused her to lose hair on her head and grow it everywhere else on her body. It also made her shoulders broaden, causing her a great deal of pain. Her voice is permanently deeper, her hormones can no longer regulate themselves, and she has vaginal atrophy so severe she can no longer use a tampon. Oh, and she had a double mastectomy. </p><p>This growing trend of doctors prescribing radical gender transition surgeries for <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/journalist-transition-bulimia\" target=\"_blank\">mental health issues</a> should concern everyone, regardless of political affiliation. It should be considered medical malpractice and the doctors responsible should have their licenses taken away. It's also infuriating to hear the other side argue that kids can just \"try out\" hormones for a while. These side effects experienced by Mosley are <em>not</em> irreversible. You cannot undo years of testosterone on a prepubescent female body. You cannot undo a double mastectomy. </p><p>Hopefully, more states will join Texas in weighing complete bans on such procedures. It's the only way. </p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/prisha-mosley-texas", "date_published": "2023-03-18 14:02:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Breaking: Trump claims he'll be arrested next week, calls on supporters to protest", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33315952&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=49%2C0%2C151%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>Ladies and gents, we may just see a perp walk of Donald Trump.

Apparently, Bragg<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/18/trump-protest-arrest-tuesday-00087738\" target=\"_blank\"> is focusing </a>on whether Trump committed a crime by disguising a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels as a legal expense rather than as an expenditure to boost his presidential campaign. </p><p>The sheer volume of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trump-tax-returns-manhattan\" target=\"_blank\">investigations</a> into Donald Trump - this one, the Georgia election, the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trump-warrant-mar-a-lago\" target=\"_blank\">Mar-a-Lago raid</a>- do suggest this is a witch hunt.
