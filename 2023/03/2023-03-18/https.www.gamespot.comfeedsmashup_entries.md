<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> lets you amass countless items as you explore the world and beat up enemies. Some are useful since they boost your character, while others are utter garbage. Still, there are those that might look quite nice, and you probably want to keep their cosmetic effect. Here's our Diablo 4 guide to help you with the transmog system, as well as the dyes or pigments.</p><h2>How to use the Diablo 4 transmog system</h2><p>The Diablo 4 transmog system can be accessed via the Wardrobe, which is found in the Kyovashad inn. You'll visit this city early in the campaign. Anyway, given that Kyovashad is the main hub in the Fractured Peaks, it will have this particular feature, though you might also see it elsewhere when you get to visit the hubs/major cities in future acts.</p><p>As for the designs of each weapon and armor, you won't have access to these by default. Instead, you'll need to visit the Blacksmith. When you mouse over an item, it should say "unlocks new look on salvage," along with a pickaxe icon. These denote that salvaging these gear pieces would permanently save their design for use in transmogrification.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-transmog-dyes-pigments-guide/1100-6512474/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

There, you're told to inscribe your greatest sin on a tablet (i.e., fear, anger, pride, greed, or nothing but scribbles).

## Meet The Hackers Behind The Resident Evil 4 HD Project That Took 8 Years To Make

<p dir="ltr">Upon its original release, Resident Evil 4 was nothing short of a revelation for the beloved horror series. Combining pinpoint moment-to-moment action with some of the best set pieces and boss fights of the 2000s, RE4 deserves its reputation as one of the greatest action games of all time. With Capcom's impressive remake coming out this year, the original is still kept relevant thanks in part to the fan-made <a href="https://www.re4hd.com/?page_id=9303">Resident Evil 4 HD Project</a>, a mod that updates the look and feel of the game to modern standards. It's one of the most impressive video game fan works of all time, and it's all thanks to a small team of dedicated hackers who literally traveled the globe to accomplish their goals.</p><p dir="ltr">Albert Marin Garau is a longtime Resident Evil fan who dabbles in game modding. Over the years, he made a hobby out of collecting assets that had appeared in many of the series' best entries, including music tracks, textures, and pre-rendered backgrounds. He created repositories of these assets primarily for his own amusement. When he started working on RE4, he realized that many of the game's textures were blurry and low-resolution. However, it wasn't until the first PC port of the game came out that he realized he could simply rip the images from the game. In fact, he could even modify them himself. Now his library had a practical use.</p><p dir="ltr">"When the first RE4 port came out in 2007, I was really impressed with how moddable the game was," Marin Garau tells GameSpot. "The textures were simple TGA images, which meant I could move from compiling game assets to improving them. I created a texture pack for the game, which obviously pales in comparison to the HD Project."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-hackers-behind-the-resident-evil-4-hd-project-that-took-8-years-to-make/1100-6512428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

While all of this is technically new to all players, Diablo veterans will undoubtedly understand most of what's going around them. However, there are a few brand new mechanics and features in Diablo 4 that every player will have to learn about. One of these new features is an item called <strong>Murmuring Obols</strong>.</p><p>Players might notice they have earned some of this mysterious currency, but they may not understand exactly how they got them or what to spend them on. We will illuminate the mystery around the Murmuring Obols so players have one less thing to worry about in Sanctuary.</p><h2>The purpose of Murmuring Obols</h2><p>Currently, in the beta of Diablo 4, there is only one use for the Murmuring Obols. Players can visit a Purveyor of Curiosities shop, which is marked by the bank icon on your map, and spend their Murmuring Obols on some mystery items.
