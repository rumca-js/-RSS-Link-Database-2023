He was 23 and had already won four Serie A titles. He had been named young player of the tournament at the previous World Cup. He was a star on the rise, the sort of player who might conceivably drag United out of their post-Alex Ferguson slump.</p><p>Pogba had apparently only one fault: he seemed a player out of time, a box-to-box midfielder in an age that had outgrown them. Midfields had split into two bands, and he didn\u2019t quite have the tight technical ability to play in the more advanced line, receiving the ball often with his back to goal, but wasn\u2019t quite disciplined enough to operate consistently as a holder (which, anyway, felt a waste of his profound creative gifts). What he needed was to operate on the left of the midfield three as he had at Juve, but that was not how United played. That quibble, though, was only the start of it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/18/paul-pogbas-targeting-by-criminals-is-a-human-tragedy-he-needs-support\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/18/paul-pogbas-targeting-by-criminals-is-a-human-tragedy-he-needs-support", "date_published": "2023-03-18 20:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018This is unacceptable\u2019: Antonio Conte hits out at Spurs players and owner", "description": "<ul><li>\u2018I see only 11 players that play for themselves\u2019 in 3-3 draw</li><li>\u2018It is time to change this situation if Tottenham want to change\u2019</li></ul><p>The Tottenham manager, Antonio Conte, launched into his players after they blew a two-goal lead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/18/southampton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">draw 3-3 with Southampton</a>, severely questioning their motivations beyond that and the club itself.
