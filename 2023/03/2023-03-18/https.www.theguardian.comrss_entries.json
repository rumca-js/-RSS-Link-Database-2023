In the dramatized yet scrupulously realistic Baltimore mapped by creator David Simon, institutions \u2013 policing, education, politics \u2013 preserve their entrenched structures of power at the cost of the individual, and it happens over and over. Red tape renders meaningful change pitifully incremental when possible at all, and those responsible for shaking up the status quo invariably face punishment rather than reward. There\u2019s a deep vein of cynicism at play in this worldview, fairly earned by Simon during his previous career as a reporter on the city desk at the Baltimore Sun, but it comes with a fundamentally idealistic corollary. So long as large, immovable systems of iniquity exist, we\u2019ll always have principled reformers who try in their own modest way to make some small difference.</p><p>Through the landmark series\u2019 five seasons, in more episodes than any other character, Lt Cedric Daniels stoked this inextinguishable ember of hope.

Daniels defends his people even when they\u2019re at fault, both out of cop solidarity and the knowledge that bad PR won\u2019t make the job more doable. In the course of a single scene, he could chew out a few of his underlings for cracking skulls in project housing, then advise them on how to beat a brutality investigation with a chilling calm.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/18/lance-reddick-the-wire-john-wick\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/18/lance-reddick-the-wire-john-wick", "date_published": "2023-03-18 17:36:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Imagine a time when Shakespeare played a very second fiddle to Ben Jonson | Tomiwa Owolade", "description": "Richard Cohen\u2019s Making History returned me to the childhood ecstasy of leafing through my first encyclopaedia<p>My favourite subjects at school were English and history.
