Following another recent decline in battery power, NASA says AIM has become unresponsive.

From its vantage point 370 miles above the planet's surface, the spacecraft proved invaluable to scientists, with data collected by AIM appearing in 379 peer-reviewed papers, including a recent <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/climate-change-responsible-these-rare-high-latitude-clouds-180969712/\">2018 study</a> that found methane emissions from human-driven climate change are causing night-shining clouds to form more frequently.

To be able to enter these stores, customers will need to scan a code from the Amazon app with a connected credit card. However, some locations offer Amazon One, the e-commerce giant's palm-based identity and payment service, as an entry option. The plaintiff's complaint said the sign informs customers that Amazon will not be collecting their biometrics unless they choose to sign up for Amazon One. However, &quot;Amazon Go stores <em>do</em> collect biometric identifier information on every single customer, including information on the size and shape of every customers body,&quot; the complaint argues.</p><p>In a statement sent to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/amazon-sued-not-telling-new-york-store-customers-facial-recognition-rcna75290\"><em>NBC News</em></a>, an Amazon spokesperson defended the company's practices and technologies. They explained that Amazon does not use facial recognition, and any system it uses to identify shoppers inside its Go stores don't constitute biometric tech. &quot;Only shoppers who choose to enroll in Amazon One and choose to be identified by hovering their palm over the Amazon One device have their palm-biometric data securely collected,&quot; they insisted, &quot;and these individuals are provided the appropriate privacy disclosures during the enrollment process.&quot;</p><p>The lawsuit's outcome could then depend on whether the court sees someone's body shape and size as biometric information. In the complaint, the plaintiff quotes <a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCadmin/0-0-0-42626\">NYC Admin Code 22-1201's</a> definition of a biometric identifier in context of the law as &quot;a physiological or biological characteristic that is used by or on behalf of a commercial establishment, singly or in combination, to identify, or assist in identifying, an individual, including, but not limited to: (i) a retina or iris scan, (ii) a fingerprint or voiceprint, (iii) a scan of hand or face geometry, or any other identifying characteristic.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-faces-lawsuit-over-alleged-biometric-tracking-at-go-stores-in-new-york-144429703.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amazon-faces-lawsuit-over-alleged-biometric-tracking-at-go-stores-in-new-york-144429703.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-18 14:44:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Discord's themes are locked behind its $10-a-month Nitro subscription", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/with-the-help-of-openai-discord-is-finally-adding-conversation-summaries-160030905.html\">Discord</a> is finally giving you the power to customize your desktop app's interface with various themes for its latest beta test.
