<p>Brisbane photographer Renato Repetto passed a single analogue camera between some of Australia’s most prominent photographers and gave them just one roll of Kodak Tri-X 400 film to shoot on. The result – the 400TX Project – brings everything back to basics and focuses on the intimacy between photographer and subject. Armed with a 50-year-old Nikon F2 35mm SLR with a 55mm f/2.8 lens, the photographers felt a sense of stepping back in time. They were conservative with their single roll of 36-frame film, using manual focus and exposure. The images reveal the unique qualities of film photography and its place in the 21st century</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/mar/03/street-photography-on-show-in-pictures">Street photography on show – in pictures</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/mar/19/one-roll-of-film-what-a-test-the-400tx-project-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rice jumps into a helicopter, shouts ‘gosh’ a lot and helps the community in a way that feels utterly right. Perhaps it has something to do with long periods of Tory rule?</p><p>Almost 30 years since the last series, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/23/challenge-annekas-lasting-legacy-in-leeds-points-way-for-shows-reboot">Challenge Anneka</a> is back for a bite of that big nostalgia pie. Perhaps you remember it. Perhaps, like one of the people Anneka Rice gets on the phone in an attempt to blag some building materials, it means nothing to you at all. Still, here she is again, in a helicopter, flying over a field in Essex, shouting “gosh!” a lot, trying to make people’s lives better by agreeing to do an enormous job in an incredibly tight period of time. Challenge Anneka walked so DIY SOS could run, and now it’s back and it deserves its credit.</p><p>The helicopter, its most iconic feature, pushes the same retro buttons as the theme tune, but it turns out to be a bit pointless. Rice flies into the sky in order to read a giant “challenge card” laid out in a field, which she has to use binoculars to read, and which poses the question of why they didn’t show her a normal-sized card, on the ground, because she could have just used a pair of reading specs and saved everyone the fuel. Still! It’s a nod to the original, and they’re so confident that this is for people who loved the original that they don’t even bother explaining what is going on.</p><p>Challenge Anneka aired on Channel 5 and is available on My5.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/18/challenge-anneka-review-shes-back-and-its-like-she-has-never-been-away">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Burnley are flying high in the Championship under Vincent Kompany but were completely outclassed by Manchester City</p><p>Manchester City had won the previous 10 matches against Burnley with an aggregate score of 34-1. All of those games took place against sides managed by Sean Dyche, a very different style of team to the one created by Vincent Kompany but, six goals later, some things never change. The Belgian has turned the Clarets from a dour but efficient team to being exciting and free-wheeling but the reality of what he faces next season became apparent on Saturday night.</p><p>Promotion is essentially guaranteed, it would take an almighty demise to give up their 16-point lead on third with a game in hand in the final two months of the season. Their dominance in the league allowed Kompany to pick an almost full-strength team at the Etihad. The fans welcomed him back by serenading their former captain but this was a business event for Kompany.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/18/guardiolas-ruthless-machine-hand-old-favourite-kompany-a-harsh-lesson">Continue reading...</a>

Others are enamoured with orchids. There are those who are mesmerised by the kaleidoscopic swish and sway of tropical fish. But mention you’re interested in fungi, and you’re likely to be met with a raised eyebrow, a sideways glance, or perhaps even a choked-back guffaw. You may even watch faces warp from expressions of interest to ones of disgust. Fortunately, however, things are changing, and fungi are finally being looked at anew by homo sapiens.</p><p>Fungi have endured a long history of neglect and disdain. In 1887, British mycologist William Hay commented how he who studied fungi “must boldly face a good deal of scorn … and is actually regarded as a sort of idiot among the lower orders”. A few years earlier, nature writer Margaret Plues observed how the stranger, “blinded by conventionalities”, sneered at those seeking fungi. Unlike birders who look upwards for their charismatic avian delights, fungus hunters glance downwards, for what the “father of modern taxonomy” Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus referred to as “thievish and voracious beggars”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/19/the-fungal-awakening-how-we-came-to-love-and-fear-fungi">Continue reading...</a>

Now along comes U2’s frontman, Bono, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001k9cy" title="">speaking on BBC Radio 2’s <em>Piano Room</em></a>, saying that, as a 16-year-old punk rocker, pressure to look “macho” meant: “I [didn’t] want to own up to [liking] Abba.”</p><p>Bono eventually got over it: by 1992, U2 were bringing Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/abba-dancing-queen-u2-live-1223026/" title="">on stage</a> to perform Dancing Queen.

## Lance Reddick: The Wire’s crusading cop led with command and conviction

<p>The late actor has left behind a career of distinguished and often devastating roles, headed up by his no-nonsense lieutenant in the HBO drama</p><p>On HBO’s crime-and-punishment epic The Wire, the moral arc of the universe does not bend toward justice. In the dramatized yet scrupulously realistic Baltimore mapped by creator David Simon, institutions – policing, education, politics – preserve their entrenched structures of power at the cost of the individual, and it happens over and over. Red tape renders meaningful change pitifully incremental when possible at all, and those responsible for shaking up the status quo invariably face punishment rather than reward. There’s a deep vein of cynicism at play in this worldview, fairly earned by Simon during his previous career as a reporter on the city desk at the Baltimore Sun, but it comes with a fundamentally idealistic corollary. So long as large, immovable systems of iniquity exist, we’ll always have principled reformers who try in their own modest way to make some small difference.</p><p>Through the landmark series’ five seasons, in more episodes than any other character, Lt Cedric Daniels stoked this inextinguishable ember of hope. A born-and-raised Baltimore native himself, actor Lance Reddick never played the no-nonsense lifer cop as a valiant crusader, however, viewing him instead as a shrewd and pragmatic compromiser. For every moment of rousing defiance that sees Daniels extend his middle finger to the system, like his vitriolic kiss-off to a superior pulling his unit’s funding or his instantly immortal declaration that the latest top-down order is “BULLSHIT”, there’s a sobering reminder of how the game is played. Daniels defends his people even when they’re at fault, both out of cop solidarity and the knowledge that bad PR won’t make the job more doable. In the course of a single scene, he could chew out a few of his underlings for cracking skulls in project housing, then advise them on how to beat a brutality investigation with a chilling calm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/18/lance-reddick-the-wire-john-wick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Despite Antonio Conte’s summer departure being widely accepted as an inevitability and annual questions over Harry Kane’s future sure to follow, Tottenham can still rescue this season. Even if finishing fourth last year has not resulted in much happiness this campaign, the financial rewards for club, playing and coaching staff are considerable.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/17/nottingham-forest-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Newcastle’s win at Nottingham Forest</a> had further upped the ante but as so often with Spurs this season, at Southampton it was rather difficult to tell how much they wanted it. Goals from Kane and Ivan Perisic looked to have won them the game, only for Pape Sarr to thoughtlessly give away a penalty in the dying seconds, swinging a leg into a flying Kamaldeen Sulemana. Up stepped James Ward-Prowse to thrash home the spot-kick and suddenly Southampton were level; deservedly so.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/18/southampton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’m the daughter of a microbiologist – which is why this crusade against unseen germs doesn’t impress me</p><p>A few weeks ago, I finally plucked up the courage and went in … to the shadowy place at the back of the fridge where no hand ever goes (sorry if you were expecting something more daring). To be clear, our fridge is quite clean, relatively speaking: nothing oozes in its salad crisper; no cheese rind awaits death in the place where the butter lives. But the top shelf, where I keep jars, open but not yet empty, was becoming too crowded. In the front row, I could see a Kilner of gherkins and some Daylesford blackcurrant and violet jam bought (ha) with a recent win on EuroMillions, and neither looked to me as if they’d give us botulism. But the Lord alone knew what lurked behind. Something had to be done.</p><p>Two hours later, and the dishwasher was full of jars, and the bin of their (mostly unrecognisable) contents: a satisfying morning’s work, and one that got me thinking about what else in the kitchen I might profitably clean. The spice cupboard, which looks a bit dusty? The space I laughably call my pantry, which has lately taken on a somewhat forlorn aspect? What I absolutely did not consider, however, was joining the crowd by boiling my wooden spoons. I’m the child of a microbiologist. I hold to the notion that, broadly speaking, wood is naturally antibacterial. I’ve had the same chopping board for more than 15 years, and I’ve only ever wiped it with a damp, soapy cloth; no one has died so far.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/18/people-are-boiling-their-wooden-spoons-on-tiktok-i-wont-be-joining-them">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The exhibition <a href="https://www.wallacecollection.org/art/exhibitions-displays/portraits-of-dogs-from-gainsborough-to-hockney/">Portraits of Dogs at London’s Wallace Collection (29 March-15 October)</a> was inspired by a single painting of a pet. Not one of the famous works in the show – by Lucian Freud, George Stubbs or Edwin Landseer – or even an image of a fabulous pedigree hound. The influential artwork was <em>A Dog Lying on a Ledge</em>, a picture of a mutt by an unknown artist, that’s a favourite of Wallace Collection director Xavier Bray. It seems appropriate that such an ordinary yet clearly loving portrait inspired a show celebrating our everyday relationship with pets. “Art helps us express our shared experiences with dogs,” says curator Alex Collins “as well as creating likenesses that capture their psychology and emotional bond with us. I would love visitors to leave this exhibition with a new appreciation for the wonders of dog portraiture.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/mar/18/rather-fetching-classic-portraits-of-dogs-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

Claire Basler has covered the walls of many of the rooms in her ancient château with exquisite floral murals<p>The château of artist Claire Basler, nestled in the languid hills of central France, is filled with flowers inside and surrounded by them outside. Not only are flowers the favourite subjects of her paintings, they are her favourite décor, too, and she arranges them like installations in each room to complement the murals she paints on walls, ceilings and doors. Being inside the home she shares with her husband, Pierre Imhof, is like being inside one of her paintings – mesmerising, magical and otherworldly.</p><p>Claire’s ability to create unique and deeply moving interior environments comes, in part, from her desire to share the power of several seminal childhood experiences. When she was 12, she had an epiphany at a Gothic palace in Avignon. While other youngsters might have been tugging at their parents’ sleeves begging for early release from sightseeing at the Palais des Papes, Claire was immovable inside its 14th-century walls. Enveloped on all sides by ancient frescoes inside Pope Clement VI’s private study, the chambre du cerf, she was overcome. “I had the strong impression that I was not just looking at the painting,” she recalls, “but was part of the painting.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/18/rooms-in-bloom-the-flower-filled-chateau-of-a-french-artist">Continue reading...</a>

## Julian Lage: The Layers review – otherworldly jazz guitar

<p>(Blue Note)<br />The American guitarist’s sparse, largely acoustic companion piece to last year’s acclaimed View With a Room is another captivating creation</p><p>A childhood prodigy who played the Grammys at age 12, <a href="http://www.julianlage.com/">Julian Lage</a> has evolved into the most admired jazz guitarist of his generation (he’s now 35). This third album for Blue Note is drawn from the same sessions as last year’s feted <em>View With a Room</em>, again featuring his regular sidekicks, bassist <a href="https://www.jorgeroeder.com/">Jorge Roeder</a> and drummer <a href="https://www.daveking.net/about">Dave King</a>, with veteran guitarist <a href="https://www.billfrisell.com/">Bill Frisell</a> as special guest. Once again produced by Margaret Glaspy (a singer-songwriter who is also Lage’s wife), the album is a companion piece to <em>View</em>, or, as Lage has it, “a prequel, it has all the musical seeds that grew into <em>View</em> but it has a heartbeat of its own”.</p><p>While possessing the same entrancing quality as its predecessor, <em><a href="https://julianlage.lnk.to/TheLayers">The Layers</a></em> is still sparser, with few of the Americana flavours that the much-travelled Frisell previously helped bring, and with half of its six tracks delivered on acoustic guitar. Lage is a masterful player, alternating careful, detailed lines with bursts of dexterous improvisation, and Roeder in particular proves a splendid foil, not least on the title track. Frisell, a fellow fretboard technician, brings intricate harmonic touches to the otherworldly Missing Voices. Like <em>View</em>, <em>The Layers</em> proves a captivating creation, but at under 30 minutes seems a little frugal by comparison.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/18/julian-lage-the-layers-review-otherworldly-jazz-guitar-bill-frisell-jorge-roeder-dave-king">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Great British Bake Off winner on the stress of the show, growing up in a family of seven children, and why egg and cress sandwiches made her cry</p><p><strong>Before </strong><em><strong>The Great British </strong></em><em><strong>Bake Off</strong></em><strong>, </strong>I never thought to bake a cake in four hours or do something that elaborate. It’s so surprising how the stress and desperation pushes you. I’d call it a human instinct to survive: no matter what I do, I have to serve <em>something</em> at the end.</p><p><strong>I grew up in </strong><strong>Malacca City</strong><strong>, </strong>in the south part of Malaysia and I’m the second of seven children and the first daughter. The thing about being the first daughter is you have to do everything. It starts in the morning: I had to do the laundry, get ready for school, cycle to school, do my homework, cook for dinner, tidy up everything and repeat every day. So I’m used to a very tight schedule, being busy. When I don’t have anything to do, I’m always rearranging stuff in my house.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/18/syabira-yusoff-bake-off-helped-my-self-confidence">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Eventim Apollo, London</strong><br />From daddy issues to violent crime, the south London rapper’s thoughtful set is distinguished by its emotional candour and vulnerability</p><p>“I broke the cycle,” declares south London rapper Loyle Carner, savagely but happily. He’s talking about HGU – one of the most hard-hitting songs on his resonant third album, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/23/loyle-carner-hugo-review-a-beautiful-blistering-masterpiece">Hugo</a></em>. As his band of nuanced live players slide gracefully into languid, jazz-tinged breakbeats, Carner dedicates the song to “my father, and his father, and his father’s father”, as a sold-out crowd bay their approval. We’re neck-deep in the first of a two-night residency in London towards the end of Carner’s UK tour: there’s another sellout – at the 12,500-capacity Wembley Arena – the following night, which will be livestreamed.</p><p>Even if you don’t know Carner’s own story, it would be hard to throw a pebble and not hit someone with daddy issues. There is a sense in this room of him strumming people’s pain with his fingers. The music fades out to leave him, clad in simple white T-shirt, rapping a cappella. His final verse goes hard against the conditions that created his line of absent fathers – who were, to quote Philip Larkin, “fucked up in their turn” – looking for a break point in the circuit. Carner wants to “rewrite the ending, and the prequel” because for “the cycle to repeat” is the “default”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/18/loyle-carner-eventim-hammersmith-apollo-london-review-hip-hop-with-an-open-heart-hugo">Continue reading...</a>

## Taylor Swift review – pop’s hardest-working star gives Eras tour her all

<p><strong>State Farm Stadium, Glendale, Arizona</strong></p><p>The electrifying start of the singer-songwriter’s first tour in five years saw a mammoth, fan-pleasing 44-song set and extravagant staging</p><p>By Friday afternoon, there was a new destination in Arizona: Swift City, population 70,000 fans in town for the first stop on Taylor Swift’s Eras tour, and designated by some of them on Google Maps as a place of worship. “Welcome to ERAzona,” the 33-year-old pop star’s publicist emailed me hours before the show, referring to one of the hashtags Swifties developed to tag their arrival for what was billed – and delivered – as an expansive celebration of her undeniably prolific catalog. Team Swift is, as ever, attuned to the online conversation around her; you cannot consume Taylor Swift music without dipping (or diving) into Taylor Swift content. This is an artist who, as some have argued, has come <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/taylor-swift-fandom-true-metaverse/671814/">closer than Mark Zuckerberg to building a true metaverse</a> and cultivated a famously chatty, close virtual relationship with her fans.</p><p>Those fans turned out in force on Friday night in Glendale – fittingly for the base of her popularity, a suburb, roughly the same distance from Phoenix as Hendersonville, the town in Tennessee where Swift attended her one year of high school, is from Nashville, home of the country music industry that shaped her early career. Mostly women and gay men (along with a few good sport boyfriends/husbands) dressed in the instantly recognizable iconography of her 10 albums – Reputation-era black leotards, Lover-era pastels, mock-ups of her 2021 Folklore Grammy dress, rhinestone-adorned bodysuits a la Bejeweled music video, and at least two men in “sexy baby” T-shirts (see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1kbLwvqugk">Antihero</a>).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/18/taylor-swift-eras-tour-review-arizona">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Texas man is suing his ex-wife’s friends for helping her get an abortion – whether he wins or not, the lawsuit is sending a terrifying message to women</p><p>Meet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/10/texas-abortion-law-jonathan-f-mitchell-profile">Jonathan Mitchell</a>. The former solicitor general of Texas is not a household name but you’ll be familiar with his work. He’s the architect of the dystopian Texas law that lets private citizens act as vigilantes and sue abortion providers or anyone who “aids or abets” the procedure. As the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/12/us/politics/texas-abortion-lawyer-jonathan-mitchell.html">New York Times</a> noted in a 2021 profile of Mitchell, he’s devoted much of the past decade to “honing a largely below-the-radar strategy of writing laws deliberately devised to make it much more difficult for the judicial system – particularly the supreme court – to thwart them.” In other words: he’s brilliant at finding sneaky ways to inflict his beliefs on everyone else. And he appears to have made it his life’s work to weaponize the law to terrorize and control women.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/18/are-texass-abortion-laws-being-used-for-state-sponsored-spousal-harassment">Continue reading...</a>

## My food revolution: how I learned to love a gluten-free diet

<p>After years of pain, the diagnosis of coeliac disease was a crucial turning point for Lizzy Davies. She explains the changes it forced her to make – and how she learned to love food once again</p><p>It starts with a strange tingling on my tongue as I get on the tube in central London. About five minutes later, I start to wonder if I might feel a little faint (or is it just really, really hot down here?). After 15, I know: I’m going to vomit the entire contents of my stomach into a bag full of orchard fruits from my friend’s dad’s garden. “Have some apples and pears from Normandy,” she’d said, charmingly, just an hour or two earlier, as we sat down for my 40th birthday afternoon tea. Little did she know the horror that was to be unleashed on that inoffensive little tote.</p><p>A few minutes later, as I stand at the side of the road in north-east London, puking into a bin in broad daylight, it occurs to me that people must think I’m drunk. But alcohol has nothing to do with my current predicament. You can blame that entirely on the scones. Or perhaps the sandwiches. I certainly have my suspicions about the dainty little tart whose pastry tasted so good, so buttery, so, well, not gluten-free, that I double checked with the waitress. But that’s the thing about being coeliac: you’re often not quite sure what the culprit was. You just know there’s been a crime – and your poor, long-suffering gut is the victim.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/18/my-food-revolution-how-i-learned-to-love-a-gluten-free-diet">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Bridgewater Hall, Manchester; Barbican; Royal Opera House, London</strong><br />A trio of young conductors vie for a job with the Hallé; Barbara Hannigan takes Mahler at his word; and Antonio Pappano makes a thriller of Puccini’s final opera</p><p>The cheers in Manchester on Tuesday night were not only for the football (City’s 7-0 win against Leipzig). Another contest took place the same evening with more than 200 entries from across the world whittled down to a shortlist of eight, three finalists and one deserved winner. The aim of the <strong><a href="https://www.conductors-competition.com/">Siemens Hallé international conductors competition</a></strong> is to appoint the Hallé orchestra’s next assistant conductor. (Wipe clean your image of that job as portrayed in the film <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/16/monstrous-maestro-cate-blanchett-cancel-culture-tar">Tár</a></em>, which I vowed never to mention again but must, in the interests of accuracy.) The assistant role has existed at the Hallé since 2002 – the first holder of the title was Edward Gardner, now principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra – but the competition itself is new. <a href="https://www.delyanalazarova.com/">Delyana Lazarova</a> was the inaugural winner in 2020, and now ends her successful two-year stint in Manchester.</p><p>Much is at stake for all. From the conversational buzz last week it was clear many in the audience had followed earlier rounds (judged by an international panel of seven) and had views and favourites. As well as working alongside Mark Elder, now nearing the end of his long stint as the Hallé’s music director, the assistant must run its youth orchestra and engage with the many outreach projects, in care homes, schools, hospitals. Being able to conduct, as each of the finalists did, Mozart’s <em>Marriage of Figaro</em> overture is not enough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/18/siemens-halle-international-conductors-competition-final-2023-bridgewater-hall-review-lso-london-symphony-orchestra-barbara-hannigan-mahler-4-barbican-turandot-pappano-royal-opera-house">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This year’s surprise quarter-finalists have previously gone further in the competition – to the semi-finals in 1936 and 1939</p><p>It’s hard to know what, in the year 2023, looks more far-fetched.

From 1929–48, including a break for the second world war, they spent 10 out of 12 seasons in the top flight. All three of Grimsby’s England internationals were capped in that time: the inside-forward Jackie Bestall (described in this paper as an “artful dodger and constructive genius”), the goalkeeper George Tweedy and the inspirational centre-back Harry Betmead each made a single appearance between 1935 and 1937.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/18/taking-on-the-powerhouses-grimsbys-golden-age-in-the-fa-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Maxim Emelyanychev and co launch their Mozart series with the first and last symphonies. And more evening canticles from the choir of St John’s College and Andrew Nethsingha</p><p>• Mozart wrote his first symphony at the age of eight when, already a renowned prodigy, he was on a visit to London as part of a European tour. While perhaps not a masterpiece, it has vim and flair. He completed the last, No 41 in C major, K551 “Jupiter”, in 1788, three years before his death at the age of 35. The first of a new series of Mozart symphonies on disc,<strong> <a href="https://www.apartemusic.com/albums/mozart-the-symphonies/?lang=en">The Beginning and the End</a></strong> (Aparté)<strong>, </strong>includes both works, played by the period instrument group <a href="https://www.ilpomodoro.org/">Il Pomo d’Oro</a>. <strong>Maxim Emelyanychev, </strong>best known in the UK as <a href="https://www.sco.org.uk/profile/maxim-emelyanychev">principal conductor of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra</a>, conducts these effervescent, brisk performances, with fleet string figures and ripe, punchy woodwind. He is also the soloist, playing fortepiano, in Mozart’s pIano concerto No 3 in A major, K488 (interesting to compare with the revivified – in abeyance for years – <a href="https://aam.co.uk/mozart-recordings/">complete Mozart piano concerto cycle</a> with fortepianist Robert Levin and the Academy of Ancient Music). If you prefer a more opulent sound for Mozart, this won’t be for you. I found it engrossing.</p><p>• As director of the <strong>choir of St John’s College, Cambridge</strong>, <strong>Andrew Nethsingha</strong> – now <a href="https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-biographies/andrew-nethsingha">organist and master of the choristers at Westminster Abbey</a> – turned an already first-class choir into an exemplary, adventurous ensemble. The more than two dozen discs they recorded together during his <a href="https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/thank-you-for-the-music">15-year tenure</a> have strong thematic shape (as well as, in their elegant black packaging, a unifying visual identity). In <strong><a href="https://signumrecords.com/product/magnificat-vol-3/SIGCD742/">Magnificat 3</a> </strong>(Signum), their third disc of evening canticles, the choir sings settings of the liturgically paired Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis. Composers include Charles Villiers Stanford, George Dyson and Herbert Howells, as well as those currently working: Bryan Kelly (b.1934) and Philip Moore (b.1943).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/18/mozart-the-beginning-and-the-end-il-pomo-doro-maxim-emelyanychev-symphony-no-1-41-piano-concerto-no-3-magnificat-3-choir-of-st-johns-college-cambridge-andrew-nethsingha">Continue reading...</a>

With this column, my aim is to show you how versatile and exciting vegetables can be, rather than how they can replace a cow-shaped hole in your life. But, as a take on the original goes, I think today’s dish really stands up. The roast celeriac and mushroom provide “meatiness”, while the cider, mustard, paprika and tomatoes give depth, heat and sweetness.

<p>The 90s powerhouse are rising again thanks to academy talent and a core of young players released by Premier League clubs</p><p>Blackburn Rovers have come a long way from the big-spending days and 1995 Premier League title under the ownership of Jack Walker. They have needed to adapt to their position in the north-west’s football ecosystem because they are no longer challenging for honours at the top of the pyramid.</p><p>The last time Blackburn played in an FA Cup quarter-final, in 2007, Hayden Carter was at Manchester City – the club they beat that day – albeit in the under-sevens. The defender was released at 13 and was signed by Blackburn, where he has been joined by a number of teammates who went through similar rejection at Premier League clubs. They hope the next stage of their journey will be a Wembley semi-final, the reward if they win at Sheffield United on Sunday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/18/blackburns-rejuvenated-rejects-target-promotion-and-fa-cup-progress">Continue reading...</a>

## The US was prepared to bomb the Middle East into shape. In Ukraine, it seems no less self-serving | Randeep Ramesh

<p>Washington split with old allies in order to pursue its own interests in Iraq. Its support for Kyiv is equally conditional</p><p>In the two decades since the second Iraq war, the United States appears like the Bourbon kings who had learned nothing and forgotten nothing. The illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq was a story of geopolitical failure and domestic political disaster. To understand the foolhardy decision to launch the war, one must first understand the US grand strategy of <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/francis-fukuyama-on-the-end-of-american-hegemony">global hegemony</a>, which Washington has pursued since 1945.</p><p>The “war on terror” provided political cover for the further pursuit of supremacy, despite threatening democratic government with lies, fraud and violence. George W Bush’s rash actions did provoke some <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/10/22/boxer-defends-vote-against-war-in/">murmurs of concern</a> about the damage being inflicted but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iraq-usa-idUKN1929611920080320">these faded</a> from the corridors of power.

<p>Who is the young girl in Paul Gauguin’s painting Spirit of the Dead Watching? On a trip to Tahiti, the film-maker and novelist Devika Ponnambalam finds out the troubling truth</p><p>She lies naked, on her belly, palms flat on the pillow. Her skin is dark as wet earth, hair black as night. A traditional Tahitian cloth covers the mattress, marigold yellow petals against midnight blue. The wall behind the bed is violet-dark with phosphorescent flashes of white. At her feet, a shadow crouches with a black shroud covering the head, so that the face appears as a death mask. This old woman at the young girl’s feet is a <em>tupapau</em><em>,</em> or spirit of the dead.</p><p>The first time I saw Spirit of the Dead Watching was in 2001 as a tiny colour reproduction embedded within a magazine article about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>’s life – how the French painter had left western civilisation behind in order to find an untouched world and a new way of seeing.

<p>When Ben Leyland’s mum said she was in trouble, he had no idea she was about to be exposed for sending hundreds of abusive tweets about Madeleine McCann’s parents – or of the tragic end to her story</p><p>“There was this entire part of Mum that I never knew about,” Ben Leyland says. Brenda Leyland was a stylish, well-spoken and rather private woman who lived in a picturesque village in Leicestershire. He knew she told stories, and that some of them may have been on the tall side. He also knew that she spent a lot of time on her laptop and was increasingly living online. What he didn’t know was that his mother had become a Twitter troll who spent the final years of her life relentlessly attacking the parents of Madeleine McCann, the girl who disappeared in Portugal in 2007 at the age of three and hasn’t been seen since.</p><p>In 2014, Brenda was approached by a Sky News journalist who asked her why she was trolling the McCanns on Twitter. She was about to get into a car with her friend to visit a garden centre, and declined to comment. The journalist then told her that she had been reported to Scotland Yard and her tweets were being investigated as part of a larger campaign of abuse against the McCanns. “Well, that’s fair enough,” she said calmly. But Brenda’s face gave her away. Her eyes blinked and her cheek twitched anxiously.

<p>Ahead of a new book about our need for faith, the ‘militant atheist’ discusses oversharing, identity – and why he’s distancing himself from Richard Dawkins </p><p>David Baddiel was six years old when his mother told him death was like a long sleep from which you never wake up. “I think from that point,” he says, “I never really wanted to go to sleep again.” That night, he lay on the top bunk of his bed, fervently praying – “probably” the first and last time he has prayed with any sincerity – that “my life as it was in Dollis Hill in 1971 would still somehow continue after death”.</p><p>More than half a century later Baddiel is still an insomniac, and he’s still terrified by the prospect of dying. “I don’t quite believe anyone who says they’re not,” he says. That childhood memory, and that conviction, is what kicks off his latest book, The God Desire, which delivers in a brisk 110-odd pages what Baddiel considers “an absolutely slam-dunk argument” against the existence of God.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/18/david-baddiel-football-fills-a-god-shaped-hole">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This Mother’s Day weekend, let’s celebrate self-sacrificing, feuding, exhausted, loving screen mums, from Stella Dallas to Lady Bird, Mommie Dearest to 20th Century Women</p><p>We often talk a bit flippantly about female movie stars past a certain age being consigned to “mum roles”: blandly supportive background figures who pop up merely to nag or nurture when required. “Mum” shouldn’t be a byword for mainstream cinema’s laziest, most ageist and least dimensional instincts when it comes to female characterisation; the best films about motherhood treat it as a state of being, not just as a balm for others.</p><p>Many of the so-called “women’s pictures” of Hollywood’s golden age hinged on complex, conflicted portrayals of motherhood. King Vidor’s excellent 1937 version of <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/0P9H279RL9R60JNX8Z1980V7NT/ref=atv_dl_rdr?tag=just016-21">Stella Dallas</a></strong> (Amazon Prime Video) is the mother-daughter weepie to end them all, powered by Barbara Stanwyck’s wrenching performance as a working-class woman who gives up her daughter to ensure her a better life. Twenty-two years later, equivalent themes of personal sacrifice and class subversion merged with surprisingly sharp racial politics in Douglas Sirk’s magnificent <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/imitation-of-life">Imitation of Life</a></strong>, in which a white woman and her black maid are bonded by fraught relationships with their respective daughters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/18/streaming-the-best-films-about-motherhood-mums-on-screen-mothers-day">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The decor of this period house in Rye, reflects the Georgians’ exuberant, hedonistic spirit</p><p>Georgian interiors tend to be decorated with quiet, tasteful dignity – all subdued hues and well-polished wood. But Nicola Gill, the owner of the Old Stout House in Rye, East Sussex, wasn’t fired up by this approach: “I didn’t want to do another Georgian renovation with a palette of sludgy neutrals, portraits leaning against walls and pared-back styling. The Georgians were exuberant, colourful and hedonistic, using vibrant colours and pattern. I wanted an uplifting clash of styles, eras, patterns, textures and colour.”</p><p>Built in the late 18th century, the building has a varied past – as an ale house, a grocer’s and a haberdasher’s before becoming a home in the 1960s. When Gill, a writer and interior designer, and her musician partner Pete found the place in late 2021, it was completely unmodernised, with no central heating and ancient electrics and plumbing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/18/goodbye-tasteful-neutrals-hello-riotous-prints-a-georgian-renovation-that-delights-in-colour">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Studded with Polari, this bold novel is a dazzling entertainment of sexual and linguistic transgression</p><p>This bold chunk of fiction comes garlanded with the promise that it is written in Polari, the historical cant of British gay male society. This turns out to be not quite true – Polari was only ever a vocabulary, rather than a full language – but it certainly indicates where we’re heading; back to the late 1960s, when Polari had its heyday, and far out into the choppy waters of linguistic transgression.</p><p>The largest part of the book is taken up with what purports to be a typescript of the “anarcho-surrealist” memoirs of one Raymond Novak. The tersest summary of Novak’s literary stylings might be to say that Julian and Sandy, those Polari-dishing stars of Round the Horne<em>,</em> meet Bataille and Breton – and lose. Other antecedents include the slang that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/anthonyburgess" title="">Anthony Burgess</a> invented for the droogs of A Clockwork Orange, and the potty-mouthed wordplay of Jarry’s Père Ubu. As if this wasn’t already more than enough, the deadpan footnotes that frame Novak’s memoir give the reader to understand that it is being received in instalments by the staff of Glass Eye Press, a Fitzrovian publisher of under-the-counter filth whose back catalogue would make Joe Orton blush.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/18/man-eating-typewriter-by-richard-milward-review-homage-to-60s-gay-counterculture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s a huge organ that gives us the energy to live, grow and repair. But how does it work – and how do you keep it healthy? Our science editor unravels its astonishing job</p><p>The gut, or gastrointestinal system, is the long and winding route that food and drink takes through the body. It ensures that all the beneficial nutrients are absorbed and used for energy, growth and repair. You can think of it as a number of hollow organs connected by a tube which starts at the mouth and ends at the anus. Once food has been swallowed, the oesophagus delivers it to the stomach. It then goes through the small and large intestines before waste – the material the body cannot use – is expelled as a stool. Solid organs help along the way: the liver, pancreas and gall bladder. The entire digestive tract is about 5m long in a typical adult, with the small intestine making up two-thirds, but there is plenty of variation between people. Spread the whole lot out, and the surface area of the gut that comes into contact with food is about 32m<sup>2</sup>. That’s about <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24694282/#:~:text=The%20mean%20total%20mucosal%20surface,of%20half%20a%20badminton%20court." title="">half the size of a badminton court</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/18/what-are-the-real-signs-of-a-healthy-gut-a-users-guide">Continue reading...</a>

Of all the pieces of intelligence that the CIA and British agents were gathering at the time, this turned out to be the only accurate one.</p><p>The invasion was launched on “evidence” about weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) that consisted mostly of whatever it was Iraqi informants knew our intelligence agencies most wanted to hear and would happily pay for.

<p>From the outside she was a flighty socialite living the easy life. But the It girl was a troubled teen who was sent away to ‘behaviour modification’ schools. She still struggles with the scars today</p><p>“All of the things that every teenage girl would go through: going to school, going to the prom, going to college, I missed out on so much of that,” Paris Hilton tells me. It would be natural to assume this was just the opportunity cost of her fame; the Shirley Temple of partying, she’s been red-carpeting so long that even if she’s younger than you – she’s 42 – it probably feels as if she’s lived longer. Of course she didn’t go to college: those sequins weren’t going to wear themselves to Coachella.</p><p>In the beginning, Paris Hilton was famous because her parents were, and they were famous because of her great-grandfather, hotel tycoon <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/23/hilton-hotel-paris-family-dynasties-ian-sansom" title="">Conrad Hilton</a>, and the whole family was famous because of its wealth. As she moved into her late teens, she became a name in her own right: a model and It girl, the “<a href="https://mega.onemega.com/the-og-influencer-how-paris-hilton-started-influencer-marketing/" title="">OG influencer</a>”, as she describes it – the first person on record to seek and attain payment for turning up at parties. This, at the time, seemed to seal her in the public imagination as a bauble, one of life’s fripperies. Certainly, we didn’t spend a lot of time pondering that it takes quite a lot of entrepreneurial moxie to recognise the value of your stardust and monetise it, especially when you’re already minted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/18/they-stole-my-childhood-paris-hilton-teenage-trauma-sex-tapes-having-baby-by-surrogate">Continue reading...</a>
