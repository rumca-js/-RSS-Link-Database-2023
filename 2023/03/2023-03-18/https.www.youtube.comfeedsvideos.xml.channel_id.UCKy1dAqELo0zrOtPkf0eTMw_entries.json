Did you spot any clues in the John Wick 4 official trailer? Before we get there, let\u2019s follow the story so far leading up to John Wick 4. New Trailer footage shows Wick\u2019s facing down a massive organization, though that\u2019s hinted at in every John Wick 4 teaser. \n\nWe\u2019re exploring how John Wick (Keanu Reeves) got to the heights in John Wick Chapter 4. Donnie Yen joins for John Wick: Chapter 4 from Lionsgate. We\u2019re exploring what went down before all this-  John Wick 3, John Wick 2, and the original. Before you watch the epic John Wick 4 fight to come, get to know the story so far. In this John Wick story so far, we\u2019ll explore everything from the people he met in John Wick 3, to the organization we got to know in John Wick 2, and more!

Let\u2019s back up a second. In season 3 episode 3 of The Mandalorian, a lot is coming back from the past- the Mythosaur, the Children of the Watch, Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito), even a new (old) character, Elia Kane! You may remember the last Elia Kane Star Wars entry way back when a nameless Katy O\u2019Brien character was in Moff Gideon\u2019s employ, alongside Dr. Pershing. Star Wars represents a huge universe, but some characters come back around all the time in Star Wars (mind flayer, anyone?) \n\nThe mind flayer is back in a big way in The Mandalorian, Star Wars currently prime story, sidelining even Grogu just a little bit. In The Mandalorian season 3, episode 3, Din Djarin makes a big achievement with \u201cBaby Yoda\u201d by his side in the Disney Plus hit show. We\u2019re breaking it down with all The Mandalorian easter eggs you\u2019re looking for, as we get this chapter of Star Wars explained. Aren\u2019t The Mandalorian easter eggs just a little bit more fun? Plus, what the stories of Dr. Pershing, Elia Kane, and more REALLY mean in this episode of IGN Canon Fodder hosted by Max Scoville.  \n\nSubscribe to IGN for more!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/IGNentertainment?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#ign", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBbBe7UDXPo", "date_published": "2023-03-18 16:00:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
