  <p id="yXGIYV">The FBI has arrested the person allegedly in charge of the BreachForums online hacking community, as reported earlier by <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/feds-charge-ny-man-as-breachforums-boss-pompompurin/"><em>Krebs on Security</em></a> and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/alleged-breachforums-owner-pompompurin-arrested-on-cybercrime-charges/"><em>Bleeping Computer</em></a>. Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, also known online as “Pompompurin,” was arrested at his New York home on Wednesday and charged with conspiracy to commit access device fraud, according to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23713838-pompompurin-court-filing">a pair</a> of <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23713839-pompompurin-criminal-complaint?responsive=1&amp;title=1">court filings</a>.</p>
<p id="UQ4PQp">In a sworn statement, the FBI agent involved in the case claims Fitzpatrick admitted to owning BreachForums at the time of his arrest and identified himself as Pompompurin. <a href="https://flashpoint.io/blog/breach-forums-raid-forums-successor/">Pompompurin created BreachForums</a> after the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/raidforums-hacking-forum-seized-by-police-owner-arrested/">FBI seized RaidForums</a>, a similar hacking site that also sold leaked information. </p>

  <p id="u6KdqX">Two men have been charged for their alleged roles in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/05/dea-investigating-breach-of-law-enforcement-data-portal/">last year’s hack</a> of the Drug Enforcement Agency’s web portal, as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/vile-gang-hackers-dea-data-portal-subpoena-data-1850226656">reported earlier by <em>Gizmodo</em></a>. In <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/two-men-charged-breaching-federal-law-enforcement-database-and-posing-police-officers">a press release posted</a> earlier this week, the Department of Justice says Sagar Steven Singh and Nicholas Ceraolo stole a police officer’s credentials to access a federal law enforcement database that they used to extort victims.</p>
<p id="JdufGz">Prosecutors claim the 19-year-old Singh and 25-year-old Ceraolo<strong> </strong>are members of a hacking group called Vile, which often steals personal information from victims and then threatens to dox them online if they don’t receive a payment. While the DOJ doesn’t explicitly say which agency Singh and Ceraolo allegedly hacked into, it states the portal contains “detailed,...</p>

  <p id="LGy7X2">For the past few months, I’ve been cheating on my Apple Pencil. Instead of using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Apple’s $129 stylus</a> with my iPad Mini for notetaking, I’ve been using an alternative I purchased off of Amazon for about $25. It looks nearly identical, works nearly as well, and even snaps onto and charges from your iPad. And while this $25 stylus doesn’t quite match all of the Apple Pencil’s features, it comes awfully close to providing a similar experience for a fraction of the price.</p>
<p id="rO0ZQ8">The stylus I’ve been using is from a random brand called “StylusHome,” but there are many similar ones listed on Amazon for around the same price. It apes the styling of Apple’s second-generation Pencil exactly — if it weren’t for the logo on the first-party one, I wouldn’t...</p>

  <p id="H4dou1">It’s official: Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell will reunite for a <em>Good Burger</em> sequel that’s set to hit Paramount Plus later this year. The duo <a href="https://twitter.com/FallonTonight/status/1636941657756123136?s=20">revealed the news</a> during a segment on <em>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em> on Friday night, noting that they will start filming in the summer.</p>
<p id="MWxMSE"><em>Good Burger </em>2 takes place in a present-day version of the fictional fast food restaurant of the same name, with Thompson reprising his role as Dexter Reed and Mitchell as Ed, the store’s hilariously oblivious cashier. Here’s the film’s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/welcome-to-good-burger-home-of-the-good-burger-301775529.html">official synopsis</a>:</p>

  <p id="yDBM1Q">The nice thing about the entry-level M2-powered MacBook Air is the fact it's relatively affordable (for a Mac, of course).
