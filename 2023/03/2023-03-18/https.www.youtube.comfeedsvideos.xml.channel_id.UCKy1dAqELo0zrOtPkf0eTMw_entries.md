We’re all asking it: Do TIE Interceptors have hyperdrives? Let’s back up a second. In season 3 episode 3 of The Mandalorian, a lot is coming back from the past- the Mythosaur, the Children of the Watch, Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito), even a new (old) character, Elia Kane! You may remember the last Elia Kane Star Wars entry way back when a nameless Katy O’Brien character was in Moff Gideon’s employ, alongside Dr. Pershing. Star Wars represents a huge universe, but some characters come back around all the time in Star Wars (mind flayer, anyone?) 

The mind flayer is back in a big way in The Mandalorian, Star Wars currently prime story, sidelining even Grogu just a little bit. In The Mandalorian season 3, episode 3, Din Djarin makes a big achievement with “Baby Yoda” by his side in the Disney Plus hit show. We’re breaking it down with all The Mandalorian easter eggs you’re looking for, as we get this chapter of Star Wars explained. Aren’t The Mandalorian easter eggs just a little bit more fun? Plus, what the stories of Dr. Pershing, Elia Kane, and more REALLY mean in this episode of IGN Canon Fodder hosted by Max Scoville.
