We got to see the co-op and more of the combat, which I dubbed \u201ca whole lot of jumping and shooting.\u201d Coming from the developer behind the Batman: Arkham series, it was confusing at best and underwhelming at worst. Not only was this three months before its worldwide launch, but the last major news drop was that Kevin Conroy would reprise Batman in his final performance.\n\nIf the gameplay showcase wasn't bad enough, Rocksteady released a behind-the-scenes video, showcasing everything fans didn't want to see. A Battle Pass, an in-game store with microtransactions, a live-service approach, loot and Gear Score systems - the hits just kept coming. There would also be post-launch content updates that would add new playable characters for free. All this for $70 and no loot boxes. How could people not celebrate?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38eSp9dOfXc", "date_published": "2023-03-13 13:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
