<p>‘Pineapple Express’ atmospheric river to bring rain and mountain snow in California and Oregon as low pressure moves up east coast </p><p>This week will feature snow events on opposite coasts of the US. As in late February, another west coast atmospheric river, or “Pineapple Express”, will bring rainfall and mountain snow to California and Oregon. Rain and mountain snow is expected to become more widespread and intense overnight and into Tuesday as an area of low pressure moves east, clearing through Wednesday.</p><p>Several feet of snow is expected to accumulate in the Sierra Nevada mountains by Wednesday evening, with the highest areas seeing up to 12 ft (3.66 metres). Large amounts of rain, with added snowmelt, will bring a significant risk of flooding across parts of the west but particularly in central California. However, every cloud has a silver lining, and in this case – in combination with the previous atmospheric river – it’s in the form of a considerable reduction in California’s extreme drought conditions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/13/weather-tracker-snow-expected-on-east-and-west-us-coasts">Continue reading...</a>

## Paula review – a glorious celebration of the most witty, flirty woman to ever grace our TVs

<p>In her heyday, Paula Yates was second only to Princess Diana in the top tier of UK celebs. This documentary shows why everyone fell for her – and why she has never been bettered</p><p>I had forgotten how brilliant Paula Yates was. I had forgotten, if I’m honest, all about Paula Yates – at least on a day-to-day basis, despite her being an almost constant presence on the television screen and in the tabloids throughout my youth. As the new two-part documentary Paula points out, in her 1980s and 90s heyday she was second only to Diana, Princess of Wales in the world of UK celebrity. “I love it when you are on the front page of the paper,” Diana once told her. “It means I’ve got the day off.”</p><p>At first the idea of a documentary about Yates seems somewhere between pointless and exploitative. She was media fodder then – do we have to make her media fodder again now? The documentary is part of Channel 4’s 40th anniversary output, but the peg on which it is hung – the airing of never-before-heard interviews she gave in the two years before she died with the (now) former editor of the Sunday Express and OK! magazine, Martin Townsend – means a slightly grubby pall is cast over proceedings as they begin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/13/paula-review-a-glorious-celebration-of-paula-yates-the-most-witty-flirty-woman-to-ever-grace-our-tvs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sunak sloped off to San Diego for the illegal migration bill’s second reading – so it was down to his cabinet to waste parliament’s time</p><p>You’d have thought the Tories would have wanted to give their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/07/what-does-the-uk-governments-migration-bill-propose">illegal migration bill</a> – insert your own gags – a good send-off for its second reading. But Rishi Sunak chose to be 8,000 miles away in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/11/sunak-heads-to-us-to-unveil-latest-news-on-australian-nuclear-sub-deal">San Diego</a>. Far away from the scene of the crime. And the government also insisted on two ministerial statements – one of them hardly pressing – to delay the debate until late in the day. Almost as if they wanted it over and done with. As it was the government benches were half empty. Most of the saner Tories had decided to give it a swerve. Not brave enough to speak out in the chamber.</p><p>The debate started with a point of order from Labour’s Clive Lewis. The bill came with its own health warning that there was a less that 50/50 chance of the government surviving a legal challenge. So why waste parliament’s time? Surely it would be better to let the courts battle this one out first. Suella Braverman disagreed. Labour hadn’t understood. This wasn’t how it worked. What was going to happen was that the UK was going to kick asylum seekers out regardless of international law. A cunning plan to turn us into a rogue state.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/13/outrageous-slurs-have-been-made-about-suella-some-of-her-own-mps-said-shes-competent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For the right, the BBC has always been a safe space. Now this space is being contested – and it scares the life out of them</p><p>For almost 50 years MI5 had agents embedded at the BBC, vetting job candidates with the specific aim of weeding out prospective left-leaning employees. It was known as the “Christmas Tree” process, after the discreet symbol on a personnel file that would advise executives that a particular individual was to be blacklisted. The practice continued well into the 80s, and until a 1985 Observer exposé was denied at all levels.</p><p>Perhaps this jars a little with the warm and fuzzy image of the BBC that has been bequeathed to us over the generations. This lovable national treasure, informed by the sacred mission of its founder Lord Reith, a humming hive of family entertainment and artistic monuments and the Sports Report theme tune and David Attenborough cuddling gorillas, a place that expresses the best of us and represents all of us. And it strikes me that many of the strong feelings generated by the treatment of Gary Lineker over the past week originate in this ideal: a honeyed, romanticised BBC that has only ever really existed in the imagination.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/mar/13/gary-linekers-treatment-exposes-fact-that-image-of-warm-fuzzy-bbc-was-always-a-lie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ministers want the BBC to do the impossible and patrol of the opinions of every contributor to save the government from scrutiny</p><p>If ministers had wanted their hardline policy on asylum seekers to be seen as a necessary response to a crisis, then they have failed spectacularly. Successive Tory governments have devoted much of their time to <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenjbarnett/status/1634245805946150912?s=20" title="">undermining</a> the capacity of the country’s political culture, media and civil society to oppose them. Firmly in their sights has been the BBC, the most trusted – and most widely viewed – source of news. But the row over criticism by one of the corporation’s best known faces, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/13/gary-lineker-to-return-to-match-of-the-day-after-bbc-suspension" title="">Gary Lineker</a>, of ministers’ “illegal migration bill” has exposed the limits of the government’s strategy.</p><p>While Auntie has been accused of bias from both sides of the political divide, the allegations the BBC leadership have taken most seriously have come from politicians threatening to <a href="https://theconversation.com/bbc-licence-fee-could-scrapping-it-be-the-end-of-public-service-broadcasting-in-the-uk-175292" title="">abolish</a> the licence fee.

But many of the BBC’s best known faces are not permanently employed by the corporation, and when they are offended by events they have tweeted their opinions. Mr Lineker is <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/voices-celebrities-gary-lineker-ever-132327959.html" title="">one of them</a>. The trouble, for Tory ministers, was that he stood up for vulnerable refugees and against their callous policy rather than amplifying rightwing talking points.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/13/the-guardian-view-on-gary-lineker-the-return-of-unabashed-liberal-dissent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Amid toxic political currents in the west, the pontiff ‘from the ends of the earth’ has provided moral leadership beyond the church</p><p>Ten years ago, when Pope Francis addressed St Peter’s Square for the first time, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/13/pope-francis-catholic-reaction-rome" title="">observed</a> that the conclave that elected him went “almost to the ends of the earth” to find a new pontiff. It was a self-deprecating but telling joke – one that signalled that the Argentinian cardinal planned a very different kind of papacy from anything that had come before. Opting to live modestly in a church guest house on the edge of Vatican City – rather than in the papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace – Francis has positioned himself as a kind of outsider pope, a champion of the marginal, peripheral and excluded.</p><p>A decade on, that approach has made him one of the most necessary moral voices of the age. On the key and related issues of troubled times – the chronic refugee crisis, the climate emergency and global economic injustice – the first non-European pope of modern times has provided a powerful defence of universal values.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/13/the-guardian-view-on-pope-francis-10-years-on-a-vital-progressive-voice">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Anne Haynes</strong> on a friendship that has endured from the day she arrived at university in 1968</p><p>Emma Beddington’s article on the phenomenon of lifelong friends (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/08/it-feels-unconditional-the-secrets-of-lifelong-friendships-according-to-lifelong-friends" title="">‘It feels unconditional’: the secrets of lifelong friendships – according to lifelong friends, 8 March</a>), struck an immediate chord. Sue and I met queueing for room keys on arrival at York University in 1968. Fresh from a year in 1960s “swinging London” and exuding cool (or so I thought), I was completely upstaged by her report of working in Italy (Rome definitely trumped London). Lost in awe, I dutifully nursed the lit cigarette that she promptly stuffed into my hand (“Here, hold this!”) as she was called into the bursar’s office ahead of me, and so began almost 55 years of the dearest of friendships – longer than many a marriage (mine included).</p><p>After two years of flat-sharing, our careers took us to opposite ends of the country, but along the way we have made space for weekends, festivals and countless brilliant holidays at home and abroad – in later years with combined, multigenerational families (our daughters are now firm friends).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/13/the-joy-of-a-lifelong-friendship">Continue reading...</a>

It’s usually used only for private events but this gig, curated by Gabriel Prokofiev’s events promoter Nonclassical, invites 200 people to wander around for two hours while a dozen or so musicians play in various parts of the space.</p><p>The Conservatory is a vast, echoey greenhouse, with lots of ambient noise, and it suits some of tonight’s more clamorous compositions. The Abstruckt quartet play an ebullient version of Steve Reich’s Music for Pieces of Wood and some thumpy pieces by David Lang and Andy Akiho for tuned percussion and assorted metal utensils, the sound of which bounce out from around the top terrace. The American sculptor and double bassist Marcus Vergette performs Tintinnabulation, where he and a pianist play a rather beautiful, atonal, written-through composition, one that ripples and resonates with the clattering of four enormous metal bells which Vergette has created.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/13/the-greenhouse-effect-review-barbican-conservatory">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether it’s Hollywood or any other industry, too many men need reminding that women can be good at their jobs even if you don’t fancy them</p><p>‘Ladies, never let anyone tell you you are past your prime,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/michelle-yeoh">Michelle Yeoh</a> told a rapt audience as she accepted her Oscar on Sunday. She made history from a number of directions with the victory – the first woman from an Asian background to win best actress in 95 years, and only the second Asian lead even to be nominated. The first was Merle Oberon in 1936, and there is no better barium meal into the bowels of Hollywood racism than<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/merle-oberon-oscars-best-actress"> Oberon’s life story. </a> but give the place a break: only 87 years later, it’s fine not to be white.</p><p>On the age point, though, Yeoh was thought to be taking a wider swipe at culture as a whole, specifically referring to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/feb/17/don-lemon-nikki-haley-cnn-chris-licht">CNN television anchor Don Lemon</a>, who said last month that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was “past her prime”.

<p>Once I actually got in, the event itself combined TV shoot with fizzy party – surreal yet well-oiled, with nerves, cocktails and surprisingly friendly advice</p><p></p><p>It’s two hours before the Oscars begin, and I am running barefoot down the sidewalk a block from the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. In the multiverse of ways my first trip to the Academy Awards could’ve played out, there was a version where I remembered I had a vehicle pass, my Uber made the correct stop and I wasn’t barricaded from the entrance. (There probably was not a version where Everything Everywhere All at Once, the most nominated film of the evening and by far the most cheered inside the auditorium, didn’t triumph over the ceremony.)</p><p>But that’s not how things went, so I found myself on the wrong side of the theatre and unable to call a car that could reach me. My Saint Laurent heels, sourced from a friend’s mom in New York the day prior – which was less than a day after I learned I was going to the Oscars as a last-minute replacement for a reporter with a visa snafu – are beautiful, but not the best for navigating the sidewalks, fences and crowds around Hollywood Boulevard. This has been written and told to me several times, but it’s still notable – the Oscars are basically held at a mall. One replete with tourists gawking for a glimpse at a celebrity and passersby seemingly confused as to why there are hordes of police cars, but still. It’s a theatre next to a Hard Rock Cafe, not necessarily the glamour you’d expect for Hollywood’s biggest night.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/13/my-first-oscars-from-barefoot-on-the-sidewalk-to-drinks-with-daniel-kwan">Continue reading...</a>

## Talking Horses: Irish being whipped into line could hurt Cheltenham

<p>Irish riders could be forgiven for thinking that the Brits are on their case when the Festival starts on Tuesday</p><p>A modern-day Cheltenham Festival involves 28 races and about 400 horses, supports a significant cottage industry of preview nights in the months beforehand and is the only thing on the mind of most racing fans once the Christmas decorations are packed away, if not before. With so much to consider, it is fair to say no one has seen much need for something new and divisive to argue and fret about in the run-up to the biggest meeting of the year.</p><p>The British Horseracing Authority, however, apparently thinks differently. It could have introduced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/dec/09/talking-horses-whip-splits-sport-again-as-riders-call-new-rules-ridiculous-horse-racing-tips">its new rules on the use of the whip</a> from the start of summer jumping in May or even the start of the Flat campaign on turf at the end of this month and run this year’s Festival as the last under the old regime. Instead, it took a deliberate decision to ensure the new rules would be in place for this year’s meeting, and the wisdom, or otherwise, of that choice will become apparent over the next four days, though it certainly feels as though scarcely a day has passed since the turn of the year without a trainer or jockey criticising the move.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/mar/13/talking-horses-irish-being-whipped-into-line-could-hurt-cheltenham-horse-racing">Continue reading...</a>

## Junior doctors are the workhorses – the backbone – of hospitals | Secret Health Boss

<p>The chief executive of an acute hospital trust in England explains why this week’s strike by junior doctors will have a huge impact and potentially put patients at risk but also why they support their action</p><p>In terms of running an acute hospital, junior doctors being on strike is much more serious – much more impactful – than the recent strikes by ambulance workers. On an ambulance strike day, if someone could get themselves to hospital there was a fully functioning emergency department, with fully functioning specialist medicine departments behind it able to provide the right care. But this time, although hospitals will be open, they’ll be running in a very different way to normal.</p><p>That’s because junior doctors are so vital to hospitals functioning properly. They are integral to the basic medical management of the medical services they work in. I think people misunderstand how important ‘junior’ doctors are and also how skilled they are. They’re not just fresh out of medical school. They are often doctors with 10 years’ experience or more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/13/junior-doctors-backbone-of-hospitals-the-secret-health-boss">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Theatre Royal, Glasgow<br /></strong>David McVicar’s atmospheric production of Puccini’s triptych gains from magnificent performances by Roland Wood and, in her company debut, Sunyoung Seo</p><p>It’s rare to hear Puccini’s Il Trittico, his triple bill of one-act operas, performed as the single work the composer intended. His publisher’s warnings of the commercial risks the project presented were proved right. On its New York premiere in 1918 Gianni Schicchi was an instant hit, but audiences found the musical language of Il Tabarro indigestibly modern, while Suor Angelica was regarded as overly sentimental and too Catholic for Protestant-dominated New York.</p><p>Set in different locations and in sharply contrasting tonal registers, the operas that make up the triptych each centre on the theme of death. This new Scottish Opera and Welsh National Opera co-production, directed by Sir David McVicar, presents the works as three distinct tableaux. While Il Tabarro stays true to the libretto’s pre-first world war Parisian setting, Suor Angelica takes place within the timelessness of a traditional convent, and Gianni Schicchi is located in 1960s Florence – the Duomo is visible through the window behind Buoso Donati’s deathbed, and Hannah Clark’s colourful costumes add to the comedy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/13/il-trittico-review-scottish-operas-vivid-new-staging-has-humour-and-heartbreak">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ever since he had encephalitis as a child, Simon Hattenstone worried that the disease might have caused long-term effects such as memory loss and depression. So, finally, he went for an MRI to find out</p><p>I’ve had doubts about the old grey matter for a long time. Fifty one years to be exact. And now, at the age of 60, those doubts are increasing. When I was a young boy, my brain took a beating. I had been an A1 swot until then – loved school, was a quick learner, and was super independent. At the age of nine, I was racing around the neighbourhood on my bike delivering messages and cakes for my mum. I was fearless. Nothing fazed me. Bury Old Road in Salford was my Route 66 – I’d fly down it on my Chopper, wind in my hair, embracing the freedom.</p><p>Then one day I woke up with a burning headache, high temperature, and an aversion to light and noise (actually pretty much all sound). I lived much of the next two years in darkness. I felt as if my head had caved in, that I was detached from my body, and regressed to a little boy who just wanted to play with baby toys. It was the best part of a year before I was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/encephalitis" title="">encephalitis</a> – inflammation of the brain – a relatively rare but dangerous condition. One in 10 people are still estimated to die from it, and back then misdiagnosis was common.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/13/i-have-a-hunch-i-was-left-damaged-what-would-a-scan-reveal-about-my-brain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Emergency relief must be about money, not well-intentioned donations of goods</p><p>The first time I understood quite how bad emergency relief can be was in the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/tsunami2004" title="">Indian Ocean tsunami</a> in December 2004. From the dockside, first responders fed back stories of containers full of pots and pans with broken handles, soiled clothing and expired medication. As accounts started to come in about quite how unhelpful and time consuming it was, all around me in England church halls and primary schools continued to collect items that they thought might help. The impulse was quite understandable; the unintended consequences grimly depressing.</p><p>The tsunami was a terrifying event on a huge scale. Sadly, in emergency planning and disaster response, such events come around more than we would like.

<ul><li>Australian was approached by Stokes at T20 World Cup</li><li>Returns to role he filled from 2010 to 2015</li></ul><p>David Saker is to work as England’s fast bowling coach throughout the red-ball summer, reprising the role he took during the successful Ashes campaigns of 2010-11 and 2013. The Australian, who is with the white-ball squad in Bangladesh, has agreed a short-term deal after being approached by Ben Stokes during last year’s T20 World Cup.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ll do much Test cricket, but I’m doing the Ashes,” he said. “Ben said: ‘I’d like to get you involved in the Ashes.’ Rob Key had already floated it a little bit, but being so busy I wasn’t sure if I really wanted to do it. Once Stokesy pushed it, it made it an easy decision. I said yes straight away because of the magnitude of the occasion. I’ve been involved in Ashes with both parties and the cricket is as exciting as it gets. It’s the biggest Test event.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/13/david-saker-england-fast-bowling-coach-ashes-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Cardiff International Arena</strong><br />His stagecraft and star quality may still be coming together, but the everyman Bedfordshire singer can still energise a crowd</p><p>Tom Grennan is a hard sell in a world as cynical as this. As family photos scroll on giant screens he climbs into the syrupy Here, having dedicated the song to his mum and dad, who are in the building. “When the sky turns black, I’ll be the light you need,” he sings. It makes a change from saying that dreams can come true, at least.</p><p>When the final chorus hits, confetti rains down in a flash of arena pomp that should be enough to scour away his everyman mask. Instead, it does the opposite: it feels like watching your mate from back home win, and win big. This arena tour is the anointment of the Bedfordshire singer as a proper pop star, five years on from his debut.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/13/tom-grennan-review-cardiff-international-arena">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester United rage over penalty calls, Leah Williamson gives midfield masterclass and Spurs slide towards relegation</p><p>Manchester United’s manager, Marc Skinner, raged over two penalty appeals waved away by the referee, Cheryl Foster, in their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/12/chelsea-manchester-united-womens-super-league-match-report-wsl">1-0 defeat</a> at the WSL champions, Chelsea. “They’re stonewall when I watch them both,” he said. “We have to invest in the officials, we have to invest in the surrounding technology that can help. We’ve come to the champions’ home ground and put our stamp on it – you need those things to go for you.” Skinner also pointed to other incidents this season and warned of the impact of poor decisions on the destination of the title. “It’s the same as what happened in the Arsenal game [against Chelsea in the Continental Cup final], where [Caitlin] Foord goes into the box and Kadeisha [Buchanan] brings her down – it’s a penalty. They need to be picked up, they’re obvious. If they are not obvious we would swallow the medicine and get on with it. We have learned about our resolve and resilience this season; we didn’t crumble. We shouldn’t have to address it, not in big games when we go on to this stage and these are big for what the league looks like in the next eight games. That’s huge decisions.” <strong>SW</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/13/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pravesh Kumar’s clumsy but affectionate comedy about a Punjabi family living in Slough has the makings of a decent sitcom</p><p>Theatre director Pravesh Kumar has written and directed an affectionate comedy about a dysfunctional British south Asian family. It’s a film very much in the tradition of sitcom-ish Brit movies: the comedy painted in broad strokes, warm-hearted but with an unmistakable air of naffness. It just about gets by on sheer likability and warmth for its Punjabi family living in a Slough semi.</p><p>We meet them just as eldest son Raj (Simon Rivers) does a runner after his wedding to Simmy (Rameet Rauli); she’s newly arrived from India, barely speaking a word of English. The marriage has been arranged by Raj’s overbearing mum Gurbaksh (Seema Bowri). To keep up appearances with their nosy neighbours, she confiscates Simmy’s passport and keeps her new daughter-in-law locked up in the house. I did wonder if the film is a bit lighthearted in its treatment of domestic abuse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/13/little-english-review-dysfunctional-punjabi-family-pravesh-kumar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A lighter cake to enjoy at teatime (or at a bar counter with a cappuccino)</p><p>For a few weeks I had an appointment on Wednesdays at 3pm. It was suggested that, while I shouldn’t eat a big lunch beforehand, I could have a light snack that didn’t interfere with having my shoulder manipulated. If I’d been told to eat nothing, it would have been easier: an adjustment to breakfast maybe, an ice-cream or bag of chips after, and thoughts of dinner. But “anything that might interfere with my shoulder” was a question as much as a suggestion. What wouldn’t interfere with my shoulder? Crackers and cheese, yoghurt, ice-cream, banana, a triangle sandwich or a biscuit with a jam filling from the nearest bar?</p><p>One of the many benefits of having a granny who ran a pub was knowing from a young age what a wonderful place a long bar can be. And not just in a pub. It could be at a swimming pool canteen or cafe, or a bar in the Italian sense – a long counter where you have something quick to eat or drink, be alone while in company, have things going on behind the bar to watch and a person to talk to. Or not. Anyway, it was the third or fourth week when I stood at the counter in Bar Paradiso, having a cappuccino and a slice of plain cake. It was perfect, didn’t interfere with my shoulder, and my stomach didn’t rumble. I went back the following week, which was my last appointment. But paradise and cake were by now for ever linked, so when I read about <em>torta del </em><em>paradiso</em>, which has nothing to do with a bar in Rome (it’s typical of Pavia in Lombardia), I decided to make it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/13/torta-del-paradiso-paradise-cake-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

To this day, I still have trouble identifying my identity.”</p><p>This split identity has carried through into 2023, as Heidecker gears up to tour the UK as both comic and musician. His band, the Very Good Band, will be supported by Heidecker playing a bitter and flailing standup comedian.

I was at that awkward age where I worried that if I talked to her I might never stop.” Although he felt a connection, it was years before they formed a friendship. “I spent a lot of time looking lovingly at the back of her head,” he laughs. After middle school, they went to the same high school where they joined the band, choir and theatre group. “I always noticed him and thought he seemed really nice,” Velina says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/13/how-we-met-i-planned-to-break-up-with-him-then-he-proposed">Continue reading...</a>

There’s something a bit uncanny about her; a quiver at the side of her temple, a peculiar stillness of her lip. But if you saw the video in the wild, you might not know that it’s a deepfake fabrication. It would just look like a video, like the opening shots of some cheesy, low-budget internet porn.</p><p>In top right corner, as the video loops, there is a still image of the actress Emma Watson, taken when she was a teenager, from a promotional shoot for the Harry Potter movies. It’s her face that has been pasted onto the porn performer’s.

As if telepathically connected, Raghu responds by gently folding into a heap and quietly placing his head in her lap. It is a miraculous moment that illustrates an astonishingly deep and unlikely maternal bond between a young elephant and his human caregiver. Raghu is at the heart of this documentary directed by Kartiki Gonsalves that uses a tender family dynamic in the middle of an Indian forest reserve to comment on climate change, shrinking animal habitats and our warped perception of the wild.</p><p>“I just found it beautiful that this little family had this unusual bond, especially in a time when we are struggling to coexist,” Gonsalves says over a call from the US. In 2017, while driving back from Bengaluru to her hometown Ooty, a hill station in the Western Ghats of southern India, Gonsalves saw a caregiver giving a young calf called Raghu a bath. That’s when it all began. She did not, however, begin shooting in earnest until she had earned the trust of both Bomman and Bellie, the middle-aged couple looking after young calves on the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/13/elephant-whisperers-director-kartiki-gonsalves-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Updated security strategy and funding boost comes ahead of UK PM’s meeting with US president and Australian PM</p><p>Good morning. <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> is in San Diego in California where today he will meet Joe Biden, the US president, and Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, for an Aukus meeting. Aukus is the Australia/US/UK security pact, primarily focused on providing Australia with nuclear-powered submarine. It was set up when Boris Johnson was prime minister, and now provides him with the material for<a href="https://twitter.com/Tony_Diver/status/1577615972546088960"> one of his most over-used jokes.</a></p><p>The meeting will coincide with the publication of the government’s update (or “refresh”, as it is offically called) to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy">the integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy</a> first published in 2021. Liz Trus ordered the update during her short-lived premiership, because she wanted it to take a tougher line on China. IR23, as the “refresh” is also called by No 10, will be published this afternoon.</p><p>The 2023 integrated review refresh [IR23] confirms that an additional £5bn will be provided to the Ministry of Defence over the next two years, to help replenish and bolster vital ammunition stocks, modernise the UK’s nuclear enterprise and fund the next phase of the AUKUS submarine programme. It follows a £24bn four-year uplift in defence spending in 2020, the largest sustained increase since the Cold War.</p><p>The prime minister will also set out an ambition to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP in the longer term, and the UK will lead a conversation with Allies on future posture and burden sharing at the NATO Summit in Lithuania this summer. We will review defence spending after 2025 in light of this ambition.</p><p>I don’t think it’s kind of smart or sophisticated foreign policy to reduce our relationship with China – which after all is a country with one and a half billion people, the second biggest economy, and member of the UN security council – to just two words.</p><p>That’s why in the integrated review you will see a very thoughtful and detailed approach to China …</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/mar/13/rishi-sunak-defence-spending-uk-us-australia-aukus-summit-joe-biden-anthony-albanese-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

He is in Argentina to atone for failing to protect his B17 crewmates when they are downed near enemy lines.

A chance encounter in a bar with atomic physicist Albert Vogel (Al Pagano) points to where Bach is lying low, but the Mossad operative Leyna Rahn (Corinne Britti) is itching to liquidate the scientist before he can assist Spalding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/13/condors-nest-review-tarantino-esque-nazi-hunt-thriller-heads-for-the-pampas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jadon Sancho struggles in new role, Amadou Onana impresses for Everton and West Ham unsure how to use Gianluca Scamacca</p><p>Fulham were meek against Arsenal: they looked timid and small from the opening moments, the surprise entirely minimal when their visitors put the outcome beyond doubt so quickly. Their tilt at Europe is fizzling out although that should not diminish the excellent work Marco Silva has done in ensuring they do not yo-yo down to the Championship yet again. They badly missed the suspended João Palhinha: he has now missed four games in all competitions this season and Fulham have lost all four, conceding 12 times. Fulham played a blinder in landing him from Sporting and their drop-off without him is a reminder that it will take some time for them to amass the depth of quality that will mitigate such absences. On Sunday they lacked and were unable to get any grip in midfield. At least their next four league games are against relegation contenders: if Palhinha returns with the influence he wielded previously, they can still lever themselves back into the top-six conversation. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/12/fulham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Fulham 0-3 Arsenal</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/11/crystal-palace-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Crystal Palace 0-1 Manchester City</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/11/tottenham-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report">Tottenham 3-1 Nottingham Forest</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/11/leeds-brighton-premier-league-match-report">Leeds United 2-2 Brighton</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/13/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>18 March 1948</strong>: The work of the farm labourer, ditcher, hedger, market gardener or teacher could not go on if it were not for the ordinary safety bicycle</p><p>NORTH LINCOLNSHIRE: “This here Progress, it keeps on,” as HG Wells made Mr <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_in_the_Air">Tom Smallways </a>observe 40 years ago. One must leave it to the philosophers to define “progress.” To most of us it implies the substitution of the new for the old, resulting in the short-circuiting of time, distance, and energy. Thus, on the farms the motor-tractor displaces the horse-drawn plough, the electric torch the hurricane lamp, the rotary pump the hand-worked pump, the motor-mill the windmill, the motorcar the pony and trap, the motor-bus the carrier’s wagon, &amp;c.</p><p>But probably the most revolutionising factor throughout the last half-century has been the ordinary safety bicycle. Electric power is not yet enough for life and work, however potent for death and destruction. Muscle still counts and will continue for long to do so. In Lincolnshire the work of the farm labourer, the ditcher, the hedger, the road-mender, the drainage-worker, the market gardener, the builder, the errand-goer, the policeman, the student, and the teacher could not go on if it were not for the ubiquitous “bike.” I know two octogenarians who use it. A farmer’s wife, who, since the age of 16, has delivered mails for 40 years, makes her morning round on it. Picture the effects of a universal strike of those who use it for work alone!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/13/country-diary-1948-role-of-the-bike-in-rural-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We wonder whether a mortgage should wait while we build up UK bank accounts and credit scores</p><p><strong>Q</strong> Myself and my wife are looking into moving from the EU back to the UK. We currently own a property over here that we are looking to sell and are wondering whether we should rent for a few months when we get back or look to buy straight away? I know that lenders have made a huge cut in the mortgages they are offering, so our thought process is that renting for a few months while we work on building up our credit scores and having income flow into our UK bank accounts could be a more viable option.<br /><strong>WC</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> I think that you and your wife should rent somewhere to live until you have sold your current property in Europe. You are right in thinking that it would be a good idea to build up your credit records – which includes registering to vote – and having proof of a regular UK income before you apply for a mortgage. But it’s also unlikely – but not impossible – that you would be considered for a mortgage if you are both starting new jobs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/mar/13/if-we-sell-our-property-abroad-and-move-back-to-britain-should-we-rent-or-buy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The biological ‘brainwashing’ that happens while you are sleeping is crucial for filtering out toxins. Here’s how to optimise your overnight cycle</p><p>Tonight, and almost every night, something amazing will happen inside your brain. As you turn off the light switch and fall asleep, you will be switching on the neurological equivalent of a dishwasher deep-clean cycle. First, the activity of billions of brain cells will begin to synchronise, and oscillate between bursts of excitation and rest. Coupled with these “slow waves”, blood will begin to flow in and out of your brain, allowing pulses of the straw-coloured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that usually surrounds your brain to wash in and be pushed through the brain tissue, carrying the day’s molecular detritus away as it leaves.</p><p>Most people recognise that if they don’t get enough sleep, their mood and memory will suffer the next day. But mounting evidence is implicating this “brainwashing” function of sleep in longer-term brain health.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/13/the-battle-to-boost-our-deep-sleep-and-help-stop-dementia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Duncan Hess grew up wanting to be an actor, instead becoming a successful director at the BBC. Now he has returned to his first love, and is already walking in the footsteps of the greats</p><p>Duncan Hess spent 40 fulfilling, fascinating years directing for the BBC: “Every news programme there ever was; Antiques Roadshow; I travelled all over making documentaries …” His career culminated with directing the corporation’s coverage of the Queen’s lying in state last September. It was Hess who chose to feature the footage of Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/21/holly-willoughby-and-phillip-schofield-would-never-jump-a-queue-to-see-queen-lying-in-state">scandalised the nation</a>. “They weren’t queue jumping at all!” he says. “They were just walking past.”</p><p>But all that time, Hess had nourished a different dream, one born on a school trip to the RSC in Stratford aged 15 to see a production of <a href="https://www.rsc.org.uk/henry-v/past-productions/in-focus-terry-hands-1975">Henry V</a>. “I didn’t understand Shakespeare particularly but I found the whole experience thrilling. There was a wonderful Welsh actor called Emrys James who did [the chorus’s speech]: ‘Oh for a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention.’ I’m crying thinking about it now.” Galvanised, he wrote to the RSC asking if he could come back and hang around between shows, bagging a community centre floor to sleep on. He returned several times, listening to records of his hero, Laurence Olivier, at night in his sleeping bag after performances.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/13/a-new-start-after-60-my-parents-dissuaded-me-from-acting-but-i-reached-the-national-theatre-at-65">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My sons’ festering protein shake beakers have been living outside for months, part science experiment, part artwork – and don’t forget pure laziness and passive aggression</p><p>After a brief Fool’s Spring, Second Winter is upon us, leaden and inevitable. But, despite the slush, there are cheering hints of colour: I can see a pop of red in the garden from my office window. Is it a tulip? No – it’s the lid from a protein shake beaker. They’ve been living out there for nearly a year. After I fell over yet another one festering next to the sofa with three inches of stinking “plant protein” left to ferment in the bottom, the iron entered my soul. I chucked them all outside, unwisely reasoning that at some point someone would need, retrieve and clean them.</p><p>That never happened, and I have doubled down on my idiocy by just leaving them there. They have now become a garden feature, the kind of thing you notice occasionally, think “I should do something about that,” then ignore. The lids became separated from the beakers and set out on a frolic of their own, rolled by the wind in all directions. I see one beaker is gracing a pot of daffodils; another miraculously appeared on the scaffolding covering the house.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/13/how-long-ignore-revolting-garden-mess">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Narrated by a mathematician, the American author’s antic shaggy dog story may disappoint fans of last year’s The Trees, but he knows exactly what he is doing</p><p>Percival<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/12/percival-everett-id-love-to-write-a-novel-everyone-hated"> Everett</a>, who made his debut in 1983, was little known to UK readers before his 2001 satire <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/erasure-9780571370894">Erasure</a></em>, the intimate tale of an African-American writer’s existential crisis, framed by a ruthless send-up of the racist publishing industry helping to fuel it. But after that success, Everett’s output – restless as well as prolific, riffing on literary theory, Greek tragedy, westerns – largely escaped British attention. Almost none of his books were in print here before he caught the eye of the small independent press <a href="https://www.influxpress.com/dr-no">Influx</a>, publisher of last year’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/31/the-trees-by-percival-everett-review-potent-satire-of-us-racism">The Trees</a></em>, a knockabout cop romp that unearthed the history of lynching via a zombie-tinged revenge scenario involving grisly murders of white people in Trump-era Mississippi. Played for laughs yet deadly serious, it made the Booker shortlist and won the <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/everett-wins-bollinger-everyman-wodehouse-prize-for-comic-fiction-with-powerful-the-trees">Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse </a>prize for comic fiction, a mark of its transgressive genius.</p><p>So for the first time in his 40-year career, Everett has a UK readership anticipating his next book. That it should be <em>Dr</em><em> No</em>, a honeycomb-light chase caper, is the kind of deflationary plot twist that probably tickles him to the marrow. If <em>The Trees </em>owed a debt to the detective novels of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/nov/12/biography.crimebooks">Chester Himes</a>, this is a dizzying shaggy dog story written under the spell of another of Everett’s guiding lights, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/thomaspynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a>, with maths, weapons of mass destruction and mix-ups between pie and pi and CNN and the CIA, as well as starring roles for a backstabbing vice-president named Shilling, someone called Bill Clinton (“not that Bill Clinton”) and the priest from <em>The Exorcist</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/13/dr-no-by-percival-everett-review-something-out-of-nothing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>French Algerian documentary-maker Lina Soualem interviews her grandparents about their marriage and the 1950s immigrant experience in this touching film</p><p>A tender tribute to her Algerian grandparents, who emigrated to the French medieval town of Thiers in the 1950s, Lina Soualem’s touching documentary shows how the act of filming can awaken memories that have long laid dormant. Aïcha, the bubbly matriarch, looks youthful beyond her years, and can’t help but lapse into fits of shy giggles when prodded with questions about love and marriage. Husband Mabrouk is starkly withdrawn in contrast to her infectious warmth. As the couple decide to separate after 62 years of marriage, home videos of family celebrations become even more bittersweet in their fragile vibrancy.</p><p>A familiar face in French cinema, Soualem’s father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinedine_Soualem">Zinedine Soualem</a>, says with a matter-of-fact sadness that Mabrouk never complimented him on the success of his career. Consequently the documentary feels like Lina Soualem’s attempt to break a cycle of generational miscommunication and repression. Unfolding with the gentle casualness of everyday conversation, her interviews with her grandparents not only draw her closer to their personal history but also paint a vivid picture of the hardships endured by Algerian immigrants in 1950s France. Mabrouk, for example, was among countless Algerian young men employed on low wages by a cutlery factory in Thiers. The loud noises resulting from the production of shiny knives and forks would later render many of these workers deaf.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/13/their-algeria-review-docmentary-lina-soualem">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As she stages a new production of The Dead City, Korngold’s wild opera banned by the Nazis, English National Opera’s artistic director Annilese Miskimmon talks about the company’s strong present and uncertain future</p><p>‘I’ve been a bit obsessed with it for a long time,” says Annilese Miskimmon of the opera she’s rehearsing in the studio downstairs. Her words are appropriate: if there has ever been an opera about obsession, then Erich Wolfgang Korngold’s Die Tote Stadt (The Dead City) is it. The opera, completed in 1920 and steeped in the communal sense of loss after the first world war, tells the story of a bereaved husband finally coming to terms with his wife’s death through a hallucinatory experience, after a chance encounter with her doppelganger. Or, as Miskimmon more punchily describes it, “a subconscious psychological thriller about a man who’s in a love triangle with a fantasy sex goddess and his dead wife”.</p><p>It’s quite a synopsis. Yet it’s the equally heady music that drew her to stage the work for her second production as artistic director of English National Opera – a welcome distraction, one imagines, from the current uncertainty over the company’s future, of which more later. Die Tote Stadt was an early hit for Korngold, completed when he was 23; the composer, who was Jewish, would later flee Vienna and find a home in the US, where his sumptuous film scores defined the sound of Hollywood movies for decades to come. The opera was banned by the Nazis yet has made its way back to the edge of the repertoire on mainland Europe and in the US. Still, it waited until 2009 for its first and so far only staging in the UK, at the Royal Opera. “I really wanted to hear our orchestra play it,” says Miskimmon. “It fills the Coliseum in such a way that we can really indulge the sound.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/13/annilese-miskimmon-eno-arts-council-london-dead-city-korngold">Continue reading...</a>
