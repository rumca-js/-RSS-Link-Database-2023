But the extra \u00a35bn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/18/james-heappey-defence-spending-quit-hints\">was less than the \u00a38bn to \u00a311bn that Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, had sought</a>.<br /><br />Rishi Sunak, visiting San Diego, where he was poised to announce a deal to design and build new nuclear-powered submarines with Australia and the US, told the BBC that the latest review was a response to the fact that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2023/mar/13/rishi-sunak-announces-5bn-for-defence-as-uk-faces-volatile-world-video\">the world has become more volatile, the threats to our security have increased</a>\u201d.<br /><br />The prime minister said the review, and the extra \u00a35bn promised, was part of a \u201crecord amount of investments since the end of the cold war\u201d including a previously announced \u00a316.5bn in 2020. Lifting defence spending to 2.5% of GDP was \u201can ambition over time\u201d he added.<br /><br />James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, presenting the full review to the Commons, said that Lammy\u2019s remarks represented a dramatic change of position for Labour when compared to the party\u2019s previous leader Jeremy Corbyn. Cleverly said he was \u201cvery glad to hear Labour frontbench support for the nuclear deterrent and Nato\u201d.<br /><br />Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the defence select committee, also called for rearmament in response to Russian aggression and the rise of China. \u201cWe are sliding towards a new cold war. Threats are increasing but here we are staying on a peacetime budget,\u201d he said, calling for a rapid move to 2.5% of GDP.<br /><br />There also remains frustration in military circles that more was not done to reverse decades of cuts to the army. Of the extra \u00a35bn, \u00a33bn is pledged to help fund the joint Aukus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/13/britain-to-build-nuclear-powered-submarines-for-historic-aukus-pact\">nuclear-powered submarines</a>, not expected until the early 2040s and nearly \u00a32bn to replenish stockpiles of munitions sent to Ukraine.<br /><br />Ed Arnold, a land warfare analyst with the Rusi thinktank and a former infantry officer, said the UK was increasingly unable to meet its commitments to Nato, with its promise to provide a war-fighting division in an emergency.<br /><br />\u201cNato\u2019s defence planning process heavily favours land forces and what the military alliance wants from the UK is a heavy division. At the moment that won\u2019t be ready until 2030. Already the UK has had to pull out a battle group from Estonia because it couldn\u2019t be sustained,\u201d Arnold said.<br /><br />Several European countries have promised to lift defence spending in response to the Russian invasion. Germany expected to announce a \u20ac10bn increase for 2024 while Poland plans to increase its military budget to above 4% of GDP this year.<br /></p><p>As expected, the published document also sought to calibrate a careful line on China, describing the country as posing \u201can epoch-defining and systemic challenge\u201d with implications for all of the UK. But it fell short of describing Beijing as a threat, a demand made by many backbench Conservative MPs.<br /></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/13/labour-accuses-government-of-failing-to-reverse-cuts-in-defence-spending\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/13/labour-accuses-government-of-failing-to-reverse-cuts-in-defence-spending", "date_published": "2023-03-13 20:23:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "title": "Australia news live: Nuclear powered subs deal revealed with $368bn price tag over next three decades", "description": "<p>Anthony Albanese, Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak announce biggest defence materiel agreement for Australia since second world war</p><ul><li><strong>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_sfl\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Daniel Hurst</strong> is out of the Aukus lockup \u2013 here is his first take.</p><p>The main phases of the plan:</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/14/australia-news-live-updates-aukus-submarine-nuclear-defence-albanese-agreement-biden-sunak-meeting-pacific-politics-virginia-class-collins\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/14/australia-news-live-updates-aukus-submarine-nuclear-defence-albanese-agreement-biden-sunak-meeting-pacific-politics-virginia-class-collins", "date_published": "2023-03-13 20:18:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "title": "Aukus: nuclear subs deal will cost Australia up to $368bn", "description": "<p>\u2018Rotational forces\u2019 of US and UK nuclear-powered submarines set to visit Australia from 2027 as part of landmark pact</p><ul><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_sfl\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p>Australia is to embark on one of its most significant, expensive and geopolitically consequential military tasks in a century: the push to acquire, operate \u2013 and eventually build \u2013 nuclear-powered submarines.</p><p>The program is forecast to cost $268bn to $368bn between now and the mid 2050s, most of it beyond the first four-year budget period.
