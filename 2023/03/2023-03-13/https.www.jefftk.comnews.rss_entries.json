[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Decentralized Exclusion", "description": "<p><span>\n\nI'm part of several communities that are relatively decentralized.\nFor example, anyone can host a contra dance, rationality meetup, or\neffective altruism dinner. Some have central organizations (contra has\n</span>\n\n<a href=\"https://cdss.org/\">CDSS</a>, EA has \n\n<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">CEA</a>) but their\ninfluence is mostly informal.  This structure has some benefits (lower\noverhead, more robust) but one drawback is in handling bad behavior.\nIf several people reported very bad experiences with someone at my\nlocal dance \n\n<a href=\"https://www.bidadance.org/safety/approach\">we'd\nkick them out</a>, but that wouldn't keep them from harming others at,\nsay, any of the \n\n<a href=\"https://www.trycontra.com/\">hundreds of other\nevents</a> run by other organizations.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI have seen cases, though, where someone was fully removed from a\ndecentralized community.  Looking at why these cases succeeded and\nothers failed, I think it took:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><p>Clear misbehavior, in a way that nearly everyone would agree if\nthey looked into it.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Detailed public accusations, so people can look into it if they\ndoubt the consensus.\n\n</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThe combination of these means that you can have an initial burst of\n'drama' in which lots of people learn about the situation and agree\nthat the person should be kicked out, and then this can be maintained\nwhenever they show up again.  For example:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>2016: Gleb Tsipursky from the EA community, for a range of\nshady things and a pattern of apologizing and then continuing (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fn7bo8sYEHS3RPKQG/concerns-with-intentional-insights\">details</a>).\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>2017: Jordy Williams from contra dance, after accusations of\ngrooming and rape (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/maren.hurley/posts/pfbid02X3ZYn7qbkrujD4Uit771bWac5Vf2GqrRcwBs45QS5dGQNNN2hgR3nQrzUfjpnSXRl\">details</a>).\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>2018: Brent Dill, from the rationality community after\naccusations of sexual abuse, gaslighting, and more (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@mittenscautious\">details</a>).\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nUnfortunately this approach relies on people making public\naccusations, which is really hard. We should support people when they\ndo and <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/speaking-up-publicly-is-heroic\">recognize their\nbravery</a>, but people will often have valid reasons why they won't:\nfear of retaliation, unwilling to have that level of public scrutiny,\nrisk of legal action. In those cases it's still possible to make some\nprogress privately, and we definitely need to try, but you keep\nbumping into the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/15/23601143/effective-altruism-sexual-harassment-misconduct\">limitations\nof decentralization</a>\nand defamation law.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nTo clarify why I think (1) and (2) are key for community-wide\nexclusion, however, let's look at two cases where this has been tried\nbut was only partially successful.  Within EA I've seen people <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WebLP36BYDbMAKoa5/the-future-might-not-be-so-great?commentId=9pnWvAbjF4DfAxpYZ\">apply\nthis approach</a> to Jacy Reese, but because the details of what he\nwas <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8XdAvioKZjAnzbogf/apology\">apologizing\nfor</a> are vague he's only mostly kicked out and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS/abuse-in-lesswrong-and-rationalist-communities-in-bloomberg?commentId=P3drAXNugLgmwi7Yf\">people\naren't sure how to view him</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe second case is Michael Vassar, in the rationality community (with\nsome overlap into EA).  He's been mostly expelled, but not as clearly\nas Tsipursky/Williams/Dill.  His case had (1) and (2) but not\nentirely:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Some alleged misbehavior was clearly bad (sexual assault) but\nsome was strange and hard to evaluate (inducing psychosis).\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>The sexual assault allegation was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RuffleJax/status/1009625312844550146\">public</a>,\nbut it was in a hard-to-follow Twitter thread, included accusations\nagainst other people, and mixed accusations of many levels of severity\n(assault, distasteful, being a bad partner).  I don't fault the\naccuser for any of this, but as a \"here's a link that explains the\nproblems\" resource it didn't work as well as the three more successful\ncases above.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>The psychosis allegations were even harder to link, scattered\n<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/u8GMcpEN9Z6aQiCvp/rule-thinkers-in-not-out?commentId=JLpyLwR2afav2xsyD\">across</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MnFqyPLqbiKL8nSR7/my-experience-at-and-around-miri-and-cfar-inspired-by-zoe?commentId=4j2GS4yWu6stGvZWs\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MnFqyPLqbiKL8nSR7/my-experience-at-and-around-miri-and-cfar-inspired-by-zoe?commentId=7H37xwFWGbEg8YNK4\">threads</a>\nwith people <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/u8GMcpEN9Z6aQiCvp/rule-thinkers-in-not-out?commentId=KLayjPTG3bbpBc66s\">changing\ntheir minds</a>.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nVassar was widely banned (<a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/why-i-am-no-longer-supporting-reach/\">REACH</a>,\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190927005116/https://slatestarcodex.com/comments/\">SSC</a>),\nbut there were still holes.  For example, he was <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MnFqyPLqbiKL8nSR7/my-experience-at-and-around-miri-and-cfar-inspired-by-zoe?commentId=EcjEBtBRMBCsAZwmR#EcjEBtBRMBCsAZwmR\">invited\nto speak</a> at an online SSC meetup.
