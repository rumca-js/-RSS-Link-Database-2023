"People who've seen Across... have told us that it feels like The Empire Strikes Back of the Spider-Verse franchise," Miller said. "It shows you worlds you haven't seen, and it's an emotional story that ends in a place where you need to see the third one.

<p>Paramount and Entertainment One's upcoming Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is right around the corner and is primed to become a major franchise player. In a new clip released today, we see our band of adventurers, led by Chris Pine's Bard Edgin, up against two other teams in a shifting maze of the Highsun Games. One of those teams should look extremely familiar to Dungeons and Dragons fans.</p><p>The clip shows off several classic D&amp;D monsters, including displacer beasts and a viscous gelatinous cube, but also shows the cast of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon, which ran on TV from 1983-1985. You can check out the full clip below.</p><div>          </div><p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons animated series was a co-production of Marvel Productions and TSR, with the Japanese Toei Animation. It ran on CBS for a total of twenty-seven episodes. The show centered around a group of six friends who are transported into the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons via an amusement park ride. The story followed the team as they tried to find a way home with the help of their guide, the mysterious Dungeon Master, while combating an evil wizard named Venger.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dungeons-and-dragons-clip-features-classic-character-cameos/1100-6512304/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>HBO has announced that the season finale of The Last of Us reached 8.2 million viewers on its first night across HBO Max and traditional TV in the US. That's a new ratings record for first-night viewership.</p><p>HBO also confirmed that Episode 1 from January is now closing in on 40 million viewers in the US alone, while Episodes 1-6 are averaging 30.4 million viewers in total. Outside the US, The Last of Us has become HBO Max's most-watched TV show in Europe and Latin America.</p><p>Viewership for The Last of Us for its premiere grew with every episode. Episode 5 is something of an anomaly, though, as it premiered on HBO Max two days early to avoid a clash with the Super Bowl.

But the network is not going to recast actress Bella Ramsey.</p><p>Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, who is also a writer on the TV series, said during a roundtable interview with press that the only way the team would consider recasting Ellie would be if Ramsey wanted to leave the series.

<p dir="ltr">Marvel has asked a US federal court to issue Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) subpoenas to Google and Reddit in a bid to identify individuals who leaked dialogue from the upcoming film Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/marvel-angry-about-ant-man-dialogue-leak-demands-names-of-reddit-and-google-users/">Ars Technica</a> was first to report.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel alleges that before the film's release in February, dialogue was leaked via a Google Docs file posted on Reddit. Although both links have since been deleted, Marvel is hoping to identify the people responsible, including Reddit moderators whom it suspects may have been involved. The subpoena requests filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California are seeking users' identifying information, including names, numbers, addresses and IP addresses. In addition, Marvel is requesting a report of revisions made to the Google Docs file between December 1, 2022 and February 15, 2023, including all related IP addresses associated with such revisions.</p><p dir="ltr">The subpoena requests follow a separate case in the same court, in which Reddit is fighting demands from several film studios to identify users who posted comments in piracy-related threads. In this instance, Marvel is specifically targeting the Reddit account MSSmods, a shared account for the moderators of the Marvel Studios Spoilers subreddit. Users in the thread discussed the leaked dialogue, with some calling it one of the biggest movie leaks ever or the biggest leak in the subreddit's history.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-seeks-dmca-subpoenas-for-names-of-ant-man-dialogue-leakers/1100-6512300/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Super Mario 64 Speedrunner Collects "Impossible 1-Up" 27 Years After Launch

<p dir="ltr">As one of the most beloved games of all time, Super Mario 64 has been endlessly dissected by fans and speedrunners in the 27 years since release. Now, one runner has conquered one of its final secrets: collecting an "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/11k99d8/tas_for_the_first_time_in_super_mario_64_history/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3'">impossible 1-Up</a>" without dying.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The 1-Up in question is located in Cool, Cool Mountain's slide shortcut, and it's long been thought impossible to collect without dying due to the fact that it immediately falls below the floor when it spawns, seemingly due to developer error. However, in a new tool-assisted (TAS) video, runner PaLiX uses many pinpoint wall jumps and three hours of stored speed to clip through a wall and collect the 1-Up without falling into the pit.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Collecting All 1Ups in Cool Cool Mountain in 1:20.42<br />Yes, even the "Impossible" 1Up... <a href="https://t.co/1nbPw7UCgY">pic.twitter.com/1nbPw7UCgY</a></p>  — Terb (@Terbaigne) <a href="https://twitter.com/Terbaigne/status/1388858597191438342?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">May 2, 2021</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In the above run from 2021, you can see TASer Terb collect all the 1-Ups in the level, leaving the impossible 1-Up for last--and dying in the process. It seems unlikely that this new three-hour strategy will change much in the world of Super Mario 64 speedrunning, but it's interesting to see that it is indeed possible. Now, if a real human somehow manages to perform those wall jumps without the help of save states, we're really in trouble.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-64-speedrunner-collects-impossible-1-up-27-years-after-launch/1100-6512292/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

There are two weapons to grab in the demo, each one being a marked improvement on Leon Kennedy's regular firearm. A shotgun can be found when you're running for dear life, and if you're sneaky enough, you can also get your hands on a tactical machine pistol that can chew through infected villagers. Here's where you can find both of them.</p><h3>Where to find the shotgun</h3><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4111519-vlcsnap-2023-03-13-18h16m04s346.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4111519-vlcsnap-2023-03-13-18h16m04s346.jpg" /></a></figure><p>This one is the easiest if you don't mind running through a horde of bloodthirsty villagers.

During a recent panel, Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi discussed the waning era of the JRPG in the 2000s, stating that he doesn't feel the need to be inspired by Western games.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-castlevania-creators-discuss-rise-decline-revival-of-japanese-video-games">IGN</a>, the panel covered the whole history of Japanese games, from the emergence of Dragon Quest in 1986 to modern-day hits like Final Fantasy XIV. Sakaguchi said that Japanese games dominated the 1980s and 1990s because developers mastered their native hardware, like the NES and PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr">"At the time, people in the West saw pixel art and three-heads-high characters as something for children," Sakaguchi said. "It was frustrating that our games were struggling there, as we wanted to find a way to expand our business.

<p>The next big Zelda game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, is a first for Nintendo as it'll be launching with a $70 price tag instead of the usual $60 that the company's first-party titles sell for. In a new interview, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser explained that the sequel to 2017's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will justify the increase when fans discover how "immersive" the game is.</p><p>"We look at what the game has to offer," Bowser told the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nintendo-bowser-mario-donkey-kong-universal-interview-8aeaa03f3ad4a3032c08c77945a3e787">Associated Press</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-thinks-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-will-justify-its-70-price-tag/">VGC</a>). "I think fans will find this is an incredibly full, deeply immersive experience. The price point reflects the type of experience that fans can expect when it comes to playing this particular game. It's actually a fairly common pricing model either here or in Europe or other parts of the world, where the pricing may vary depending on the game itself."</p><p>$70 first-party games won't be the new standard for Nintendo going forward. After the decision was made to price <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-says-70-switch-game-pricing-will-be-evaluated-on-a-case-by-case-basis/1100-6511366/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Tears of the Kingdom at $70</a>, a spokesperson added that the company will examine the retail price of its titles on a "case-by-case" basis.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-will-be-worth-its-70-price-tag-nintendo-president-says/1100-6512284/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">In a new interview, Dwayne Johnson reflected on the DC Universe overhaul that derailed his plans for a Black Adam-Superman crossover movie. Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/dwayne-johnson-henry-cavill-dc-exit-superman-black-adam-2-1235552230/">Variety</a>, Johnson opened up about how he's come to peace about how Black Adam performed at the box office and his current standing within the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">"All that I can do, and all that we could do when we were making Black Adam, was to put our best foot forward and surround ourselves with the best people and deliver the best movie we could," Johnson said. "Our audience score was in the 90s. Critics took a couple shots, but that's just the business of it."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the film's success with audiences, Black Adam failed to hit the $400-million mark at the global box office. After the movie's release, new DC Studios bosses James Gunn and Peter Safran were announced as the new architects of the DC Universe, effectively killing Johnson's hopes and plan for a Black Adam-Superman crossover.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dwayne-johnson-on-black-adam-and-planned-superman-crossover-movie-we-did-our-best/1100-6512286/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Roblox developer Roblox Corp. has revealed it had $150 million in cash parked at Silicon Valley Bank, the banking institution that recently folded, but the studio is not worried about a negative impact on its business.

<p>The PS5 comes with a built-in 825GB SSD, but only about 667GB of that space is actually usable. And if you’ve been steadily adding games to your library since the console launched in 2020, you’re probably bumping up against your storage limits. Thankfully, there’s an impressive sale going on for a <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B09Q2MW21F?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">PS5-compatible SSD,</a> </span> which adds 1TB of space to your console for just $85, down from $185.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B09Q2MW21F?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div><p>There’s a <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/">long list of requirements</a> SSDs need to meet in order to support PS5.

<p dir="ltr">HBO's The Last Of Us show has proven a huge success, drawing in an audience of millions of viewers.

The show was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbos-the-last-of-us-renewed-for-season-2/1100-6510940/">renewed for Season 2</a> back in January, after its series premiere became the second-biggest debut ever with 22 million viewers, a number that has no doubt increased dramatically since then. Star Pedro Pascal told Collider that there's a chance that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-could-start-filming-this-year/1100-6511948/">second season</a> will enter production this year, though it's far from certain.

## Dead Island 2 Ditches The Open World, But Ramps Up The Gore

<p dir="ltr">It wasn't until two hours or so into my seven hours with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a> when I finally understood that the linear nature of the game wasn't just part of the tutorial, and that Dambuster Studios' game wasn't going to eventually swing its proverbial doors open and reveal to me the sandbox I was looking for. Action-RPGs, especially zombie-centric ones, have so often utilized an open-world setting over the past 15 years that it was, for a good while, jarring to see that Dead Island 2 isn't actually the latest in a long line of them. That took some mental remapping of what this game is going to be, and while I do find the smaller scope disappointing, it's not without its benefits too.</p><p dir="ltr">In my hands-on time with the game, I visited several areas, including the disgustingly wealthy Bel-Air, a dilapidated but probably once five-star hotel, and a formerly proud movie studio. Sometimes the way these areas would snake around surrounded by unclimbable walls felt very restrictive, closer to a game as tightly set as BioShock rather than even the original Dead Island's large hubs. While this is a much more linear game than its predecessors, there are many optional nooks in each area. I encountered many locked rooms, safes, and loot caches that would each require further investigating or even backtracking, some of which wasn't possible in my limited demo. These side attractions, be they puzzles or just temporarily inaccessible, gave me the sense that, though the world was narrower, it was also sometimes deeper.</p><p dir="ltr">A great example came about an hour into the game, when I trekked down the Hollywood Hills and found myself in a luxurious home/studio belonging to a media group of online influencers--rich Gen Z kids with podcasts, basically. I had to pass through this as part of the main campaign, but I could do just that--find the key and move along. Instead, I explored the space and found a lot of environmental storytelling that felt deeper than anything in the original game, and perhaps deeper than this game could've had if it hadn't ditched the sandbox.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-ditches-the-open-world-but-ramps-up-the-gore/1100-6512175/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Much like its predecessor, the Sega Genesis Mini 2 is a stellar mini console. Due to its exclusivity to Japan, the Genesis Mini 2 has somewhat flown under the radar since launching last fall. Sega fans who are interested in the console should definitely take a look at Amazon today. The retailer is selling the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4D19JJ4?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sega Genesis Mini 2 for $88.10</a></strong> (plus $22.30 shipping), which is the lowest price we've seen. The shipping cost is high because you're importing from Japan.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4D19JJ4?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p><p>It's worth noting that Sega only manufactured 10% of the stock versus the original Genesis Mini. Though it's a bit surprising to see it available again months after launch, we wouldn't be shocked if the console becomes hard to find for a reasonable price soon.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-genesis-mini-2-gets-rare-price-cut-at-amazon/1100-6506652/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>HBO's The Last of Us writer Neil Druckmann has revealed that after the release of the first The Last of Us game, there was talk of making a spin-off featuring Ellie's mom, Anna.</p><p>In a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-merle-dandridge-season-1-finale-marlene-spoilers/1100-6512262/">conference call</a> with press, Druckmann and showrunner Craig Mazin discussed Episode 9, and the return of original The Last of Us actor Ashley Johnson, who played Ellie in the games. In the series finale, Johnson plays the role of Ellie's mom Anna in flashbacks, who is pregnant with Ellie at the time.</p><p>Druckmann revealed that after Naughty Dog wrapped the first game, there was an idea for an animated short featuring Anna, and he even wrote a "short" script about how she gave birth and was bitten at the same time, but wasn't certain if Ellie became infected too. "It just became a little character drama that felt like it spoke to the same themes of parental love for their child and how much you're willing to do even when you're on death's door," Druckmann said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-was-almost-a-last-of-us-spin-off-game-from-a-different-studio-about-ellies-mom/1100-6512277/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>In Naughty Dog's The Last of Us video game, main character Ellie is immune to the cordyceps fungal infection that caused a pandemic that propelled the world into chaos and despair. Ellie is immune to the infection, but why, and how? The game never provides an answer, but the Season 1 finale of HBO's series provides clues, it seems, to the origin of Ellie's immunity. <strong>Spoilers for The Last of Us follow below.</strong></p><p>In the Season 1 finale, we get a flashback that shows Anna (Ashley Johnson), pregnant with Ellie, trying to outrun an infected person, only to be cornered in an abandoned house and attacked. She kills the infected, and during the struggle, gives birth to Ellie. Anna is bitten during the encounter.</p><p>Anna cuts the umbilical cord, but the show leads us to believe the cordyceps infection was indeed spread to Ellie. Marlene (Merle Dandridge) soon arrives on the scene. Anna pleads with her to kill her and take Ellie, assuring Marlene that she gave birth <em>before </em>she was bitten--this is a lie.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-is-ellie-immune-in-the-last-of-us-season-1-finale-provides-a-hint-but-still-no-answers/1100-6512273/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>With the Season 1 finale of HBO's The Last Of Us hitting similar story beats from the game, the episode finally brought to life one of that world's most enigmatic characters: Anna Williams, Ellie's mom.

<p dir="ltr">Don't hold your breath that the next season of HBO's The Last of Us will change up things to address criticism regarding the sequel to the video game. Series co-creator Neil Druckmann isn't concerned with the Part 2 feedback whatsoever.</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't care," Druckmann told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-finale-ending-explained-interview">GQ</a> when asked about how a minor segment of players strongly disliked how the story unfolded in The Last of Us: Part 2. "How they react is how they react, that is completely outside of our control. So how do we make the best TV show version of that story? That's the problem that we wrestle with every day."</p><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us show co-creator Craig Mazin followed up Druckmann by mentioning that at least the audience is emotionally invested. "To the extent that the storylines move people to rage, confusion, or disappointment, or anger," Mazin said. "Well that, I suppose, is preferable to the worst possible outcome, which is indifference."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-on-negative-criticism-over-the-last-of-us-part-2-i-dont-care/1100-6512272/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

If you’re itching to collect every Apogee Repeater, this guide details their locations across Neomuna.

<p>The Sega Saturn used to only be a plug-in home device, but no longer. Thanks to modder TZMWX, fans can now see what the 64-bit system would look like if it transformed into a portable console. TZMWX dubbed their invention the Sega Uranus, riffing on the planet-themed name that Sega used for the original console.</p><p>On March 8, TZMWX tweeted the demo for their Sega Uranus prototype, which they had been working on for months. Their Twitter timeline shows the steady progress they put into the build, including a <a href="https://twitter.com/TZMWXdiyer/status/1623270874030968832?s=20">digital model</a> from last month before the prototype came to fruition and the process of <a href="https://twitter.com/TZMWXdiyer/status/1616239142685536257?s=20">trimming the Sega Saturn</a> motherboard.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">“URANUS” prototype<br />😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣🥲☺️ <a href="https://t.co/PwAs7JxD2W">pic.twitter.com/PwAs7JxD2W</a></p>  — TZMWX (@TZMWXdiyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/TZMWXdiyer/status/1633649954156843008?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">March 9, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>TZMWX created the Sega Uranus using the Sega Saturn motherboard as a base.

<p>HBO's The Last of Us has wrapped up its first season, and the finale played out very similarly to the game, which means it was controversial and heavily debated online. Series star Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel, has commented on the ending, as has writer Craig Mazin. <strong>Spoilers for The Last of Us follow below.</strong></p><p>Just like in the game, Joel chooses to save Ellie (Bella Ramsey) instead of allowing the Fireflies to conduct a medical procedure on her that would kill her but potentially save humanity by creating a cure. Joel proceeds to viciously murder lots of foot soldiers in the hospital, the doctor who was going to conduct the procedure, and then Marlene (Merle Dandridge) before escaping with Ellie. Pascal said Joel was motivated to choose Ellie over choosing to save humanity because after losing his daughter Sarah (Nico Parker), he could not lose Ellie.</p><p>"What would make one choose one thing over the survival of humanity, essentially? He finds himself incapable of losing again," Pascal said in the behind-the-scenes video below. "It's this beautiful shadow and one can explore and question, find the horror and the humanity of."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pedro-pascal-discusses-the-last-of-us-season-1-finale-and-joels-choice/1100-6512271/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">It's always good when there's a brand-new Scream movie in theaters and this weekend is no different. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/scream-6-review-ghostface-takes-manhattan/1900-6418043/">Scream VI</a> is in theaters now, featuring Ghostface slashing his way around New York City, taunting the core four survivors from the last film--along with returning favorites Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) and Kirby Reed (Hayden Panettiere). And just like every other Scream movie, the unmasking of Ghostface in the movie's final act is as bonkers as you'd expect.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: The following contains spoilers for the end of Scream 6. If you've yet to see the movie, look away now.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, it's revealed that the killers in Scream 6 were a family affair. More specifically, the family of one of the killers of Scream (2022), Richie Kirsch (Jack Quaid). Richie's dad Wayne (Dermot Mulroney, brother Ethan (Jack Champion), and sister Quinn (Liana Liberato), have gone to extreme lengths to exact vengeance on the core four who survived the previous year's massacre. So extreme that the gang–and viewers in the audience–were convinced Quinn was dead earlier in the movie at the hands of Ghostface. It's all an elaborate ruse to allow them to carry out their carnage on the core four, though--especially Sam (Melissa Barrera), who was Richie's girlfriend and who, herself, is the daughter of original Scream killer Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scream-6-directors-break-down-killer-reveal-and-movies-ending/1100-6512265/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">And just like that, the Season 1 finale of HBO's The Last of Us has come to a close. The first nine episodes of the series stuck pretty close to the events of the 2013 game, with some important changes along the way to deepen character development. In the end, though, those of us who have played The Last of Us know how it has to end. And even with some added context in the Season 1 finale, the series beautifully landed the story's conclusion.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: The following contains spoilers for the Season 1 finale of The Last of Us, as well as the events of The Last of Us Part II. If you haven't seen the episode yet or don't want to be spoiled on the 2020 game, turn away now.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">A true standout in this final episode is a returning Marlene (Merle Dandridge), who not only got pivotal moments with Pedro Pascal's Joel throughout the episode but was also explored via her own flashback, which is an incredibly important piece of her story--and allowed for the return of a fan-favorite performer from the games.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-merle-dandridge-season-1-finale-marlene-spoilers/1100-6512262/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
