It makes arms controls experts nervous because it sets a precedent that could be used by others to hide highly enriched uranium, or plutonium, the core of a nuclear weapon, from international oversight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/13/aukus-australian-submarine-nuclear-loophole-proliferation-fears">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Oval showdown in June will provide a fascinating postscript to India’s Border-Gavaskar series victory</p><p>In 2017, Australia’s Test team came home from India after four Tests with a 2-1 defeat. In 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/13/india-win-series-2-1-after-fourth-test-with-australia-ends-in-a-draw">the scoreline was the same</a>. In the first series, the tourists made the better of a turning pitch to win a shootout, fumbled a game they had in their keeping, batted the last day to see out a draw and had a loss by a substantial margin. This time around they started with a big loss, had their fumble in the second match, won the shootout in the third, and batting out the draw to finish it off.</p><p>The results don’t merit rejoicing, but with India having lost three matches and won 36 in more than a decade, the fact that Australia’s tours have produced two of these wins is worth some satisfaction. The sequence of results meant that 2017 was a story of taking a lead and being reeled back in, while 2023 surrendered the chance of a series win in five days, but fought back from that low with unlikely tenacity. It’s a matter of opinion which scenario would leave losing players feeling better about the situation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/13/tenacious-australia-recover-to-offer-hope-for-world-test-championship">Continue reading...</a>

## Ligue 1 relegation battle shows it pays to be decisive if sacking a manager | Eric Devin

<p>Montpellier, Reims, Nice and Auxerre reacted quickly when their coaches were failing, but Strasbourg dithered</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_">Eric Devin</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>Football clubs are often indecisive when the stakes are high. Too often they dither over transfers, dropping players who have lost form, or dismissing managers. The dangers of this approach has been on show in Ligue 1 this season, where the relegation of four clubs rather than the usual three has made the need for success even more acute than usual. Ligue 2 is a particularly difficult division to bounce back from, as St-Étienne are discovering. Having been relegated from the top flight last season, they are now 13th in the second tier.</p><p>With other clubs understandably concerned about facing a similar fate, they have been quick to fire managers. Eleven bosses have lost their jobs since the start of the campaign. In October alone, five clubs sacked managers – Lyon, Auxerre, Brest, Reims and Montpellier – mostly due to concerns about relegation. Montpellier are on their third manager of the season and Angers have a vacancy following the resignation of Abdel Bouhazama last week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/13/ligue-1-relegation-battle-clubs-montpellier-reims-nice-strasbourg-auxerre">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh<br /></strong>Katie Posner directs a high-voltage cast in playwright Ahlam’s politically charged portrayal of a group of teens coming of age in post-Arab spring Cairo<strong><br /></strong></p><p>We view momentous events as distant observers. In an uprising, we see the flags, the occupations and the street battles and get a general sense of cause and effect. What is harder to gauge is how it feels to live through such turbulence, not just on the days of insurrection, but in the months and years on either side.</p><p>One of the strengths of You Bury Me, by the dramatist known only as Ahlam, is in its portrayal of everyday life during extraordinary times. A recipient of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/01/first-womens-prize-for-playwriting-winners-ahlam-amy-trigg">2020 Women’s Prize for Playwriting</a>, it is set in the Cairo of 2015, but repeatedly harks back to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2021/jan/25/how-the-arab-spring-unfolded-a-visualisation">Arab spring of 2011</a>. Crucially, it focuses on a group of teenagers, including the boisterous Maya (Yasemin Özdemir) who was 13 at the time of the demonstrations in Tahrir Square and is now turning 18. She and her peers have been shaped, in their formative years, by a volatile combination of hope, fear and despair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/13/you-bury-me-review-teen-rage-and-romance-in-the-age-of-intolerance">Continue reading...</a>
