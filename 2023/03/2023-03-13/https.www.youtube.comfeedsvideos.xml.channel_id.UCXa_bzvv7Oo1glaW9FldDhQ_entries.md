The Last of Us is one of the many hallowed PlayStation exclusives that PC players couldn't experience since it first debuted in 2013. However, on March 28th, they'll finally get the opportunity when The Last of Us Part 1 launches for PC. 

Currently available for PlayStation 5, this is a remake with improved visuals and several new features while retaining the core gameplay and story of the original. Let's take a spoiler-free look at 15 things you should know before buying.

In case you missed it, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League had an extended gameplay showing at Sony's recent State of Play. We got to see the co-op and more of the combat, which I dubbed “a whole lot of jumping and shooting.” Coming from the developer behind the Batman: Arkham series, it was confusing at best and underwhelming at worst. Not only was this three months before its worldwide launch, but the last major news drop was that Kevin Conroy would reprise Batman in his final performance.

If the gameplay showcase wasn't bad enough, Rocksteady released a behind-the-scenes video, showcasing everything fans didn't want to see. A Battle Pass, an in-game store with microtransactions, a live-service approach, loot and Gear Score systems - the hits just kept coming. There would also be post-launch content updates that would add new playable characters for free. All this for $70 and no loot boxes. How could people not celebrate?
