As in late February, another west coast atmospheric river, or \u201cPineapple Express\u201d, will bring rainfall and mountain snow to California and Oregon. Rain and mountain snow is expected to become more widespread and intense overnight and into Tuesday as an area of low pressure moves east, clearing through Wednesday.</p><p>Several feet of snow is expected to accumulate in the Sierra Nevada mountains by Wednesday evening, with the highest areas seeing up to 12 ft (3.66 metres).

Annilese Miskimmon of the opera she\u2019s rehearsing in the studio downstairs. Her words are appropriate: if there has ever been an opera about obsession, then Erich Wolfgang Korngold\u2019s Die Tote Stadt (The Dead City) is it. The opera, completed in 1920 and steeped in the communal sense of loss after the first world war, tells the story of a bereaved husband finally coming to terms with his wife\u2019s death through a hallucinatory experience, after a chance encounter with her doppelganger. Or, as Miskimmon more punchily describes it, \u201ca subconscious psychological thriller about a man who\u2019s in a love triangle with a fantasy sex goddess and his dead wife\u201d.</p><p>It\u2019s quite a synopsis.

Die Tote Stadt was an early hit for Korngold, completed when he was 23; the composer, who was Jewish, would later flee Vienna and find a home in the US, where his sumptuous film scores defined the sound of Hollywood movies for decades to come. The opera was banned by the Nazis yet has made its way back to the edge of the repertoire on mainland Europe and in the US. Still, it waited until 2009 for its first and so far only staging in the UK, at the Royal Opera. \u201cI really wanted to hear our orchestra play it,\u201d says Miskimmon. \u201cIt fills the Coliseum in such a way that we can really indulge the sound.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/13/annilese-miskimmon-eno-arts-council-london-dead-city-korngold\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/13/annilese-miskimmon-eno-arts-council-london-dead-city-korngold", "date_published": "2023-03-13 06:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018I hope I haven\u2019t killed anybody\u2019: the pacifist author fighting on Ukraine\u2019s frontline", "description": "<p>Vlad Beliavsky dreamed that his new psychology book would help end wars.
