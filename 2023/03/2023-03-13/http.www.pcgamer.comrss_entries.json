That, but on an alien planet\u2019s frozen moon, whose topside we also haven\u2019t documented and is ram-packed with unspeakable, harmful things. And what\u2019s scarier than both of those things? Being stuck in a submarine with other people.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s the setup, more or less, to hardcore multiplayer sci-fi submarine survival sim <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/602960/Barotrauma/\" target=\"_blank\">Barotrauma</a>. You and a team of 15 other players - or AI, since there is a singleplayer mode too - descend the depths of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, keep the sub operational, moving between underwater biomes to complete missions and fend of the aforementioned unspeakable, harmful things. You communicate. You delegate. You each work diligently in your assigned roles, and you complete the missions as a team.\u00a0</p><p>I mean, presumably that\u2019s happened at least once since Bartrauma released in Early Access in 2019. I don\u2019t have the figures in front of me, but even though it\u2019s got over 2.5 million players, I think it\u2019s safe to say that 99.99991% of play sessions have not turned out that way. In reality, Barotrauma is a game about the most outlandish, chaotic and hilarious sabotage, subterfuge and skullduggery ever committed below sea level. It\u2019s got a little bit of Among Us about it in that way, if Among Us was a grindhouse horror where crewmates injected each other with deadly parasitic viruses that paralysed and muted them.\u00a0</p><p>Now that the full release has arrived, players have the chance to check out new tutorials and and a totally overhauled campaign, replete with a scripted event system. Like there wasn\u2019t already enough to worry about down here with some guy singing to you while simultaneously holding a shotgun to your face, and giant shrimp-like creatures destroying the deck below you.</p>\n<figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\"><div class=\"image-full-width-wrapper\"><div class=\"image-widthsetter\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top: 56.23%;\"><img align=\"middle\" alt=\"Barotrauma\" class=\"expandable\" height=\"1439\" id=\"HShchmJKDMuBpV3FqshzYb\" name=\"01.png\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HShchmJKDMuBpV3FqshzYb.png\" width=\"2559\" /></p></div></div><figcaption class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\">(Image credit: Daedalic)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Graphics and environments have also been polished considerably over the course of Barotraum\u2019s Early Access phase, leading to a V1.0 that looks genuinely unsettling, moody, and distinct from just about anything else out there. Light and darkness are the key theme here, visually: light is a rare commodity down in the waters of a frozen moon, and awful, awful things happen outside it.\u00a0</p><p>Barotrauma\u2019s community is closely involved in the game\u2019s development, all the way along. Lead developer Joonas Rikkonen had been toying with the idea of making a totally unscripted, sandbox-style experience in the vein of Dwarf Fortress, and first put a playable public build live way back in 2016. It was the encouraging player response to that build that led to Rikkonen taking a job at Finnish studio Fakefish to continue its development.\u00a0</p><p>Barotrauma\u2019s Discord community is now more than 30,000 members strong. Their feedback has shaped the game over the last four years, and they\u2019ve been active in expanding on the game\u2019s framework, too. Fakefish made the source code and all the dev tools used to create the game available to that community, which has spawned quite the modding community. Its Steam Workshop has 60,000+ different entries. I\u2019ve yet to find one that stops me being terribly frightened. Fakefish have included one of those player-made ships in this 1.0 release of the base game, as part of a community competition.\u00a0</p><p>Also new to players who haven\u2019t submerged since v1.0 arrived are explorable outposts, wrecks of other submarines and improved alien ruins. There are more monsters and missions out there, and character progression goes deeper thanks to a talent system. Barotrauma\u2019s full 1.0 release is <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/602960/Barotrauma/\" target=\"_blank\">available now on Steam</a>.</p>\n

there&apos;s purple hell mist filled with monsters that come for us each night. To fix this, they&apos;re making the wizards do a spell that deletes magic from existence forever. Now you just have to keep them alive for the days of uninterrupted casting it&apos;ll take to pull it off.</p><p>That&apos;s the metal as hell setup for The Last Spell, a tactical RPG roguelite that has you in control of an all-too-small band of heroes whose job it is to defend a crumbling city and its mages against the onrushing hordes of mutants, demons, zombies, and demon zombie mutants. Every day you spend resources to build up the town and level up your heroes, while every night you fight off a horde of monsters to the last gasp. When you lose, well, you&apos;ve earned upgrades for next time.</p><p>It&apos;s a pretty cool setup, where movement and positioning are just as important as damage, and squeezing all the potential you can out of every last action point is vital to survive. The characters you recruit, meanwhile, are very customizable. Skills are determined by weapon held, so there&apos;s not so much classes as specializations in different pieces of equipment backed up by stats. Finding good combos of weapon and role is part of the fun.</p><p>The Last Spell was developed by <a href=\"https://ishtar.games/\" target=\"_blank\">Ishtar Games</a>, who previously developed <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/dead-in-bermuda/\" target=\"_blank\">Dead in Bermuda</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/dead-in-vinland-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Dead in Vinland</a>.
