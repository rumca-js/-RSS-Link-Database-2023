Between <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jane-fonda-view" target="_blank">literal calls to murder</a> against pro-lifers, to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shumirun-nessa-jeffrey-marsh-dox" target="_blank">doxing innocent people on TikTok</a>, plus the looming possible financial crisis...I think we could all use a break. So let's sit back and watch a dog video, shall we?</p><p>A Southern California lifeguard recently rescued a tiny <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dog-salad-meat-lady" target="_blank">dog</a> in the ocean, and the whole event was caught on video. </p><p>The near-drowning happened this past Saturday evening. The pup was apparently running around in the water a lot, and by the time the lifeguards got there, he had begun his voyage out to sea. One of the lifeguards promptly put on his wetsuit, grabbed his rescue board and buoy, and jumped to the rescue. The dog made it all the way to the swim line before a nearby boat crew was able to assist the lifeguard in the rescue. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The video was shared on the Long Beach fire Department's Facebook and shows the lifeguard paddling with the tiny, terrified white dog on his board. The Fire Department explained in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LongBeachFD/videos/219707293906081/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>,<em> "</em><em>At approximately 6:00 pm, Long Beach Lifeguards were called for a dog running loose in the Junipero Lot. When Lifeguard Units got on the scene, the dog had run out to the ocean and started swimming out to sea. LifeGuard 7 put on his Wetsuit, grabbed his rescue board and bouy, and headed out to rescue the small white lap dog."</em></p><p><em>"The little dog made it out to the swim line, and with Rescue Boat 2’s help, LG7 could get the dog on the rescue board and bring it safely to shore."</em></p><p>The Fire Department was originally unable to find the owner. But yesterday, they announced the pup had been successfully reunited with its owner. Hopefully, this is the last time he tries to swim without his floaties. <br /></p>

## Florida democrat's tweet about Ron DeSantis, "butt plug porn" gets hit with greatest Community Notes of all time

What follows is the greatest self-own in the history of politics. Or if you want to dial back the hyperbole, at least Top 5. It involves Ron DeSantis and butt plug porn.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

DeSantis is banning pornography that is available in Florida schools. Democrats and the media (again, repeating) who support and encourage pornography in schools <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/desantis-reporter-protest" target="_blank">have been lying that DeSantis is banning all books</a>, leaving out the pornography part. The video gives examples of the ACTUAL books that are being removed from schools.</p><p>Nikki Fried, the Chairwoman of the Florida Democrat Party, blew up their spot by sharing a photo of a book available in elementary schools and admitting that it is porn. FURTHER DRIVEN HOME by the Community Notes now added to her tweet:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>As my <a href="https://twitter.com/treyradel/status/1635277151145693185" target="_blank">second favorite Florida conservative Trey Redel said</a>, Fried recognized that a book made readily available to kids in public schools is - using her word here - porn. So really it's: "Fried posting porn to own the cons."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="c89ab" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33265134&amp;width=980" />

## WATCH: Woke Mob Doxes And Threatens Daughters Of TikToker Who Dared to Call Out Jeffrey Marsh

Shumirun Nessa on TikTok called out Jeffrey Marsh for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/young-fan-patreon" target="_blank">questionable, possible-grooming behaviors</a>. After widespread backlash, she initially doubled down and brought receipts. But now, the attacks are dramatically worsening. </p><p>Nessa tearfully explained in a video how she is being doxxed and her children are being threatened: <em>"So I just got an email saying, pretty much a threat, saying they know where I am. And what scares me the most is they have got my daughters' details on the email. Like what time I leave to drop them to school, pick them up. And it's not a coincidence because, both of my daughters, they go to two different schools. So they know." </em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">None</div> —  (@)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpNetwork/status/1634993025855418370"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>She also said her car has been damaged, and she has received threatening videos and emails. She went on the explain that, because of the threats to her daughters' safety, she no longer wants to talk about Jeffrey Marsh and has since deleted everything. </p><p><em>"Don't come to my house [...] You guys want me to say I'm sorry? Fine, I'm sorry. Please, don't come to me, don't come to my house, don't do anything to me, because I'm just one person [...] Some of you have found old pictures of me and uploaded it on TikTok without my hijab [...] Please don't continue this, I'm sorry, please don't come for my kids."  </em></p><p>On the plus side, most of the comments on her video are very supportive and sympathetic, with a lot of people urging her to go to the police: </p><p><em>"Go to the police, IMMEDIATELY. We love you, you are an amazing person"</em></p><p><em>"DO NOT BE SORRY...call the police and let them see the email...emails can be found out where they came from...do it for your protection"</em></p><p><em>"I’m sorry this is happening… time to get the authorities involved!"</em></p><p>There were a few negative Nellies who claimed she was lying and, if the threats really happened, she would have gone to the police. But Nessa cleared this up and explained that she had, in fact, already gone to the police:</p><p><em>"For everyone asking, I did go to the police and showed them the email; they said they will investigate it. They also advised me to delete all the videos and not respond to anyone who is writing to me like this." </em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="5d2a6" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33264327&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p><br /></p><p>So it seems that the mob got what they wanted, in that she'll stop making videos about Jeffrey's concerning behavior. But on the bright side, the police will hopefully be able to bring justice and peace of mind for Nessa and her family. </p>

And it's not a coincidence because, both of my daughters, they go to two different schools. So they know." </em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

        <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpNetwork/status/1634993025855418370"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>She also said her car has been damaged, and she has received threatening videos and emails. She went on the explain that, because of the threats to her daughters' safety, she no longer wants to talk about Jeffrey Marsh and has since deleted everything. </p><p><em>"Don't come to my house [...] You guys want me to say I'm sorry? Fine, I'm sorry. Please, don't come to me, don't come to my house, don't do anything to me, because I'm just one person [...] Some of you have found old pictures of me and uploaded it on TikTok without my hijab [...] Please don't continue this, I'm sorry, please don't come for my kids."  </em></p><p>On the plus side, most of the comments on her video are very supportive and sympathetic, with a lot of people urging her to go to the police: </p><p><em>"Go to the police, IMMEDIATELY. We love you, you are an amazing person"</em></p><p><em>"DO NOT BE SORRY...call the police and let them see the email...emails can be found out where they came from...do it for your protection"</em></p><p><em>"I’m sorry this is happening… time to get the authorities involved!"</em></p><p>There were a few negative Nellies who claimed she was lying and, if the threats really happened, she would have gone to the police. But Nessa cleared this up and explained that she had, in fact, already gone to the police:</p><p><em>"For everyone asking, I did go to the police and showed them the email; they said they will investigate it. They also advised me to delete all the videos and not respond to anyone who is writing to me like this." </em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p><br /></p><p>So it seems that the mob got what they wanted, in that she'll stop making videos about Jeffrey's concerning behavior. But on the bright side, the police will hopefully be able to bring justice and peace of mind for Nessa and her family. </p>

## WATCH: Gov. Whitmer Admits  Banning Gardening to Fight Covid Didn't Make Any Sense. Three Years Later.

<p>I had no idea she even did this until now. This probably isn't something she should keep reminding people of. But I'm glad she did, since now we can all reflect on what an absolute tyrant she is. </p><p>Back in April of 2020, the state <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicksibilla/2020/04/16/michigan-bans-many-stores-from-selling-seeds-home-gardening-supplies-calls-them-not-necessary/?sh=414de3a35f80" target="_blank">banned</a> many stores from selling seeds, soils, plants, and other gardening supplies. Whitmer explained the reasoning, <em>“If you're not buying food or medicine or other essential items, you should not be going to the store." </em></p><p>What, you peasants wanted something to do outside while the state forced you to stay home for months on end? You wanted to develop a wholesome hobby, like gardening? Think again. There's a respiratory virus in town.

But the fact she thought she could do it in the first place speaks to her insane superiority complex. And much worse were her COVID nursing home policies and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ready-release-the-numbers-demands-for-gov-whitmer-to-release-full-covid-nursing-home-death-count-intensify" target="_blank">subsequent refusal</a> to release the undisclosed COVID-19 nursing home death count in Michigan.  </p><p>Michigan, next election cycle, <em>please</em> elect a new governor.

## Dad turns himself in for murder after "finishing off" sex offender with moose antlers ... wait, moose antlers?

Finishing one off with moose antlers is quite a flair for the dramatic. The rub is we're not sure if he got the right guy.</p><p>Picture it. Minnesota, 2023. <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/11/minnesota-dad-kill-elderly-sex-offender-with-moose-antler/" target="_blank">Per the New York Post</a>, a guy walks into a Minnesota police station covered in blood. Levi Axtell drops to his knees and confesses to beating Lawrence Scully to death with a shovel. But not before “finished him off” with a moose antler. Where he finished him off with the moose antler is unclear.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="4315a" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33264035&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>This is where the story gets murky. Scully was in fact convicted of molesting a 6-year-old girl in 1979. That makes him worthy of shame and ridicule for the rest of his days. However, the report doesn't state if there was another incident that led to him getting antler'd.</p><p>Axtell and Scully had a long history of beef, and Axtell accused Scully of "'stalking' and 'attempting to groom' his then-toddler daughter at her daycare by parking his van at the facility."</p><p>There were other, recent allegations against Scully. However, the sheriff claims <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/11/minnesota-dad-kill-elderly-sex-offender-with-moose-antler/" target="_blank">to the Associated Press</a> that they “didn’t reveal anything” and that most of the reports were “regarding harassment.”</p><p>Axtell after his confession was arraigned for second-degree murder. Why second and not first degree? That is an excellent question and I'm assuming there is more of the story to be revealed. Had Axtell caught Scully with his daughter, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/crowder-heated-cain-velasquez" target="_blank">his reaction to the convicted pedo is understandable</a>. Maybe not in a legal sense. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/forced-dig-grave" target="_blank">But in a street justice sense</a>.</p><p>We'll know more when Axtell next appears in court on April 10th.</p><p><p>

## Watch As This Actress, Who's Apparently 'Past Her Prime,' Absolutely Torches Don Lemon in Oscars Speech

But I was pleasantly surprised to wake up this morning and see that a jab was thrown at our favorite CNN morning host, Don Lemon. </p><p>Actress Michelle Yeoh, who was in Crazy Rich Asians and Avatar 2, accepted the Best Actress award for her role in Everything Everywhere All At Once. During her acceptance speech, she said, <em>"Dream big, and dreams do come true. And ladies, don't let anybody tell you you're ever past your prime." </em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>Yeoh is actually 60 years old, which I find shocking. She looks amazing. Her comment is obviously a reference to that time Don lemon <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/don-lemon-cnn-poppy-harlow" target="_blank">claimed women shrivel up and lose all value after the age of fifty,</a> then had to undergo<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/don-lemon-formal-training" target="_blank"> "how-not-to-offend-women" training</a> at CNN. </p><p>You may be asking, how did our pal Don respond to this jab? And I'm here to tell you, he didn't. He completely ignored it. This morning on CNN, Lemon said, "“this is a huge night for Asian and Asian Americans" as they discussed the film Yeoh starred in. He also said it was "especially re-affirming" for Asian Americans. But no mention of the jab. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p><em> “The moment that I related to the most is when Ke Huy Quan said' my 80-year-old mother is at home watching.' He said, ‘Look, Mom! I won an Oscar!’ You can’t help but tear up at that moment and relate to it.”</em><br /></p><p>But again, no mention of Michelle's jab. Just a bit of virtue-signaling about the race of the actors. CNN contributor Nischelle Turner also joined the discussion to say she hopes the Oscars continue to recognize more actors of color. Which I have no problem with, as long as the actors deserve the awards based on their performances. Irrespective of their race, or whether they're past their "prime" age. According to Lemon, of course. </p>

## "The Office" actor blasts Hollywood's anti-Christian bias ... at least for now

Christians tend to have opposing political opinions than Hollywood. Hollywood hates and loathes anyone who disagrees with whatever their opinion is that week. It's only shocking when an actor without the last name Cameron speaks out against it. That's what makes Rainn Wilson's milquetoast tweet noteworthy,</p><p>Wilson was watching HBO's <em>The Last of Us</em> and noted, "I do think there is an anti-Christian bias in Hollywood. As soon as the David character in “The Last of Us” started reading from the Bible I knew that he was going to be a horrific villain. Could there be a Bible-reading preacher on a show who is actually loving and kind?"</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I do think there is an anti-Christian bias in Hollywood.

Of course. Will there be? Not anymore. The Bible-reading preacher character may have, at some point in his backstory, held a traditional Christian belief. Even acknowledging traditional Christian beliefs exist let alone doing so without adding the word "sucks" is cause for Twitter hate. And Twitter hate by randos is a driving factor in art.
