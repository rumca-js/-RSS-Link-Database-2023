<p><span>

I'm part of several communities that are relatively decentralized.
For example, anyone can host a contra dance, rationality meetup, or
effective altruism dinner. Some have central organizations (contra has
</span>

<a href="https://cdss.org/">CDSS</a>, EA has 

<a href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">CEA</a>) but their
influence is mostly informal.  This structure has some benefits (lower
overhead, more robust) but one drawback is in handling bad behavior.
If several people reported very bad experiences with someone at my
local dance 

<a href="https://www.bidadance.org/safety/approach">we'd
kick them out</a>, but that wouldn't keep them from harming others at,
say, any of the 

<a href="https://www.trycontra.com/">hundreds of other
events</a> run by other organizations.



<p>

I have seen cases, though, where someone was fully removed from a
decentralized community.  Looking at why these cases succeeded and
others failed, I think it took:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Clear misbehavior, in a way that nearly everyone would agree if
they looked into it.

</p></li>
<li><p>Detailed public accusations, so people can look into it if they
doubt the consensus.

</p></li>
</ol>



<p>

The combination of these means that you can have an initial burst of
'drama' in which lots of people learn about the situation and agree
that the person should be kicked out, and then this can be maintained
whenever they show up again.  For example:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>2016: Gleb Tsipursky from the EA community, for a range of
shady things and a pattern of apologizing and then continuing (<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fn7bo8sYEHS3RPKQG/concerns-with-intentional-insights">details</a>).

</p></li>
<li><p>2017: Jordy Williams from contra dance, after accusations of
grooming and rape (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/maren.hurley/posts/pfbid02X3ZYn7qbkrujD4Uit771bWac5Vf2GqrRcwBs45QS5dGQNNN2hgR3nQrzUfjpnSXRl">details</a>).

</p></li>
<li><p>2018: Brent Dill, from the rationality community after
accusations of sexual abuse, gaslighting, and more (<a href="https://medium.com/@mittenscautious">details</a>).

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

Unfortunately this approach relies on people making public
accusations, which is really hard. We should support people when they
do and <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/speaking-up-publicly-is-heroic">recognize their
bravery</a>, but people will often have valid reasons why they won't:
fear of retaliation, unwilling to have that level of public scrutiny,
risk of legal action. In those cases it's still possible to make some
progress privately, and we definitely need to try, but you keep
bumping into the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/15/23601143/effective-altruism-sexual-harassment-misconduct">limitations
of decentralization</a>
and defamation law.

</p>

<p>

To clarify why I think (1) and (2) are key for community-wide
exclusion, however, let's look at two cases where this has been tried
but was only partially successful.  Within EA I've seen people <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WebLP36BYDbMAKoa5/the-future-might-not-be-so-great?commentId=9pnWvAbjF4DfAxpYZ">apply
this approach</a> to Jacy Reese, but because the details of what he
was <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8XdAvioKZjAnzbogf/apology">apologizing
for</a> are vague he's only mostly kicked out and <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS/abuse-in-lesswrong-and-rationalist-communities-in-bloomberg?commentId=P3drAXNugLgmwi7Yf">people
aren't sure how to view him</a>.

</p>

<p>

The second case is Michael Vassar, in the rationality community (with
some overlap into EA).  He's been mostly expelled, but not as clearly
as Tsipursky/Williams/Dill.  His case had (1) and (2) but not
entirely:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Some alleged misbehavior was clearly bad (sexual assault) but
some was strange and hard to evaluate (inducing psychosis).

</p></li>
<li><p>The sexual assault allegation was <a href="https://twitter.com/RuffleJax/status/1009625312844550146">public</a>,
but it was in a hard-to-follow Twitter thread, included accusations
against other people, and mixed accusations of many levels of severity
(assault, distasteful, being a bad partner).  I don't fault the
accuser for any of this, but as a "here's a link that explains the
problems" resource it didn't work as well as the three more successful
cases above.

</p></li>
<li><p>The psychosis allegations were even harder to link, scattered

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

Vassar was widely banned (<a href="http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/why-i-am-no-longer-supporting-reach/">REACH</a>,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190927005116/https://slatestarcodex.com/comments/">SSC</a>),
but there were still holes.  For example, he was <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MnFqyPLqbiKL8nSR7/my-experience-at-and-around-miri-and-cfar-inspired-by-zoe?commentId=EcjEBtBRMBCsAZwmR#EcjEBtBRMBCsAZwmR">invited
to speak</a> at an online SSC meetup.  With the publication of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-03-07/effective-altruism-s-problems-go-beyond-sam-bankman-fried?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTY3ODIwNjY2MiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4ODExNDYyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJSUjVBRzVUMEFGQjQwMSIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIzMDI0M0Q3NkIwMTg0QkEzOUM4MkNGMUNCMkIwNkExNiJ9.nbOjP4JQv-TuJwoXaeBYhHvcxYGk0GscyMslQFL4jfA">Bloomberg

will stick.
