<p>Brave has expanded its browser/firewall/VPN service, known as Brave Firewall + VPN, to Windows with the release of Brave 1.49, the company said Monday.</p>



<p>Brave, of course, is typically known for its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398351/brave-10-review-this-excellent-privacy-focused-browser-can-make-you-money-too.html">privacy-centric browser</a>, which has existed for several years. Recently, it expanded into VPN services, though just for Android and iOS. Today, Brave&rsquo;s Firewall + VPN service can now run on top of Windows and MacOS for $9.99 per month or $99.99 annually. Each subscription supports up to five devices in total. (If you already subscribe to the mobile service, you can simply add your PC.)</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1534539/google-one-adds-vpn-service-to-its-1-99-basic-tier.html">Google recently said</a> that the company would add its VPN by Google One for all Google One subscribers. Brave&rsquo;s offer works a bit differently. For one, Brave isn&rsquo;t supplying its own VPN itself; instead, it&rsquo;s working with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dnsfilter.com/guardian&amp;xcust=2-1-1656327-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Guardian</a> to provide its VPN. Google&rsquo;s VPN also didn&rsquo;t allow you to select from any other regions, thus preventing you from sampling Netflix options in foreign countries; Brave&rsquo;s browser VPN does, though it&rsquo;s not clear how flexible those options are. </p>



<p>Google&rsquo;s connection to its VPN works across the operating system, with what Google calls a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://one.google.com/about/vpn/howitworks&amp;xcust=2-1-1656327-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;blinded&rdquo; interface</a> that prevents the network from identifying the client. Brave&rsquo;s VPN service doesn&rsquo;t collect identifying information, including cookies, nor logs it, but the VPN is confined to the browser&mdash;sort of. </p>



<p>When Brave Firewall + VPN connects to the internet, the browser hides your personal information while surfing within the browser. While Brave Firewall + VPN can hide your identity outside the browsers, within other apps, you&rsquo;ll need to turn off what&rsquo;s known as the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/11973307463181&amp;xcust=2-1-1656327-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Smart Multi-Homed Name Resolution Feature</a> for additional privacy. </p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what this is, don&rsquo;t worry: &ldquo;The problem only affects apps&nbsp;<em>outside</em>&nbsp;of Brave; as long as you use Brave VPN, your activity within the Brave browser is protected even with Smart Multi-Homed Name Resolution in place,&rdquo; Brave says.</p>



<p>Brave, however, said it believes its combination of services offers close to, if not absolute privacy: The Brave browser blocks ads and trackers, the firewall blocks incoming attacks, and the VPN helps preserve your anonymity from ISPs and other services. If you want other, more flexible options for a VPN, however, you can check out our list of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">best VPN services</a> as well as our list of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/634025/best-free-vpns-for-windows.html">the best free VPNs</a>. </p>

<p>Does the Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra justify its $300 price tag? That was our question, and undoubtedly yours as well. Our answer? If you own an older laptop, absolutely. But the 4K-capable Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra also offers a noticeable upgrade compared to even the latest webcam hardware. You&rsquo;ll look like a pro while using this camera.</p>



<p>Razer&rsquo;s Kiyo Pro Ultra claims to offer DSLR-like image quality, and its massive 2-inch-diameter lens certainly reminds you of that right out of the box. In practice, the webcam holds up to its claims. Simply be aware that it doesn&rsquo;t do quite everything, and one shortcoming in particular might leave you wondering why.</p>



<p>Most of the devices we feature in our list of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html">the best webcams</a> step down considerably in price&mdash;as does this webcam&rsquo;s predecessor, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394156/razer-kiyo-pro-review-one-of-the-best-webcams-out-there.html">1080p, $199 Razer Kiyo Pro</a>. The Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra is for those people who want to look like they&rsquo;re on a professional-quality YouTube stream, with the camera presenting you at your best. What this webcam <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> do, however, is offer Windows Hello capabilities via a depth camera, so you&rsquo;ll have to use your PC&rsquo;s default mechanism to log you in. (We have a list of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394379/windows-hello-webcams-you-can-buy-right-now.html">the best Windows Hello webcams</a>, too.)</p>



<h2 id="razer-kiyo-pro-ultra-features">Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra: Features</h2>



<p>From a features standpoint, the Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra can record in various video resolutions up to 4K: 4K at 30 FPS (4K30), 1440p30, 1080p60/30/24, and 720p60/30. Images are captured at up to 8.3 megapixels, which is just about smartphone quality. The field-of-view varies between 72 degrees and 82 degrees, depending on the resolution. Manual pan and zoom are available. The camera also provides options to record video in HDR, though your frame rate will slip by an undisclosed amount if you choose this option, Razer warns. The Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra also includes a microphone capable of recording at 16bit/48KHz, though you&rsquo;ll probably find that a good laptop&rsquo;s stereo mics sound better.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra 4K webcam is the webcam to buy to stand out from the crowd. You&rsquo;ll look like a Hollywood star who accidentally joined your work&rsquo;s Zoom call.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>You will need to install the Razer Synapse app to control the webcam, however, which requires roughly a 550MB download. (The app also controls any other Razer hardware you may own.) You don&rsquo;t need to register the Razer Synapse app, which saves your settings to the cloud, in order to use it; simply agree to sign in as a guest instead. Razer also allows you to download a &ldquo;virtual ring light&rdquo; app, which uses your monitor as a source of white light to illuminate your face. Just make sure that you set your video options in Teams/Zoom/Google Meet to use the appropriate camera, and select the best audio, too. (We&rsquo;d recommend using Zoom&rsquo;s &ldquo;test microphone&rdquo; feature in the settings to compare both mics.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra webcam shutter" class="wp-image-1654845" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230310_143817.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra can sit by itself as a standalone camera. The weight of its attached USB cable (detached here) tends to drag it about, however. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Kiyo Pro Ultra measures about 3 inches deep, depending on how the camera is oriented. The lens mount is well designed; the adjustable L-shaped joint simply hooks over the front of your laptop display or monitor. </p>



<p>Though chunky, the camera is not particularly heavy, so you shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about your display tipping over. An ordinary clamshell laptop, however, will probably struggle to hold up the camera without the display reclining involuntarily, unless you position the screen to counterbalance it. A tablet with a kickstand shouldn&rsquo;t have any trouble. In general, however, clipping the Kiyo Pro Ultra to the top of a monitor positions the camera at eye level or slightly facing down, which helps maintain eye contact.</p>



<p>In the case of a laptop, the clip also folds back to serve as a standalone mount, or you can even screw it in to an ordinary camera mount. A 4.9-foot (1.5m) braided cable connects the camera (USB-C) to your PC (USB-A). Be warned, however, that Razer asks you to use a 10Gb/s USB-A port to connect the camera; an older 5Gb/s USB-A port (found on older PCs) won&rsquo;t offer enough bandwidth. Consult your PC&rsquo;s manual if you&rsquo;re not sure.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the removeable transparent plastic protector that the Kiyo Pro Ultra shipped with didn&rsquo;t obstruct the lens while providing scratch protection. However, the webcam also ships with a dedicated lens cover that can be fitted to the front of the webcam. That serves as one privacy option when not in use, and you can also use a separate privacy dial on the webcam&rsquo;s barrel to close a physical shutter. Just be aware that the small white LED on the camera itself indicates that it&rsquo;s receiving power, and <em>not</em> that the webcam is in use. Close the webcam shutter, and the LED will remain lit.</p>



<h2 id="razer-kiyo-pro-ultra-video-quality">Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra: Video quality</h2>



<p>For better or worse, high-resolution cameras with good color capabilities have become synonymous with YouTube streamers, the news, and more. They connote an air of professionalism, authority, and celebrity, and there&rsquo;s a bit of a thrill to see your own face in the same light. In 2020, we highlighted the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/399101/why-microsofts-surface-cameras-are-a-compelling-feature.html">webcams on the Microsoft Surface lineup</a> as some of the best in the business, with 1080p resolution and solid color balance and contrast. The Pro Ultra easily puts them to shame&mdash;its camera sensor&nbsp;features a 2.9 &mu;m pixel size, capturing 3.9x more light compared to other webcams, Razer claims.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra webcam good shot" class="wp-image-1654860" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/camera-3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>An image showing both the preview image as well as some of the options offered by the Razer Synapse software. (The library I was at was undergoing renovations.)</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Put simply, this webcam is outstanding. Colors pop, though not overwhelmingly, and there are image presets (including &ldquo;cool,&rdquo; warm,&rdquo; and &ldquo;vibrant&rdquo;) if you want to emphasize these. Many laptop webcams have a sort of gauzy, ghosty effect, in part because of the lower resolution, slower frame rate, and poor color balance. You&rsquo;ll see none of that here. You&rsquo;ll look alive and authoritative. Just keep in mind that any videoconferencing app you use may lower the resolution or compress the stream, so you may look a bit worse. </p>



<p>The camera had no problem auto-focusing on me (or my son, when he poked his head within a few inches of the camera) and handled odd lighting situations very well, including backlit lamps that blew out a comparatively poor 1080p webcam on another laptop. Maybe because I&rsquo;m used to a certain &ldquo;look,&rdquo; turning on HDR didn&rsquo;t do anything for me and arguably made the image worse.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra webcam bokeh" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1800" id="1654858" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/camera-shot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="2880" /><img alt="HP Pavilion x360 Convertible 14 (dw0097nr)" class="image-compare__image-after" height="1080" id="1654849" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/camera-shot.png" width="1920" /></div><figcaption>An extreme example, but one worth showing: I mounted the Razer Kiyo Pro on top of 2020&rsquo;s HP Pavilion x360 Convertible 14, a consumer laptop which offered a 720p webcam. The difference is striking. </figcaption></figure>



<p>All of the Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra&rsquo;s controls are found within the Synapse <em>Streaming</em> tab at the very top: All of the options are generally well organized under <em>Camera</em>, though you&rsquo;ll find the resolution and frame rate inexplicably tucked inside the <em>Processing</em> tab.</p>



<p>Many of the available options you can leave on the default settings, and there are a ton of them: everything from low-light compensation to dynamic noise reduction to lens distortion compensation and more. You probably won&rsquo;t want to adjust any of the <em>Image</em> settings for brightness, contrast, etc., at all.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra webcam bokeh" class="wp-image-1654857" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bokeh-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This looks like a smartphone selife, but it&rsquo;s not. And there&rsquo;s even the natural bokeh blur effect in the background.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The main <em>Camera</em> settings, though, are where you&rsquo;ll have the option of selecting how autofocus works, whether it&rsquo;s passive or active, and how the camera adjusts for lighting on your face or just the scene itself. </p>



<p>About the only obvious omission is a section on top of the <em>Camera</em> tab, which offers manual pan and zoom. According to the settings, the camera can zoom up to 4X (digitally, it appears). When zoomed, the camera can be panned left and right. What we&rsquo;re left wondering is, if the camera can already track your face to adjust the lighting, why can&rsquo;t it pan and zoom automatically, too? Webcams in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html">Surface Pro 9 (5G)</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499055/samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-review.html">Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Book3 series</a> use hardware AI to achieve this via Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows Studio Effects, and so does the <a class="product-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B098R165KF&amp;xcust=2-1-1654613-1-925137-11245&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394759/dell-ultrasharp-4k-webcam-price-specs-features.html">Dell UltraSharp Webcam (WB7022)</a>, this camera&rsquo;s closest competitor. It almost seems like something Razer might even add in a firmware update, though that&rsquo;s just speculation on our part.</p>



<p>With all that said, Razer&rsquo;s Kiyo Pro Ultra is a superb webcam, one that we&rsquo;d wholeheartedly recommend. Just consider it an investment, and one that isn&rsquo;t absolutely <em>quite</em> as professional as we&rsquo;d like.</p>

## HP printers still block third-party ink. These models have a workaround

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>HP&rsquo;s &ldquo;dynamic security&rdquo; prevents you from using third-party ink with HP printers. While HP does this to &ldquo;protect the quality of our customer experience,&rdquo; being able to buy cheaper, non-HP ink can save you money. So how can you use third-party printer ink? We have a solution for at least some models.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, HP&rsquo;s dynamic security isn&rsquo;t new. HP began the practice of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/410401/firmware-update-for-hp-printers-bans-third-party-ink.html">banning unauthorized printer ink in 2016</a> with a firmware update that prevented third-party ink from being used. That hasn&rsquo;t stopped consumers from being outraged that they can&rsquo;t do what they want with printers they purchased, and buy whatever third-party ink cartridges they want to use.</p>



<p>Last week, the topic of HP dynamic security surfaced again when users on Reddit <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/11l4kne/hp_have_updated_their_printers_to_outright_ban/&amp;xcust=2-1-1656073-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">discovered</a> (or re-discovered) the fact that HP uses what is essentially digital-rights-management (DRM) on its printers to identify authentic HP printer ink cartridges and prevent unauthorized cartridges from being used. Ars Technica <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/customers-fume-as-hp-blocks-third-party-ink-from-more-of-its-printers/&amp;xcust=2-1-1656073-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">noted</a> the issue, pointing out that HP is currently facing a class-action lawsuit over the issue as consumers attempt to legally prevent HP from blocking third-party ink.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card">      <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/11l4kne/hp_have_updated_their_printers_to_outright_ban/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share&amp;xcust=2-1-1656073-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">HP have updated their printers to outright ban &lsquo;non-HP&rsquo; ink! They no longer shows the &ldquo;can&rsquo;t guarantee quality&rdquo; message, but instead cancels your print completely until you inset a HP ink cartridge. After contacting HP, they advised &ldquo;this is due to the recent &lsquo;update&rsquo; of all printers&rdquo;</a> from      <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/&amp;xcust=2-1-1656073-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">assholedesign</a>    </blockquote>    
</div></figure>



<p>HP maintains that it&rsquo;s doing this for your benefit, but also freely admits that it&rsquo;s trying to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; its own technology. </p>



<p>&ldquo;The purpose of dynamic security feature is to protect HP&rsquo;s innovations and intellectual property, maintain the integrity of our printing systems, ensure the best customer printing experience, and protect customers from counterfeit and third-party ink cartridges that do not contain an original HP security chip and infringe HP&rsquo;s intellectual property,&rdquo; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.hp.com/za-en/product/hp-officejet-pro-6830-e-all-in-one-printerserie/5390307/document/c05308850&amp;xcust=2-1-1656073-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">it says</a>.</p>



<h2 id="hp-printers-that-use-dynamic-security-to-block-third-party-ink-cartridges">HP printers that use &ldquo;dynamic security&rdquo; to block third-party ink cartridges</h2>



<p>HP doesn&rsquo;t make clear which printers use the dynamic security feature, which is what Reddit users became infuriated about &mdash; HP apparently had permitted the use of third-party ink on the OfficeJet 7740 and the OfficeJet Pro 6970, then cracked down. But HP does list some printers which can be upgraded via a firmware update to eliminate the block on third-party ink. </p>



<p>Even those, however, fall into two categories: printers whose dynamic security feature can be disabled, and printers whose dynamic security feature is permanent.</p>



<ul><li><strong>HP printers with dynamic security that can be disabled:</strong> HP OfficeJet 6810, 6820, OfficeJet Pro 6230, 6830, 8610, 8620, 8630, 8640, 8660, X451dn/dw, X476dn/dw, X551dw, and X576dw printers. </li><li><strong>HP printers with dynamic security that can be disabled depending on the date of manufacture: </strong>HP Officejet Pro 6970, 7740, 8210, 8700, Officejet 6950, PageWide 300, 400, and 500 printers. The key is the manufacturing date. If the printer was manufactured before Dec. 1, 2016, dynamic security can be disabled via a firmware update. If the printer was manufactured after that date, however, dynamic security can not be disabled.</li></ul>



<p>Unfortunately, that still leaves a number of other HP printers that don&rsquo;t allow for the firmware workaround &mdash; and HP won&rsquo;t say which printers that applies to.</p>



<p>To eliminate HP&rsquo;s block on third-party ink, you&rsquo;ll need to visit the printer&rsquo;s Software and Drivers Downloads page. There, you&rsquo;ll find instructions on how to upgrade the printer firmware. When that&rsquo;s completed, HP says, you&rsquo;ll be able to use third-party ink with that printer.</p>



<p>HP still won&rsquo;t accept blame for whether or not the process works, however. &ldquo;If the cartridge still fails after the feature is removed, then the cartridge is most likely defective and should be returned to your retailer,&rdquo; HP says. </p>

## Custom Intel Arc graphics cards receive huge price cuts

<p>Mere weeks after Intel sliced the price of its home-grown <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499123/intel-slashes-arc-a750-price-to-249-touts-substantial-gaming-improvements.html">Arc A750 graphics card to $250</a>, instantly propelling it into our list of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">best GPUs for gaming</a>, the rest of the Arc family is seeing some massive discounts too&mdash;but not from Intel. Instead, it&rsquo;s custom board maker ASRock making the latest cuts.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-a380-a750-and-a770-8gb-gpus-price-slashed-a380-now-listed-for-120&amp;xcust=2-1-1655894-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Videocardz</a> and others, ASRock&rsquo;s custom versions of the Arc A380 and more potent Arc A770 are both available on steep sale. The ASRock A380 costs just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/asrock-arc-a380-a380-cli-6g/p/N82E16814930076&amp;xcust=2-1-1655894-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$120 at Newegg</a>, down from $140, while the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/asrock-arc-a770-a770-pgd-8go/p/N82E16814930077&amp;xcust=2-1-1655894-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">8GB ASRock Arc A770 is currently $270</a>, a $50 discount from its usual $320 price.</p>



<p>The savings make Intel&rsquo;s debut consumer GPUs much more appealing, especially the ASRock Phantom Gaming Arc A770. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html">substantially faster than the $250 Arc A750</a> for just $20 more, and much cheaper than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 it beats in DirectX 12, ray tracing, and cutting-edge AV1 encoding. Now that Intel has managed to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1500230/intels-arc-gpu-drivers-show-major-improvement-for-cod.html">smooth out Arc&rsquo;s initial driver issues</a>, the Arc A770 is mighty compelling at this price&hellip;if your computer supports <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394720/faster-gaming-frame-rates-for-free-resizable-bar-explained.html">PCIe Resizable BAR</a>, that is. Arc&rsquo;s performance tanks on older systems.</p>



<p>The entry-level Arc A380, on the other hand, offers more value for content creators than pure gamers thanks to its exceptional AV1 and QuickSync-powered H.264 encoding capabilities, which you won&rsquo;t find in comparably priced Nvidia and AMD graphics cards.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/827992/tested-intel-arc-av1-video-encoder-vs-nvidia-amd.html">deep-dive into the Arc A380&rsquo;s AV1 chops</a> goes into much greater detail. Here&rsquo;s the gist, though: &ldquo;The future of video streaming is very bright, and significantly less blocky.&rdquo; If you want GPU-accelerated AV1 encoding, picking the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/asrock-arc-a380-a380-cli-6g/p/N82E16814930076&amp;xcust=2-1-1655894-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">ASRock Arc A380 up for just $120</a> is a no-brainer.</p>

## How to fix stick drift on the Steam Deck

<p>If there are two words that strike fear into the heart of every gamer, they&rsquo;re &ldquo;stick drift.&rdquo; This dreaded hardware failing on analog sticks has been the bane of many a controller, notably the Nintendo Switch&rsquo;s Joy-Cons, and unfortunately it&rsquo;s a rare but confirmed issue for the Steam Deck as well. Stick drift happens when you&rsquo;re not touching the analog stick at all, but it still transmits &ldquo;movement&rdquo; to the game. </p>



<p>But since Valve has made the Deck so friendly to user modifications, there&rsquo;s a solution. A third-party parts supplier called GuliKit is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7L4H3ZM&amp;xcust=2-1-1655730-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">selling inexpensive hall effect analog sticks</a> for the Steam Deck. The hall effect design replaces parts that physically contact each other with a series of magnets and sensors, making them far more long-lasting and &mdash; yes! &mdash; immune to the stick drift problem. </p>



<p>If you have a few bucks, the right tools, and a little courage, you can replace the default Steam Deck analog sticks with these upgraded ones. PCWorld contributor Keith May shows us how on our latest YouTube video. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Before you start, you&rsquo;ll need a few basic tools. Get a spudger, a series of guitar picks, or some other means of gently prying the case apart &mdash; a pocket knife will do in a pinch, but it&rsquo;s not ideal. You&rsquo;ll also want a Phillips-head screwdriver (cross, not flat) and a pair of tweezers. (Incidentally, you can get all of these in an iFixit tool kit, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/424342/9-awesome-gifts-for-nerds.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">one of our favorite gifts for nerds.</a>) A <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/443031/for-the-high-tech-tinkerer-we-pick-10-incredibly-useful-tools.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">soldering iron</a> is optional for advanced electronics users. After removing the eight screws from the rear of the case, you can crack the case open with your spudger, removing the rear shell &mdash; you don&rsquo;t need to get the top off. </p>



<p>With the rear interior of the Steam Deck exposed, you should be able to see the right and left stick modules immediately, held in place by three screws each. Use your tweezers to lift up the protective flap on the ribbon cable, then remove the screws. With those four points of contact removed, the analog stick should pull right out with a little pressure from the underside (the front of the Steam Deck). Repeat the process with the other stick. </p>



<p>With the modules removed, you need to take the analog sticks themselves off of the old modules and onto the new ones. The sticks are connected to the modules with a tiny red cable which is soldered in place. This cable is solely for sensing when your thumbs are resting on the stick. </p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t care about this feature, you can cut or pull off the cable and the sticks will work just fine without that capability. If you want to preserve that function, then use your soldering iron to heat up the solder that&rsquo;s in place on the old module and gently pull the exposed copper wire out of the solder. Re-solder the wire into the same spot on the replacement GuliKit module. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam deck analog stick soldering " class="wp-image-1655799" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/soldering-steam-deck-stick.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Soldering the plastic sticks to the new module is an advanced, but optional, step.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keith May/IDG</p></div>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve placed the old plastic analog sticks on the new module&rsquo;s circuit board, you&rsquo;re ready to reassemble the Steam Deck. Simply place the completed sticks back into their spots on the housing (right to right, left to left, note the &ldquo;R&rdquo; and &ldquo;L&rdquo; printed on the back). Put the three screws back in, then re-attach the ribbon cable and lower the black protective flap. (Be careful with this step, it&rsquo;s tricky, and the most likely issue if you&rsquo;re having problems at the end of the process.) Repeat on the other side. </p>



<p>Replace the rear Steam Deck body panel and place the eight body screws back in, and you&rsquo;re ready to go! Your Steam Deck now has upgraded, drone controller-style hall effect joysticks, and it&rsquo;s 100 percent stick drift-proof.

</div>


<p>Gamers looking for a mid-range laptop have a lot of choice and, with mid-range RTX 40-series hardware presumably arriving later in 2023, it&rsquo;s an excellent time to snag a deal on outgoing 30-series laptops. The MSI Sword 15 A12UE is a reasonably priced offering that shows promise in performance tests. Its design and features, however, could use improvement.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630093/best-gaming-laptops-under-1000.html">best gaming laptops under $1,000</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a budget gaming laptop, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="msi-sword-15-a12uel-specs-and-features">MSI Sword 15 A12UEL: Specs and features</h2>



<p>The MSI Sword 15 A12UE is a 15.6-inch gaming laptop with an Intel Core i7-12650H processor, 16GB DDR5 memory, and an Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU. It also has a 1920&times;1080 144Hz display and a 1TB PCIe Gen4 M.2 solid state drive</p>



<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-12650H</li><li>Memory: 16GB DDR5</li><li>Graphics/GPU: Nvidia RTX 3060</li><li>Display: 1920&times;1080 144Hz IPS</li><li>Storage: 1TB PCIe Gen4 M.2 solid state drive</li><li>Webcam: 720p</li><li>Connectivity: 1x USB-C, 3x USB-A, 1x HDMI, 1x Ethernet, 1x 3.5mm combo audio, 1x AC barrel plug</li><li>Networking: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2</li><li>Biometrics: None</li><li>Battery capacity: 53 watt-hours</li><li>Dimensions: 14.13 x 10.20 x 0.98 inches</li><li>Weight: 4.96 pounds</li><li>MSRP: $1,299.99</li></ul>



<p>The laptop&rsquo;s specifications are otherwise unremarkable. It offers a decent array of ports, but nothing beyond the norm, and supports the usual Wi-Fi standards. The webcam sticks to 720p and biometric login isn&rsquo;t included.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="msi-sword-15-a12uel-design-and-build-quality">MSI Sword 15 A12UEL: Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Sword design" class="wp-image-1532997" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-sword-15-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The MSI Sword 15 A12UE&rsquo;s chassis is nearly identical to the MSI Katana, with one important exception: the color. Sword models come in white with black accents and a blue keyboard backlight, while Katana models are black with red accents and a red keyboard backlight. Personally, I prefer the Sword&rsquo;s design. It looks like a budget Alienware R15.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Build quality is good, but not outstanding. MSI&rsquo;s choice of plastics leans towards sleek, slippery surfaces without much sense of texture or substance. Despite this, the laptop&rsquo;s rigidity is good, allowing minimal flex across most surfaces. It&rsquo;s a cut above the least expensive Acer Nitro and Asus TUF laptops and more similar to competitors like the Dell G7 and Lenovo Legion 5.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s light for a budget gaming laptop, weighing in at just 4.96 pounds. Most alternatives weigh around 5.5 pounds. This difference is noticeable when handling the laptop. Dropping a few ounces doesn&rsquo;t make the laptop much more portable, though. It&rsquo;s still close to an inch thick and over 14 inches wide. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372718/lenovo-legion-5i-review-cranks-nvidias-rtx-3060-up-to-11.html">Lenovo Legion 5i</a>, Dell G7 15, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/920328/hp-victus-15-review-a-mediocre-gaming-laptop-at-a-great-price.html">HP Victus 15</a> are similar in size.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="msi-sword-15-a12uel-keyboard-and-trackpad">MSI Sword 15 A12UEL: Keyboard and trackpad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Sword keyboard" class="wp-image-1532995" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-sword-15-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>MSI&rsquo;s Sword has a conventional keyboard layout with numpad, although the numpad&rsquo;s half-sized keys may be uncomfortable for frequent use. The keyboard&rsquo;s size is comparable to other budget laptops but some space remains on either side that could be better utilized.</p>



<p>The keyboard is sure to disappoint gamers who prefer a tactile experience. Key travel is long, but key feel is vague and springy, which makes high-speed typing or gameplay feel less precise. The typing experience is similar to other budget gaming laptops including the Dell G7 and Asus TUF series, but the Lenovo Legion 5 and Acer Nitro 5 perform better.</p>



<p>Keyboard backlighting comes standard and is only available in blue, with three brightness levels to choose from.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The touchpad, unlike the keyboard, is cramped. It measures just 4 inches wide and 2.5 inches across. The lack of touchpad surface makes multitouch gestures annoying to use. This is a common problem among many budget gaming laptops though, once again, Lenovo&rsquo;s Legion 5 leap ahead. It has a more spacious touchpad measuring five inches wide and three inches deep.</p>



<h2 id="msi-sword-15-a12uel-display-audio">MSI Sword 15 A12UEL: Display, audio</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Sword design" class="wp-image-1532994" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-sword-15-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The MSI Sword 15 A12UE comes equipped with a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS display featuring a 144Hz refresh rate. A few more expensive configurations have a 1080p 240Hz panel instead. Unfortunately, the 144Hz display&rsquo;s performance is disappointing.</p>



<p>The issues begin with brightness. At only 266 nits, the display isn&rsquo;t bright enough for comfortable use in a well-lit room. Lackluster brightness saps vibrance from the image. It often appears a bit dull and dim, especially if you choose to turn the display even a couple notches down from its maximum brightness setting.</p>



<p>Contrast is better, reaching a maximum ratio of 1210:1. That&rsquo;s a decent showing for a budget gaming laptop and on par with some more expensive alternatives, like the Acer Predator Helios 300. The Sword&rsquo;s contrast ratio is enough to offer a sense of depth and dimensionality in many situations, but darker areas of the screen will look hazy when the laptop is viewed in a dark room.</p>

<p>Color performance, on the other hand, is a major problem. The 1080p 144Hz display covers just 70 percent of the sRGB color gamut and 53 percent of DCI-P3. That&rsquo;s about as low as you&rsquo;ll find on any modern laptop or standalone monitor. Colors often appear faded, as if the image was left out in the sun for a few years.</p>



<p>The display&rsquo;s 144Hz refresh rate offers good, but not great, motion performance. Fast-moving objects show slight motion blur and small details are obscured, but there&rsquo;s clear improvement in motion clarity compared to the laptop with a 60Hz panel. The laptop doesn&rsquo;t support G-Sync, so gamers must rely on V-Sync or play with the framerate uncapped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the display&rsquo;s performance is disappointing, it&rsquo;s common among budget gaming laptops. Many competitors, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/920328/hp-victus-15-review-a-mediocre-gaming-laptop-at-a-great-price.html">HP Victus 15</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/700135/acer-nitro-5-review-a-gamers-gaming-laptop.html">Acer Nitro 5</a>, offer similar displays, while Lenovo&rsquo;s Legion 5i offers a slightly better 165Hz display with 300 nits of brightness in its entry-level configuration.</p>



<p>The built-in speakers are modest but respectable. Spoken dialogue, podcasts, and YouTube videos are enjoyable, but music and games lack oomph. The sound stage is rarely distorted or muddy, at least, which places the Sword&rsquo;s speakers a peg above most budget gaming laptops.</p>



<h2 id="msi-sword-15-a12uel-webcam-microphone-biometrics">MSI Sword 15 A12UEL: Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>



<p>The MSI Sword 15 A12UE has a 720p webcam that performs poorly. The image appears soft with muted, faded colors, and the webcam struggles to adjust to changes in lighting. A video conference over Zoom or Google Meet will look ok (these generally restrict video quality to 720p or below, anyway), but the camera&rsquo;s limitations are obvious when attempting to stream at higher resolutions or record video.</p>



<p>Microphone quality is acceptable, effectively capturing my voice while minimizing background noise. Recorded audio sounds thin and metallic, but this is a common problem for all laptop microphones. Laptops in this price range won&rsquo;t offer a better experience.</p>



<p>Biometric login isn&rsquo;t supported by any MSI Sword configuration.</p>



<h2 id="msi-sword-15-a12uel-connectivity">MSI Sword 15 A12UEL: Connectivity</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Sword ports" class="wp-image-1532996" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-sword-15-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>A variety of USB-C and USB-A connectivity lines the Sword 15&rsquo;s flanks. It has one USB-C port and three USB-A ports (two of which are USB 3.2). These are joined by HDMI, Ethernet, and a 3.5mm combo audio jack.</p>



<p>The USB-C port is limited, however. It can&rsquo;t support DisplayPort video or charge the laptop. This was confirmed through testing with a USB-C monitor that provides Power Delivery and a USB-C power brick. That&rsquo;s disappointing news. The Dell G7 15 has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode, and the newest Lenovo Legion 5 laptops offer that plus up to 135 watts of USB Power Delivery.</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity spans Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. I&rsquo;d prefer to see<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/552421/wi-fi-performance-matters-more-than-you-think.html"> the latest Wi-Fi 6E standard</a>, but a Wi-Fi 6E router is required to take advantage of its added performance. Most homes have yet to make that upgrade.</p>



<h2 id="msi-sword-15-a12uel-performance">MSI Sword 15 A12UEL: Performance</h2>



<p>The MSI Sword 15 A12UE comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-12650H processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB NVMe PCIe Gen4 solid state drive. Graphics are provided by Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 3060 with 6GB of GDDR6 memory and a maximum graphics power of 105 watts. This is typical hardware for the price.</p>



<p>MSI provides several different power modes. The company requested the laptop be tested in Extreme Performance mode, but this ramps the fan speed up to maximum and keeps it there&mdash;an annoying experience, to say the least. I&rsquo;m presenting results from testing in the Balanced performance mode instead. The Extreme Performance mode provides small gains to performance, but rarely greater than five percent when compared to the Balanced mode..</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the results.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Sword PCMark" class="wp-image-1532998" height="769" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-sword-15-pcmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>PCMark 10 is a complete system benchmark, though it does tend to lean more heavily towards processor performance. The MSI Sword 15 A12UE may seem a bit under-powered here, due to its Core i7-12650H (instead of the Core i7-12700H, which is available at this price point), but it makes a good showing. The Lenovo Legion 5i, the quickest laptop in this competitive set, only beats the Sword by a few hundred points.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Sword Cinebench" class="wp-image-1533002" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-sword-15-cinebench-r15.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The gap widens a bit in Cinebench R15, but the relative position of laptops is almost identical, with MSI&rsquo;s Katana and Sword are nearly tied. It&rsquo;s clear the Lenovo Legion 5i has an advantage in this benchmark, and I&rsquo;d expect the same to be true of any laptop with a Core i7-12700H. Still, the gap is small enough for the Sword to remain competitive.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Sword Handbrake" class="wp-image-1533003" height="768" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-sword-15-handbrake.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Handbrake remains on trend. The MSI Sword performs similarly to the Katana, which was tested with the same Core i7-12650H processor. The AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS and Intel Core i7-12700H run ahead of the Sword by a more significant margin than before, however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now we come to the star of the show: the GPU. The MSI Sword 15 A12UE, like most gaming laptops priced a few hundred above $1,000, selects Nvidia&rsquo;s GTX 3060 for its graphics grunt. Its performance is respectable but slightly lags some competitors.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Sword 3D Mark" class="wp-image-1533004" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-sword-15-3dmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>3DMark Time Spy gives the Sword a strong start with a score of 8,291. This falls behind the Lenovo Legion 5i and Acer Nitro 5 with Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 3060, but the gap is so small that it&rsquo;s basically a tie. All three laptops provide healthy performance for the price and will generally outperform thinner laptops (like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/798334/dell-xps-15-9520-review-premium-laptop-with-oled-display-and-polished-design.html">the Dell XPS 15</a>) with the same GPU.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Sword Shadow of the Tomb Raider" class="wp-image-1533008" height="811" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-sword-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p><em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> starts to separate the pack. The MSI Sword turns in an average of 99 frames-per-second. That&rsquo;s seven less than the Acer Nitro 5 and 11 less than the Lenovo Legion 5i. It&rsquo;s still not a massive gap, but the Sword is starting to fall behind.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Sword Metro Exodus" class="wp-image-1533025" height="774" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-sword-metro-exodus.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p><em>Metro Exodus </em>is a demanding title. The Sword offers a playable average of 35 frames-per-second, but falls several frames behind the Acer Nitro 5 and Lenovo Legion 5i. A performance gap of this size isn&rsquo;t easy to notice in real-world gameplay, but it&rsquo;s hard to accept even a slight dip in performance when all three laptops hover around the same $1,300 price point.</p>



<p>I also benchmarked the Sword in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> with ray-tracing turned on. It averaged 26 frames-per-second at 1080p resolution with Ultra ray tracing settings&mdash;exactly the same as the Lenovo Legion 5i. Performance improved to an average of 44 frames-per-second at Medium ray tracing settings with DLSS in Performance mode, which is playable, if not smooth.</p>



<p>What about the Extreme Performance mode? It offers a minor bump: <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider </em>increased from an average of 99 FPS to 105 FPS, while <em>Metro Exodus</em> nudged up from 35 FPS to 36 FPS. That&rsquo;s not enough to beat the Acer Nitro 5 or Lenovo Legion 5i.</p>



<p>While the Sword isn&rsquo;t as quick as some competitors, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a dealbreaker. A performance deficit this small is hard to notice in real world use. A slight discount to the Sword&rsquo;s price relative to the competition will put it back into contention.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="msi-sword-15-a12uel-battery-life">MSI Sword 15 A12UEL: Battery life</h2>



<p>The MSI Sword 15 A12UE has a 53.3 watt-hour battery. This isn&rsquo;t a large battery for a gaming laptop, but also not unusual for gaming laptops sold at or near $1,000. The lack of juice leaves the Sword out of breath after a few hours.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Sword battery life" class="wp-image-1533011" height="791" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-sword-15-battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Battery life comes in at four hours and 11 minutes&mdash;enough for a short flight or half-day at a coffee shop, but that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;ll also mention that our test, which loops a 4K clip of the short film <em>Tears of Steel</em>, is not demanding. Expect a significant cut to battery life if you play games while on battery power.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-msi-sword-15-a12uel">Should you buy the MSI Sword 15 A12UEL?</h2>



<p>The MSI Sword 15 A12UE delivers good performance at a reasonable price. Older games are playable at 60 FPS or better. Even the most demanding games can achieve 30 FPS with only a few settings turned down from their maximum.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s the details, not game performance, which blunt the Sword&rsquo;s edge. The keyboard is merely okay, the touchpad is small, and the USB-C port doesn&rsquo;t support video or charging. Display quality also falls short. The Lenovo Legion 5i and Acer Nitro 5 are a better choice when equal in price.</p>



<p>None of the Sword&rsquo;s flaws are dealbreakers, though, and it&rsquo;s worth considering when its MSRP is slashed. MSI often makes such cuts. Currently, <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmsi-sword-15-6-144hz-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070ti-1tb-ssd-16gb-memory-white%2F6511433.p%3FskuId%3D6511433&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">a Sword 15 model with an RTX 3070 Ti is available on Best Buy for just $1,199.99</a>.&nbsp;</p>

## AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX vs. Radeon 6900 XT: Battle of the generations

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>The AMD 7900 XTX has proved to be an impressive GPU, but the story didn&rsquo;t start there. The 6900 XT that preceded it opened up the competitive high-end GPU landscape against Nvidia in a dazzling way. So much so that the 6900 XT remains relevant today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s the cool thing about last-generation GPUs. The new AMD cream of the crop has not obsoleted the older gen, not by a long shot. GPUs such as the 6900 XT remain potent, and in many cases, can prove to be excellent price-to-performance warriors. The refreshed AMD 6950 XT added a few percentage points to the mix, too. With AMD putting the 6000-series GPUs on sale, is it enough to draw you away from the breakneck performance of the 7000 series to save a few bucks?&nbsp;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to retroactively look at the big guy from last generation&mdash;the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393792/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-3440x1440-ultrawide-benchmarks.html">6900 XT</a>&mdash;and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">7900 XTX</a> of this generation. They were both the fastest and top AMD GPUs on release. Keeping in mind the 7900 XT and 6950 XT also exist, we&rsquo;ll keep the attention on the OG &ldquo;original&rdquo; top dogs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll go over the current market prices, gaming performance, and important things to be aware of. As with most GPUs, it&rsquo;s not always a rosy situation that leads you down the correct path. The GPU market is often murky, challenging, and full of twists and turns.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="amd-6900-xt-vs-amd-7900-xtx-price-and-availability">AMD 6900 XT vs. AMD 7900 XTX: Price and availability&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD 6900 XT vs AMD 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1530202" height="1201" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2022-12-13-at-3.57.38-PM.png?w=630" width="630" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Both GPUs debuted at a $999 MSRP. This makes them impressive&mdash;since comparable Nvidia GPUs are priced higher, such as the RTX 3090 and RTX 4080.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, AMD has dropped the price of the older 6900 XT to as low as $629 to make way for the 7900 XTX. (You can even pick up the 6950 XT for under $700, too.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have another shared attribute, this time concerning availability. The 6900 XT came during a very turbulent time of the GPU shortages, making it rarely available at MSRP. Thanks to an ease in the GPU market, it&rsquo;s easily found in stock now. </p>



<p>While the 7900 XTX has launched during a downturn in GPU purchases, it too has availability issues. Its less-performant 7900 XT sibling has remained in stock at $899, but the $999 XTX proves to be too appealing with its price-to-performance advantage to stay on the shelves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither the 6900 XT nor the 7900 XTX have had ideal launch and availability conditions for most of their existence. If you were to purchase today, you&rsquo;d more easily find the older 6900 XT for cheaper in stock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we&rsquo;ll find out, the 7900 XTX has an impressive performance uplift if you consider both GPUs at their original $999. That MSRP has stayed the same, unlike the RTX 4080, which has crept up. If we compare the current $629 6900 XT price, however, you&rsquo;re certainly paying more for each frame by a similar dollar amount as of today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering the above, we&rsquo;d say the 7900 XTX is one of the better performance values you can get today, for those seeking the most frames. If you can do with a bit less performance, the 6900 XT is still a good value.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="amd-6900-xt-vs-amd-7900-xtx-performance">AMD 6900 XT vs. AMD 7900 XTX: Performance</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD 6900 XT vs AMD 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1530204" height="1201" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2022-12-13-at-3.57.46-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Performance is the dueling ground where the real questions will be answered concerning these two contenders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are you missing with the older generation? Nvidia has made DLSS 3 with frame generation an exclusive advantage to only its RTX 4000 series of GPUs.&nbsp; AMD technology such as FSR (FidelityX Super Resolution) is currently similar on both generations, so you&rsquo;ll enjoy parity there. The advantage comes down to better brute performance instead. That&rsquo;s good news, meaning 6900 XT buyers can still enjoy a relatively modern GPU experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep another important performance issue in mind: CPU choice. With the 7900 XTX reaching such high frame rates, your CPU choice will become even more of a factor in some games. Just as the RTX 4090 can have CPU bottlenecks at even 4K, the 7900 XTX will be much more demanding. Meaning you&rsquo;re likely able to skate by with a fast&mdash;but not &ldquo;fastest&rdquo; CPU&mdash;such as the 6900 XT without as much bottlenecking.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="AMD 6900 XT vs AMD 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1530209" height="1038" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cyberpunk.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>From PCWorld&rsquo;s RX 7900 XTX review.</p>

<p>With <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> (ray tracing and DLSS/FSR off), the 7900 XTX is one of the most impressive GPU&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve seen. It even puts up a domineering effort against the Nvidia RTX 4090, which is quite the feat!&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also see the 6900 XT with very close performance to the RTX 3090, but far from the 7900 XTX. If this was your game of choice, the latter&rsquo;s performance is around 63 percent better on paper. Oddly enough, the price difference between $629 and $999 for both GPUs currently stands around 58 percent. While you&rsquo;re getting tremendous performance increases, the price is similarly higher. You&rsquo;ll have to ask yourself if you&rsquo;re fine with the acceptable 91 FPS at 1440p for <em>Cyberpunk</em>, or if you need more (such as 4K, and ray tracing, where the answer favors the 7900 XTX).&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no doubt that when comparing their original $999 MSRP, instead of the cheaper current price of the 6900 XT, the performance gains make the 7900 XTX a better choice. But at current prices, it&rsquo;s a bit more of a toss-up.</p>



<p>In looking at the lower-priced 7900 XT, the price-to-performance difference falls in favor of the 6900 XT, as the $899 7900 XT lacks the same oomph as its bigger XTX brother (but doesn&rsquo;t lack the high pricing).&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="AMD 6900 XT vs AMD 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1530210" height="1038" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/codmw2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>From PCWorld&rsquo;s 7900 XTX review.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>With <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>, we find a game that likes AMD hardware in general. The 6900 XT is putting up impressive numbers still&mdash;even at 4K it&rsquo;s able to go above the magical 4K 60 FPS barrier. At 1440p, once again we see the 7900 XTX with nearly a 60 percent gain over the 6900 XT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is incredible&mdash;but once again you must ask yourself if the 123 FPS of the 6900 XT at 1440p is insufficient. Chances are, it will do you just fine, and you&rsquo;re paying much less.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="AMD 6900 XT vs AMD 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1530212" height="1038" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RT-cyberpunk-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>From PCWorld&rsquo;s 7900 XTX review.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>Returning to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, we now see how ray tracing fares. AMD has made some impressive improvements to its ray-tracing performance in the 7900 XTX, although it&rsquo;s still behind Nvidia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In most cases, ray tracing is where you&rsquo;ll likely also want to pair FSR to ensure you&rsquo;re getting playable frame rates. With FSR balanced, you&rsquo;re getting over 50 percent better ray-tracing performance with the 7900 XTX over the 6900 XT. With FSR off, that number climbs slightly closer to 60 percent, where the brute force of the 7900 XTX plays a bigger role. You will get less FPS with it off, and sometimes low enough to be unplayable with ray tracing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The story with ray tracing is oddly like regular rasterized performance differences between both GPUs. In both cases, the 7900 XTX performs more than 50 percent higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your primary goal is ray tracing, chances are you&rsquo;ll be better served on the Nvidia side. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re likely paying similarly for that performance increase on the 7900 XTX versus the 6900 XT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s FSR technology is a great performance feature on both GPUs, and they&rsquo;ll be further augmented by the eventual release of FSR 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the performance conclusion, if you&rsquo;re okay with the $999 price, the clear choice is the much faster 7900 XTX. It&rsquo;s one of the few decent &ldquo;bang-for-buck&rdquo; GPUs nowadays, even at its current price. If you&rsquo;re okay with some compromises in frames, the $629 6900 XT has more than enough chops to handle demanding games.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="amd-6900-xt-vs-amd-7900-xtx-power-and-other-things-to-know">AMD 6900 XT vs. AMD 7900 XTX: Power and other things to know</h2>



<p>As we&rsquo;re talking about the leading performers from AMD, efficiency isn&rsquo;t always the first talking point. While AMD has heavily pushed its relative efficiency in the past, Nvidia has certainly showcased some impressive numbers, too.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="AMD 6900 XT vs AMD 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1530213" height="1038" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/power.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p></p>

<p>With a 355W TDP on the 7900 XTX and a tamer 300W on the 6900 XT, they&rsquo;re both reasonable. Remember, the RTX 4090 has a whopping 450W TDP, albeit with more performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that typically you&rsquo;ll have an easier time cooling and fitting these AMD GPUs in your system. AMD made a point initially that these are &ldquo;normal-sized&rdquo; and use the regular PCIe 8-pin adapters compared to Nvidia&rsquo;s 12VHPWR solution. While that is true, some AIB third-party coolers such as the PowerColor Red Devil can be just as massive!&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD 6900 XT vs AMD 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1530214" height="808" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2022-12-14-at-6.14.10-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The 7900 XTX is even bigger than the RTX 4080.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Another important point to touch on is in driver support. While AMD has been much better in recent generations with driver updates, there have been some issues. For example, updated drivers for the 6900 XT were noticeably late after 7900 XTX drivers had already been released for some new game releases. That&rsquo;s one thing to remember about buying the older GPU&mdash;you may have less frequent driver updates over time compared to the shiny new thing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="amd-6900-xt-vs-amd-7900-xtx-the-verdict">AMD 6900 XT vs. AMD 7900 XTX: The verdict&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There is no doubt that, pound for pound, the 7900 XTX is impressive. If we consider that the $999 MSRP technically stayed the same versus the 6900 XT, it&rsquo;s even more so. (We&rsquo;re looking at you, RTX 4080!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can find the 6900 XT at $629 today, however. And while it doesn&rsquo;t have the door-busting performance of the 7900 XTX, it&rsquo;s still competent in modern games. It&rsquo;s also much easier to find in stock. You will be missing out on the top frame rates, and likely have insufficient ray-tracing performance. If you combine FSR and the upcoming FSR 3 with the 6900 XT, it will prolong the life of this GPU even more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having said that, if you find a $999 7900 XTX, the performance gains are clearly worth it for many. You&rsquo;ll enjoy 50 percent more frames in many games, including ray tracing, at the same original MSRP of the 6900 XT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How about phrasing it like this: If you were considering the 6900 XT, is the $370 difference worth it to jump to the 7900 XTX? If we consider future depreciation of both, it&rsquo;s a close call. You&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy the 7900 XTX for much longer than the 6900 XT, as it&rsquo;s more future-proof with its increased performance. In the long term, you may be able to enjoy more performance now, and a longer life&mdash;therefore negating some of the 6900 XT&rsquo;s price advantage. Either way, you&rsquo;ll still have great performance with both!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verdict: The 7900 XTX, albeit more expensive, is likely worth it over the 6900 XT currently, as it will give you longer usability and comes with tremendous performance gains.</p>
