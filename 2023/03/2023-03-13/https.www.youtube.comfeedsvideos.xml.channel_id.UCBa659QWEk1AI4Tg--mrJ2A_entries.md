Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan is not just the world's oldest hotel, but the world's oldest still-operating business. Or at least, that's one way of looking at it. But things are changing here, just like they always have. â–  The hotel: https://www.keiunkan.co.jp/

An accessible English dub is available for anyone unable to read subtitles; you can turn it on in your device's player settings. It's experimental and using an AI-generated voice, so it's a long way from perfect, and I can't guarantee it'll be available for future videos, or even for this one long-term! But hopefully it's a step in the right direction.
