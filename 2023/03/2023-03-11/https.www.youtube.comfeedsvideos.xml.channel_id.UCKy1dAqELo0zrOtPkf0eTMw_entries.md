“Not in my movie” is one of Sidney Prescott’s most iconic lines, but what happens when it isn’t her movie anymore? The truth is, we’ll always miss Scream’s original final girl (and hope Neve Campbell’s contract negotiations smooth out and we see her again someday). But, for now, it turns out that a Sid-less Scream ended up being pretty damn great. The sequel to the requel may have botched the reason for her absence, but all of that occurs very early on in Scream 6. And we, my friends, are here to talk about what happens at the end of this chapter of the Carpenter sisters’ story and what it all means for the franchise going forward. Yes, this is our Scream 6 ending explained!

Watch out though, because Scream spoilers follow from here…

It all comes down to the trophy room from hell. Sam (Jenna Ortega) and Tara Carpenter (Melissa Barrera) find themselves trapped in the decrepit theater that someone has been using as a shrine for all of the artifacts of Ghostface’s past. With them is one Kirby Reed (Hayden Panettiere), who seems to be acting just a little odd. She’s turned the theater into a death trap as the remaining survivors planned, but she sure does seem strangely gleeful about it. Sam and Tara grow suspicious, and it seems Detective Bailey (Dermot Mulroney) had the same concerns as he arrives on the scene so he and Kirby can have a shouty standoff ala Scream 2’s Mickey and Derek.

The big “who is Ghostface” reveal goes about the same as it does in Scream 2, but not in a way that’s detrimental to the story. The Detective and Kirby have each other at gunpoint as they shout at Sam and Tara, insisting that the other is Ghostface. But to really dig into all the Scream 6 spoilers, you’ll need to watch our full ending explained on the horror movie!

A24's Everything Everywhere All at Once isn't just the sci-fi/fantasy darling of the past year, it's also now an Oscar darling, having racked up nominations for Michelle Yeoh (Best Actress), Ke Huy Quan (Best Supporting Actor), Jamie Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu (both Best Supporting Actress), Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, a.k.a. the Daniels, for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, and then Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, and of course Best Picture.

In this epic interview, IGN's Michael Peyton sits down with Michelle Yeoh, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ke Huy Quan and Stephanie Hsu to discuss the making of the film, how they approached the multiverse of it all, working with the Daniels, bringing their past movie-making experiences to bear on the film (such as Yeoh's martial arts background and Quan's time as a child actor in The Goonies and as Short Round in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom), and much more.

So sit back and dig in deep on how the 2022 Oscar fave Everything Everywhere All at Once was made!
