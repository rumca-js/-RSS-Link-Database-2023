On Saturday, Relativity Space\u2019s Terran 1 rocket failed to get off the ground after two launch attempts. It was a day of false starts. Following Wednesday's scrub, Relativity Space initially set its sights on a 1:45PM ET launch, a window the company later push back to 2:45PM ET <a href=\"https://twitter.com/relativityspace/status/1634622573374853121?s=20\">due to &quot;upper-level wind violations.&quot;</a>&nbsp;</p><p>After the countdown restarted, all was going well until a boat entered the spacecraft\u2019s range. Once the countdown resumed again, the company called a launch abort at t-minus zero after the spacecraft\u2019s nine first-stage Aeon engines roared to life and then cut off almost immediately after. After blaming a &quot;launch commit criteria violation for the 2:45PM abort, Relativity Space said it would attempt to fly the rocket again at 4PM ET, just as its launch window was about to close for the day. Unfortunately, the second time around Relativity called an abort before Terran 1 could even ignite its engines. As of the writing of this article, the company did not provide a reason for the abort, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/relativityspace/status/1634661606368985090?s=20\">said</a> the rocket was &quot;healthy&quot; and that it would have more information to share soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Provided it can get off the ground, Terran 1 would represent a significant milestone for spaceflight technology. While the rocket isn\u2019t completely 3D-printed, 85 percent of its mass is \u2013 including its entire structure and 10 first- and second-stage engines. In theory, Terran 1\u2019s manufacturing process produces a spacecraft that is cheaper and faster to make. Relativity Space claims it can build a Terran 1 rocket in about 60 days, and that exclusive missions will cost around $12 million to complete. With future spacecraft, the company hopes to make around 90 percent of the vehicle from 3D-printed parts.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/relativity-spaces-3d-printed-rocket-fails-to-lift-off-during-second-launch-attempt-211805294.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/relativity-spaces-3d-printed-rocket-fails-to-lift-off-during-second-launch-attempt-211805294.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-11 21:18:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Microsoft confirms it won't be on the E3 2023 show floor", "description": "<p>When E3 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/e3-2023-dates-announced-162713745.html\"><ins>returns this June</ins></a> to the Los Angeles Convention Center for the first time since the start of the pandemic, Microsoft won\u2019t be on the show floor. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to host our Xbox Games Showcase on June 11th and will share more details later,\u201d an Xbox spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-confirms-it-wont-be-on-e3-showfloor-will-co-stream-digital-week\"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>IGN</ins></em></a> on Friday (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/10/23634418/xbox-e3-2023-skipping-show-floor\"><ins>via </ins><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>). \u201cWe also look forward to co-streaming our event as part of E3 Digital and will not be on the E3 show floor.\u201d</p><p>Questions about Microsoft\u2019s E3 2023 presence began circulating at the start of February when <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-nintendo-sony-skipping-e3-2023\"><em><ins>IGN</ins></em></a> reported that the company, alongside Sony and Nintendo, would not have a presence on the show floor.
