Erling Haaland, scorer of the only goal, could be seen beating his chest wildly, the City players hugging eagerly.</p><p>A 1-0 win with a goal from the spot against a Crystal Palace team that hasn’t won at Selhurst Park since October is hardly the stuff of the springtime cavalry charge.

There are the quick impressions – men wrestling escaped bees on a roadside deep in flood waters, a flattened cornfield marked by the shape and force of the torrent, a mud-soiled child on a stoop, wide plains transformed into lakes, the eerie chime of a stuck train signal. Then there are the pecuniary matters – the financial loss of a corn yield – and the interviews with the afflicted.</p><p>Any large-scale traumatic event, be it a natural disaster or a war will often provoke reminders of previous traumatic episodes; instances that have remained abstract, placeless or locked within the mind. A flood might breach other instances of grief, loss, degradation, violence. It may be the interminable and sour stench of silt and sewage, children’s toys and clothing heaped in brown puddles, humble and cherished items stacked in ruins or the ceaseless clack of helicopters flying low through ashen skies that prompt the return of a painful memory; it could be the sight of broken walls, sagging houses, a wrecked car submerged in mud.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/12/my-cyclone-diary-after-the-flood-the-dread-that-replaces-panic">Continue reading...</a>

Disclosures of his emails in Dominion Voting Systems’s $1.6bn (£1.33bn) suit against Fox, show the TV presenter admitting “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/08/tucker-carlson-hates-trump-capitol-footage" title="">I hate him [Trump] passionately</a>”.

Atwood brings her trademark wit and invention to bear on subjects as diverse as a pandemic, cancel culture, female friendship, witchcraft – and cats. At the heart of the book is a sequence of tales about a long-married couple, Nell and Tig, as they look back over a lifetime together and, in Nell’s case, contemplate a future alone.</p><p><strong>This feels like a highly personal collection, especially the story in which Nell is coming to terms with life after her beloved Tig’s death. How much of your own life is reflected in their tales of love and loss?<br /></strong>The stories are pretty true to the life we shared and to life since Graeme died. Of course, they are obviously not the whole story – they’re facets of it, snapshots in time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/11/margaret-atwood-it-would-be-fun-to-talk-to-simone-de-beauvoir-old-babes-in-the-wood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The England fast bowler will play once more in Bangladesh as he targets a return to the Test side in the Ashes this summer</p><p>Just one Test. As Jofra Archer works his way back to full fitness after an injury-ravaged 18 months, and before he heads to his first Indian Premier League season since 2020, this is the primary target. “If I can play one game this summer, I’ll be happy. If I play more than one, that’s a bonus,” he says.</p><p>It is a tantalising prospect.

Bringing a beautiful old house into the 21st century was a labour of love for a couple creating their forever home<p>We weren’t actually planning to move house,” says Rebecca Boektje. “Our son, Xan, was just six weeks old. But my husband, Bo, is addicted to estate agents’ websites and saw this house. Even though we thought it was out of our league, we decided to view it anyway.”</p><p>Then the pandemic broke out and suddenly the number of physical viewings permitted per day was greatly reduced. This meant that, in turn, many potential viewers and purchasers dropped out, leaving a window of opportunity for Rebecca, 38, and Bo, 42, which they seized wholeheartedly. They put in an offer, which was accepted, and they became the owners of this fantastic old property in the historic Plantage district of Amsterdam.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/11/dutch-courage-a-family-home-in-amsterdam-balances-the-old-with-new">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is a new word for the degradation of online platforms, but it’s been happening for years. Why do we tolerate it?</p><p>“Those whom the Gods wish to destroy,” says the adage, “they first make mad.” Actually, that’s overkill: the Gods just need to make people forget. Amnesia turns out to be a powerful narcotic and it’s been clouding our perceptions of what’s been happening on the internet for at least 25 years, namely the inexorable degradation of the online environment and our passive, sullen acceptance of that.</p><p>Examples? Everywhere you look. Take Google search that, once upon a time (1998), was elegant, efficient and a massive improvement on what went before. You typed in a query and got a list of websites that were indicated by a kind of automated peer-review called PageRank. Now, the first page of results from a search for “high-quality saucepans” produces a myriad of “sponsored” items, ie advertisements.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/11/users-advertisers-we-are-all-trapped-in-the-enshittification-of-the-internet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Refurbished offices can offer big carbon savings over the traditional approach of demolishing them and starting again</p><p>A stone’s throw from London’s affluent Sloane Square, a 1980s redbrick facade hides a fully revamped office building, partially built from reclaimed materials.

## Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom review – Bhutan school drama is a breath of fresh air

<p>A disillusioned teacher is sent to a remote Himalayan school in this charming, visually stunning first feature</p><p>The story behind <em>Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom</em> is almost as heartwarming as the tale that it tells, of a disillusioned teacher who finds meaning in his life (and a new use for yak dung) while teaching at the world’s most remote school. The staggeringly photogenic, emphatically feelgood first feature from Pawo Choyning Dorji, set in an isolated mountain community in Bhutan, garnered such a warm global reception that it ended up nominated in last year’s Oscars – quite an achievement for the tiny Himalayan kingdom, hardly a major player in world cinema. Lunana’s appeal is hard to miss: though rather naive in its messaging and unashamedly sentimental, the film is so pure of spirit and so open-hearted, you want to breathe it in, to fill your lungs with it.</p><p>Aspiring musician Ugyen (Sherab Dorji) has one eye on a new life in Australia. Working as a teacher for his five years of mandatory government service, he has distinguished himself with his lack of motivation and little else. But with an assignment to Lunana, an eight-day hike from the nearest bus stop, Ugyen peels himself from his phone and engages with tradition, yaks and a class full of bright-eyed poppets. The non-professional cast and Norbu the stoic yak (named, perhaps, for Bhutan’s most famous film-maker, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6qDpRbIM7o">The Cup</a></em> director Khyentse Norbu) add considerably to the film’s charm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/11/lunana-a-yak-in-the-classroom-review-bhutan-school-drama-is-a-breath-of-fresh-air">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the 1980s an unknown photographer from New York travelled through the US capturing life in black communities. Now these mostly unseen pictures have made him a star</p><p>At 72, and almost 30 years after he gave up photography, Baldwin Lee is having a long overdue moment. Following the publication of an eponymously titled monograph last year, which led the <em>New Yorker</em> to call him “one of the great overlooked luminaries of American picture-making”, a selection of his evocative images of black life in the American south is currently on show for the first time in Britain, at the <a href="https://davidhillgallery.net/exhibitions">David Hill Gallery, London</a>. Comprising a mere fraction of the estimated 10,000 photographs that Lee, the New York-born son of a Hong Kong emigrant, made on various extended road trips around Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana between 1982 and 1989, they are nevertheless a revelatory record of a time and a place and a people.</p><p>His subjects are the black Americans he encountered in the mainly rural, often desperately deprived, southern communities where segregation still cast a long shadow. Many of them had never spoken to an Asian person before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/11/it-stunned-me-that-people-had-to-live-like-this-baldwin-lee-rediscovered-images-deep-south-southern-portrait">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Ovo Hydro, Glasgow<br /></strong>The Glasgow-loving US star’s whip-smart extravaganza of glittering sisterhood is an irresistible showcase of hits and positivity with just a hint of pop juggernaut</p><p>In a better, kinder, funnier parallel universe where Lizzo’s values are uppermost, every day is International Women’s Day. Or no days are, because there is no need for it. Until we get there, the US singer’s UK tour kicks off on IWD with an all-female band, three female backing vocalists, the Little Bigs, Lizzo’s longtime DJ, Sophia Eris, and the 10-strong Big Grrrls dance troupe, stars of Lizzo’s triple-Emmy-winning reality competition show, <em><a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/lizzo-emmy-win-watch-out-for-the-big-grrrls-acceptance-speech-1235137840/">Watch Out for the Big Grrrls</a></em>. Those Emmys put Lizzo halfway to EGOT status – ie bagging an Emmy, a Grammy (current tally: four), an Oscar and a Tony. Among many bravura performances on the stage tonight, one stands out. At just 19, guitarist Jordan Waters plays a kind of Steve Lacy role – a wunderkind who can muster plangent, taut, Prince-like funk lines, but never lapses into the kind of florid rock solos that have become endemic at pop gigs.</p><p>We know we are in Glasgow because Lizzo revels in shouting it – “GlasGOH!” she hollers, often – and twice starts a chant of “here we, here we fucking go”. Arena divas seem to act as though every city is their favourite, but Lizzo’s love for Glasgow, like her love of many things, seems genuine.

<p>The neurosurgeon spent decades making people’s brains better, but a scan led him to focus on the factors that stave off cognitive decline and boost quality of life</p><p>As a neurosurgeon, Henry Marsh has spent several decades making people’s brain’s better (and occasionally, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/oct/05/the-more-dangerous-the-operation-the-more-i-wanted-to-do-it-neurosurgeon-henry-marsh-on-mistakes-and-mortality" title="">his memoirs document</a> with breathtaking honesty, making them worse). But that job involved removing tumours and patching up the aftermath of serious head traumas. Keeping a brain in perfect health is an altogether different matter, not least because we understand so little about it.</p><p>A couple of years ago, the now 73-year-old Marsh agreed to have his own brain scanned. He was not overly worried about what it might show. He exercised well, stayed mentally active and was not displaying any significant signs of cognitive decline. “But it was slightly shocking, because my brain looked rather elderly,” he says. “I shouldn’t have been surprised because I was 70 years old! But it was rather scary.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/11/exercise-avoid-bangs-and-invent-fairy-stories-henry-marshs-guide-to-keeping-brains-healthy">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Great Hampton Works; Symphony Hall; CBSO Centre, Birmingham</strong><br />Birmingham Opera Company regroup, and the CBSO triumph in Elgar’s great oratorio as the city’s rich musical life thrives. And shock and anger as the BBC Singers are axed</p><p>Birmingham Opera Company has always challenged its audiences. Finding the venue is a first hurdle. When knowledge of Birmingham’s repurposed factories, skating rinks, ballrooms and leisure centres is sketchy, the only proof of arrival is the equally uncertain group huddled outside a shuttered building in an empty street. Minutes before start time, doors are flung open on to a bright hub of activity. Even the most shy, leave-me-alone visitor is pulled into proceedings.</p><p>Their latest production was <strong><a href="https://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/the-decision-tickets">The Decision</a></strong> (<em>Die Massnahme</em>), the 1930 agitprop cantata by Bertolt Brecht (text and lyrics) and Hanns Eisler (music), in the standard translation by John Willett. Cast members, kitted head to toe in red, thrust red baseball caps or scarves into our hands, as well as biscuits and drinks. Join the party, was the message, the wordplay immediately evident. Brecht and Eisler’s short drama – propulsive, episodic, wearyingly didactic – explores how the actions of an individual can threaten the collective and lead to violence. Four agitators kill a young comrade, then defend their deed. The scale is modest: one singer/speaker (the versatile <a href="https://www.wendydawnthompson.com/">Wendy Dawn Thompson</a>), three actors, small orchestra and a chorus – of any size – which has to sing or recite the rousing songs that shape the drama.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/11/birmingham-opera-company-the-decision-brecht-eisler-review-city-of-birmingham-symphony-orchestra-ryan-wigglesworth-the-dream-of-gerontius-cbso-soloists-bbc-singers-axed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the BBC crisis snowballs, it is obvious that director general Tim Davie and those who pushed him into error misread the public mood</p><p>Impartiality is a knotty old concept, and one of the trickiest things about it is that it relies on the idea that you can safely find the middle ground. Witness the agonised attempts by the BBC and the Labour party to land on that sweet spot of unimpeachable banality after radical centrist firebrand Gary Lineker’s tweets became a rightwing media obsession this week. Instead of establishing themselves as the trusted representatives of the median voter or viewer, they have ceded moral authority to a man who spent last Sunday commentating on Nottingham Forest v Everton.</p><p>That’s Steve Wilson, one of the Match of the Day commentators who on Friday announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/10/gary-lineker-step-back-match-of-the-day-bbc">that they would be stepping back from their duties this weekend in solidarity with Lineker</a>. Post-match analysis and player interviews will also be missing. The version of the BBC’s football highlights show that will be on air as a result – and the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/entertainment-arts-64895316">enforced dropping of Saturday’s Football Focus</a> after its presenter Alex Scott, pulled out – is the natural endpoint of the position that the corporation has so painfully staked out for itself: a (political!) football fizzing about without much sense of why, or what the stakes are. Give up on meaningful analysis in pursuit of neutrality and the result is a version of events which is uncontroversial, certainly, but also difficult to understand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/11/gary-lineker-bbc-moral-clarity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The singer<em> </em>on the strange world of being a child star and how Coyote Ugly spelled the end of her ‘wholesome’ image</p><p>Born in Mississippi in 1982 and raised in Texas, LeAnn Rimes signed her first record deal aged 13. At 14, she became the youngest person to win a Grammy, for her <a href="https://youtu.be/GozdIQx1Wow" title="">cover of country classic Blue</a>, and followed her success with How Do I Live, one of the bestselling singles of the 1990s. In 2000, her song Can’t Fight the Moonlight was used in the teen box-office smash Coyote Ugly, a film about a group of female bartenders who danced on tabletops for tips. The song was No 1 in 12 countries and catapulted her into the pop market. She won the 2020 season of The Masked Singer US, has released 18 albums and her latest, God’s Work, is out now. She lives in California with her husband, actor Eddie Cibrian, and is a stepmother to two boys.</p><p><strong>There was a lot of acting going on </strong>in this photograph. I was only 17 when Coyote Ugly came out and until this point in my career I’d been constantly on the road, doing press and working in the studio. I had teen angst, I was hormonal and I had done 500 shows in three and a half years, so I was tired. I hadn’t been to many bars before, let alone danced on top of them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/11/leann-rimes-looks-back-i-hadnt-been-to-bars-before-let-alone-danced-on-them">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Everything Everywhere All at Once raked in $100m and is tipped to win big at the Academy Awards. If it does, that caps quite a decade for the hip New York firm credited with getting young viewers into the arthouse. What’s its secret?</p><p>It has been six years since the Academy Awards ended with an old-guard error that culminated in a shock of the new.

Moonlight was released by the hip, still-green indie studio A24, then only four years into its existence. It was the very first film A24 had produced from the outset, after establishing itself by acquiring and distributing finished products: it could hardly believe its beginner’s luck.</p><p>Fast-forward to this year’s Oscar race, and A24 is no longer David but Goliath, with the heavily tipped best picture frontrunner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/11/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-review-nothing-nowhere-over-a-long-period-of-time" title="">Everything Everywhere All at Once</a>.

<p>Heavy snow has wrought calamity across the state; burying roads and houses, disrupting power and snapping branches off trees</p><p>Blake Heauser’s chainsaw slowly rumbled quiet. Sounds of tall trees splintering and crashing under the weight of the freshly fallen snow cut through the stillness, as the latest round of winter weather bore down on the town, tucked into the foothills in northern California. He had cleared a path through the wooded debris for now but with more storms in the forecast it might not last.</p><p>Heauser had spent days trying to remove fallen trees from the roads that snaked through the hillsides in his community in Grass Valley, even as those roads disappeared under the heavy snow. He and others worked around the clock to ensure vulnerable neighbors could either evacuate or were able to safely remain in their buried homes, while grappling with the effects of prolonged and widespread power outages that left some without heat or pumped well water.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/11/california-mountain-towns-snowstorm-weather">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Celebrity is religion’: How Andy Warhol kickstarted our obsession with superstars

<p>Kitschy unboxing videos, sunset selfies, TikTok dances: what would the man in the blonde wig make of the world he created, asks Nicole Flattery</p><p>In every argument, debate or article about the rise of the modern celebrity, one name always reappears: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol">Andy Warhol</a>. Do you know who first documented the minutiae of their life? Andy Warhol. Do you know who coined the phrase “In the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes”? Andy Warhol. How did it happen? He made it happen. Warhol, the original narcissist; Warhol, the genius; Warhol, the void. He is responsible for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok">TikTok</a> dancers, the Instagram models hogging the infinity pools, the needy comedians, the intense desire for recognition we are confronted with daily. It’s an awful lot for one notoriously frail man to carry.</p><p>I think the main reason why Warhol is blamed for our disposable celebrity culture is because of the superstars. The superstars were Warhol’s set, plucked from relative obscurity to star in his films, circle him and make him interesting, because Warhol’s only real god was work. Some of the superstars were talented; some were not. Some were beautiful; some were bizarre, and that was even better. Some were forgettable but some – and this is crucial – had something special. Charisma, charm, electricity, a presence that defied description. I have my own favourites: Ondine, Candy Darling, Edie Sedgwick. Sedgwick, an actor and model, has, like so many cultural icons, been reduced to parts: a fur coat, a leotard, heavy earrings. This still happens with celebrites. As I write, pictures from the set of the new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse">Amy Winehouse</a> film are circulating. Everything is where it’s supposed to be, how we remember it, but uncanny, unreal. A beehive, a pair of ballet slippers, a once living person made into a costume.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/11/celebrity-is-religion-how-andy-warhol-kickstarted-our-obsession-with-superstars">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A boarding school is the backdrop for a metaphysical journey in this magical-realist debut</p><p>This British-Nigerian debut, part boarding-school story and part Igbo metaphysics, is about the strange, otherworldly experiences of two friends, Ozoemena and Treasure, in a school in upcountry Nigeria. The two meet following family tragedies. When Treasure’s father dies, her family loses everything to grasping uncles. One day she meets a spirit who promises to bring her father back if she agrees to help it. And in exchange for finding it “wives”, the spirit will also bring her material goods. It’s a tempting offer, as the family owes rent and has barely any money for provisions. We are not surprised when she agrees.</p><p>In a somewhat similar vein, her friend Ozoemena’s alternative identity as a leopard arises from the murder of her uncle Odiogo. Odiogo had been a vessel for the leopard spirit; after his death, a new receptacle is needed to continue the family tradition. This spirit is part of the mythology of a secret Igbo sect that worships the goddess Idemili, previously introduced to non-Igbos by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/chinuaachebe">Chinua Achebe</a> in the novels <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/arrow-of-god-9780141191560">Arrow of God</a> and <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/anthills-of-the-savannah-9780141186900">Anthills of the Savannah</a>. “Soon you will become the thing that all other beasts of the night fear,” the deity’s priest tells Ozoemena, when he announces her new avatar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/11/dazzling-by-chikodili-emelumadu-review-an-otherworldly-vision-of-nigeria">Continue reading...</a>

## Greek tragedies like Medea are an ethical nightmare. That’s why we need them | Charlotte Higgins

<p>Ancient classics can reinforce patriarchal lies about women, but they also take us back to the origins of pernicious narratives</p><p>Last week, I found myself – at the end of a gloomy day – shot through with a burst of fierce, electric energy. It came from watching Sophie Okonedo’s 90 minutes of flat-out fury as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/18/medea-review-sohoplace-london">she played Medea</a>, opposite Ben Daniels’s Jason, in Dominic Cooke’s production of the Euripides play.</p><p>Afterwards, I registered the fact that the woman sitting by me had actually put her hands over her face when Medea decided to murder her own children. I, on the other hand, had not. Why did I mentally urge her on towards the unspeakable deeds, inwardly channelling all the pent-up anti-patriarchal rage at my disposal? Wasn’t there something deeply disturbing about that? Or was the play precisely doing its job in Aristotelian terms: providing a catharsis?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/11/greek-tragedies-medea-ethical-nightmare-classics">Continue reading...</a>

## Wandering Souls by Cecile Pin review – from Vietnam to London

<p>This powerful debut, longlisted for the Women’s prize, is a heartfelt portrayal of the Vietnamese refugee experience and the tolls of assimilation</p><p>“After I learned about Koh Kra I couldn’t sleep for three days,” declares the narrator of Cecile Pin’s moving and meticulously researched debut novel. The Koh Kra tragedy occurred in 1979 on a 100-acre swatch of land off the coast of southern Thailand. There, a gang of fishermen intercepted a boat of Vietnamese refugees. Over the course of 22 nightmarish days the women and girls were repeatedly raped, while the men and boys were robbed, murdered or left to die at sea. The Koh Kra massacre is one of the real-life ordeals foregrounded in Pin’s heartfelt and informative portrayal of the Vietnamese refugee experience and the psychological and emotional tolls of survival and cultural assimilation.</p><p>The book opens three years after the American troops have withdrawn, with Vietnam in a state of political and economic turmoil. The mass exodus following the Vietnam war resulted in an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 dying at sea, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Wandering Souls<em> </em>examines the human cost of large-scale tragedy through the story of 16-year-old Anh, her 13-year-old brother Minh and their 10-year-old brother Thanh, who are separated from their parents and four younger siblings when the family attempts to make the perilous journey to Hong Kong on two separate boats. Tragically, only Anh, Minh and Thanh arrive at their destination.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/11/wandering-souls-by-cecile-pin-review-from-vietnam-to-london">Continue reading...</a>

And that’s when it registered. “Oh that’s not Fuzzerhead. That’s a real life bobcat.”</p><p>In the week since, Zovko and his family lost and found their beloved pup Squeakers, a 10-year-old chihuahua-dachshund mix.

<p>Portrait of the colossally successful pornography website dithers between its defenders and critics and doesn’t really tell us much</p><p>Documentaries about pornography are usually building to one of two different climactic conclusions: that porn is actually a hateful enabler of rape, or that porn is actually a sex-positive celebration of sensual pleasure. It seems to me that Suzanne Hillinger’s uncertain documentary about Pornhub isn’t exactly sure what its money shot should be.</p><p>Pornhub is the colossally successful porn site, owned by a Canadian company with the airily tech-bro name of MindGeek; for years it provided a lucrative and arguably enlightened outlet for adult content creators and models who were providing a consensual, legal service to paying customers, and who were thus able to get away from the sleazier and more exploitative side of studio-based porn and sex work. But a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html?searchResultPosition=1">2020 exposé by New York Times reporter Nicholas Kristof</a> revealed that alongside this perfectly respectable material, people were uploading rape videos and child-abuse videos and the outrage meant that Pornhub’s activities were severely curtailed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/11/money-shot-the-pornhub-story-review-netflix">Continue reading...</a>
