There is always a slight caution about such statistics \u2013 football didn\u2019t begin in 1992, you know \u2013 but three decades on the Premier League serves as a useful shorthand for the modern era. But what is perhaps more striking is that Salah is not Liverpool\u2019s all\u2011time leading scorer. That record still belongs to Ian Rush and that makes Liverpool unique among the big six clubs.</p><p>Arsenal\u2019s leading all-time scorer is Thierry Henry. Chelsea\u2019s is Frank Lampard. Manchester City\u2019s is Sergio Ag\u00fcero. Manchester United\u2019s is Wayne Rooney. Tottenham\u2019s is Harry Kane. Those are all players who are either still playing or retired in the past decade. Which, you may think, makes sense. There are more games than ever before. Careers are longer than they have ever been. Football is in an attacking phase: there are more goals per game than at any point for 60 years.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/11/premier-league-goalscoring-records-are-falling-but-what-does-that-mean\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/11/premier-league-goalscoring-records-are-falling-but-what-does-that-mean", "date_published": "2023-03-11 20:00:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "BBC apologises for disarray to sport coverage due to Lineker walkouts", "description": "<p>Broadcaster admits output will be limited, including much reduced Match of the Day, after presenters\u2019 show of solidarity</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/live/2023/mar/11/bbc-gary-lineker-match-of-the-day-alex-scott-latest-reaction-news\">Gary Lineker suspension: live reaction</a></li></ul><p>The BBC has apologised for the changes to this weekend\u2019s sporting schedule and said it is \u201cworking hard to resolve the situation and hopes to do so soon\u201d.</p><p>The broadcaster\u2019s radio and TV timetables have been left in disarray as a series of presenters pulled out of shows after Gary Lineker was told to step back from hosting Match of the Day in a row over impartiality.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/11/bbc-apologises-for-disarray-to-sport-coverage-due-to-gary-lineker-walkouts\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/11/bbc-apologises-for-disarray-to-sport-coverage-due-to-gary-lineker-walkouts", "date_published": "2023-03-11 17:24:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018We played Bournemouth\u2019s game\u2019: J\u00fcrgen Klopp rues Liverpool setback", "description": "<ul><li>Mohamed Salah missed penalty in 1-0 loss on south coast</li><li>\u2018The game was played the opposite of the way we wanted\u2019</li></ul><p>J\u00fcrgen Klopp found himself at a loss to explain how his Liverpool team, having beaten Manchester United 7-0 last Sunday, flopped to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/11/bournemouth-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">a 1-0 defeat to Bournemouth</a>.
