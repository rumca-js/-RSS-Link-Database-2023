  <p id="gsYNOM">HP is preventing more customers from using third-party ink with their printers. Numerous reports scattered across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/printers/comments/11l8b9q/hp_printer_issue/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JeannineBSmith/status/1611380539298021378?s=20">Twitter</a>, and the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fh30434.www3.hp.com%2Ft5%2FPrinter-Ink-Cartridges-Print-Quality%2FNon-HP-ink-cartridges%2Fm-p%2F8635463&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F3%2F11%2F23635168%2Fhp-printer-update-brick-third-party-ink-dynamic-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HP community</a> forum suggest that a recent printer firmware update is blocking the use of non-HP ink as part of the company’s stringent “dynamic security” policy, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/customers-fume-as-hp-blocks-third-party-ink-from-more-of-its-printers/">as first reported by <em>Ars Technica</em></a>.</p>
<p id="3H6N5i">First introduced in 2016, <a href="https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c05310148">dynamic security</a> is part of HP’s cartridge authentication process the company says should “protect the quality of our customer experience, maintain the integrity of our printing systems, and protect our intellectual property.” This means barring the use of ink or toner cartridges that do not contain “new or reused HP chips or electronic circuitry” in some printers, something HP has...</p>

<p id="NMS5Vp">It’s a big investment for a vacuum, but you have to consider that’s a $600 discount on a bot that vacuums, mops, cleans its own pads, and empties and refills itself. Robot vacuums are meant to keep your house clean on the regular without you having to lift a finger, and the X1 Omni is more hands-off than most.

  <p id="Kbu9nS">Apple’s ProRAW camera feature is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features">a powerful tool to have in your back pocket</a>. An image taken in ProRAW mode combines the same great post-processing flexibility of a traditional RAW file with the benefits of multi-frame computational photography. Kind of the best of both worlds! But once you’ve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23624251/iphone-proraw-camera-how-to-apple">gone through the steps to enable it on your iPhone</a> and have taken your photo, that’s when the real work starts: processing and converting it to a shareable format like JPEG, PNG, or HEIF. </p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="wtZR7D"><div></div></aside></div>
<p id="ucvLIi">ProRAW files are saved in Adobe’s ubiquitous DNG format, which is compatible with virtually every RAW photo editing app under the sun. That means you have a lot of options, including just sending the file to a computer and using desktop software. But you don’t...</p>

<p>Tovala reinvents the TV dinner with its connected oven combined with a meal delivery service that cooks healthy, delicious meals in under 20 minutes. But as a smart oven, it’s a disappointment.</p>

## Yes, paper-feel screen protectors for the iPad are good

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="t3U6wG">Apple’s iPad and Pencil combination makes for an excellent note-taking or digital drawing solution. But even though writing notes or creating art on the iPad has a lot of advantages over using analog pen and paper, the actual <em>feel</em> of writing with a plastic-tipped stylus on the iPad’s smooth glass isn’t great. The hard plastic of the stylus hitting the hard glass of the iPad can be noisy, slippery, and just unpleasant to use if you’re used to writing on paper.</p>
<p id="KdVjt7">Yet it doesn’t necessarily have to be that way. There is a small cottage industry of paper-feel  (or paperlike or paper-type) screen protectors for the iPad that address this issue directly. And as someone who takes handwritten notes on the iPad every single day, I now swear by...</p>

  <p id="OWhbCm">This week<em>, </em>the indie roguelike<em> Dead Cells</em> got a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/2/23618884/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-composer-music-songs-dlc">massive <em>Castlevania</em>-themed expansion</a>, the game’s fourth paid DLC. After years of wanting to play <em>Dead Cells</em>, I’ve finally started in earnest, but I feared I would be overwhelmed by everything that had come before. Turns out that I had nothing to worry about: <em>Dead Cells</em> is smartly designed so that newcomers can jump in and have a blast without already knowing about the game’s worlds, weapons, or mysteries.</p>
<p id="N53guq">As a 2D action game, it’s pretty easy to grasp the basics of <em>Dead Cells</em>. You’ll explore rooms, collect weapons, and use your arsenal to defeat various enemies that are out to get you. The roguelike elements of the game mean that you’ll frequently stumble upon new and better weapons while...</p>
