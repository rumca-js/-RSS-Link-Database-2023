The players would be allowed to compete as neutral athletes as long as they have no clear links to the military, and would be unable to wear national kit or see their flags and anthems. The IOC president, Thomas Bach, used the example of Kostyuk competing against the Russian Varvara Gracheva in the recent ATK Open final as an example of athletes competing without friction in sport, despite Kostyuk refusing to shake her opponent's hand. Kostyuk in response has said that her 'career would be over' if she refused to compete against Russians and that Ukrainian players felt 'discriminated against' by the tennis authorities.</p><p></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/28/russian-and-belarus-athletes-should-be-allowed-to-compete-as-neutrals-says-ioc"><strong>Russian and Belarus athletes should be allowed to compete as neutrals, says IOC</strong></a></p></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2023/mar/30/athletes-criticise-ioc-recommendation-to-readmit-russian-and-belarusian-athletes-video">Continue reading...</a>

New signings – especially strikers – can take their time to adapt to the Premier League, but Haaland has excelled in his first campaign in English football. If he wins the PFA award, he would be the first player to be recognised by his peers in his debut season since Ruud van Nistelrooy won the award in 2001-02. Although, if City fail to win the league, a few other players will be hoping to pip Haaland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2023/mar/30/erling-haaland-player-of-the-year-award-saka-degaard-de-bruyne">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The passing of youth is vividly drawn in this epic tale of a Swedish publisher whose wife mysteriously goes missing</p><p>Martin Berg is a Swedish publisher living in the aftermath of tragedy. More than a decade ago, his wife, a writer and academic named Cecilia, vanished one morning, leaving behind Martin and their two young children, Rakel and Elis. In her outstanding debut novel, Collected Works, translated into propulsive English by Agnes Broomé, Lydia Sandgren tells Martin’s story across two narrative timelines. The novel interweaves his youth and the progress of his life up to Cecilia’s disappearance with events in the present day, where Rakel, his daughter, is preparing a reader’s report on a German novel to which Martin has been offered the rights. It seems, astonishingly, to be about her missing mother.</p><p>It’s utterly gripping stuff, and if it didn’t weigh in at more than 700 pages, Collected Works would be one of those books one reads in a single sitting. Sandgren has constructed a delicious combination of a detective thriller with an achingly beautiful extended look at the way youth washes over a group of compelling characters in the last decades of the 20th century, only to leave them stranded in the 21st, wondering what happened. The rendering of the early lives of this core ensemble – Martin, Cecilia, and their closest friend, Gustav Becker, who becomes an internationally renowned painter but has more than a touch of Peter Pan about him, never growing up – is the central achievement of the novel. They are exquisitely drawn in all their gaucheness, their grandness, their vulnerability. It’s like the films of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-linklater" title="">Richard Linklater</a> transmuted to the page.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/30/collected-works-by-lydia-sandgren-an-outstanding-debut">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An engaging guide to Shakespeare’s most famous female role – and how it has been misread and misplayed for centuries</p><p>Sophie Duncan did not call her book Looking for Juliet, possibly because that was the name of a <a href="https://www.pirelli.com/global/en-ww/life/looking-for-juliet-we-present-the-cast-of-the-2020-pirelli-calendar" title="">Pirelli calendar </a>featuring film stars posed as exquisite, death-obsessed goths. This is just one of the artefacts Duncan, a fellow at Magdalen College, Oxford, analyses in her invigorating cultural investigation of Shakespeare’s heroine, reaching back to his source texts, forward to Taylor Swift’s song Love Story, and beyond.</p><p>Juliet enacts a “stunning rebellion against a society that deems her the property of her parents” when she marries Romeo. Shakespeare had never written a heroine like her before, and Duncan believes he created the juicy role for a particular actor, Robert Gough. Gough probably also played Rosaline in Love’s Labour’s Lost, Hero in Much Ado About Nothing and Hermia in A Midsummer Night’s Dream – all determined, diminutive brunettes beset by patriarchal forces.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/30/searching-for-juliet-by-sophie-duncan-review-the-many-faces-of-a-heroine">Continue reading...</a>
