Eight years ago, Citadel fell. The independent global spy agency—tasked to uphold the safety and security of all people—was destroyed by operatives of Manticore, a powerful syndicate manipulating the world from the shadows. With Citadel’s fall, elite agents Mason Kane (Richard Madden) and Nadia Sinh (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) had their memories wiped as they narrowly escaped with their lives. They’ve remained hidden ever since, building new lives under new identities, unaware of their pasts. Until one night, when Mason is tracked down by his former Citadel colleague, Bernard Orlick (Stanley Tucci), who desperately needs his help to prevent Manticore from establishing a new world order. Mason seeks out his former partner, Nadia, and the two spies embark on a mission that takes them around the world in an effort to stop Manticore, all while contending with a relationship built on secrets, lies, and a dangerous-yet-undying love.

The first season of Citadel consists of six episodes with two episodes premiering April 28 on Prime Video, and one episode rolling out weekly through May 26. The landmark, high-stakes drama is executive produced by the Russo Brothers’ AGBO and showrunner David Weil, and stars Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, with Stanley Tucci and Lesley Manville. Citadel will be available in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide.

From Amazon Studios and the Russo Brothers’ AGBO, Citadel is executive produced by Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Mike Larocca, Angela Russo-Otstot, and Scott Nemes for AGBO, with David Weil serving as showrunner and executive producer. Josh Appelbaum, André Nemec, Jeff Pinkner, and Scott Rosenberg serve as executive producers for Midnight Radio. Newton Thomas Sigel and Patrick Moran also serve as executive producers.

Succession is HBO’s Emmy award-winning stalwart series about Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and the perma-struggle for power between him and his children: Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong), Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin), and Siobhan Roy (Sarah Snook). While the series is currently in its last hurrah, ending after four seasons, here's a season 4 that looks back at, recaps, and analyzes the power moves, backstabbing, and dealmaking from seasons 1-3 that these characters - as well as characters like Connor Roy (Alan Ruck), Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen), Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun), Gerri Kellman (J. Smith-Cameron), Marcia Roy (Hiam Abbass), and more - have done to get to where we are now.

Season 4 sees Logan about to close his deal for GoJo founder, Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård), and the kids teaming up to, if not only beat, but surpass their father’s legacy and pave the way for their own.

Did you know that, each year, Women’s History Month has a theme as declared by the National Women’s History Month Project? In 2023, that theme is “Celebrating Women Who Tell Our Stories,” so what better time to highlight the incredible women who work in front of and behind the camera here at IGN? Some you may recognize, while others have been working behind the scenes to keep productions, stories, guides and the community as a whole rolling for years!

Women's History Month 2023 is nearly at an end, so we talked to the women of IGN to learn who would be on their A-Force (the all-female Avengers team), least favorite tropes (the strong female character, fridging, women falling down, etc), favorite protagonists, and favorite directors and developers. Women's history is so rich in both games and entertainment as a whole, and IGN's own leading ladies wanted to take a chance to highlight all of their favorites.

## The Great James Cameron Pivot: From ‘Wee Skirmish’ to Huge Climax | Avatar: The Way of Water

James Cameron warned us. Critics and naysayers said the 13-year span between 2009’s Avatar and 2022’s Avatar: The Way of Water would result in audience disinterest in all things Pandora. But Cameron doubled down and essentially promised, “If I build it, you will come”... and then showed us all the receipts. At this point, Avatar 2 has earned almost $2.3 billion dollars in worldwide box office, critical praise and four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and won Oscars for Best Achievement in Visual Effects.

The Way of Water has wowed audiences with its impressive set pieces and creature designs, using state of the art VFX and 3D to immerse audiences into the oceans of Pandora and the tech of the RDA. In particular, the final battle sequence on the massive SeaDragon vessel has had audiences clinging to their chairs and curling in tension.

Ironically, the team that had to design that sequence had no idea that it was going to be the film’s big finale… until suddenly, that’s what it was. But when you work with Jim Cameron, you gotta be ready to pivot…

This is how Avatar: The Way of Water's climactic battle scene got made!

It’s looking like Marvel Entertainment’s chairman and CEO is out at Disney, with the consumer products-focused department reportedly being folded into various other parts of the company. Isaac Perlmutter’s ousting as Marvel Entertainment’s chairman is just one of 7,000 layoffs Disney CEO Bob Iger announced as part of the company’s new ‘strategic realignment’ initiative. For the record, Marvel Entertainment is separate from Marvel Studios. Perlmutter, as the chairman of Marvel Entertainment, had quite the run, with reports of Bob Iger having to step in to stop the chairman from firing Kevin Feige back in 2015 after the two budded heads. Kevin Feige was running Marvel Studios at the time, and he’s spoken about Perlmutter pushing back on his continuous efforts to diversify the MCU. As for the planned layoff of 7,000 employees, Disney is hoping it’ll cut back on costs that tally to $5.5 billion dollars for the company. Ryan Coogler’s involvement in an X-Files reboot is likely happening, and we’ll tell you all about it. Plus, Adult Swim has plans to air earlier come May, along with a few new animated shows you might be interested in.
