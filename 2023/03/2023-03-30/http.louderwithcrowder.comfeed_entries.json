Because you know there were real people triggered by #WhatsMySnack -- where Pratt let people guess what snack he was eating that day -- because laughter and levity during the Trump years was frowned upon.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>It could very well just be five idiots. Most internet outrage is based off of five idiots with the same dumb opinion, and bloggers who want the clickbait (we can smell our own). The rub is that the faux outrage turns into real outrage when celebrities are compelled to apologize for dumb stuff just because they don't want the headlines. Chris Pratt doesn't have time for such silliness unless he's mocking the silliness. </p><p>I also find the lack of \"Chris Pratt is Over\" parties being thrown since Elon Musk took over. Prior to Elon, all it took was <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-james-gunn-thor\" target=\"_self\">Pratt showing up in the Thor trailer</a> for \"Twitter\" to \"demand\" Pratt be canceled. Or, when the actor <a href=\"https://www.theblaze.com/news/chris-pratt-pilloried-daughter-classy-faith-based-statements\" target=\"_blank\">would post something about his family</a>. You see, the knock on Pratt (by idiots) is that he likes Jesus, America, and hunting. And because he uses his platform to make millions of people happy and NOT attack Trump supporters, leftists hate him. Presumably, the same leftists who would curate what they wanted to trend on Twitter.</p><p>Then, other leftists who hate him and who work in digital media would write about how Pratt was being canceled on Twitter. It was a never-ending cycle.</p><p>It turns out that when Twitter employees don't have their finger on the scale, Twitter users don't care about the topics those Twitter employees want them to care about. Like, for example, one of the few A-List actors who doesn't validate the now former Twitter employees' worldviews. Go figure.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Gerald highlighted how, after making these comments, Provorov's jersey sold out. </p><p>Another clip showed Reimer explaining that he has to not only believe in, but also live out his Christian faith. Gerald then highlighted an article from The Atlantic that claims Russian players are only doing this because they're scared for their safety in Russia, as well as calls from sports commentators for the players to go back to the country they came from. Which, until today, we all thought was a highly racist and completely unacceptable comment. But it's apparently fine only when you're talking about Eastern European athletes, and they should be forced to violate their religious beliefs. For \"gay visibility,\" or something. </p><p>Amidst all this hullaballoo, the NFL commissioner spoke about potentially ending Pride Nights, since they make players uncomfortable.  Crowder pointed out how boycotts like these are proof that they work, and that they're the only way to bridge the gap between citizens and corporations. </p><p>All in all, this was a much-needed win, particularly in light of the recent news cycle.

An over-9-foot alligator, to be precise. </p><p>Mr. Gator was just wandering around the neighborhood at approximately 1AM when the officers first encountered him. Video shows the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nashville-police-bodycam-footage\" target=\"_blank\">officers</a> cornering the alligator as it snaps at them. Two of the officers then sit on him from behind, pushing his mouth closed. Another officer comes in to duct tape his mouth shut. The officers reportedly stayed like this to keep him restrained until the certified gator trapper arrived, and it took four men to load the gator into the car. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cA SCALY SITUATION \\ud83d\\udc0a Tampa police officers wrangled a 9-foot alligator found wandering through a neighborhood intersection early this morning.

He told a local news station that the Tampa Police Department typically doesn't get \"down and dirty\" when it comes to trapping gators. As to where the alligator may have originated from, Walters said he could have journeyed from a nearby river that connects to the road via a creek.</p><p> It seems this isn't a rare issue during mating season. Walters <a href=\"https://www.fox13news.com/news/tampa-police-trap-a-nearly-10-foot-alligator-on-howard-avenue\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a>, <em>\"This time of year for whatever reason they start walking around, looking for love, looking for new places to eat \u2013 they\u2019re hungry. This is the time of year to be really aware of your surroundings. Look where you put your feet and hands. Look before you jump in the pool. I take them out of pools this time of year. Look before you walk out the door. If you have a doggy door, look before you step out of bed.\"</em></p><p>Walters said he's already captured 10 other gators in the past week. He also said it's important for citizens to have situational awareness about potential rogue gators, since hitting one with a car would completely total the vehicle. Which makes sense, given that the creature is basically a dinosaur. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

And by \"feisty\" I mean borderline unhinged. </p><p>Bowman was very upset over the recent <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nashville-police-bodycam-footage\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville shooting</a>. As we all are. But he placed the blame on Republicans who don't want to ban guns. Bowman called his Republican colleagues \"cowards\" and repeatedly put his hands on Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201chttps://t.co/giNVWLiwSd\\u201d</div> \u2014 Davy Jones (@Davy Jones)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itsNTBmedia/status/1641240485397254146\">1680137199</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>\"Why the hell won't you do anything to save America's children? Let them explain that all the way up until election day 2024 [...] They're freaking cowards. They're gutless.\" </em></p><p>At this point, Rep. Massie strolled right up to him to ask what the heck he was talking about. Bowman screamed in reply, <em>\"I'm talking about gun violence.\" </em></p><p>Massie then pointed out there's never been a school shooting in a school that allows teachers to carry. Which Bowman did not like at all. He screamed about how \"more guns lead to more death\" before he began grabbing Massie and yelling about \"data\". Remember, these people run our country. Apparently. </p><p>How did Bowman feel about his little outburst? Well, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepBowman/status/1641219152303013889?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">posted it to Twitter</a> afterwards with the caption,<em> \"Republicans won't do SH*T when it comes to gun violence, but try to tell me to calm down. NO. We can't calm down. People are dying everyday while we wait.\"</em></p><p>So he must be pretty proud. What's really irritating is, Democrats aren't doing anything to stop gun violence either. They always yell about banning assault weapons and beat their fists in emotional speeches. But they're empty speeches. They play on people's emotions and create the illusion of action. Nothing is ever <em>actually</em> done. It's always a campaign for the next election cycle. </p><p>Better security for schools is such a simple, logical first step. So of course our lawmakers will never get it passed. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Particularly when it comes to Gen Z. People are hooked on their social media feeds. It's causing short-term memory loss. IQ scores are going down. It's a problem, and it's one I've been concerned about myself for the past few years. Starting with a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kevin-hart-roughing-passer\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Hart</a> clip from <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-joe-rogan\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Rogan's podcast</a>.</p><p>Hart shared a story about when he realized his smartphone had turned into more of a curse than a blessing.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n<span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n<small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Kevin Hart on the Dark Side of Social Media | Joe Rogan</small>\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/KCe2MMhpkis\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be</a>\n</small>\n</p>\n<p>Hart makes two key points. One is the sudden realization of how addicted and reliant we've all become on our smartphones. For him, it was when his phone died while he was on a road trip and realized how little he knew without his phone: where to go, who to call, etc. </p><p>My sister lives three blocks away. I pick up my nieces and nephew from school all the time. If my phone ever died, I wouldn't know my sister's phone number without scrolling through my phone to find it. And even then, it's not the number. It's her name. If my phone ever died during a road trip, I'd still be pulled over to the side of the road.</p><p>The other Hart point was putting the phone away at a certain point of the day, and being present with his family. It's like the drug commercial from the 80s, \"I LEARNED IT FROM WATCHING YOU.\" Kids pick up their device habits because we as adults always have ours in our hands.</p><p>It was after watching this clip I started to look at my own life and how addicted I am to \"the scroll.\" These are three changes I made:</p><p><strong>No phones at the dinner table. </strong>It's funny because adults fight me on this more than kids do.</p><p><strong>Wear a watch.</strong> Part of the problem is I'm always grabbing my phone to check the time. Then I scroll through Twitter and check email before putting my phone back in my pocket...forgetting to check the time. Wearing a watch cuts down on that.</p><p><strong>Listen to vinyl. </strong>Aka records, as opposed to Spotify or Music. In the olden days, you had media collections and a single stereo. Now I have my iPhone and eleventy different Bluetooth speakers. I love music but grew dependent on my phone to listen to it. Then when I would be listening to Spotify since my phone was in my hand I'd be too busy scrolling to listen to the music I had on. Putting on a record is my way to completely get off the grid for an hour or so.</p><p>You have to retrain your brain to accept the world will get along fine without you if you aren't connected to it 24/7. DeSantis stans and Trump marks will still be fighting. People will still argue over movies. The news will be every bit of \"everything sucks,\" \"everything is terrible,\" and \"oh my God, someone do something\" without you tweeting about it.</p><p>Take care of yourself first. Disconnect.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

It's a breeding ground for web content. Though while the Waffle House tends to be more about <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-grits\" target=\"_blank\">throwing hands</a> and/or <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-cook-shares-story\" target=\"_blank\">throwing chairs</a>, Walmart is where people go to have psychotic episodes. Our latest example is this specimen, choosing the pool-noodle aisle to go bowling and make a political statement about both Black-Americans and her vagina.</p><p>I believe this video is from last year, but it's getting a fresh look on Twitter this week.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><a href=\"https://t.co/lzvWgcI7An\">pic.twitter.com/lzvWgcI7An</a><br />\u2014 Clown World \u2122 \ud83e\udd21 (@ClownWorld_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClownWorld_/status/1640897718917931009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 29, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'm curious what this specimen's rationale is. What was the thought process or defining incident that led to her making a political statement in the aisle of Walmart?</p><p>For a while, black lives were the only ones that matter. If you said any other lives mattered, you weren't showing equity. And FORGET saying that \"all lives matter.\" That's the most racist thing you can say. It's the hard-R of lives mattering.</p><p>Then trans lives came along, and black lives dropped on the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings. Though black lives still rank above women, who on the regular get told <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-university-pittsburgh-speech\" target=\"_blank\">by trans lives</a> they <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out\" target=\"_blank\">don't matter at all</a>.</p><p>This brings us to this lady. Is she saying that black lives DON'T matter? And \"my pussy\" is her version of a deez nuts joke? Or is it that she dreams of a world where her pussy matters at least as much as black lives? We're at a point in the 2020s where it's hard to tell what is woke progressism and what is unhinged lunacy.</p><p>We're just thankful someone had their camera out. Always remember to do it for the content, folks.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
