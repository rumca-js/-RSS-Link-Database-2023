<p>Liverpool need to close gap on former title rivals, Jesus key for Arsenal and Hodgson returns for relegation six-pointer</p><p>Over four seasons, there was a single Premier League point between them. This season there are 19 points between Manchester City and Liverpool. City still don’t have things their own way: Erling Haaland’s presence remains a double-edged sword. Without Haaland’s goals, Arsenal would be on a title victory lap while with the Norwegian – an injury doubt for Saturday’s match – City have never quite hit the fluency shown when they were duking it out with Liverpool over those years. By contrast Jürgen Klopp’s problems run rather deeper than implanting a guaranteed goal-machine. Virgil van Dijk was criticised this week by the Dutch legends Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten for his leadership style. And even though Stefan Bajcetic is only 18, losing him for the season was a blow. Liverpool, though, retain significant danger, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/05/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Manchester United found out</a>, and as Guardiola recognised after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/16/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">losing 1-0 at Anfield in October</a> to a Mo Salah strike. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p><p><em>Manchester City v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p><p><em>Chelsea v Aston Villa, Saturday 5.30pm</em></p><p><em>Arsenal v Leeds, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Crystal Palace v Leicester, Saturday 3pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/31/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>

## What does Donald Trump’s indictment say about US democracy? | Jan-Werner Mueller

<p>The fact that there is no choreographed political theater around the indictment is precisely how democracies tend to work: in a messy and piecemeal fashion</p><p>So it finally happened. Trump has been indicted. For Democrats and scattered anti-Trumpers on the right, it will probably feel not nearly as satisfying or generate as much schadenfreude as they imagined. In fact, it might seem positively anticlimactic.</p><p>After all, Trump did not get indicted for his political crimes and misdemeanors. Other investigations may still catch up with him. But the fact that there is no choreographed political theater is precisely how democracies tend to work: messy, piecemeal, ensuring that there is no impunity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/30/what-does-donald-trumps-indictment-say-about-us-democracy">Continue reading...</a>

## Chelsea into WCL semi-finals after dramatic penalty win against Lyon

<p>Battling, bruised and almost buried. The goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger was the hero as Chelsea booked a place in the Champions League semi-finals on penalties after Emma Hayes’ side had pulled the aggregate score with the European champions, Lyon, level deep into extra time. Sara Däbritz’s strike in the 110th minute had seemingly put eight-time winners Lyon into the final four after Vanessa Gilles’s second-half goal cancelled out the slender advantage Guro Reiten’s strike had given the Blues in the first leg.</p><p>But Lauren James was deemed to have been felled by Vicki Becho after a VAR check and Maren Mjelde’s penalty levelled things. It was the final action of the game and, after four penalties scored in the shootout, Berger saved Wendie Renard’s spotkick but James’s effort was similarly pushed away by Christiane Endler. It came down to the final kick, and Berger pushed away Lindsey Horan’s effort to give Chelsea a 4-3 shootout victory and send the rapt home crowd into ecstasy. Barcelona now await them in the semi-finals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/30/chelsea-lyon-womens-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This look at the icons of Black creativity in the US sees the actor on infectious form. But he fails to offer any insight on complex issues – leaving this documentary feeling jolly, but bland</p><p>David Harewood may be British, but on screen he feels like an old-school Hollywood star. The low timbre of his voice and his broad-shouldered physique somehow evoke the leading men of days gone by, and even without his knack for American accents it would be easy to buy him on screen alongside one of his heroes, Sidney Poitier. But that is not an accident and, as is the case for many Black Britons, Harewood has a profound connection to Black American culture, which shaped him as both a performer and a man.</p><p>Harewood’s two-part programme Get On Up: The Triumph of Black America sees him travel across the US to meet many of the icons he holds dearest. Sadly, Poitier died last year, but many others at the forefront of Black American creativity sit down with Harewood and share just what it took for them to succeed. He learns to moonwalk from Shalamar’s Jeffrey Daniel (the brains behind Michael Jackson’s signature move). He spends time with John Amos, who recalls playing Kunta Kinte in Roots with his signature velvety baritone. And he giggles with the first Black Bond Girl, Gloria Hendry, as she recalls snogging Roger Moore in Live and Let Die.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/30/get-on-up-the-triumph-of-black-america-review-david-harewood-bbc-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

## Arsenal Women making Emirates Stadium their home would be giant leap forward | Suzanne Wrack

<p>Sharing centre stage with the men’s team no longer feels like a distant dream and could push other clubs to do the same</p><p>As Leah Williamson and Jonas Eidevall reflected at the Emirates Stadium on Arsenal’s success in reaching the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in 10 years, they had more than exciting upcoming fixtures on their minds. Captain and manager were united in stating it was a realistic vision for the team to play every game at the club’s 60,000-capacity ground.</p><p>It would be a huge statement for Arsenal to relocate there and the discussion alone demonstrates how quickly the conversation has moved on. In the WSL, Leicester play at the King Power Stadium and Reading at the Select Car Leasing Stadium used by their men’s team, but the impact of one of the top sides – England’s most successful women’s football team – putting their women’s team on the stage previously reserved for their premier product would be enormous.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/30/arsenal-women-emirates-stadium-move-comment">Continue reading...</a>

Pioneer of stage improvisation who freed drama from scripts in London and built on this approach in Canada<p>In 1967 Keith Johnstone, who has died aged 90, formed an improvisation troupe, Theatre Machine, with the actors Ben Benison, Roddy Maude-Roxby, Richard Morgan and Anthony Trent. Starting as an educational demonstration of the techniques that Keith had developed while running the Royal Court Theatre Studio in London, the project soon developed into a variety evening of longer improvised playlets interspersed with short sketches. Keith acted as emcee, calling out prompts and suggestions to the improvisers.</p><p>With a new fringe theatre circuit an active part of the emerging counterculture, Theatre Machine were soon invited to festivals all over mainland Europe. Performing to audiences who did not always understand English, the group rapidly developed their skills in slapstick and clowning. When a critic from the Stage newspaper observed that the work of the company was too polished to be unscripted, he was invited back on a subsequent evening to prove that they were indeed making it all up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/30/keith-johnstone-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The government has chosen oil and gas over renewables, increasing the climate threat</p><p>To say that Rishi Sunak’s government has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/29/uk-scientists-rishi-sunak-oil-and-gas-developments-climate-crisis" title="">chosen the “path of climate vandalism”</a>, as Labour’s Ed Miliband did this week, is no exaggeration. The policies contained in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/30/half-baked-half-hearted-critics-ridicule-uk-long-awaited-climate-strategy" title="">energy plan</a> announced on Thursday are dangerous.

As prime minister, he is steering the UK even further away from the course towards speedy decarbonisation that we should be on. In the long term, climate will surely top the list of public policy failures during this long period of Tory government.</p><p>Hundreds of leading scientists wrote to Mr Sunak’s government this week, calling for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/29/uk-scientists-rishi-sunak-oil-and-gas-developments-climate-crisis" title="">an end to new oil and gas developments</a>. The government is set to defy them with plans for a huge North Sea oilfield, which it attempts to justify on the grounds that it is investing £20bn (over 20 years) in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, in order to limit the damage caused. The scientists are right. The politicians and their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/tory-partys-35m-dirty-donations-revealed-by-desmog-analysis" title="">fossil fuel industry backers</a> are wrong.

<p>This week’s heightened threat level is umbilically connected to the continued absence of democratic government</p><p>A year ago, in March 2022, the terror threat level in Northern Ireland was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/northern-ireland-terrorism-threat-level-lowered-for-first-time-in-12-years" title="">lowered</a> for the first time in more than a decade. This week, however, that window of hope was slammed shut once again, when the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, announced that the threat level was being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/28/northern-ireland-terrorism-threat-level-mi5" title="">restored</a> to “severe”. This means that a terror attack in the north is now officially deemed to be “highly likely”. These are extraordinarily ominous words, not solely because there is less than a month to go before the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/good-friday-agreement" title="">agreement</a>, which brought power-sharing and peace to Northern Ireland.</p><p>In his <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/northern-ireland-related-terrorism-threat-level-raised" title="">statement</a> on Tuesday about the threat level, Mr Heaton-Harris pointed the finger at an increase in politically motivated violence. He singled out the targeting of police officers, exemplified by the shooting of DCI John Caldwell in Omagh in February, and by a bomb attack on police in Strabane in November, both attributed to the New IRA. Yet the threat to peace does not emanate from dissident republicans alone. There have been pipe bomb and petrol bomb attacks on homes in Ards and North Down this week, all of which are part of a continuing drugs war between rival<a href="https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/five-people-expelled-from-donaghadee-as-uda-feud-rumbles-on/195249848.html" title=""> loyalist UDA gangs</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/30/the-guardian-view-on-northern-ireland-violence-in-a-political-vacuum">Continue reading...</a>

The UK justice system is stuck in the dark ages, 28 March</a>). That Grey should have been held solely responsible for the death of a cyclist using the pavement is a travesty of justice. Grey was visually and cognitively impaired and, as a consequence, only dimly perceived a threat and overreacted to a fear for her own safety. That the judge failed to understand those mitigating circumstances is regrettable.</p><p>The local authority was unable to ascertain whether the walkway was a shared facility for pedestrians and cyclists. But even if it had been a shared-use path, there is a duty on both parties to use it safely. When the Department for Transport first proposed the introduction of shared-use paths, blind and visually impaired people made strenuous objections. The first involved signage: a visually impaired or blind person would not be able to see this. The second involved the acceptance that a cyclist was effectively silent, so a blind person could not determine a cyclist’s approach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/30/the-auriol-grey-case-exposes-britains-obsession-with-prison">Continue reading...</a>

How, then, for the 10 years for which there’s information on the BBC website, is there an average of 10.9 Oxbridge colleges competing each year, out of a total of 28 entrants? A yearly miracle?

## Reports of rotten pork being sold in UK may lead to tighter control of FSA

<p>Therésè Coffey may bring Food Standards Agency, which oversees England, Wales and Northern Ireland, under remit of Defra</p><p>The UK government is considering tightening control over the Food Standards Agency (FSA) following news that allegedly fraudulent pork products found their way on to UK supermarket shelves.<br /><br />On Thursday, Therésè Coffey, secretary of state for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), told the House of Commons that she will look at bringing the FSA, under her department’s control.<br /><br />Coffey’s statement followed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/29/inquiry-launched-after-foreign-pork-is-allegedly-sold-as-british">an investigation</a> by trade publication, <a href="https://www.fwi.co.uk/news/exclusive-mass-food-fraud-and-safety-scandal-engulfs-sector">Farmers Weekly</a>, which found that until at least the end of 2020, one of the UK’s top food manufacturers has sold mislabelled and sometimes rotten meat to retailers.<br /><br />Meat produced by the supplier, as yet unnamed, is reported to have ended up in products such as ready meals, quiches, sandwiches and other produce sold in Tesco, Asda, Co-op, Morrisons and Marks &amp; Spencer. <br /><br />The FSA, a <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/about-us/fsa-board-meetings">non-ministerial agency</a> currently overseen by the Department of Health and Social Care, which is responsible for public health in relation to food in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, has launched an investigation into the alleged supply chain fraud.<br /><br />Defra minister of state Sir Robert Goodwill told the Guardian that having talked to the Farmers Weekly team behind the investigation, and read the reports, it was “obvious that the FSA inspectors appear to have been misled by the company, which hid the suspect meat, sometimes in lorries or in other parts of the factory, during the time it took for the inspectors to have a cup of tea and put on their protective clothing on.”<br /><br />“We could be looking at people going to prison because of how serious this all is,” he added.<br /><br />Goodwill said he had “naively assumed FSA was reporting to Defra but actually it was arm’s length and part of the Department of Health and Social Care, which tends to come to it from a health point of view, rather than being closer to the supply chain as Defra would be.”</p><p>Asked if a government inquiry might be launched into the supplier, Goodwill said enquires can take time but that a “one-day evidence session … with people from the FSA” was a possibility.<br /><br />Any full-blown inquiry might wait until investigations were completed, he said. “We don’t want to undermine the prosecution. But we [the House of Commons cross-party environment food and rural affairs select committee] will be discussing what course of action to take after the Easter recess.” <br /><br />Defra’s farm minister, Mark Spencer, said he had met FSA and hoped it would deliver a criminal prosecution. “We will be keeping a close eye on the investigation,” he said. “And we’ll leave that with the Food Standards Agency to deliver a criminal prosecution.”<br /><br />Spencer said he would not make any further statement on Thursday because of the “ongoing criminal investigation” that involved “very serious allegations”, which the FSA had a responsibility to investigate. Spencer added that he is in regular contact with both the meat industry and the FSA.<br /><br />The Farmers Weekly investigation found that tens of thousands of tonnes of foreign pork, mislabelled as British, had found its way into the supply chain each week. The supplier has also been accused by former employees of regularly “washing” visibly bad hams in salt water, and of mixing rotting pork with fresh product for further processing.<br /><br />On Wednesday, Darren Davies, head of the FSA’s national food crime unit (NFCU), said the agency was “carrying out a criminal investigation into how a supplier was allegedly providing products labelled as British when they were in fact sourced from elsewhere.”<br /><br />Davies said the investigation was “complex” and that “all new lines of enquiry … including any potential food hygiene breaches at the premises” were being perused. “If any evidence of a food safety risk is found, then necessary action will be taken,” he said.<br /><br />Last year, Davies said, the FSA “advised retailers … to check their cooked meat supply chain and to apply extra due diligence in their checks. We don’t give out these alerts without a reason.” Davies warned too that the cost of living crisis could mean that food fraud increases as suppliers face pressure to turn a profit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/rotten-pork-sold-in-uk-may-lead-to-tighter-control-of-food-safety-body-fsa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Lisa Kudrow’s comic ditty in Friends, to the supposedly world-defining music of Daisy Jones &amp; the Six, writing songs for television characters isn’t easy. Just ask the brains behind it …</p><p>Taylor Jenkins Reid’s 2019 novel Daisy Jones &amp; the Six was practically made for television: charting the rise and fall of a 70s rock band that bears more than a little similarity to Fleetwood Mac, it’s filled with secret affairs, cocaine-fuelled fights and a cast of cool, stylish characters. There is one problem in putting it on screen, though: the music. In Jenkins Reid’s book, the Six are painted as one of the defining rock bands of all time, an overnight success story that went on to redefine popular music. How, exactly, do you go about writing songs <em>that</em> good?</p><p>For a music supervisor – the crew member charged with finding the right musicians to bring the fictional Best Band of All Time to life – it’s an uphill battle. Frankie Pine, music supervisor for Amazon’s recent adaptation of Daisy Jones, says she wasn’t hung up on finding musicians who could achieve the impossible task of recreating, say, Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams. Instead, she sought to find someone who could make a record that sounded convincingly 1970s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/30/my-kids-friends-wear-smelly-cat-t-shirts-tv-insiders-on-creating-unforgettable-onscreen-songs">Continue reading...</a>

Time was when the SNP didn’t think 52% to 48% a proper margin of victory. He would have liked something more convincing. A mandate of which he could boast. That all was well in the good ship SNP.

These two worlds are connected by an ironclad thread.</p><p>The Manchester Guardian’s founder and early backers were thoroughly embedded, leading members of the city’s industrial elite.

On this particular night, Paulini had the gall to front the judges while wearing a fitted dress.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/31/fat-shaming-body-fatphobic-now-is-the-time-to-speak-out-against-fatphobia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s kind to take your mother’s feelings into account, says advice columnist <strong>Eleanor Gordon-Smith</strong>.

We are due to get married in September in an already pared-down wedding day (we cancelled our original plans when I realised how anxious and unhappy the idea of the “big day” was making me). Now, even though we have planned a small “big day” I am still feeling nervous.</strong></p><p><strong>I think I want to elope – an idea my fiance is very much on board with. What’s stopping me is the thought of my mum’s hurt and disappointment if she doesn’t get to see her one daughter get married. I have a complicated relationship with my mum which I have worked through in therapy and am now at peace with. However, as one of three children who have all “disappointed” her in some way, I feel I carry the responsibility to do this one thing for her. Earlier this year I told her I wasn’t going to have children – a hard decision and hard to tell her. Her disappointment was palpable. I feel by eloping I may be being selfish.

## Figure skating isn’t seen as extreme, but learning in my 40s I found ice extremely hard | Andrew Herrick

I was in a rut. I needed to get fit or wind up permanently wedged into that rut by middle-age spread. For too many of my peers, their surrender to gravity was apparent in changes of poise, from vertical to slumped, spry to idle. I wanted to stay uprightly mobile for as long as I could.</p><p>The need wasn’t just physical. It had to be something that would launch me from the weekly grind so I wouldn’t dwell, as Nick Carraway had, on my thinning hair and thinning briefcase of enthusiasm.

I needed to fan them back to life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/31/figure-skating-isnt-seen-as-extreme-but-learning-in-my-40s-i-found-ice-extremely-hard">Continue reading...</a>

What are your memories of this taboo-breaking event? </strong><em>VerulamiumParkRanger<br /></em>Well, I remember being very nervous about the whole thing. Then I got over it. Then I was worried about how my parents, who lived in a quiet suburban area of Liverpool, would cope. I thought: “My poor mum! The neighbours will be whispering: ‘Did you see your daughter on television?’” By the time we came to record, this great director [Peter Gill] didn’t make a fuss and said: “So this is the bit where they kiss … All right, quick kiss, let’s carry on.” I was just nervous about people’s reactions. But my mum was great, and the neighbours got over it quickly.</p><p><strong>What do you think Wendy in <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/27982-life-is-sweet">Life Is Sweet</a> actually thought of Aubrey and have you ever tried saveloy on a bed of lychees, prawn in jam, trotter with eggs or pilchard curry? </strong><em>Vhsstilllives and EddieChorepost<br /></em>The easy answer to those last ones is: no. Even the descriptions make me feel sick. Wendy was fond of Aubrey and thought he was an idiot, but a nice idiot. She was trying to help him. The bit I love the most is when he starts kissing her feet, and she says: “I might have trod in dog poo.” He was a ridiculous guy who would do anything to make an impression.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/30/alison-steadman-we-filmed-the-sex-scene-in-the-new-forest-so-it-was-quite-prickly">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Jones/Omordia/BBC Concert Orchestra/Andrews<br />(Resonus Classics)<br /></strong>The BBC Concert Orchestra bounce off the coiled spring of Martin Jones’s piano playing as moments of reflective beauty shine through in previously unrecorded works</p><p>Even the ostensibly better-known British female composers have much music that is yet to be recorded. This is the first recording of <a href="https://www.fabermusic.com/we-represent/elizabeth-maconchy">Elizabeth Maconchy</a>’s 1941 Dialogue for Piano and Orchestra and the same goes for the two works by <a href="https://britishmusiccollection.org.uk/composer/elisabeth-lutyens">Elisabeth Lutyens</a>.</p><p>It’s the Maconchy – essentially a concerto in four movements, each less than five minutes long – that makes the strongest immediate impression. What’s remarkable is the tautness of her invention: everything grows out of a rising figure comprising just two notes, from the stark, marmoreal opening through a perky, rhythmically tricksy second movement and a funereal third to the scampering finale. It packs a punch, with the BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by John Andrews, bouncing off the coiled spring of Martin Jones’s piano playing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/30/maconchy-lutyens-and-wallen-works-for-piano-and-orchestra-review-first-time-recordings-pack-a-punch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Conservatives are cynically using carbon capture and storage as a get-out-of-jail card for the fossil fuel sector</p><p>Crossing fingers and hoping for the best is hardly a sensible way to tackle the climate emergency, but it is a strategy that the government seems determined to follow. Today, it launched its revised net zero plan, which turns out to be more a damp squib than a rocket that will ignite a desperately needed green transformation of the energy landscape. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/30/half-baked-half-hearted-critics-ridicule-uk-long-awaited-climate-strategy">Widely dismissed</a> as half-baked and utterly lacking in ambition, it pledges no new money and most of the initiatives flagged are based on government commitments that have already been touted. The truth is that the entire exercise is a smoke-and-mirrors attempt to conceal the fact that business as usual remains the order of the day.</p><p>At the heart of the strategy is the intention to unleash a new wave of UK oil and gas exploration – an astonishing and, frankly, dangerous path to take at the height of a climate emergency that is set to deepen year on year, in the absence of massive cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The government is attempting to justify the unjustifiable by talking up a technology known as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/government-gambles-on-carbon-capture-and-storage-tech-despite-scientists-doubts">carbon capture and storage</a> (CCS), which seeks to apprehend carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) before it gets into the atmosphere and store it underground.

## ‘Why am I crying over this?’: how corecore TikTok videos caught the mood of Gen Z

<p>Sad clips from films, TV shows and TikTok are being spliced together over melancholy music – and they’re raising a smile among hopeless young people</p><p>Jimmy Nguyen, an 18-year-old student, saw his first “corecore” video on TikTok in January. He can’t remember which one it was – there are so many of them now. But he says it was typical of this new trend of video: other TikTok videos, celebrity or podcaster interviews, TV show and film clips spliced together over some sad or ambient music. They’re depressing, full of existential dread and usually and always broadly speaking on the theme of disconnection and alienation. Nguyen initially thought, like other users, that these videos were a joke. They’re crudely edited and the name in itself is a sarcastic reference to the proliferation of <a href="https://fashionista.com/2022/08/core-style-aesthetics-fashion-style-glossary-gen-z">micro-trends</a> emerging from TikTok since 2020. But he was soon staying up late at night in his bedroom making corecore of his own.</p><p>“As I was making my first video I started to really see myself expressing how I was feeling and it felt relieving because I didn’t have anyone to talk to and explaining my emotions is hard,” he tells me. “But that video felt like an exit or gateway to those feelings.” In it, clips of Lee Jung-jae, the lead in Squid Game smiling broadly and falsely at the camera, someone recounting how in school kids would ask which super power you’d want out of invisibility and flying but he says “I’m already invisible” and Jake Gyllenhall in Stronger<em> </em>(2017) screaming “Why do you even want me? I’m such a fuck up!” run into each other over a morose Arcade Fire track. Now Nguyen makes these videos in an attempt to help people, he says, to let them know that they’re not alone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/30/corecore-tiktok-videos-gen-z">Continue reading...</a>

## Theodora review – a searing performance of Handel’s own favourite oratorio

<p><strong>Barbican, London<br /></strong>Period music powerhouse Arcangelo gave the alternately poignant and earth-quaking arias the deluxe treatment in this unstaged yet dramatic concert performance</p><p>Handel’s Theodora is one of classical music’s reminders that audience tastes change – sometimes radically. The oratorio was considered a failure at its Covent Garden premiere in 1750 and was pulled after only three performances. Even the theatrical austerity of Lent had failed to persuade opera-goers that a work about Christian martyrdom was a good night out. These days, though, there are recordings galore and the oratorio Handel apparently considered his best (move over, Messiah!) has enjoyed high-profile stagings by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/27/how-we-made-theodora">Peter Sellars at Glyndebourne</a>, Christof Loy at Salzburg and, most recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/01/theodora-review-katie-mitchell-handel-royal-opera-house-london">Katie Mitchell at the Royal Opera House</a>.</p><p>This Barbican outing from period-performance powerhouse Arcangelo and their artistic director Jonathan Cohen was emphatically unstaged – albeit with “on-” and “off-stage” seating for the soloists. In fact it’s remarkable that the performance communicated so searingly when the shattering final seconds of various numbers involved another singer creeping on to the middle of the stage for the next scene, and when there were always too many chairs but never enough music stands. Like it or not, even concert performances have a visual element.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/30/theodora-review-handel-arcangelo-barbican">Continue reading...</a>

<p>His wobbly blocks of high-key colours, painted while listening to Miles Davis, have made Whitney America’s greatest Black abstract artist. As a new show opens in the UK, he relives his tough early days</p><p>I’m early, but the gallery receptionist tells me that Stanley will be right down. Right down from where, I wonder. The artist, Stanley Whitney, has<a href="https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2023/stanley-whitney-there-will-be-song/"> an exhibition of new work opening this week at Gagosian</a> in London and will be spending the next couple of months in Paris with his wife Marina Adams, who is also an artist. So, here I am at the gallery’s sleek outpost off the Champs-Élysées. Whitney appears and says, “We’re staying in Larry’s apartment upstairs,” smiling as he hears the words out loud, then laughing at how inconceivable they sound. That’s Larry as in Larry Gagosian, titan of the art world, owner of the international chain of galleries.</p><p>The 77-year-old Whitney is the greatest Black abstract artist in America, and his patchwork canvases composed of wobbly blocks of high-key colours are now in great demand. Some works on paper have <a href="https://artbma.org/exhibition/stanley-whitney-dance-with-me-henri">been on show at the Baltimore Museum of Art</a> since last November, and he’s working towards a major retrospective at the <a href="https://buffaloakg.org/">Buffalo AKG Art Museum</a>, due next year. How does it feel to look back over his career? “Awful!” he replies, letting out another laugh, louder this time. “I am excited, but I’m trying to move forward rather than look through old work and wonder why I didn’t keep doing it. I mean, I probably would have if anyone had been interested.” Recognition has been a long time coming.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/30/stanley-whitney-black-abstract-artist-larry-gagosian-new-york">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The way to make tired formats seem bold and exciting? Stick in 100 participants! Or at least the makers of Physical: 100 and Dance 100 certainly think so …</p><p>Over the past two decades, reality shows have been a constant presence in TV schedules. Cheap and quick to produce, it didn’t take long for us to have seen it all: a litany of dating shows, a slew of survival competitions. There is little that hasn’t been already done. So producers are increasingly turning to a new trick to stop the genre from becoming repetitive: size. Or at least taking a would-be ordinary show and packing 100 contestants into the format.</p><p>This month’s Netflix dance competition, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/17/dance-100-review-netflix-choreography-competition">Dance 100,</a> sees 100 of the world’s best dancers performing routines that are choreographed by eight contestants. In a twist, it’s down to those 100 dancers to decide who stays in the competition and who gets eliminated. The sheer scale of the operation leads to high stakes TV, with the choreographers struggling as they have to translate their routines into ever-bigger performances as their group swells in size, from 25, to 50 to the titular 100. The dynamic of dealing with the giant cast seems to lend itself to tensions as entertaining as the routines. Multiple clashes unfold, as mob mentality from the judging horde at times turns a dance contest into a popularity contest. The silly number of dancers involved turns what could easily have been a forgettable show into something more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/30/physical-100-dance-100-reality-tv-contestants">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Stones Throw)</strong><br />The 56-year-old singer of Charles &amp; Eddie fame is back with a second album of tightly written melodies and abstract tracks that draw you in to a rich, heady world</p><p>It was hard not to notice a tone of amazement about the glowing reviews of Eddie Chacon’s debut solo album, Pleasure, Joy and Happiness. Whatever musical highlights people expected 2020 to bring, a warped soul album by a 56-year-old singer, working with a producer who had previously collaborated with Harry Styles, Solange and Frank Ocean, wasn’t among them. Nor was a comeback by one half of Charles &amp; Eddie, previously filed away alongside Tasmin Archer and Tony Di Bart in a drawer marked early 90s one-hit wonders. No matter that Charles &amp; Eddie had been a more substantial proposition than most of said drawer’s other denizens, as anyone who listened to the charming retro-soul of their 1992 album Duophonic would tell you.</p><p>Their debut single Would I Lie to You? was the kind of hit that achieves what you might call obliterating ubiquity: a global smash that succeeded in overshadowing everything else its authors did. Under the circumstances, you couldn’t blame Chacon for walking away, which he eventually did, becoming a photographer and creative director after his erstwhile partner Charles Pettigrew’s death from cancer in 2001. And yet, nearly 30 years after Chacon’s solitary hit, and apparently out of nowhere, here was Pleasure, Joy and Happiness, an understated, left-field triumph, Chacon’s plaintive but emollient voice drifting over collaborator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jun/29/jazz-funk-guru-john-carroll-kirby">John Carroll Kirby</a>’s gauzy, off-beam synths, samples and electric piano, singing songs that seemed to speak of hard-won experience: Trouble, Hurt, My Mind Is Out of Its Mind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/30/eddie-chacon-sundown-review-delightful-career-renaissance-for-former-one-hit-wonder">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Descendants of the west Africans who picked the cotton that made Manchester rich are struggling to keep their distinct culture alive</p><p>Dorcas, who was 17 and picked Sea Island cotton, sold for $1,200. Cassander, a 35-year-old “prime woman” who also picked cotton but was prone to “fits”, sold for “just” $400. The same price was paid for Emiline, 19, who was described as a “prime young woman cotton hand”, and Judy, who was only 11.</p><p>Under torrential rains, on 2 and 3 March 1859, these enslaved Africans, who worked on rice and cotton plantations in the Sea Islands of Georgia, were sold at the Ten Broeck racecourse in Savannah.

## A three-year cruise sounds like a costly, sweaty nightmare. But then you start doing the maths … | Emma Brockes

<p>A cabin on the round-the-world MV Gemini costs £75,000. It could be a cost of living escape hatch for the middle classes</p><p>It is a juvenile but bankable way to pass time and lift one’s spirits without too much exertion: I’m talking about identifying ways in which the lives of rich people suck, a list that is always imaginatively growing. Gwyneth Paltrow, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/28/gwyneth-paltrow-ski-optometrist-court-utah">testifying in Utah</a>, has delivered solidly on this front this week, but there’s an even more gratifying story you might have missed.

It is so perfect a punishment for a certain type of hollowed-out plutocrat it might have been created by a limp, mid-list satirist. According to Life at Sea Cruises, the company behind the venture and a subsidiary of Miray Cruises, demand for the cruise is “unprecedented” and it also goes without saying that the word “cruise” in this case, is a misnomer. Cruises are for people who get excited by the presence of jumbo prawns at the buffet. By contrast, life aboard the “400-cabin MV Gemini” is, says Mikael Petterson, the managing director, “a way of living as opposed to travel”.</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/30/cruise-cabin-round-the-world-cost-of-living-middle-class">Continue reading...</a>

## Three Colours: Blue review – Binoche as charismatic as ever in Kieślowski masterwork

<p>Krzysztof Kieślowski’s meditation on love and fate is the first in the trilogy to be rereleased 30 years on</p><p>Krzysztof Kieślowski’s vast meditation on love, fate and the unheard harmonies of the universe begins its 30th-anniversary rerelease tomorrow. This is the first in his film trilogy with its tricolour motif (to be followed by White and Red); the whole is a triptych with overlapping images and character-glimpses, all destined to be tied up in a chaotic conclusion.</p><p>Here, Juliette Binoche plays Julie, the wife of a famous composer working on a huge commission from the European Council: a symphony to be played by no fewer than 12 orchestras, symbolising the 12 nations of the European Community (as it then was). Kieślowski teasingly hints that the hubris of this project is maybe not too different from his own triple-decker movie fantasy, and the music itself periodically crashes on to the soundtrack in Julie’s mind, disruptively jolting her from a trance of anxiety. The chords are vehement but halting, self-questioning, a very different officially sanctioned Euro-celebration to, say, the Ode to Joy from Beethoven’s Ninth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/30/three-colours-blue-review-binoche-as-charismatic-as-ever-in-kieslowski-masterwork">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The protest movement will either transform into a call for genuine democracy – for Palestinians and Israelis alike – or it will remain locked in the current impasse</p><p>There is a certain afterglow to mass protest. It’s a feeling strongest when the slogans have just ceased to echo in the streets, when the barricades have just come down, the banners rolled back up and the flags folded and put back in their place. It is also a dangerous moment, when what looks like sudden success can just as quickly turn into defeat.</p><p>That is the place where the protests against the Netanyahu government’s plan to strip the judiciary of its power stand right now.

It was, largely, a revolt of the educated and the middle class – of self-identified liberal, secular Israel against authoritarian, theocratic Israel. One of the movement’s most prominent organizers, and perhaps most representative, is Shikma Bressler, a professor of particle physics at the Weizman Institute, who for 13 weeks exhorted her fellow Israelis into the streets.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/30/israel-hasnt-been-a-democracy-for-a-long-time-now-israelis-need-to-face-this-fact">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Latest updates: Labour leader to launch campaign for local elections with tax pledge that Conservatives have criticised as worthless</p><p>The <strong>Commons standards committee</strong> says Margaret Ferrier should be suspended for 30 days for breaches of Commons rules related to the incident where she travelled by train from London to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland">Scotland</a> after testing positive for Covid in 2020.</p><p>Last year a court sentenced her to 270 hours of unpaid work in relation to the offence, but the standards commmittee says a further sanction by the Commons is required.</p><p>The threshold for a breach of paragraph 17 of the code [which says MPs should “never undertake any action which would cause significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole”] is necessarily high. However, any finding that a member’s actions have brought the house into disrepute must be considered to be a serious breach. The 2019 Code states that “members have a duty to uphold the law”; something the public rightly expect. If Ms Ferrier had been a public sector employee in a position of trust or leadership, she could have faced severe disciplinary consequences, potentially including dismissal, for these or similar actions.</p><p>We therefore recommend that Ms Ferrier is suspended from the service of the house for 30 days.</p><p>Labour’s announcement isn’t worth the paper it’s written on. They have no plan to introduce this if elected. They’re taking the British people for fools.</p><p>If Labour were serious about cutting council tax Labour councils would be doing it now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/mar/30/rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-labour-humza-yousaf-latest-politics-news-updates">Continue reading...</a>

## Julia Scotti: Funny That Way review – transgender comedian is cracking company

<p>Uplifting documentary allows its funny, flawed and likable subject to tell the poignant story of how she came to realise who she was</p><p>In 2016, the comedian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6msBqtZ_mYk&amp;ab_channel=TheShowman">Julia Scotti auditioned for America’s Got Talent</a> and brought the house down. Once the applause had died away, the judges asked Scotti, then 63, why she’d come to comedy so late in life. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSkpaKtkVik&amp;ab_channel=Steve">She explained</a> she’d actually been doing it for years – but as a man called Rick, in the mists of the 1980s, when she’d shared bills with Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld.</p><p>This uplifting documentary tells Scotti’s story, and director Susan Sandler doesn’t take a whizz-bang approach – there’s some animation here and there, but most of the film is spent simply letting Scotti talk about her life in different settings: on stage, in cars, on sofas with her grownup son. The no-frills strategy works because Scotti is such cracking company, and because her life has been characterised by such extremes. Raised in New Jersey, she grew up feeling something wasn’t right. She married young but it didn’t work out: she admits she “sucked, sucked, suckarama-sucked” at marriage. It was only when she was in her 40s and having a meltdown after a bad date that a friend told her: “You’re a woman.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/30/julia-scotti-funny-that-way-review-uplifting-doc-about-transgender-comedian">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Injured players could lose money or have contracts terminated next season – and we at the PFA are pushing for a rethink</p><p>Last Saturday, with no Premier League or international football in the English men’s game, many fans turned their attention to their local non-league teams. The depth of non-league football is a unique feature of the English game. I can speak from experience, having spent several seasons with non-league clubs before coming into the EFL, where I play for Leyton Orient.</p><p>Unfortunately, a large part of the weekend’s focus centred on the introduction by the Football Association of a new non-league player contract that has caused anger at that level. In football, the “standard” contract is, basically, the template terms and conditions element signed as part of every agreement. Among a range of changes to the non-league standard contract are two that players will view as most important.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/30/fa-new-non-league-contract-cut-injured-players-wages-must-be-stopped-pfa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the week that marked 100 days since the World Cup final we look at five areas with unanswered questions</p><p>The Qatar women’s team has not played an official game since 2014. A squad exists in some form, and is believed to gather for training and matches played in private, but their activities are kept far from the spotlight and they are not run by the local FA. They do not appear on the Fifa rankings. The side was formed in 2009, shortly before the World Cup bid was made, but has only been in action 15 times. In private the right noises are being made about a return to action and discussions are believed to be underway, although as with many of the lingering questions about Qatar’s post-World Cup future there is little detail about timescales. The idea is that they will have infrastructure waiting for them, with the Education City Stadium being repurposed into the team’s home and a hub for women’s sport. A friendly tournament involving academy and club sides from Qatar and abroad took place there last month. A small local league exists, while positive steps are undoubtedly being made to improve participation at grassroots level: the recently-created Elite Academy for girls shows promise. But real hope that Qatar is serious about developing the sport would come in the form of an active national team.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/30/from-the-womens-team-to-grassroots-football-questions-lingering-in-qatar-after-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How the special economic areas championed by rightwing radicals undermine democracy</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bertolt-brecht" title="">Bertolt Brecht</a><strong> </strong>famously advised his allies on the left not to “start from the good old things, but the bad new ones”. It is a maxim that has guided various activist-writers over the years, wherever they have sought to identify and expose the latest mutations and dreamworlds of capitalist development. In recent decades, figures such as Naomi Klein and the late Mike Davis have kept this tradition alive, unearthing the “bad new” innovations, ideas and technologies that are restructuring the world around us on behalf of capital. Klein looked to the US policies rolled out in Iraq or post-Katrina New Orleans in search of an overarching economic logic. Davis mined the cityscapes of Los Angeles and Dubai for clues as to the latest forms of repression and exploitation.</p><p>Historian Quinn Slobodian’s fascinating Crack-Up Capitalism is in a similar vein, only with a distinctive twist: his case studies are chosen for having already been explicitly championed by libertarians and neoliberal intellectuals. Anti-democratic and authoritarian cities and regional experiments of the past 45 years – from Singapore to Somalia, from Liechtenstein to Honduras – are scrutinised less for how they function economically, and more for how they fuel the imaginations of reactionaries and market fundamentalists. This is a history of contemporary ideas – specifically those that seek to protect capitalism from the interferences of democratic politics – that is interwoven with a geography of the various territories on which those ideas descended.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/30/crack-up-capitalism-by-quinn-slobodian-review-zoning-out">Continue reading...</a>

## Why are today’s TV dramas so devastatingly difficult to follow? | Adrian Chiles

<p>I am constantly being told to simplify documentary scripts for television - but the same channels will air dramas that are wildly confusing</p><p>I can’t remember the last time I watched a television documentary I couldn’t follow. Some are more captivating than others, but I can generally fathom what’s going on. The people who make them – and I’ve made a few myself – are at great pains to keep them comprehensible. This is good, although I must admit that when scripting my stuff, I’ve often been at loggerheads with producers imploring me to make things simpler. “Signpost better!” they say, the idea being to lead viewers gently through the story, reminding and recapping and explaining as you go. On occasion I have been known to throw a hissy fit, fulminating along the lines of: “How bloody stupid do we think the viewers are here? It’s not Playschool we’re doing!” I soon calm down, they get their way and they’re probably right in the end. Much better to err on the side of spoon-feeding – or patronising, as I put it when I’m hissy-fitting – than risk confusing and losing the audience altogether. I get it.</p><p>However, here’s the thing: on the same channel on the same evening as your typical, entirely comprehensible documentary, there will be a drama of quite devastating complexity, the twists and turns of which many can make neither head nor tail. Episodes are paused or even rewound; family conferences are called to figure out what on earth is going on. Sometimes the internet is searched for clues; fan forums convene to thrash out the details. And so we go from programmes being ever so careful to assume nothing and explain everything to programmes requiring a mastermind’s analysis.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/30/why-are-todays-tv-dramas-so-devastatingly-difficult-to-follow">Continue reading...</a>

## Local journalism made me what I am today. Without it, we’ll all be the poorer | John Humphrys

<p>For budding journalists and citizens alike, the demise of local newspapers will leave a void that’s impossible to fill</p><p>Had things turned out a little differently back in the late 1950s, it’s just possible that the cast in the TV smash hit Succession might have featured a rather different set of characters. Instead of featuring a media mogul partly inspired by Rupert Murdoch, it could have been based on yours truly – an uppity young Taffy trying to transform his local rag, the Cardiff and District News.</p><p>It had started well for me. At 15 I had a regular column with the very successful Penarth Times. Almost every household in the posh seaside town bought a copy. Then the proprietor decided we could do the same with a new weekly in the great metropolis that was Cardiff. He called it the Cardiff and District News and not only made me the editor of the teenage page but the circulation manager, too.

It seems an opportune place to meet Sharlet – journalist, author and professor – halfway between his home in Vermont and mine in Brooklyn. We are here to talk about the fragmentation of American democracy,<strong> </strong>and I knew the Titanic museum would strike Sharlet as an apt spot: a reliquary of dissolution, another ship lost at sea.</p><p>Sharlet’s latest book, <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/the-undertow">The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War</a>, is the culmination of more than a dozen years’ reporting on the US religious right and its machinations. The core of the book is Sharlet’s reporting from the midwest and the high plains, talking to ordinary people about their extraordinary predilection for violence. They see a country gone wrong under decades of “immoral decadence” and often see the expansion of rights for women, the poor and people of color as proof of this turpitude.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/30/jeff-sharlet-undertow-fascism-far-right-religion-trump">Continue reading...</a>

## Kill Boksoon review – intense Korean assassin thriller with satisfying complexity

<p>This fast-moving yarn about a woman balancing contract killing with raising a teenage daughter has flair and depth to spare</p><p>Like a lot of topline Korean films, this prestige action thriller is a little too long at 137 minutes, but it’s consistently entertaining throughout, and quite well-suited given the length to being viewed on a streaming platform. Viewing in chunks works quite well, especially since the dialogue zips by so quickly that if you don’t speak Korean you may need to rewind to read the subtitles – and they’re actually worth reading here, which is not something you can always say about a film with this much martial arts and fisticuffs.</p><p>Jeon Do-yeon (South Korea’s version of Meryl Streep, best known in the west for Im Sang-soo’s The Housemaid and Lee Chang-dong’s Secret Sunshine) stars as Gil Bok-soon, a middle-aged single mother to teen daughter Jae-yeong (Kim Si-a). Jae-yeong and the yummy mummies at the private school Jae-yeong attends think Bok-soon is some kind of executive for an events company, which fits with the crisp haircut and boxy Chanel boucle jacket. In a way it’s true, because her employer, MK Ent, calls the contract killings it’s hired to do “shows”; Bok-soon is their star assassin, revered by her colleagues and rivals alike. Here special skill is her ability to game out in her head the next steps in a tricky situation – the film will sometimes show her doing this and then rewind back to an earlier point, which is a little confusing. Wait until you get towards the end, when an ultimate boss fight becomes a panorama of multiple, CGI-replicated Bok-soons and her adversary, as they slug, stab and shoot it out all at once.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/30/kill-boksoon-review-intense-korean-assassin-thriller-with-satisfying-complexity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor and fashion designer has worn this 1940s gown many times since buying it in 2000.

When Jude [Law, whom Frost was married to at the time] was nominated for an Oscar in 2000, it was the same. I went to the vintage shop One of a Kind in Notting Hill and found this amazing dress that really does feel like a second skin. It’s this lovely cream colour, with a beautiful jewelled high halterneck and a really low back. I think it would have cost a couple of hundred pounds, which I don’t think is too bad for an Oscars dress.</p><p>I have friends who are in fashion and they laugh at me because I have always been kind of anti-fashion.

<p>Today’s generation is not responsible for what happened two centuries ago – but it can be guilty of refusing to learn from it</p><p>British politics has an unusual obsession with Britain’s past. In some sense this should not be remarkable: the writing of history takes place in the present, and the story any nation tells about itself is therefore always a political one. But in Britain, it is only ever that: contemporary debates about British history are distinguished by their lack of historical content. Instead, they are merely a new way of posing an old question: does Britain need to change, or is it great the way it is?</p><p>This is why attempts to revise and update conventional accounts of British history are so fiercely and reflexively rejected. Britain’s past, or a glorious version of it, is so central to maintaining the status quo that to question our history is to invite dramatic charges of vandalism and erasure – from those who seem to believe the past is like an antique vase that might be shattered if too many people lay their hands on it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/commentisfree/2023/mar/30/britain-slavery-change-guardian">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Historians aren’t supposed to make predictions, but Yale professor Timothy Snyder has become known for his dire warnings – and many of them have been proven correct</p><p>Last September, seven months after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Yale historian Timothy Snyder took a 16-hour train ride from Poland to Kyiv. Snyder knew the city well: he’d been visiting since the early 1990s, when he was a graduate student and the newly post-Soviet Ukrainian capital was dark and provincial. In the decades that followed, Kyiv had grown bigger and more interesting, and Snyder, who is now 53, had become an eminent historian of eastern Europe. On disembarking at the Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi station, he found the city transformed by war. There were sandbags everywhere, concrete roadblocks and steel “hedgehogs” designed to stop Russian tanks. Air raid warnings blared from phones in pockets and handbags.</p><p>Not everything was unfamiliar. The first months of the war had gone relatively well for the Ukrainians – a fact that surprised many observers, but not Snyder – and by September, Kyiv was no longer in imminent danger of occupation. Life, while not normal, was regaining some of its prewar rhythms. You could get a haircut at a barbershop, or hear standup at a comedy club, or sunbathe on the shores of the Dnieper River.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/how-timothy-snyder-became-the-leading-interpreter-of-our-dark-times-putin-trump-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>
