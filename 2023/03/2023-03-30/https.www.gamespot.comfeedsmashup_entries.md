<p dir="ltr">The ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis gave an interview explaining why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-is-canceled/1100-6512853/">E3 2023 was canceled</a>. He largely attributed E3 2023's demise to a combination of publishers adjusting their marketing plans due to changes in the economy and deciding to run their own digital showcases. Covid-19 also played a part, Pierre-Louis added, in changing game development timelines.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/e3-2023-is-cancelled-esa-tells-us-why">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Pierre-Louis said," We were off to a strong start. There was interest among exhibitors, industry players, media and certainly the fans. Ultimately, however, there were challenges that proved too large to surmount."</p><p dir="ltr">"First, several companies have reported that the timeline for game development has been altered since the start of the COVID pandemic. Second, economic headwinds have caused several companies to reassess how they invest in large marketing events. And third, companies are starting to experiment with how to find the right balance between in-person events and digital marketing opportunities," Pierre-Louis concluded.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esa-president-explains-why-e3-2023-got-canceled/1100-6512857/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## How Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves Makes D&D Easy To Understand For Newbies

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/does-dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-have-a-post-credits-scene/1100-6512831/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</a> is in theaters March 31, and the big-screen epic tale has, thus far, been met with very positive reviews. Over at GameSpot sister site Metacritic, the movie is sitting pretty with a score of 71 and that had to be thanks, in some small part, to the fact that this is a film that is approachable for everyone, whether you've mounted your own D&amp;D campaign or not.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to a property with such deep lore over several decades, properly capturing it in a way that appeals to longtime fans is daunting. However, according to the film's writers and directors, Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, that wasn't even the hard part. Instead, it was finding a way of explaining everything to people with no knowledge of D&amp;D that was the real hurdle.</p><p dir="ltr">"[That was the] bigger challenge even than appealing to the fans, because we knew we had the material with the lore and the 50 years of history behind us to really give players of the game something that they will appreciate," Daly explained to GameSpot. "The bigger challenge was to give something to the people who have absolutely nothing to do with Dungeons &amp; Dragons--or know nothing about it--a movie that they will also enjoy. And what I would say is, you know, we were very authentic. Everything--every spell that you see--is accurate, is true-to-life authentic. All of our creatures, or monsters or environments are all part of the lore. But again, you do not have to know anything about that for it to work."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-makes-dd-easy-to-understand-for-newbies/1100-6512854/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>DC's upcoming The Flash solo movie is seen as a send-off to the old DCEU before the new guard is established with James Gunn and Peter Safran's Gods and Monsters movement. Actor Ezra Miller was cast as Barry Allen/The Flash when they were just 22 and after numerous delays and false starts, The Flash finally hits theaters in June.</p><p>The film's first trailer showed Barry disrupting the main timeline--as he tends to do now and then--and showed the return of Michael Shannon's General Zod a decade later. The obvious notable cameos are Michael Keaton as Batman after over 30 years, and Sasha Calle's Supergirl, but there's still one more that hasn't been seen.</p><p>Ben Affleck went on the Smartless podcast to promote the upcoming Nike biopic Air (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ben-affleck-the-flash-cameo-gal-gadot-wonder-woman-1235363769/">THR</a>), and revealed another central DC character that appears in the film.

<p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's had the most participants of any beta in the history of Diablo games. Whether it was the irresistible allure of KFC's Double Down or just pure excitement for the first Diablo console game since 2012, players spent more than 61 million hours combined in Diablo 4's beta.</p><p dir="ltr">According to other stats released by Blizzard, players also died over 46 million times. 2.6 million players reached character level 20 and earned the special wolf pup cosmetic, and the most popular classes chosen were Necromancer and Sorcerer.

<p>Choosing a PC gaming headset is more challenging than it is for consoles like PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, in large part because just about every gaming headset out there is compatible with PC. This means you can shop for headsets that were designed with PlayStation or Xbox in mind and not miss out on anything. To help make your purchasing decision easier, we've rounded up the best PC headsets in 2023. We left no stone unturned here by testing and picking headsets across all budgets, from high-end headsets with heaps of customization features to no-frills wireless and wired headsets that will get the job done for many PC users.</p><p>In addition to having more options than console players, PC gamers can also often fine-tune their listening experience to a greater degree than those gaming on Xbox and PlayStation. Many major gaming headset manufacturers have free audio software that lets you take control over practically all aspects of your game audio. So, if you're one of those gamers who plays on PC because you generally get more of a say when it comes to overarching settings like graphics, you'll probably want to opt for a headset that gives you similarly robust audio customization options.</p><p>Our list of the best PC gaming headsets includes the latest options from major manufacturers such as SteelSeries, Razer, HyperX, and Logitech. We're confident that you'll find a headset on this list that will work well for your needs. If you also game on other platforms, you should pay close attention to compatibility for your favorite platforms. Some of the best gaming headsets today feature universal support across all major platforms and also have built-in Bluetooth support. If you choose carefully, you can ensure that you have a PC gaming headset that will also fill your needs for other devices in your home.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-gaming-headsets-in-2023/1100-6486018/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A new update has gone live for Destiny 2, and while the list of changes aren't long, they are substantial. According to the hotfix 7.0.0.7 patch notes, the biggest tweaks are focused on Lightfall's Root of Nightmares raid, two underperforming Exotics, and the way commendations factor into Guardian Ranks.</p><p>For the raid, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-raid-root-of-nightmares-gets-master-difficulty-and-a-tougher-nezarec-boss-fight-soon/1100-6512672/">expect Nezarec to no longer be confused</a> when a Warlock on your team pops their Well of Radiance Super, as the Final God of Pain would often be halted in his tracks by this display of empowering space-magic. With this fix, expect Nezarec to snap out of his confused state and put that gigantic scythe of his to good use.</p><p>Part of the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-2-hotfix-7-0-0-7">update</a> is focused on Quicksilver Storm and Touch of Malice, two Exotic weapons that were doing reduced damage against red-bar enemies. Bungie had previously mentioned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-quicksilver-storm-exotic-bug-fix-coming-in-this-weeks-update/1100-6512685/">fixing Quicksilver Storm</a> was a complicated process, but with this fix, they'll rip through cannon fodder enemies as they'll now do 40% extra damage against them.

## Mina The Hollower Blends Bloodborne With Zelda And Castlevania

<p dir="ltr">Yacht Club Games's first-ever foray into retro-inspired games, Shovel Knight, has quickly grown into one of the most successful indie franchises in the industry. The team is attempting to strike gold again with Mina The Hollower, but this time it has a new genre--and a new spookier tone--in its sights.</p><p dir="ltr">A short demo playable at PAX East last weekend gave a taste of what Mina The Hollower is all about, and it's much more than the classic Zelda-inspired look would let on. Throughout the 15-minute demo, we had a chance to test out multiple weapons, underground traversal through a digging mechanic, and more, and we came away impressed with what we played.</p><figure style="width: 1536px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4118562-mina.png"><img alt="Mina The Hollower puts a horror spin on classic gameplay." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4118562-mina.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Mina The Hollower puts a horror spin on classic gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">The PAX East demo started us off next to a derelict carriage, with the horse in charge standing next to it. After a well-placed pun lightens the mood--"this carriage is broken down, so I'll have to hoof it!" Mina says--the next screen pits Mina against a few enemies. Experience with Zelda games would indicate a straightforward battle, but this moment is where Mina's open-ended approach begins to shine. Attacking each monster head-on is an option, but so is digging underneath the ground in an attempt to get past them. Once they're behind Mina, she can step on certain tiles to make them fall away, which keeps the enemies on one side of the pit and our heroine on the other.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mina-the-hollower-blends-bloodborne-with-zelda-and-castlevania/1100-6512837/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The reason the card is so rare is because it was made for Tyler Gressle, who in 2005 received it as part of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, a non-profit that attempts to make the wishes of children with "critical illnesses" come true.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">In 2005, Gressle was suffering from a rare liver cancer that only had 200 cases reported in the whole of the US. In a video talking to Yu-Gi-Oh content creator Alex Cimo, Gressle quipped, "I wanted a Porsche, but I wasn’t old enough." So in turn, he had a Yu-Gi-Oh card made just for him, where he was flown out to New York to meet Kazuki Takahashi, creator of Yu-Gi-Oh, as well as the voice cast for the anime.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-could-have-the-chance-to-buy-the-rarest-yu-gi-oh-card-ever/1100-6512836/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Priced at $560, the bundle will launch worldwide alongside Diablo IV on June 6.

<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves releases in theaters this weekend, but does it have enough steam to dethrone John Wick: Chapter 4? According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/03/dungeons-and-dragons-box-office-projection-1235312815/">Deadline</a>, it isn't tracking for a very massive opening weekend. The site said the fantasy film starring Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez is expected to earn between $30 million-$40 million in the US over its first weekend.</p><p>That's not a huge number, the site reported, especially when you consider the film carried a $150 million production budget before marketing expenses are factored in. Working in the film's favor, though, is its strong review scores--it currently boasts a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dungeons_and_dragons_honor_among_thieves">89% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 94% score from viewers</a> who saw it early. On GameSpot sister site Metacritic, Honor Among Thieves has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves">71 metascore</a>.</p><div>          </div><p>Another element helping Honor Among Thieves, at least on paper, is the film's star power. In addition to Pine and Rodriguez, it features Rege-Jean Page, Sophia Lillis, Justice Smith, and Hugh Grant.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-honor-among-thieves-expected-to-have-slow-start-at-the-box-office-this-weekend/1100-6512828/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Street Fighter 6 Tournament Rule Change Has Hitbox Users Up In Arms

<p>Ahead of the release of Street Fighter 6 in June, Capcom has outlined a rule change to leverless controllers that'll have a major impact on future Capcom Pro Tour tournaments. Capcom's new rule says that if a player inputs up and down directions at the same time, then both inputs must either be maintained or rejected.</p><p>"The new rule we are putting forth below is designed to ensure all leverless controllers operate to a universal standard regardless of make or model at Capcom-sanctioned events," the Street Fighter 6 developer said in a <a href="https://www.capcomprotour.com/rules/">blog post</a>. "With this in mind we’ve decided to make the following change. If up and down directions are input at the same time, both inputs must be maintained or both inputs must be rejected."</p><p>What this means is that Capcom is essentially leveling the playing field. Leverless controllers, and especially those manufactured by Hitbox, give players a major advantage in matches, allowing them to perform certain moves more quickly than competing players who use standard fightsticks or controllers.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/street-fighter-6-tournament-rule-change-has-hitbox-users-up-in-arms/1100-6512832/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Does Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves Have A Post-Credits Scene?

<p dir="ltr">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is just a day away from releasing in cinemas, but obviously you might be wondering if there's a post-credits scene to hang around for. If you want to know, then read on, but we do want to offer a <strong>mild spoiler warning</strong> just in case.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Once you hit the preliminary credits for the film, you won't have to wait long for more, as there is a short mid-credits scene (thanks, <a href="https://collider.com/dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-post-credits-scene/">Collider</a>). This takes place right after the stylish credits start rolling, so once that's wrapped up you'll get to see what's in store. After that, the rest of the credits will continue, but there is no post-credits scene to be found, so if you watch the full credits you'll just be doing the good thing of respecting everyone's hard work.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're wondering if the scene points towards a sequel, spin-off, or any other Dungeons &amp; Dragons-related projects, it doesn't. It's more of a payoff to a joke that occurs earlier in the film, so if you want to end things on a good laugh it's worth sticking around for. Otherwise, feel free to head home--you won't be missing out on Samuel L. Jackson asking the band of adventurers to help him form a special unit or anything.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/does-dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-have-a-post-credits-scene/1100-6512831/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> Chapter 4 Season 2 has been a blast so far, but the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-spring-breakout-event-2023-challenges-rewards-and-new-skins/1100-6512769/">Spring Breakout</a> marks the season's first major event, bringing with it plenty to do around the island to earn some cosmetics and XP. Each day of the event brings a new challenge to complete, and one of these requests is to find a Golden Egg. We'll tell you how to make that happen below.</p><h2>Where to get a Golden Egg in Fortnite</h2><p>Golden Eggs are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-where-to-find-laid-eggs/1100-6512795/">one of three types of eggs</a> laid by chickens all across the map during the Spring Breakout Event, so it's possible that you'll find one just by playing naturally. However, if you'd like to speed up the process, you can use a specific section of the map to increase your odds rather significantly. Head over to <strong>Frenzy Fields</strong> in the southern section of the map to find tons of chickens roaming around the farm and its surrounding area.</p><figure style="width: 2048px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4117616-frenzy.jpg"><img alt="Frenzy Fields has plenty of chickens wandering about and is a good place to find Golden Eggs." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4117616-frenzy.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Frenzy Fields has plenty of chickens wandering about and is a good place to find Golden Eggs.</figcaption></figure><p>As long as you don't accidentally kill any of the chickens, they'll just keep laying eggs--especially if you chase them around a bit. With so many chickens around, you'll have no trouble rounding up lots of eggs, including the shiny gold ones--good for 350 gold bars a piece! Additionally, if you leave unwanted eggs lying about, they'll eventually hatch into even more chickens. It can get pretty wild at Frenzy Fields.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-how-to-get-golden-eggs/1100-6512827/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## How Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Seemingly Fixes BOTW's Divisive Weapon Durability

<p dir="ltr">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is generally considered one of the best games of all time, but certain aspects of it are more controversial than others. Though its often-rainy weather, relatively short dungeons, and surprising difficulty have all been marked as particularly divisive, the most frequently debated aspect of Breath of the Wild is almost certainly its use of weapon durability as a core mechanic. However, regardless of where you stand on this raging debate, it appears that Nintendo is making serious changes to how weapon durability works in Tears of the Kingdom, and that might transform the discussion entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">It didn't take long for broken sword proponents to declare a resounding victory for their side after Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-showcases-weapon-durability-makeshift-weapons-in-new-trailer/1100-6512746/">recent showcase</a> featured a branch breaking after a scant number of hits. Indeed, those who hoped to see a total removal of durability mechanics in Tears of the Kingdom were betting on a long shot to begin with. The Fuse tool that the showcase revealed appears to be Nintendo's response to many of the problems that fans complained about in Breath of the Wild, and it's certainly a promising start.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, though it's probably not necessary to rehash all of the durability debate here, let's go over some of its basic points. All weapons break in Breath of the Wild sooner or later (except the Master Sword), though some are sturdier than others. Some players enjoyed the mechanic and felt that it added a lot to the game. For example, GameSpot's Chris Pereira says that he liked the weapon durability in BOTW, stating that it added depth to its combat.

<p>Actor Chris Pratt voices Mario in the upcoming The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and his original casting announcement was met with a level of consternation among a portion of the Mario fanbase. Some thought that Charles Martinet, who voices Mario in the games, should have voiced him in the film. Others took issue with how Pratt is not Italian. Speaking to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/chris-pratt-super-mario-movie-interview-charlie-day-lui-1850275991">i09</a>, Pratt said he "totally" understands why people were upset. It stems from the love fans have for the Mario series, he said.</p><p>"There's a passionate fan base and I'm one of the fans. I get it. Mostly, people don't want something like this to get screwed up. They're precious about it. They're careful. And I'm grateful for that," Pratt said.</p><div>          </div><p>The head of animation studio Illumination, Chris Meledandri, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-boss-responds-to-criticism-of-chris-pratt-voicing-the-main-character/1100-6504773/">previously defended Pratt</a>, saying the criticism of Pratt's Mario voice would "evaporate" after fans heard it for the first time, but "maybe not entirely."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-pratt-reacts-to-backlash-about-him-voicing-mario-in-the-upcoming-film/1100-6512822/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

According to a recent <a href="https://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/rowland/media-release/albanese-government-outlines-key-reforms-national-classification-scheme">press release</a>, the changes would introduce a mandatory classification of R18+ of games with simulated gambling elements, and a classification of M (15+) for games with paid loot boxes.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-03-29/video-games-simulated-gambling-social-casino-r18-rating-proposal/102153966">ABC News</a>, Communications Minister Michelle Rowland cites growing concerns about the harms of simulated gambling on children as the impetus for the proposal.

## PlayStation VR 2 Is Apparently Selling Really Badly - Report

<p>Sony's new PlayStation VR 2 is reportedly off to a slow start since it launched on February 22, and it's estimated that Sony will miss its sales goal by a massive margin. According to estimates from the research firm IDC (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-30/sony-psvr2-headset-off-to-slow-start-as-metaverse-push-sputters">Bloomberg</a>), Sony is expected to sell around 270,000 units by the end of March. Bloomberg had previously claimed that Sony was aiming to ship 2 million PlayStation VR2 units during the headset’s launch quarter, according to "people familiar" with the company's deliberations.</p><p>PlayStation VR 2, which is part of Sony president and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida's goal to create a metaverse for the company, hasn't generated much excitement since its arrival. This comes down to a number of reasons, with the hefty price tag of the hardware being a key sticking point for cash-strapped consumers.</p><p>"Consumers around the world are facing rising costs of living, rising interest rates, and rising layoffs," IDC's Francisco Jeronimo said to Bloomberg. "VR headsets are not top of mind for most consumers under the current economic climate."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-2-is-apparently-selling-really-badly-report/1100-6512820/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Zelda Expert Breaks Down Tears Of The Kingdom Combat Changes And Customization

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4118471-totk_aonumavideo_01_png_jpgcopy.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">We finally got our first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-showcases-weapon-durability-makeshift-weapons-in-new-trailer/1100-6512746/">in-depth look at The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom gameplay</a> with the latest Nintendo presentation, and there were a ton of new details to pick apart. The extended 10-minute deep dive covered lots of new details, especially surrounding combat and traversal.</p><p dir="ltr">We saw the first confirmation that weapon degradation is returning, along with a new Fuse system that will let you craft your own weapons and shields from other objects. Examples included building an extra-long pitchfork, placing a rock on the end of a sword, and even packing a smokey surprise onto a shield. Not only that, but the Fuse system can also be used to custom-build vehicles, like the ones we saw teased in an earlier trailer, which were custom-built by a player rather than being discovered in the game. In this demonstration, the vehicles included a raft and a flying contraption to reach the Sky Islands. And as an added feature to move around the world, Link can now transport through ceilings to stand on top of buildings or cave structures.</p><p dir="ltr">As a combat expert in Breath of the Wild, our own Max Blumenthal focused specifically on Link's new battling abilities, in both tangible information and theorizing on possibilities you may have missed. Below, you can check out his in-depth analysis of what the presentation revealed. If you enjoy in-depth breakdowns like this, be sure to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">check out the video version</a> as well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4118474-slide1.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The combat showcase starts around when Link approaches this tree branch, lighter in color to match these lighter-colored trees in these sky biomes. Link is approached by a new enemy called a Soldier Construct, which is also wielding an identical tree branch. It goes on the offensive and attacks Link but gets staggered immediately. This is already decent information because it can show some early damage numbers in this part of the game without telling us directly.</p><p dir="ltr">Without going too in-depth on how blocking types are calculated, all enemies have a base attack, and the weapon attack is stacked on top of that. If an enemy's total attack is equal to or lower than your shield's defense stat, the attack will bounce off. If the enemy's attack is higher than your shield, it will continue attacking without stagger. These critical strikes can also disarm enemies, so Link then quickly steals the enemy's branch.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4118475-slide2.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">This part will likely be many players' favorite addition, the Fuse ability. From the looks of it, this ability auto-targets close materials, and gives you the option to fuse it with your weapon or your shield. This seems to reset, or more likely just add additional durability to the weapon you currently have, which is likely a welcome change for players who complained about weapon durability in Breath of the Wild. This also changes the way the weapon's damage totals are calculated.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4118476-slide3.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Link fuses a Wooden Spear (2 attack) with a Pitchforks (4 attack) to make a 6-attack power, super-long spear. At this point you're starting to think about the possibilities you could make with multiple weapons and materials getting stuck together, along with many, many questions. What if two low durability weapons are fused together? Does it reset the total durability of the weapon and make it usable again? We haven't actually seen a fused weapon break yet so it could be that only one part of a fused weapon will break. Can the handle portion separately break? Can you unfuse weapons back apart? Does fusing onto an already fused weapon replace the modification or add onto it? There appeared to be an option to fuse onto an already fused weapon, but Aonuma passed that up. Can you fuse with magical wands? What happens if you attach a burnable stick onto a Flameblade? Or a metal weapon onto a Thunderblade? Can we Fuse ingredients onto weapons as well as shields? Can we Fuse ingredients onto already Fused weapons? How do all of these work with Boomerangs? Does it affect the boomerang's ability to fly or its attacking width? While this mechanic has huge possibilities, it leaves us with many questions.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4118477-slide4.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Let's talk about the bow-and-arrow gameplay. One thing that sticks out immediately to me is the quick menu system. In Breath of the Wild, the D-pad normally shows shields, runes, and weapons, and when you draw a bow, the D-pad quick menu shifts it to arrows, runes, and bows. In Tears of the Kingdom, it's now shields, <em>materials</em>, and weapons, and when aiming with a bow, only the bow quick menu is affected. This means that either elemental arrows are out of the picture entirely, and are replaced with attachable chuchu jellies, or elemental arrows are still an option but are instead considered a material you can get later on.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4118478-slide5.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The quick menu pulled up here only shows a few materials, but we can still learn quite a bit. The Soldier Construct's Horn we picked up earlier is attachable, and now the Amber material has taken a new shape as an arrowhead. It's safe to say that all the gems in the game are like this now, and I'm guessing Diamond-tipped arrowheads may pack a punch. My personal theory is that these gems will do as much additional damage as they sell for rupees. Then it can be a gamble on your wallet versus your damage, which could be an interesting mechanic. Or it could be that gems will function as elemental arrowheads, since that was the initial plan for Breath of the Wild.</p><p dir="ltr">Link switches over to the Korok Frond, which is likely not to be confused with a Korok Leaf weapon, because this item is considered a health material. Then he switches back over to a White Chuchu Jelly to simulate an ice arrow. This combo packs a punch, instantly taking out the Construct. Directly attaching these effects to arrows opens up a whole new layer of combat that was much harder to access before.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4118479-slide6.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">We also get a second look at the Keese Eyeball attachment from the previous trailer, which automatically homes in on enemies. This is definitely most useful when performing non-bullet-time combat, when it's difficult to aim quickly in real time. It's still difficult to know how this mechanic works, if it prioritizes wildlife or enemies first, or whatever comes into its range first. But I'm sure many players struggling with the bow and arrow will enjoy this attachment, and it gives Keese much higher value to hunt down and farm.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4118480-slide7.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">I want to briefly touch upon Ultrahand. At first glance, this is a crafting ability, and not designed for combat. But those who've played Breath of the Wild long enough know that this kind of ability can come in clutch to drop objects onto enemies. The fact that this is not tied to only magnetic objects anymore opens up a lot of opportunities to use more of the environment as an environmental weapon, especially when paired together with the motion control option.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4118481-totk_aonumavideo_03_png_jpgcopy.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">While we saw the basics of combat here, they haven't shown their hand in any trailers of more advanced techniques with any slowdown abilities, such as parrying, flurry rushes, or bullet time, but something tells me they have something up their sleeve, especially with bullet time. We'll see soon enough.</p><p>Hopefully you enjoyed this breakdown of what we've seen in the latest gameplay trailer. When Tears Of The Kingdom launches, we'll have a host of video guides and a new series of things you didn't know, so stick around on GameSpot.

<p>Dead by Daylight studio Behaviour Interactive launches its new game Meet Your Maker in April, and the studio has outlined its plans for the first three months of content that will arrive after launch. Set in a post-apocalyptic future and described as a new spin on the building-and-raiding genre by its creators, Meet Your Maker will arrive on April 4 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-for-april-2023-revealed/1100-6512797/">PS Plus subscribers will be able to play the game on launch day</a>, as Meet Your Maker is one of the free games for the month alongside Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Tails of Iron.</p><p>"While Meet Your Maker will launch with a full arsenal of traps, guards, weapons, Custodians, and more already included for players to discover and master, we have a strong post-launch plan that will be delivering content designed to constantly expand the players' toolbox," creative director Ash Pannell explained in a press statement. "Keeping things fresh, ever-changing, and always unexpected is our mission when it comes to adding content to Meet Your Maker."</p><p>For the first DLC pack, players can look forward to the Hellscape deco pack that adds a grisly new aesthetic to the game. This DLC combines organic matter, industrial materials, pulsing animations, and sinister lighting to make you feel like you're raiding a living organism. New mods and augments will roll out over time, allowing for unlockable enhancements that Builders can use to make their lairs even more dangerous for would-be Raiders.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/april-playstation-plus-game-meet-your-maker-unveils-early-post-launch-content-roadmap/1100-6512815/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
