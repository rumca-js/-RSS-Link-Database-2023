## Launch HN: Baseplate (YC W23) – Back end-as-a-service for LLM apps

<p>Hey HN! Andrew and Ani here, co founders of Baseplate (<a href="https://www.baseplate.ai">https://www.baseplate.ai</a>). We're building a unified backend for LLM apps, where you can manage your data, prompts, embeddings, and deployments. Demo video here: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/97bc388f6b6c4c95bf6c51c832bfd8a5" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/97bc388f6b6c4c95bf6c51c832bfd8a5</a>.<p>Most LLM apps can be built by properly integrating LLMs with a knowledge base consisting of domain-specific or company-specific data. The scope of this knowledge base can change based on the task- it can be something as narrow and static as your API docs or as broad and fluid as meeting transcripts from your customer support calls.<p>To effectively use their data, most teams need to build a similar stack—datasource integrations, async embedding jobs, vector databases, bucket storage for non textual data, a way to version prompts, and potentially an additional database for the text data. Baseplate provides much of the backend for you through simple APIs, so you can focus on building your core product and less on building common infra.<p>At my previous role at Google X, I worked on building data infrastructure for geospatial data pipelines and knowledge graphs. One of my projects was to integrate knowledge graph triples with LaMDA, and I discovered the need for LLM tooling after using one of Google's initial prompt chaining tools. Ani was a PM at Logitech, shipping products in their Computer Vision team, and at the same time building side projects with GPT-3.<p>The core of Baseplate is our simplified multimodal database, which allows you to store text, embeddings, data, and metadata in one place. Through a spreadsheet-style interface, you can edit your vectors and metadata (which is surprisingly complex with existing tools), and add images that can be returned at query time. Users can choose between standard semantic search or hybrid search (weighted keywords/semantics for larger, more technical datasets). Hybrid search on Baseplate utilizes two open-source models that can be tuned for your use case (instructor & SPLADE). Datasets are organized into documents, which you can keep in sync through our API or through the UI (this way you can keep your datasets fresh when ingesting data from Google Drive/Notion/ etc).<p>After your datasets are set up, we have an App Builder where you can iterate on prompts with input variables, and create context variables that pull directly from a dataset at query time. We give you all the knobs and dials, so that you can configure exactly how your search is performed and how it is integrated with your prompt.<p>When you're satisfied with an app configuration, you deploy it to an endpoint. All you need is a single API call and we'll pull from one (or multiple) datasets in your app and inject the text into the prompt. We also return all the search results in the API response, so you can build a custom UX around images or links in your dataset. Endpoints have built in utilities for human feedback and logging. With GPT-4 being able to take images as input, we will soon be working on a way to pipe images from your dataset directly to the model. And all of these tools are in a team workspace, where you can quickly iterate and build together.<p>We just started offering self-serve sign up, and our pricing is currently $35/month per user for our Pro plan and $500/team on our Team plan. Feel free to sign up and poke around. We'd love to hear feedback from the community, and look forward to your comments!</p>

## Show HN: Open-source ETL framework to sync data from SaaS tools to vector stores
 - [https://github.com/ai-sidekick/sidekick](https://github.com/ai-sidekick/sidekick)

<p>Hey hacker news, we launched a few weeks ago as a GPT-powered chatbot for developer docs, and quickly realized that the value of what we’re doing isn’t the chatbot itself. Rather, it’s the time we save developers by automating the extraction of data from their SaaS tools (Github, Zendesk, Salesforce, etc) and helping transform it to contextually relevant chunks that fit into GPT’s context window.<p>A lot of companies are building prototypes with GPT right now and they’re all using some combination of Langchain/Llama Index + Weaviate/Pinecone + GPT3.5/GPT4 as their stack for retrieval augmented generation (RAG). This works great for prototypes, but what we learned was that as you scale your RAG app to more users and ingest more sources of content, it becomes a real pain to manage your data pipelines.<p>For example, if you want to ingest your developer docs, process it into chunks of <500 tokens, and add those chunks to a vector store, you can build a prototype with Langchain fairly quickly. However, if you want to deploy it to customers like we did for BentoML ([<a href="https://www.bentoml.com/](https://www.bentoml.com/)" rel="nofollow">https://www.bentoml.com/](https://www.bentoml.com/)</a>) you’ll quickly realize that a naive chunking method that splits by character/token leads to poor results, and that “delete and re-vectorize everything” when the source docs change doesn’t scale as a data synchronization strategy.<p>We took the code we used to build chatbots for our early customers and turned it into an open source framework to rapidly build new data Connectors and Chunkers. This way developers can use community built Connectors and Chunkers to start running vector searches on data from any source in a matter of minutes, or write their own in a matter of hours.<p>Here’s a video demo: [<a href="https://youtu.be/I2V3Cu8L6wk](https://youtu.be/I2V3Cu8L6wk)" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/I2V3Cu8L6wk](https://youtu.be/I2V3Cu8L6wk)</a><p>The repo has instructions on how to get started and set up API endpoints to load, chunk, and vectorize data quickly. Right now it only works with websites and Github repos, but we’ll be adding Zendesk, Google Drive, and Confluence integrations soon too.</p>

<p>Hi HN, we’re building Noya (<a href="https://noya.io">https://noya.io</a>), a product design tool that lets everyone design like a designer. Here’s a video: <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910" rel="nofollow">https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910</a>.<p>Getting from a product idea to a design is too hard. Wireframing tools (e.g. Balsamiq) are limited and their output is too low-fidelity to get people excited about the idea. On the other hand, high-fidelity design tools (e.g. Figma) require advanced skills and are better for tweaking fine details than hashing out a big picture. Meanwhile, companies have an insatiable need to make new screens and change existing ones, and hiring more designers is time-consuming and expensive.<p>David and I were on the design tools team at Airbnb when we realized there’s another solution: let designers encode their knowledge (e.g. design rules and components) into a tool, then let non-designers (PMs, marketing, engineers) use that tool to make new screens and features. This helps remove design as a bottleneck for a lot of product development. We built such tools at Airbnb, and with Noya we’re building them for product teams everywhere.<p>Current design tools are too freeform for non-designers to design great products. They let you do anything, like draw rectangles and move text blocks anywhere, so it's easy to mess things up, introduce inconsistencies, and so on. With Noya, designers set up "guardrails" in the form of a design system (rules and components for a company's design), then non-designers work within those constraints. This makes it harder to mess up and quicker to build something that fits in with your product. Footguns begone!<p>It all starts with wireframing, i.e. drawing a minimal layout that shows the elements that would exist on the screen. Noya combines wireframes and design systems to generate high-fidelity designs and code. If you have an idea for a user interface, you can use Noya to quickly wireframe that idea by clicking and dragging to place blocks for each element of your user interface. For each block, choose a type and provide any content that goes inside it.<p>Based on the rules and component library of the design system you select, Noya automatically turns your wireframe into a high-fidelity design. This design can be exported to design files, to Figma or Sketch, or to React code.<p>(If you’re curious what the React code looks like, try exporting and take a look! There’s plenty of room for improvement, especially around responsive layouts, but we think it’s a reasonable starting point. The code export is configurable on a per-design-system basis so that it’s closer to a company’s preferred standards).<p>Most tools in this space are optimized for either low-fidelity wireframes that are quick to create (e.g. Balsamiq), or high-fidelity output that’s slow to create (e.g. Figma). We think there’s a gap in the market for a great wireframing tool that produces a high-fidelity output quickly. For example, two-thirds of Figma users are non-designers. While there are many valid reasons for a non-designer to use Figma, there’s often a lot of upfront effort required to learn the tool and set up components. We think there should be a lower-effort way for non-designers to create high-fidelity designs.<p>Based on feedback from our Show HN (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34848583" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34848583</a>), we’ve improved our onboarding, revamped our entire block library, and added a documentation reference for each block type. The docs are interactive, so you can play with our editor without signing up: <a href="https://noya.io/app/docs">https://noya.io/app/docs</a>.<p>Startup founders and PMs have used Noya to build landing pages, dashboards, and other flows of their apps. We have some templates on our site (<a href="https://noya.io/templates">https://noya.io/templates</a>) that give examples of what people commonly build in Noya. We use Noya ourselves, and have been surprised by how frustrating it was to go back to existing design tools after using even the earliest prototypes of Noya. Existing design tools just aren’t built for the comprehensive design systems that products are based on today.<p>The source code is available here (though largely undocumented & unlicensed): <a href="https://github.com/noya-app/noya">https://github.com/noya-app/noya</a>. We’re not focused on growing our open source community or supporting other design tool builders just yet, so we haven’t published our packages (renderer, canvas, etc) to npm, but we’re planning to use the Apache V2 license. We make money by offering a paid subscription.<p>Noya currently supports one design system based on Chakra UI. We’re adding additional design systems soon, including Material Design, as well as the ability to import custom design systems. If your company has an open source design system and you’re interested in trying Noya with it, we may be able to integrate your design system for free. Get in touch if you’re interested - dabbott@noyasoftware.com.<p>We’d love for you to try Noya and let us know what you think! It’s still very much an MVP and all kinds of feedback are welcome.</p>

## Show HN: Gut – An easy-to-use CLI for Git
 - [https://gut-cli.dev](https://gut-cli.dev)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage
 - date published: 2023-03-30 12:18:56+00:00

<p>Hi Hacker news !<p>I’m Julien and I built an alternative CLI for Git : gut.<p>Even if I haven’t been coding for a long time (I’m in the first year studying computer science), I’ve always found git to be frustrating. 
The command naming is inconsistent and git lets you easily shoot yourself in the foot.<p>I made gut, another git porcelain, to solve these issues.<p>It provides a consistent naming of command. To do so, syntax is based on subcommands. For example, to delete a branch, run gut branch rm rather than git branch -d, same to delete a remote (gut remote rm) and so on.<p>Gut also prevents you from shooting yourself. It provides nice defaults and always prompt you before doing something destructive.
Also, it won’t allow you to rewrite the history if it has been pushed to the remote. Creating commits in detached head is also prohibited.<p>Finally, git was made when GitHub and others didn’t existed yet. To diff commits, gut opens the compare view in the browser. And to merge a branch, gut opens a pull request.<p>I have been working on this project for the past few months and I am happy to be able to share it.<p>I hope you’ll like it. Any suggestions is welcome !</p>

## Show HN: Yesterday I open sourced StratusGFX, a realtime 3D rendering engine

<p>It's been closed source for a long time while I worked on it on and off as a hobby research project, but yesterday the repo was made public for the first time under the MPL 2.0 license.<p>A feature reel showing its capabilities can be found here:
<a href="https://ktstephano.github.io/rendering/stratusgfx/feature_reel" rel="nofollow">https://ktstephano.github.io/rendering/stratusgfx/feature_re...</a><p>A technical breakdown of a single frame can be found here:
<a href="https://ktstephano.github.io/rendering/stratusgfx/frame_analysis" rel="nofollow">https://ktstephano.github.io/rendering/stratusgfx/frame_anal...</a><p>It's still in a very beta state (bugs and instability expected), but I felt like it was a good time to make it public since a lot of its core features are mostly presentable. I plan to continue working on it in my spare time to try and improve the usability of the code.<p>Two main use cases I could see for it:<p>1) People using it for educational purposes.<p>2) People integrating it into other more general purpose engines that they're working on since Stratus is primarily a rendering engine. Any extensions to the rendering code that are made public would then further help others.<p>So I think it will remain very niche but I'm hoping it will still be helpful for people in the future.</p>

## Show HN: Marvin – build AI functions that use an LLM as a runtime
 - [https://github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage

<p>Hey HN! We're excited to share our new open-source project, Marvin. Marvin is a high-level library for building AI-powered software. We developed it to address the challenges of integrating LLMs into more traditional applications. One of the biggest issues is the fact that LLMs only deal with strings (and conversational strings at that), so using them to process structured data is especially difficult.<p>Marvin introduces a new concept called AI Functions. These look and feel just like regular Python functions: you provide typed inputs, outputs, and docstrings. However, instead of relying on traditional source code, AI functions use LLMs like GPT-4 as a sort of “runtime” to generate outputs on-demand, based on the provided inputs and other details. The results are then parsed and converted back into native data types.<p>This “functional prompt engineering” means you can seamlessly integrate AI functions with your existing codebase. You can chain them together with other functions to form sophisticated, AI-enabled pipelines. They’re particularly useful for tasks that are simple to describe yet challenging to code, such as entity extraction, semantic scraping, complex filtering, template-based data generation, and categorization. For example, you could extract terms from a contract as JSON, scrape websites for quotes that support an idea, or build a list of questions from a customer support request. All of these would yield structured data that you could immediately start to process.<p>We initially created Marvin to tackle broad internal use cases in customer service and knowledge synthesis. AI Functions are just a piece of that, but have proven to be even more effective than we anticipated, and have quickly become one of our favorite features! We’re eager for you to try them out for yourself.<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and any creative ways you could use Marvin in your own projects. Let’s discuss in the comments!</p>
