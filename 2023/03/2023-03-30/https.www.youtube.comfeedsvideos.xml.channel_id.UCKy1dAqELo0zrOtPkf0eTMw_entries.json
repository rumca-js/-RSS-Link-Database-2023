The independent global spy agency\u2014tasked to uphold the safety and security of all people\u2014was destroyed by operatives of Manticore, a powerful syndicate manipulating the world from the shadows. With Citadel\u2019s fall, elite agents Mason Kane (Richard Madden) and Nadia Sinh (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) had their memories wiped as they narrowly escaped with their lives. They\u2019ve remained hidden ever since, building new lives under new identities, unaware of their pasts. Until one night, when Mason is tracked down by his former Citadel colleague, Bernard Orlick (Stanley Tucci), who desperately needs his help to prevent Manticore from establishing a new world order. Mason seeks out his former partner, Nadia, and the two spies embark on a mission that takes them around the world in an effort to stop Manticore, all while contending with a relationship built on secrets, lies, and a dangerous-yet-undying love.\n\nThe first season of Citadel consists of six episodes with two episodes premiering April 28 on Prime Video, and one episode rolling out weekly through May 26. The landmark, high-stakes drama is executive produced by the Russo Brothers\u2019 AGBO and showrunner David Weil, and stars Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, with Stanley Tucci and Lesley Manville. Citadel will be available in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide.\n\nFrom Amazon Studios and the Russo Brothers\u2019 AGBO, Citadel is executive produced by Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Mike Larocca, Angela Russo-Otstot, and Scott Nemes for AGBO, with David Weil serving as showrunner and executive producer.

But Cameron doubled down and essentially promised, \u201cIf I build it, you will come\u201d... and then showed us all the receipts. At this point, Avatar 2 has earned almost $2.3 billion dollars in worldwide box office, critical praise and four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and won Oscars for Best Achievement in Visual Effects.\n\nThe Way of Water has wowed audiences with its impressive set pieces and creature designs, using state of the art VFX and 3D to immerse audiences into the oceans of Pandora and the tech of the RDA. In particular, the final battle sequence on the massive SeaDragon vessel has had audiences clinging to their chairs and curling in tension.\n\nIronically, the team that had to design that sequence had no idea that it was going to be the film\u2019s big finale\u2026 until suddenly, that\u2019s what it was.
