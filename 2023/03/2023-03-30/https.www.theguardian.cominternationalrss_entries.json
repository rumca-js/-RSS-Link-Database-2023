More than a decade ago, his wife, a writer and academic named Cecilia, vanished one morning, leaving behind Martin and their two young children, Rakel and Elis. In her outstanding debut novel, Collected Works, translated into propulsive English by Agnes Broom\u00e9, Lydia Sandgren tells Martin\u2019s story across two narrative timelines. The novel interweaves his youth and the progress of his life up to Cecilia\u2019s disappearance with events in the present day, where Rakel, his daughter, is preparing a reader\u2019s report on a German novel to which Martin has been offered the rights. It seems, astonishingly, to be about her missing mother.</p><p>It\u2019s utterly gripping stuff, and if it didn\u2019t weigh in at more than 700 pages, Collected Works would be one of those books one reads in a single sitting. Sandgren has constructed a delicious combination of a detective thriller with an achingly beautiful extended look at the way youth washes over a group of compelling characters in the last decades of the 20th century, only to leave them stranded in the 21st, wondering what happened. The rendering of the early lives of this core ensemble \u2013 Martin, Cecilia, and their closest friend, Gustav Becker, who becomes an internationally renowned painter but has more than a touch of Peter Pan about him, never growing up \u2013 is the central achievement of the novel.
