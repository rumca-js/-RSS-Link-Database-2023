You Should Too | Derek Kreifels | EP 344", "description": "Watch Jordan Peterson's \"Vision & Destiny\" on DW+ https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nPeterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality \u2014 with a vision. \n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson and Derek Kreifels discuss the primary role of the state treasurer and why now, with the onslaught of ESGs and anti-fossil fuel divesting, their stewardship is so important. \n\nDerek Kreifels is the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF), the only nonprofit in the U.S. that combines ground-breaking free-market research with a strong network of states\u2019 treasurers, auditors, and other financial officers, to actively sustain the health of each state\u2019s economic outlook.\n \nBefore co-founding SFOF in 2012, Kreifels spent five years as Assistant State Treasurer of Kansas, where he oversaw the state\u2019s college savings plan, ABLE plan, debt and bond management, and pension investments. During his tenure, his office processed over $21B annually, and he managed 42 employees with an annual budget of over $3.5M.\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN - https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\nGenucel: Use code \"JORDAN\" at checkout for additional savings on your entire purchase! https://genucel.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Derek Kreifels and SFOF:\n\nSFOF website: https://sfof.com/\n\nSFOF Twitter: https://twitter.com/SFOF_States\n\nSFOF Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/statefinancialofficers\n\nESG's Explained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4XmzYj9cEY\n\nOur Money, Our Values website: https://ourmoneyourvalues.com/\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:30) Coming Up\n(1:33) Intro\n(2:33) Background, the State Financial Officers Foundation\n(5:50) Free Market first\n(6:28) What a State Treasurer is responsible for\n(8:25) Trust and treasuries\n(9:36) Fiduciary responsibility defined\n(11:02) ESG\u2019s intro\n(12:48) Environmental, Social, and Governance\n(14:15) The vision being put forward\n(17:18) Vanguard, Blackrock: the giants\n(18:04) Leveraging your money against your values\n(20:19) SFOF\u2019s stance on ESG\u2019s\n(23:41) The \u201cmad rush\u201d to abandon fossil fuels\n(27:39) The ESG movement will not work\n(28:24) The issue of poverty and human flourishing\n(29:19) Banning gas stoves, the scope of metro-products\n(30:49) Leveraging US funds for Chinese coal investment\n(32:22) To the residual environmentalists: It\u2019s the same air\n(33:40) Why Fink bends the knee\n(35:04) Cobalt Red and covert buying\n(36:40) Conservatives have been slow to respond\n(39:08) Evil capitalists\n(40:41) CEOs, you\u2019d have to be daft\u2026\n(41:39) Why we typically listen to our elders\n(44:11) The top 3 ESG firms own 20 percent of the market\n(46:02) How Blackrock co-opts your funds\n(49:17) Most people don\u2019t vote their shares\n(51:41) Weaponizing money\n(54:39) The absurd precedent set by Trudeau\n(56:19) Pushing back on IRS over-monitoring\n(58:37) 15-minute cities\n(1:00:00) Digital currency and crypto\n(1:03:11) 50 states, 50 answers\n(1:03:58) SFOF goals for Americans: divest in Blackrock\n(1:06:30) Vanguard lost 2 Billion in a year\n(1:08:04) Vivek Ramaswamy, Strive\n(1:09:59) America: a beautiful mess or progress and insanity\n(1:11:59) What you can do\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwGz8Ab2VB8", "date_published": "2023-03-30 15:00:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
