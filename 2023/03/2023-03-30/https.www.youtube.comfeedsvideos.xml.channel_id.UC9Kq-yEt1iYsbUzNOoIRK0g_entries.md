Step into the Pitch Meeting that started Pixar's first computer animated film, Toy Story! 

Pixar and Disney completely changed the animation game when they released the acclaimed Toy Story all the way back in 1995. As the first completely computer generated feature film, it ushered in a new era of film. Characters like Buzz, Woody, Andy, and more became classics overnight. But the movie definitely raises a few questions. Like what’s up with Buzz freezing around humans despite not thinking he’s a toy? Why are the toys so sudden to turn on Woody? What exactly are the RULES of toys coming to life?
To answer all these questions and more, step inside the pitch meeting that led to Toy Story! It’s super easy, barely an inconvenience!
