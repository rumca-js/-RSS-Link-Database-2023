But we [the House of Commons cross-party environment food and rural affairs select committee] will be discussing what course of action to take after the Easter recess.\u201d <br /><br />Defra\u2019s farm minister, Mark Spencer, said he had met FSA and hoped it would deliver a criminal prosecution. \u201cWe will be keeping a close eye on the investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll leave that with the Food Standards Agency to deliver a criminal prosecution.\u201d<br /><br />Spencer said he would not make any further statement on Thursday because of the \u201congoing criminal investigation\u201d that involved \u201cvery serious allegations\u201d, which the FSA had a responsibility to investigate. Spencer added that he is in regular contact with both the meat industry and the FSA.<br /><br />The Farmers Weekly investigation found that tens of thousands of tonnes of foreign pork, mislabelled as British, had found its way into the supply chain each week. The supplier has also been accused by former employees of regularly \u201cwashing\u201d visibly bad hams in salt water, and of mixing rotting pork with fresh product for further processing.<br /><br />On Wednesday, Darren Davies, head of the FSA\u2019s national food crime unit (NFCU), said the agency was \u201ccarrying out a criminal investigation into how a supplier was allegedly providing products labelled as British when they were in fact sourced from elsewhere.\u201d<br /><br />Davies said the investigation was \u201ccomplex\u201d and that \u201call new lines of enquiry \u2026 including any potential food hygiene breaches at the premises\u201d were being perused. \u201cIf any evidence of a food safety risk is found, then necessary action will be taken,\u201d he said.<br /><br />Last year, Davies said, the FSA \u201cadvised retailers \u2026 to check their cooked meat supply chain and to apply extra due diligence in their checks. We don\u2019t give out these alerts without a reason.\u201d Davies warned too that the cost of living crisis could mean that food fraud increases as suppliers face pressure to turn a profit.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/rotten-pork-sold-in-uk-may-lead-to-tighter-control-of-food-safety-body-fsa\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/30/rotten-pork-sold-in-uk-may-lead-to-tighter-control-of-food-safety-body-fsa", "date_published": "2023-03-30 16:16:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Morrisons plans to cut \u00a3700m in costs despite rise in revenue", "description": "<p>Supermarket chain reports quarterly results and says three-year savings plan will enable it to reduce prices</p><p>Morrisons has said it plans to cut \u00a3700m in costs over the next three years to allow it to reduce prices amid a squeeze on consumer spending.</p><p>The supermarket group, which reported falls in quarterly sales on the previous year through 2022, said it had eked out a 0.1% increase in same-store sales in the first three months of 2023.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/30/morrisons-plans-to-cut-700m-in-costs-rise-in-revenue-supermarket-prices\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/30/morrisons-plans-to-cut-700m-in-costs-rise-in-revenue-supermarket-prices", "date_published": "2023-03-30 16:03:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "New project seeks to bring south Asian literature to western readers", "description": "<p>Founded by two translators \u2013 one American, one British \u2013 the Salt initiative will provide mentorships, funding and a south Asia-focused literary translation school</p><p>A new project to help bring the \u201cextraordinarily rich\u201d literature of south Asia to English-speaking countries will launch this summer, it has been announced.</p><p>The cross-continental <a href=\"https://salc.uchicago.edu/salt-project\">South Asian Literature in Translation</a> (Salt) project has been set up by the University of Chicago, in partnership with the American Literary Translators Association, English PEN, Words Without Borders and the British Council.

This is the first in his film trilogy with its tricolour motif (to be followed by White and Red); the whole is a triptych with overlapping images and character-glimpses, all destined to be tied up in a chaotic conclusion.</p><p>Here, Juliette Binoche plays Julie, the wife of a famous composer working on a huge commission from the European Council: a symphony to be played by no fewer than 12 orchestras, symbolising the 12 nations of the European Community (as it then was). Kie\u015blowski teasingly hints that the hubris of this project is maybe not too different from his own triple-decker movie fantasy, and the music itself periodically crashes on to the soundtrack in Julie\u2019s mind, disruptively jolting her from a trance of anxiety. The chords are vehement but halting, self-questioning, a very different officially sanctioned Euro-celebration to, say, the Ode to Joy from Beethoven\u2019s Ninth.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/30/three-colours-blue-review-binoche-as-charismatic-as-ever-in-kieslowski-masterwork\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/30/three-colours-blue-review-binoche-as-charismatic-as-ever-in-kieslowski-masterwork", "date_published": "2023-03-30 10:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018Desperate and bigoted\u2019: the right uses latest shooting to malign trans people", "description": "<p>From hateful rants on Fox news to falsehoods in Congress, the far right exploits the tragedy to demonize vulnerable people</p><p>An already vigorous assault by Republicans on LGBTQ+ rights around the US is certain to gather pace in the wake of the Nashville school shooting, advocacy groups are warning.</p><p>Hard-right figures wasted little time in seizing on the reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/28/nashville-school-shooter-identity-transgender\">transgender identity of the Covenant school killer</a> to advance tenets of a \u201chateful\u201d agenda that has become an obsession of Republican-controlled statehouses from <a href=\"https://www.orlandoweekly.com/news/all-the-anti-lgbtq-laws-being-proposed-in-florida-and-how-you-can-fight-back-33857786\">Florida</a> to <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/human-rights-campaign-tennessee-continues-obsession-with-anti-lgbtq-legislation-with-house-passage-of-religious-refusal-bill-and-second-anti-drag-bill\">Tennessee</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/30/far-right-demonize-lgbtq-nashville-shooting\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/30/far-right-demonize-lgbtq-nashville-shooting", "date_published": "2023-03-30 10:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "How Bali governor\u2019s Israel protest ended Indonesia\u2019s U20 World Cup dream | John Duerden", "description": "<p>Football-mad country was due to host the men\u2019s Under-20 World Cup in May but has been stripped of the tournament by Fifa</p><p>Beautiful Bali has been known to disrupt the plans of many a tourist thanks to its surprisingly terrible traffic, but the Island of Gods has thrown a giant spanner into the works of Indonesia\u2019s hosting of the men\u2019s Under-20 World Cup.
