  <p id="FiMx8Q"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23660456/e3-2023-canceled">E3 2023 has been canceled</a>, but that doesn’t mean you won’t have big summer gaming events to look forward to. We’re already aware of at least three things you should mark on your calendar, and it seems like there will be major news of some kind from each one.</p>
<p id="f9X1zM">Here’s the 2023 summer gaming events that we’re currently aware of. Given that E3 is now officially not happening, it’s possible this list will grow if more companies want to make a splash in June.</p>
<ul>
<li id="6YNkDQ">
<strong>June 8th: Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest.</strong> Since 2020, Summer Game Fest has taken E3’s place as the industry’s collective summer news blowout, with reveals like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22307059/elden-ring-george-rr-martin-fromsoftware-e3-2021-trailer-gameplay">first gameplay trailer for <em>Elden Ring</em></a> in 2021 and Naughty Dog’s standalone <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23161755/the-last-of-us-part-2-tlou2-multiplayer-release"><em>The Last of Us</em> multiplayer game</a> in 2022....</li>

  <p id="PGuuDH">It was inevitable that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23660456/e3-2023-canceled">E3 would end this way</a>. Even before the pandemic put a pause on in-person gatherings, the Electronic Entertainment Expo was already on life-support as the larger developers had already put distance between themselves and the event to focus on their own presentations on their own time. And though E3’s eventual cancellation was all but written in stone, I still feel a great sense of loss. Which is odd considering I’ve never been to E3.</p>
<p id="NzC9wE">I’ve covered it remotely before. It was my first year of freelancing for a small video game wiki site that no longer exists and I was excited because this was, in my freelancer’s eyes, the big leagues. I was covering E-friggin’-3.

## The F-150 Lightning now starts at $20k more than when it was announced

  <p id="QQ4Bm5">Ford is raising the price of the F-150 Lightning for the fourth time — the base “Pro” trim has gone from $55,974 to $59,974, not including a $1,895 shipping charge. When the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price">announced the Lightning in May 2021</a>, the starting price for the Pro was $39,974, $20,000 less than where it’s sitting now. Other models in the lineup, such as the Lariat and Platinum, are also getting price bumps.</p>
<p id="P3Iqmh"><a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/ford-increases-f-150-lightning-prices">According to <em>Automotive News</em></a>, the Lariat trim has gone up $1,500 to $77,869, and the Platinum model is now $99,969, up by $1,200. (Those prices <em>do</em> include the shipping charge.) The slightly more attainable XLT trim is the only one that appears to be unaffected — its price <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/17/23514435/ford-electric-f-150-lightning-price-increase">rose to $63,474 in December</a> and seems to have stayed there.

## Carbon capture will probably make electricity more expensive

  <p id="CwUo38">Keeping coal and gas power plants alive while purporting to tackle climate change will likely make electricity more expensive for consumers, a new analysis warns. Fossil fuel companies have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23628772/texas-oil-company-occidental-carbon-capture-hub-pollution">eager to deploy</a> technologies that filter planet-heating carbon dioxide out of power plant emissions. But relying on the technology, called carbon capture and storage (CCS), is a risky venture and consumers are likely to bear the costs.</p>
<p id="QrIPBW">The cost of electricity from power plants outfitted with carbon capture devices is at least 1.5 to 2 times more expensive than other alternatives, according to a new <a href="https://ieefa.org/resources/ccs-power-yet-stack-against-alternatives">report</a> from the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

Gaming’s big summer show was set to return <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/7/23197645/e3-2023-pax-organizers-in-person-la-convention-center">in person in Los Angeles</a> for the first time since 2019, but it’s been called off after huge gaming companies like Nintendo, Microsoft, and Ubisoft all said they wouldn’t be participating in the event.</p>

  <p id="505RGK">Netflix’s ad-supported tier now works with Apple TV set-top boxes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/30/netflixs-ad-supported-plan-comes-to-apple-tv-after-months-of-delay/?guccounter=1">the company confirmed to <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. The “Basic with Ads” tier comes at a more affordable $6.99 per month cost, but when it launched in November, people who subscribed to it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438754/netflix-basic-ads-plan-not-supported-apple-tv">couldn’t use it on their Apple TV</a>. At the time, Netflix told <em>9to5Mac</em> that the ads plan <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/11/03/netflix-with-ads-apple-tv/">would work on Apple TV down the line</a>, and now that support is here. </p>
<p id="3GfLbJ">If you want to watch content through the ad-supported plan, you’ll need to be on version 2.3.0 of the Netflix app for Apple TV. I tested the plan on my laptop when it first launched, and whatever you’re imagining Netflix with ads is like, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438971/netflix-basic-with-ads-what-you-cant-watch-padlock">you’re probably right</a>.

  <p id="11MlRi">Amazon has filed three lawsuits against groups that it claims were abusing its takedown system by filing thousands of illegitimate copyright complaints against other products in a bid to get people to buy their merchandise instead. In <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-targets-multiple-bad-actors-in-novel-lawsuit-further-protecting-selling-partners-from-fraud">an announcement on Thursday</a>, the company calls the lawsuits a “new offensive against bad actors.”</p>
<p id="ztnhNS">According to the lawsuits (which you can read <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67108794/1/amazoncom-inc-v-dhuog/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67108793/1/amazoncom-inc-v-sidesk/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67108977/1/amazoncom-inc-v-vivcic/">here</a>), the alleged bad actors didn’t just file fake complaints and then sit back and wait to see if they worked.

  <p id="YsPhv8">An artificial intelligence-focused tech ethics group has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate OpenAI for violating consumer protection rules, arguing that the organization’s rollout of AI text generation tools has been “biased, deceptive, and a risk to public safety.”</p>
<p id="gV4qoG">The Center for AI and Digital Policy (CAIDP) <a href="https://www.caidp.org/cases/openai/">filed its complaint</a> today following the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23661374/elon-musk-ai-researchers-pause-research-open-letter">publication of a high-profile open letter</a> calling for a pause on large generative AI experiments. CAIDP president Marc Rotenberg was one of the letter’s signatories, alongside a number of AI researchers and OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk. Similar to that letter, the complaint calls to slow down the development of generative AI models and implement stricter government oversight.</p>

  <p id="LCLx0z">Roku plans to lay off an additional 200 employees, the company announced today in an <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/filing/7375345">8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, a little over four months after announcing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23464849/roku-streaming-layoffs-200-employees-costs-advertising">previous round of 200 layoffs last November</a>. While the first round affected its US workforce specifically, today’s filing doesn’t specify where the affected workers are based.</p>
<p id="7ipgOg">The layoffs are expected to impact around 6 percent of Roku’s workforce, and are part of a restructuring plan to “lower the company’s year-over-year operating expense growth and prioritize projects that the company believes will have a higher return on investment.” The restructuring changes are expected to mostly be completed by the end of the second quarter of this year. </p>

  <p id="XC2EVr">Twitter has formally announced its revamped API tiers a month and a half after new CEO Elon Musk promised a big shake up of the system. In a thread, the <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1641222782594990080">company’s official developer account</a> listed three tiers — free, basic, and enterprise — and provided some details on their prices and read and write limits. It also linked to <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info">signup</a> <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en">pages</a>, which offer links to get started with the first two tiers, and to express an interest in the third.</p>
<p id="mtF6dx">The company says older tiers will be depreciated “over the next 30 days.” Here’s a short summary of the three replacements (which can also be <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en">found on Twitter’s website</a>): </p>
