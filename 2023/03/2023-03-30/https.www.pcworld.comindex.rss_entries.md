<p>Turns out Google imposes a hard limit on the number of files you can upload to Google Drive, its cloud storage service&mdash;despite a lack of clear documentation that outlines the restrictions. That magic number? Five million.</p>



<p>This hidden count only became apparent when users started running into it. As <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/123fjx8/google_has_applied_a_5_million_items_limit_for/&amp;xcust=2-2-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">reported on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/google-drive-has-a-5-million-item-cap-even-if-you-have-storage-space-left/&amp;xcust=2-2-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">shared by CNET</a>, users discovered this cap the hard way in February. In a post on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/268606830?pli=1&amp;xcust=2-2-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google&rsquo;s IssueTracker</a>, both individuals and businesses noted that uploads had stopped working on their accounts, but without a clear explanation for the failures, leaving users confused while scrambling to deal with broken automated integrations and backup systems. Upgrading the account to a higher amount of storage also did not fix the problem.</p>



<p>In early March, Google&rsquo;s customer service agents revealed the hard ceiling in individual replies to account holders, stating they could not exceed 5 million documents&mdash;even when the total storage used was under the plan&rsquo;s limits. A Google Workspace spokesperson confirmed this policy in a statement to CNET, saying individual users were limited to 5 million total created items to &ldquo;maintain strong performance and reliability.&rdquo; However, the rollout of this limitation appears to be inconsistent, with others on the IssueTracker thread hitting the restriction at the 1 million mark. If you&rsquo;ve encountered Error 403 (&ldquo;The limit for the number of items, whether trashed or not, created by this account has been exceeded&rdquo;), you may have tripped into this issue.</p>



<p>Mention of this restriction on file count remains missing from Google&rsquo;s documentation, too. At the time of this article, only a help page covering <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/37603?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-2-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">individual file limitations</a> (with surprisingly fine detail) exists. Meanwhile, shared drive accounts have their file limits <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/7338880?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-2-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">clearly listed as a maximum of 400,000</a>, and competitor Dropbox has <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.dropbox.com/storage-space/file-storage-limit&amp;xcust=2-2-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">no limitations on the number of files uploaded</a>; same for Box, which the company confirmed to CNET.</p>



<p>Affected users now face a hard decision: Switch accounts (either to a rival service or within Google), or begin deleting files. Neither task will be simple for those part of wide organizations (one person described this limitation affecting &ldquo;tens of thousands&rdquo; affiliated with their org) and folks who had used their accounts for cloud backups. Backup software can create multiple small files as part of incremental backups, which can add up over time&mdash;as was the case for the Redditor who alerted <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/google/&amp;xcust=2-2-1677792-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">r/Google</a> to this issue.</p>



<p>In response, other Redditors pointed out a temporary workaround&mdash;adding all documents to a few zip files. (Never change, Reddit.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the showdown you&rsquo;ve been waiting for: All three players in the desktop GPU market, going head-to-head in the contentious affordable category. PCWorld contributor Keith May has gathered graphics cards from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel in the sub-$280 price range and placed them in a battle royale for your budget bucks. If you want to see them face off, check out the latest PCWorld video on our YouTube channel. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This head-to-head fight is made possible because the 8GB Asrock Arc A770 recently hit a super-low price on sale, making Intel&rsquo;s top-of-the-line card comparable with the GeForce RTX 3050 and Radeon RX 6650 XT from Nvidia and AMD, respectively. So while you might not be able to find these specific cards at a price below $280, there should be something in that price range that&rsquo;s along the same lines whenever you&rsquo;re deal-hunting. The exact cards Keith tested are as follows: </p>



<ul><li>Intel &ndash; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/asrock-arc-a770-a770-pgd-8go/p/N82E16814930077&amp;xcust=2-2-1677284-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asrock Arc A770 Phantom Gaming D 8GB OC</a> </li><li>AMD &ndash; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YHXT12P&amp;xcust=2-2-1677284-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MSI Radeon RX 6650 XT MECH 2X 8G OC</a> </li><li>Nvidia &ndash; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09R2NWCV1&amp;xcust=2-2-1677284-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Zotac GAMING GeForce RTX 3050 Twin Edge OC 8GB</a></li></ul>



<p>As it happens, all three cards are at or below the $280 price at the links above, as of the time of publishing this article. </p>



<p>The full video has breakdowns of the test rig and our benchmark games, which are: <em>Cyberpunk 2077, Horizon Zero Dawn, Borderlands: Tiny Tina&rsquo;s Wonderlands, Forspoken, Returnal, Modern Warfare 2, Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Valhalla, Rainbow Six Siege, Hitman 2, </em>and <em>Watch Dogs Legion.</em> If you absolutely can&rsquo;t spare ten minutes, here&rsquo;s the general conclusion. All three cards performed shockingly well given the price points we&rsquo;re looking at, but the AMD RX 6650 XT is the overall winner, even with weaker performance on VRAM-heavy titles. There&rsquo;s nuance involved depending on the game and screen resolution, however, so watch the full video if you can.</p>

## Midjourney halts free trials after fake AI images go viral

<p>Midjourney has temporarily cancelled free trials of the AI art service after a series of AI-generated fake images went viral, according to the company&rsquo;s founder David Holz.</p>



<p>Holz <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/952771221915840552/1090207147268255774&amp;xcust=2-1-1677533-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">announced</a> the changes on Discord (and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23662940/deepfake-viral-ai-misinformation-midjourney-stops-free-trials&amp;xcust=2-1-1677533-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">noted</a> by The Verge) which is the platform that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/820518/midjourneys-ai-art-goes-live-for-everyone.html">Midjourney uses as its default interface</a>. The reason? &ldquo;Due to a combination of extraordinary demand and trial abuse we are temporarily disabling free trials until we have our next improvements to the system deployed,&rdquo; Holz said.</p>



<p>While Holz didn&rsquo;t go into specifics, the subtext may have been that users have rediscovered Midjourney again. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/788422/how-to-get-started-with-ai-art-dall-e-mini-ai-dungeon-and-more.html">AI art</a> service recently deployed what it calls Midjourney v5, a new update that allows for some incredibly lifelike AI creations. &ldquo;Photos&rdquo; of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/120vhdc/the_pope_drip/&amp;xcust=2-1-1677533-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Pope Francis went viral</a>, appearing to show the pontiff in a stylish white puffy jacket, like something a rapper might wear. Similar &ldquo;photos&rdquo; of former president Donald Trump decked out in gladiator gear and other macho costumes can also be found on Discord via its search function.</p>



<p>Midjourney&rsquo;s previous free trial required users to create a new Discord account, which is free, and then sign up for the trial. (Midjourney doesn&rsquo;t quite state how many image generations come with the free trial, but they&rsquo;ve typically been about 40. Users can &ldquo;spend&rdquo; their image generation credits either with new prompts or else via variations on the existing image or upscaling them to larger sizes.) Midjourney&rsquo;s paid Basic tier begins at $10 per month.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Midjourney Trump as gladiator" class="wp-image-1677586" height="804" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Midjourney-Trump-as-gladiator.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Political propaganda has become rampant on Midjourney, with derogatory images of former president Obama and macho fantasies like this image of Donald Trump, a 76-year-old man.</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://discordapp.com/channels/662267976984297473/1086795067118858280/1090027271252869190&amp;xcust=2-1-1677533-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Midjourney</a></div>



<p>On the other hand, Holz also announced an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/952771221915840552/1090879027906101334&amp;xcust=2-1-1677533-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">upgrade to the Midjourney algorithm</a> Wednesday night, which should be twice as fast. Since Midjourney measures its subscriptions not by the number of images generated but on the GPU load they place on the server, that means that users will be able to essentially double their amount of images that the service will generate before their allotment runs out. Midjourney also allows users to place their requests in a &ldquo;relaxed&rdquo; queue, which allows for unlimited generations but at the cost of a delay of about ten minutes.</p>



<p>Ironically, that also means that if a user is willing to pay Midjourney $10 or $30 per month for its paid tiers, they can generate even more images&mdash;and fake photos, too. </p>



<p>Midjourney has also taken a somewhat laissez-faire attitude toward publishing images that depict public figures. Others, like Bing Chat, do not&mdash;forget trying to depict Bill Gates juggling chainsaws, for example. We&rsquo;ll have to see what prompts Midjourney restricts&hellip;or not.</p>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s helpful <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html">Bing AI chatbot</a> will be getting more ads, the company recently announced in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.bing.com/search/march_2023/Driving-more-traffic-and-value-to-publishers-from-the-new-Bing&amp;xcust=2-1-1677292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, which was penned by corporate vice president Yusuf Mehdi. In a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23662476/microsoft-bing-chatbot-ads-revenue-sharing&amp;xcust=2-1-1677292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">statement to The Verge</a>, Caitlin Roulston, the company&rsquo;s director of communications, clarified that the &ldquo;ads will show in the new Bing, specifically in chat (as they do in traditional search results).&rdquo; </p>



<p>Twitter user <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/debarghya_das/status/1640892791923572737&amp;xcust=2-1-1677292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Debarghya Das</a> provided a helpful visual on what the ads may look like within Bing chatbot after seeing some appear when asking about cheap Hondas. As you can see in the screenshot below, there are a number of tiny Ad boxes in the most relevant spots. These boxes will link back to Bing, of course. The placement is logical and the smaller boxes aren&rsquo;t too intrusive, so hopefully it won&rsquo;t be too much of a nuisance. They&rsquo;re basically linked citations.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bing Chat now has Ads!<br /><br />It's going to be fascinating to see how the unit economics of Ads in language models will unfold and affect search advertising.<br /><br />1/3 <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/o5YjRjikOP&amp;xcust=2-1-1677292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/o5YjRjikOP</a></p>&mdash; Deedy (@debarghya_das) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/debarghya_das/status/1640892791923572737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1677292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">March 29, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>This news isn&rsquo;t too surprising, as Microsoft has been using ads in Bing since February. However, the ads pop up as inside shopping results or sponsored links. Now Microsoft plans to embed these ads within Bing&rsquo;s chat box responses. My only concern is the amount of ads Microsoft plans on incorporating. I&rsquo;m not a fan of ads in general, especially if it&rsquo;s a deluge of them. I&rsquo;m easily aggravated by the constant ad breaks on Hulu, for example, as they constantly disrupt the flow of the show I&rsquo;m watching. If I&rsquo;m ever going to use Bing chatbot, I don&rsquo;t want it to disrupt the experience for me.</p>



<p>Monetizing Bing chatbot makes sense as far as running a business goes, but how will it impact the user experience? I knew the monetization of the AI assistant would come sooner or later, especially with Bing amassing over <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bing-crossed-100-million-daily-active-users-080138371.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1677292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">100 million daily active users</a>. Microsoft is looking for a way to make money with its GPT-4-powered Bing AI chatbot and this is how its going to do it. Hopefully, the intuitive user experience will remain intact. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>The new generation of PCIe 5.0 SSDs are absolutely incredible pieces of technology, delivering read and write speeds that were impossible just a few years ago. They&rsquo;re also really, really hard to find. While we were expecting a fairly healthy market at this point in 2023, so far we&rsquo;ve only seen two models arrive, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504081/gigabytes-newest-ssd-has-a-heatsink-with-its-own-zip-code.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">one from Gigabyte</a> and one that&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microcenter.com/product/660437/inland-td510-2tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-5-x-4-nvme-m2-internal-ssd&amp;xcust=2-1-1677185-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusive to Micro Center</a>. Thanks to Galax, you can add a third option to the list&hellip;but only in China, for the moment. And it&rsquo;s an imposing one.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/galaxs-pcie-50-ssd-arrives-with-beefy-active-heatsink&amp;xcust=2-1-1677185-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>, the Galax HOF (for &ldquo;Hall of Fame&rdquo;) Extreme 50 is now on sale in China for 2500 yuan, which is a bit more than $350 in US dollars. That&rsquo;s the 2TB 2280 drive, which the manufacturer claims can read at 10,000 megabytes per second, with write speeds just a tad lower at 9500 MB/s. The 1TB model has slightly slower performance, at 9500/8500 MB/s, respectively. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Galax PCIe 5 SSD active heatsink" class="wp-image-1677274" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/galax-ssd-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Galax</p></div>



<p>Both versions of the drive come equipped with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.szgalaxy.com/__ZH_GB__/Product5/ProductDetail?proID=984&amp;xcust=2-1-1677185-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an absolutely massive heatsink</a>. It&rsquo;s an active cooling model with a built-in fan, even bigger than the passive cooler spotted on the Gigabyte PCIe 5.0 drive. With a design that wraps around the entire PCB of the drive, <em>a la</em> a modern graphics card, you won&rsquo;t be able to fit any components above it on the motherboard, and it won&rsquo;t fit into rear-facing slots, either. The active cooling fan also requires a standard 4-pin power connection. Such is the sacrifice one must make for screaming speed, I suppose.  </p>



<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly when the Galax HOF drive will be available internationally, but within the next month or two seems like a safe bet. The scarcity of these next-gen drives is particularly frustrating for PC builders, as the rest of the storage and memory market is in a huge slump, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1664694/its-a-great-time-to-upgrade-your-ssd.html">creating fantastic prices</a> on RAM and 4th-gen SSDs. </p>

<p>When it comes to protecting your PC, the right antivirus software can make a world of difference. I mean, who in their right mind wants to deal with malware attacks and security breaches? I know I don&rsquo;t. Today only, on PCWorld&rsquo;s very own online software store, <a href="https://software.pcworld.com/p36726-bitdefender_total_security_2023_5-device_1-yr">Bitdefender is on sale for $19.99</a>, which is a massive 78 percent off of the original $89.99 price. That&rsquo;s a full year of security on up to five devices, and Bitdefender works on Android, macOS, and Windows 8 through 10. It boasts a ton of cool feature, too.</p>



<p>What you&rsquo;re getting is the Bitdefender Total Security 2023, which is the company&rsquo;s full security suite. It comes with antivirus, firewall, browsing protection, parental controls, encryption, and so on. When we <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393363/bitdefender-total-security-review-2.html">reviewed the security suite back in July</a>, we awarded it an exceptional four out of five stars. The &ldquo;top protection&rdquo; antivirus is the cornerstone of that, of course, but we also liked the customizable dashboard, as well as the effective anti-tracking browser extension. To sum it up, our reviewer says that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;a very good antivirus suite with some very useful features to meet most users&rsquo; needs,&rdquo; calling Bitdefender a &ldquo;good value for the money.&rdquo; </p>



<p>And that was at full price. At a whopping 78 percent off, this is a phenomenal deal. You better scoop it up fast, though, as the deal ends in exactly one day.</p>

## Windows 12 may be stripped down to enable frequent updates

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;Windows 12&rdquo; will be designed as a more modular system that will enable quick, frequent updates without much handholding from the user, according to a new report.</p>



<p>The company hasn&rsquo;t formally announced a new version of Windows yet, but Microsoft is already <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1532952/windows-11s-new-canary-channel-could-be-a-test-bed-for-windows-12.html">paving the way for Windows 12 testing</a> with a new Windows Insider &ldquo;Canary&rdquo; build. Now we&rsquo;re starting to hear whispers of what Windows 12 may have in store.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-windows-corepc-modern-platform-hudson-valley-2024&amp;xcust=2-1-1674397-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Central report</a> claims that this new &ldquo;CorePC&rdquo; concept will strip Windows 12 (or whatever it&rsquo;s known as) down to its component parts, representing another attempt at a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; version of Windows. As the story points out, Microsoft tried that with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393937/windows-10x-leaks-hands-on-with-microsofts-new-simplified-os.html">Windows 10X</a>&mdash;but without the under-the-hood components that would actually simplify the operating system. (Subsequently, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394562/microsoft-kills-windows-10x.html">Microsoft cancelled Windows 10X</a> but kept the user interface as part of Windows 11.)</p>



<p>The CorePC concept uses something called &ldquo;state separation,&rdquo; Windows Central says, which essentially breaks up the operating system into various partitions. It&rsquo;s not clear whether these partitions would be user-accessible or not. The other advantage, apparently, is that separating various components into different partitions&mdash;virtual buckets, if you will&mdash;allows each partition to be managed and updated separately. This would theoretically allow for quicker, more seamless updates to the Windows OS.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ve seen hints of this before. Go back far enough, and Windows was once a giant, holistic thing updated via periodic service packs and feature updates. But in 2020 Microsoft introduced the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393771/the-windows-feature-experience-pack-is-a-curated-collection-for-beta-testers.html">Windows Feature Experience Pack</a>, which allowed access to distinct features, and then &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/611767/meet-the-new-ways-in-which-microsoft-is-quietly-adding-features-to-windows.html">experiences</a>,&rdquo; which updated some of the core features of Windows outside of the normal update channels. Apps like Microsoft Edge, which Microsoft would normally update as feature releases, now have their own development track, too. </p>



<p>All this points to Microsoft making Windows more modular over time. What CorePC would do, apparently, is separate some of that code to make this new modularity approach even easier to implement. (A compatibility layer called Neon would help ease older apps into this new scheme, Windows Central reports.)</p>



<p>This new approach will have a number of potential benefits: yet another attempt by Microsoft to take on Chromebooks and Google&rsquo;s Chrome OS in the low-end PC market, while potentially introducing more demanding AI apps into the more powerful upper echelons.</p>



<p>All this is being targeted at the next version of Windows, apparently code-named Hudson Valley. Will it happen? We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see. While you wait, be sure to check out our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1434344/windows-11-tips-you-must-try-in-2023.html">10 Windows 11 tips and tricks we use to customize our PCs</a>.</p>

## Seeing blurry, distorted patches of red on your new monitor? Try this fix
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671259/seeing-blurry-distorted-patches-of-red-on-your-monitor-try-this-fix.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671259/seeing-blurry-distorted-patches-of-red-on-your-monitor-try-this-fix.html)

<p>So, you bought a new monitor and hooked it up to your PC. But now you no longer have perfectly sharp, crisp text and images. Instead, you&rsquo;re seeing blurry, smeared elements wherever concentrations of the color red appear. As for anything else with red in it? It just looks&hellip;off.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, you probably don&rsquo;t have an issue with your monitor. It&rsquo;s more likely that you have a bandwidth problem related to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling&amp;xcust=2-1-1671259-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">chroma subsampling</a>. When your PC is sending a video signal to your monitor, it has to use a higher level of compression for color data, creating that ugly JPG effect. You have to adjust your setup in order to switch to a less compressed color profile. We&rsquo;ll explain how.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">The best monitors: Gaming, 4K, HDR, and more</a></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="first-check-your-displays-color-profile-in-windows">First, check your display&rsquo;s color profile in Windows</h2>



<p>To confirm that chroma subsampling is the root of your problems, open Windows&rsquo; advanced display settings (<em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Advanced display settings</em>) to check the color format of your monitor.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Advanced Display Settings in Windows" class="wp-image-1671262" height="747" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hpx32_badsettings.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>This HP X32 monitor&rsquo;s blurry red text and images stems from that YCbCr422 color profile.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>In the example above, the HP X32 monitor is set to YCbCr 4:2:2. YCbCr is an alternative color space to RGB&mdash;instead of treating color as red, green, and blue, it handles the information as a mix of luminance (brightness) and chroma (color). Meanwhile, 4:2:2 is a reference to the level of subsampling (that is, how much of the luma and chroma data is taken for constructing the video signal). At 4:2:2, only half the luma and chroma data are being taken, which can cause artifacting. And that&rsquo;s the exact issue this monitor&rsquo;s owner experienced with red text and images.</p>



<h2 id="next-answer-these-questions">Next, answer these questions</h2>



<p>Switching to an uncompressed color profile is now your goal, but the way you&rsquo;ll achieve it depends on your setup. So, your next step is figuring out what could be limiting your PC.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti firmware update alert" class="wp-image-1671263" height="333" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nvidia-update.png" width="518" /><figcaption><p>Your graphics card may only be capable of matching your monitor&rsquo;s capabilities after a firmware update.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<ul><li><strong>Is it Windows? </strong>You may be able to switch color profiles in your graphics card&rsquo;s software&mdash;if there&rsquo;s not a limitation in play, AMD Radeon software and Nvidia&rsquo;s Control Panel allow you to override Windows&rsquo; default choice.</li><li><strong>Is your graphics card old?</strong> It may not be able to send uncompressed color data to your monitor at your current resolution and frame rate settings.</li><li><strong>Does your GPU need an update?</strong> Powerful but older graphics cards could need a firmware update. For example, an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti&rsquo;s launch firmware doesn&rsquo;t support DisplayPort 1.4 and its higher refresh rates.</li><li><strong>What cable are you using? </strong>If you&rsquo;re not using the cables included with your monitor, you might be accidentally limiting your video signal&rsquo;s bandwidth.</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nvidia's Control Panel lets you play with the color format for output" class="wp-image-1671309" height="738" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nvidia-control-panel.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Nvidia&rsquo;s Control Panel lets you adjust the color format for output, provided that you&rsquo;re not constrained by a hardware (or cable) limitation.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Before answering any of these questions, you can first test to see if dropping down to a less strenuous resolution and frame rate improves your monitor&rsquo;s output&mdash;it&rsquo;ll help verify that you&rsquo;re on the right path before diving into troubleshooting.</p>



<h2 id="how-this-plays-out-in-the-real-world">How this plays out in the real world</h2>



<p>Not sure how these troubleshooting steps work out in reality? Let&rsquo;s take the previously mentioned HP X32 monitor as an example.</p>



<p>The owner of the HP X32 started by focusing on their PC&rsquo;s graphics card&mdash;an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti. It&rsquo;s able to drive the monitor at 1440p at 165Hz, but only after a firmware update to enable DisplayPort 1.4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, strangely, nothing changed after the firmware update. Red text and images still looked blurry, and text lacked sharpness. Dropping down to 120Hz fixed the issue though, as did trying out an HDMI connection, which implied a lingering bandwidth limitation. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Displayport-Kabel" class="wp-image-1443941" height="871" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Displayport-Kabel.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="946" /><figcaption><p>The cable you use to connect your computer and monitor can affect the video signal sent by your PC.  </p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>After some thinking, the likely culprit became clear: The DisplayPort cable in use came from the previous monitor rather than what was included in the HP X32&rsquo;s box. (Oops.) One quick swap later and the PC finally started using an RGB color profile instead of YCbCr 4:2:2 at 144Hz and 165Hz.</p>



<p>Had the PC&rsquo;s graphics card been less powerful, the fix would have been to stick with a lower refresh rate, so that an RGB color profile could be used. But the overall moral of the story is to not be lazy&mdash;if I&rsquo;d changed my monitor cables while exchanging out the old panel (yes, this is my tale), I would have dramatically reduced the time I spent troubleshooting. But at least you all now know how to avoid my fate.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite tech tools are the ones that I don&rsquo;t use on a daily basis.</p>



<p>I don&rsquo;t pry open my laptop too often, for instance, but I&rsquo;m glad to have the right tools at hand when the need arises. Same goes with various adapters, extension cords, cables, and battery backups.</p>



<p>In the same way that you might have a toolbox for handiwork, you might consider keeping a tech toolkit for maintaining, fixing, or improving your gadgets. That way, you don&rsquo;t have to run off to an electronics store or wait for an Amazon order to arrive in your time of need.</p>



<p>Here are seven tech tools that I&rsquo;m always happy to have at my disposal:</p>



<h2 id="gadget-repair-kit">Gadget repair kit</h2>

Many of these kits also come with plastic picks and pry tools for pulling gadgets apart.</p>



<p>When a button on my Nintendo Switch controller failed, for instance, the repair kit allowed me to open it up. I&rsquo;ve also used the pry tools to replace the battery on&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://jarednewman.com/sendy/w/WD4bLNlO2zevWYsbDbLY892w/tRmzmhWmUerL5et995r892AA/7GNCfbxxt9yWkOPSJoVLvQ&amp;xcust=2-2-1676070-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">an old Chromebook</a>, and I&rsquo;ve inspected the innards of several laptops while <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">reviewing them for PCWorld</a>. And when the battery on my Lenovo laptop starts to run down, I know its T5 Torx screws won&rsquo;t be able to keep me out. The repair kit is an indispensable tool for any gadget that isn&rsquo;t held together with glue. (For that, you&rsquo;ll need a&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Heat-Gun/IF145-031?o=1&amp;xcust=2-2-1676070-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">heat gun</a>.)</p>

<p>If you own a computer of any kind, I guarantee that it will benefit from an occasional blast of compressed air. Its internal fans inevitably suck up dust over time, hurting both performance and battery life as they have to work harder to keep the system. Buy&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Falcon-Compressed-Disposable-Cleaning-DPSJB/dp/B0000AE67M&amp;xcust=2-2-1676070-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a can</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NB2W194&amp;xcust=2-2-1676070-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">or three</a>) and give the vents a blast. Better yet, open up your computer (perhaps with the repair kit above) for a more thorough air dusting.</p>

Use a paperclip to eject the SIM tray and move the card to another phone. Need to factory reset a router, game controller, or remote control? You might need that paperclip to push the reset button.

<p>AMD now has a plethora of CPU options, ranging from the original Ryzen 7000 lineup to the new X3D variants. There&rsquo;s also a couple of non &ldquo;x&rdquo; variants such as the Ryzen 9 7900, too. That means you&rsquo;ll have plenty to choose from. This opens the possibilities for smaller, more efficient builds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s where the MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi comes in. As in &ldquo;Goldilocks&rdquo;&mdash;this one is just the right size. Micro-ATX sits in between the standard ATX size you&rsquo;re used to, and smaller Mini-ITX motherboards. (It&rsquo;s a bit shorter in length than ATX). It&rsquo;s a great compromise of size, features, and performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coupled with the more affordable B650 chipset, it also takes aim at a more reasonable price. We&rsquo;ll go over the features, design, and performance. Are you missing out by going to a smaller motherboard? Or does the space savings mean that you can cram it into an even smaller case? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi" class="wp-image-1668389" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-13-at-4.09.53-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<h2 id="msi-mag-b650m-mortar-wifi-the-specs">MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi: The Specs</h2>



<ul><li>Micro-ATX form factor (9.6&times;9.6 inches)</li><li>Supports AMD AM5 Ryzen 7000 CPUs&nbsp;</li><li>12+2+1 Duet Rail System with six-layer PCB</li><li>DDR5 RAM, dual channel up to 4 DIMMs (up to 128GB)</li><li>2x onboard M.2 slots (PCIe Gen 4)</li><li>2x PCIe 16x slot (PCIe Gen 4, 16x/4x)&nbsp;</li><li>1x PCIE X1 slot</li><li>HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort out&nbsp;</li><li>8 USB ports on back (including 1x 20Gb/s)</li><li>Realtek 2.5Gbe LAN with Bluetooth 5.2</li><li>Wi-Fi 6E&nbsp;</li><li>RGB headers for Mystic Light</li><li>6 SATA 6Gb/s ports&nbsp;</li><li>5 PWM fan headers&nbsp;</li><li>BIOS Flashback button&nbsp;</li><li>Pre-installed I/O shield&nbsp;</li><li>Realtek 7.1 ALC 4080 audio</li><li>MSRP $239</li></ul>

<p>The MSI MAG B650M Mortar Wi-Fi will set you back a cool $239. While AMD&rsquo;s AM5 overall platform costs are initially higher, B650 chipsets help make it more affordable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This B650 chipset is slightly trimmed down from B650E and X670E. It saves cost, but you&rsquo;ll also have to do with less: fewer USB options, SATA ports, and PCIe lanes. You still get PCIe Gen 4, and two M.2 NVMe slots. Keep in mind that Micro-ATX motherboards typically will have less I/O to begin with, due to size.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi" class="wp-image-1668391" height="680" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-13-at-4.08.36-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Everything included in the MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi box.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The unboxing experience is expectedly bare-bones. You get two Wi-Fi antennas for the 6E support, some stickers, Ez M.2 clips, and SATA cables.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="cpu-choice">CPU choice</h3>



<p>AMD has tons of CPU options for Ryzen 7000 on the market now. Want the original 7700X? Sure! How about a more power-efficient, cooler-running 7900 for a smaller case? That will work too. Or if you&rsquo;re feeling adventurous, the new X3D CPUs such as the 7950X3D will also give you the fastest performance around. We&rsquo;d likely recommend something sensible like the 7700X, or the upcoming 7800X3D for this class of motherboard. The 7600 will be a great option, too.</p>



<h3 id="ddr5-ram-and-pcie-gen-4">DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 4</h3>



<p>AM5 is DDR5 RAM exclusively, but prices now make it more attainable than before. Performance on average will be great&mdash;and you can fit up to 128GB across four RAM sticks. That&rsquo;s one advantage of this Micro-ATX form factor over smaller Mini-ITX options, which typically only have two RAM slots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You won&rsquo;t get PCIe Gen 5, but plenty of Gen 4 is on tap. Both 16x slots are Gen 4, and you also get a 1x slot. This is another reason why Micro-ATX is versatile for small builds, as smaller motherboards won&rsquo;t have this many slots. This makes it great for add-in cards and expansion, without needing full-size ATX. Just make sure your GPU will allow clearance for any extra cards.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>



<p>NVMe slots are limited to two onboard. While we&rsquo;d like to see three, it&rsquo;s understandable for this form factor to have some limits due to size. You do get six SATA ports for more storage options, however. Some motherboards come with an add-in NVMe PCIe card of some sort, but it&rsquo;s sensible that you would not have this included in this price class. You can still add one separately as an option, as you&rsquo;ll have the slot if your GPU isn&rsquo;t massive.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="usb-ports">USB ports&nbsp;</h3>



<p>With eight rear USB ports, including 1x USB C, I/O is great for the size. No USB 4 here&mdash;but it does pack 20Gb/s USB for those needing fast transfers. Small motherboards typically will have limited USB options, so it&rsquo;s great to see an almost ATX-level offering here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DisplayPort and HDMI 2.1 also help augment Ryzen 7000 CPUs, which have built-in iGPUs. This comes in handy for troubleshooting without a discrete GPU when needed!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Excellent news: The B650M Mortar&rsquo;s I/O shield is integrated, and the M.2 NVMe drives have retention clips! PC builders can rejoice at these simple, but highly vital quality-of-life inclusions.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>



<p>You&rsquo;ll get similar connectivity options to ATX motherboards. Wi-Fi 6E and 2.5GbE LAN are both standard, along with Bluetooth 5.2. Networking is complete and robust. Users needing more, like 10GbE, will need to step up to much more expensive (and often larger) motherboard options.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>



<p>Audio is fine here, with a 7.1 ALC4080 codec. It also has enough inputs on the back for most users. If you need much better sound options, you&rsquo;ll have to do with external solutions or add-in cards.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-16-at-3.21.38-PM.png?w=1200" /></figure></div>



<h3 id="other-features-of-note">Other features of note</h3>



<p>We&rsquo;re happy to see an integrated I/O shield, it makes the experience of building much smoother. You also get &ldquo;Ez clips&rdquo; for the M.2 drives, which simplify access. A BIOS Flash button is also clutch when you just need that special-case BIOS upgrade. That&rsquo;s a lot of features that were traditionally relegated to expensive enthusiast motherboards of the past, so it&rsquo;s great to see them make their way here.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="msi-mag-b650m-mortar-wifi-design">MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi: Design&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi" class="wp-image-1668392" height="617" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-16-at-3.21.38-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The B65M Mortar compared to a bigger ATX B650 MSI Tomahawk.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi immediately reveals its biggest design trick: its Micro-ATX form factor. This opens it up to fitting much smaller cases, expanding the possibilities for builds. It can even come in handy in a normal-sized case, like, say, the Lian Li O11 Dynamic. If you&rsquo;re water cooling and don&rsquo;t have much room on the bottom due to thick radiators, Micro-ATX can keep the motherboard clear of that space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aesthetically, it shares a lot with MSI&rsquo;s Tomahawk lineup, and that&rsquo;s great news. It has an exceptionally clean design, with robust-looking VRM heatsinks, and armor plating in the right places.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this motherboard comes in at a cheaper price point, the design and build quality certainly do not indicate that. Materials and finish are great, with most important areas covered by heatsinks, or &ldquo;Armor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t think you need the smaller form factor, you&rsquo;re often better off going with a larger ATX variant such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1522279/msi-mag-b650-tomahawk-wifi-motherboard-review.html">MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk</a> we recently reviewed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi" class="wp-image-1668393" height="753" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-13-at-4.08.54-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi&rsquo;s M.2 &ldquo;Frozr&rdquo; shields are a high-quality design touch that many other motherboards lack.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The M.2 &ldquo;Frozr&rdquo; shields protect the two NVMe drive slots. It adds an element of completeness to the design&mdash;many cheaper motherboards leave this area exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You won&rsquo;t find any RGB effects, however. You can still add RGB via the headers to your liking. Part of the price savings comes from not having fancy screens or intricate motherboard effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Excellent news: The I/O shield is integrated, and the M.2 NVMe drives have retention clips! PC builders can rejoice at these simple, but highly vital quality-of-life inclusions.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi" class="wp-image-1668394" height="880" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-13-at-4.10.14-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi (backside).</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Sweeping around to the back, you&rsquo;ll find the typical bare design. Overall, this is a very attractive motherboard that makes tremendous sense for small builds where RGB is often harder to spot. Looks premium, for a less-than-premium price&mdash;great design!&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="msi-mag-b650m-mortar-wifi-performance-software-and-bios">MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi: Performance, software, and BIOS&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi has a 12+2+1 power stage and a six-layer PCB. If you compare this to some overkill motherboard VRM stages on hyper-expensive motherboards, it doesn&rsquo;t look impressive on paper. Once again, this is not an overkill motherboard, but the &ldquo;Goldilocks&rdquo; special!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same holds true for performance&mdash;it will competently handle even the blistering Ryzen 9 7950X3D without issue. While you won&rsquo;t break any records, it&rsquo;s more than capable. Depending on your build, you&rsquo;ll still see great performance even from the more efficient &ldquo;non-X&rdquo; SKUs such as the Ryzen 9 7900. Lower watts and temperatures, meaning more consistent performance in small spaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DDR5 is also standard here&mdash;up to 128GB. The same caveat holds true: overclocking the fastest kits probably doesn&rsquo;t make sense. That&rsquo;s okay&mdash;it still can handle almost anything you throw at it with Expo profiles and super-fast performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going further, while you&rsquo;re not getting PCIe Gen 5 performance, PCIe Gen 4 is more than sufficient for GPUs and most NVMe drives on the market. There&rsquo;s no need to incur that extra expense! You&rsquo;re technically not taking full advantage of AM5&rsquo;s PCIe Gen 5 potential, however. That makes the more expensive CPUs less of a good match for this board, but you&rsquo;ll have many other options that fit the bill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Closing off motherboard performance, the USB ports are fast, with 20Gb/s speeds. That&rsquo;s the norm with even pricier ATX motherboards, with very few having the 40Gb/s speeds of USB4.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to tweak your system, we have the MSI BIOS for that. Much like Asus, MSI has a marvelous BIOS that allows you to tune various elements. Ranging from CPU overclocking, to configuration of your hardware&mdash;it&rsquo;s all here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those that would rather leave the tinkering to science will also be happy: Automatic overclocking with AMD&rsquo;s Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) is available, along with AMD&rsquo;s Expo profile for DDR5 RAM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s also simple to update the BIOS&mdash;something we&rsquo;d recommend doing. While mature systems don&rsquo;t always need BIOS updates, B650 is still new and updates early on often fix many teething issues.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;d like to spend as little time in the BIOS as possible, MSI Center has a few options to keep you entertained. Of course, Mystic Light allows for RGB header control and symbiosis with other peripherals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also has some rudimentary hardware monitoring, although we&rsquo;d recommend better third-party options for that. You can set PWM fan speeds, and even use &ldquo;Live Update&rdquo; to grab drivers. Overall, it works well&mdash;a big improvement from buggier motherboard software of the past.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-msi-mag-b650m-mortar-wifi">Should you buy the MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi?</h2>



<p>The MSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi delivers on its goal: Micro-ATX versatility, without compromising on features. It does all this for $239.99, a very fair price in today&rsquo;s more expensive motherboard market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Impressively, it does this without skimping on features that you&rsquo;d get on even larger ATX motherboards. Networking is just as good, and audio and even PCIe slots are well represented. The board closes the gap even further with eight USB ports, and good overall performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given its ability to pair with powerful CPUs and smaller cases, the B650M Mortar offers a potent combo for small form-factor enthusiasts. It certainly makes one consider Micro-ATX over Mini-ITX if more I/O is needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it isn&rsquo;t the flashiest design, and lacks the RGB flair some users may desire. It also won&rsquo;t break any records with its specs&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t have to. It&rsquo;s a very well-balanced effort that allows small form-factor builds to be more financially sensible.</p>
