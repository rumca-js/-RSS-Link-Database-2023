As I said at the beginning, I wanted to like Ravenbound, and there are certain endearing things about it. Alas, it's just a list of “could've” and “should've”. The Hatred system could have been a fun risk and reward mechanic. Combat should have been a fun amalgamation of dodging, parrying and slashing. The world could have been full of life and unique secrets to uncover. I should have been able to fly anywhere at the drop of a hat.

Instead, I just remembered there's a janky grappling hook, such is its impact on the gameplay. Unless grappling up mountains is a game-changer for you, that is.

Ravenbound could still very well live up to its potential as a rogue-lite-hack-and-slash-meets-3D-open-world. However, its combat, world design, enemy variety, Hatred system, towns, NPCs, performance, environmental effects and more still need some serious work, and that's before adding any new mechanics or variety to the gameplay.

There are a lot of surface level questions posed by the prospect of a 9th Resident Evil game: will it be 1st or 3rd person? Will its setting mark a return to urban civilisation ala Racoon City, or will it be a continuation of isolated rural environments? Genre-wise, will it lean more into action-heavy territory, or plunge headfirst into psychological horror abysses? 

This last question is especially prescient as the developer have largely favoured one or the other for Resident Evil titles. They’re either stately, shuffling horrors stuffed with tension or games stuff with full throttle action and bombast. The developer never seem to be able to land on a formula which successfully marries both… that is, until Resident Evil Village.
