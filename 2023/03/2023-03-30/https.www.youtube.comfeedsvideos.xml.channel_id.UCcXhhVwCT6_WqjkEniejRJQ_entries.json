I highly recommend you checking out Klevgr\u00e4nds other plugins - everything they do is awesome. Huge thanks to Klevgr\u00e4nd for this collaboration.\n\nSubscribe to Klevgr\u00e4nd on youtube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@klevgrand\n\nThis sound means so much to me, i created it by sampling my own music box and i have used it on almost all my songs to date.
