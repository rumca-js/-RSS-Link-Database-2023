Announcing additional content for a game like Hogwarts Legacy is sure to reignite interest within the game after the launch hype has slowed down, and doing so at a time when new versions of the game are coming out will surely nudge new players to jump aboard the hype train with hopes of playing the base game before the DLC eventually drops in the near future.

All of this comes together to paint a very promising picture for Hogwarts Legacy on PS4 and Xbox One. All that Avalanche Software needs to do now is to deliver the same experience without any unreasonable compromises on these legacy platforms. While I am no game development expert, this shouldn’t be a big ordeal since Unreal Engine 4 is known for being a pretty flexible tool that scales well across different platforms. And if the developers manage to do just that and more, the launch of Hogwarts Legacy on PS4 and Xbox One is sure to be more eventful than what many might have anticipated.
