<p>Computing giant Google announced today that it will release previews of three new AI features, including AI composition for Google Workspace, developer prototyping and coding via PaLM and MakerSuite, and validated models for its Vertex AI service.</p><p>The Workspace features, currently, are focused on Docs and Gmail. Users can use Google’s AI to rewrite emails in a particular style or tone, or even generate documents out of whole cloth. Simply asking the system to “generate a sales pitch” or similar will create a simple document that users can then edit to meet their needs. The AI can also help redraft documents to fit a more formal tone, or shorten them for brevity, and so on.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3690341/google-previews-generative-ai-features-for-workspace-users-developers.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>I'm a writer. That means many of my fellow writer buddies are worried sick about losing their jobs.

Because, as of now, ChatGPT does a crappy job of writing non-fiction. That isn't stopping publishers from using it, of course.

<p>Google's <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2893364/is-chrome-os-right-for-you.html">ChromeOS</a> is the Rodney Dangerfield of modern operating systems: It's been around for ages now, and it pops up in all sorts of unexpected places. No matter how hard it works, though — boy, oh boy — it just can't get no respect.</p><p>Much like Dangerfield, ChromeOS's struggle to be taken seriously dates back to its childhood. When the software first entered the universe in <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2469895/google-s-chrome-os-notebook-my-first-impressions.html">the simpler tech times of 2010</a>, it truly was a barebones effort. The entire platform was essentially just a browser in a box — a full-screen view of Google's Chrome browser, with no real apps to speak of and not much else around it.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3690590/chromeos-2023-google-has-eye-on-enterprise.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
