The capture you see above shows WR 124, a star located in the constellation Sagittarius, approximately 15,000 light years away from Earth. When the JWST first sighted WR 124 in June 2022, it captured the star undergoing a Wolf-Rayet phase. According to NASA, only some massive stars go through such a transition before they eventually explode. Those that do are among the largest and most luminous celestial bodies in the night sky. In the case of WR 124, NASA estimates the star is 30 times the mass of the Sun and has so far shed about 10 Suns worth of material. Over time, the gas Wolf-Rayet stars expel will cool and form cosmic dust.</p><div id=\"dd0ac156baf8449b9ebce85405e2bec5\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">There is beauty in transience. \ud83c\udf38<br /><br />Webb\u2019s stunning image of a super bright, massive Wolf-Rayet star calls forth the ephemeral nature of cherry blossoms.

The material is an essential building block of the universe. As NASA notes, it shelters coalescing stars and can even come together to form planets. At the moment, however, there\u2019s no theory that explains the amount of cosmic dust there is in the universe. The JWST could help astronomers tackle that mystery. \u201cBefore Webb, dust-loving astronomers simply did not have enough detailed information to explore questions of dust production in environments like WR 124, and whether the dust grains were large and bountiful enough to survive the supernova and become a significant contribution to the overall dust budget,\u201d NASA said. \u201cNow those questions can be investigated with real data.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-jwst-captures-a-rare-star-about-to-go-nova-220013676.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-jwst-captures-a-rare-star-about-to-go-nova-220013676.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-14 22:00:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "US government opens $2.5 biilion in funding for community EV chargers", "description": "<p>The Biden administration just made good on one of its promises to make <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-unveils-5-billion-plan-or-ev-charging-infrastructure-133022348.html\">EV charger funding</a> available to local governments.

These allow four more teams to \u201cmake the tournament\u201d than if the selection committee just filled the two 16-seed and two 12-seed slots with one school in each spot.

It\u2019s March Madness, after all. The First Four is scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, March 15th and 16th, with the March Madness schedule consisting of the First and Second rounds playing out between Friday, March 17th and Monday, March 20th. Sweet Sixteen and Elite 8 runs Friday to Monday again, starting March 24th, and the Final Four and National Championship Game are set for March 31st and April 2nd.</p><p>If you notice there are some scheduling differences so that there are only women\u2019s games on Mondays and both the Final Four and championship are slotted between the same events for the men. So when it comes down to crunch time, you can watch the conclusion of both tournaments live without having to sacrifice viewing the other.</p><p>ESPN <a href=\"https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2023/03/dancin-to-dallas-espn-once-again-exclusive-home-of-march-madness-womens-basketball/\">has the rights</a> to the Women\u2019s NCAA Tournament, so you can expect games to show up on ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPNEWS. The first two of the First Four games will be broadcast at 7PM ET and 9PM ET on ESPNU Wednesday night with the second pair on ESPN2 Thursday evening. First Round matchups begin at 11:30AM ET on Friday and Saturday on ESPN2, with subsequent games on those days expanding to the other networks.</p><p>Once again, if you have a cable plan or streaming TV service with Disney\u2019s sports channels you\u2019re all set. However, the best place to watch all of the action will be the ESPN app. Here, you\u2019ll get access to a multicast feature that will give you up to four games at once (YouTube TV didn\u2019t specify if it would include women\u2019s games in its multiview trial). Multicast will be especially handy during those first four days of the tournament when there\u2019s lots of action happening at the same time. However, it's only available on Apple TV and Xbox One.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/march-madness-streaming-guide-163042028.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/march-madness-streaming-guide-163042028.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-14 16:30:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google is shoving generative AI into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Meet, Chat and Slides", "description": "<p>Google has been scrambling to catch up to to OpenAI for months, ever since the latter dropped its  conversational bot, ChatGPT, and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html\">took the generative AI industry by storm</a>.

Sounds like a dream, right?</p><p>Well, mostly. For one, it's an eye-watering $699, putting it out of reach for most cat owners. And like practically every \"smart\" device, I ran into issues while setting up the Litter Robot 4. After a few months of testing, I've encountered many quirks \u2013 sometimes it didn't sift properly, occasionally its cat detecting sensors went haywire, and it didn't really prevent litter from reaching my floors. Despite all of that, though, it still made my life easier. Thanks to the Litter Robot 4, I had to deal with animal poop just a bit less every day. I'll chalk that up as a win.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"9bbc0a8646bc4aecb53ba0fbbe5c7515\"></div><p>As a cat owner since 2009, I've always eyed self-cleaning litter boxes with envy. But almost every option seemed like a headache back then: Some required specialized litter, others were prone to jamming and failure. And even though the Litter Robot has been around for a while, I've always considered it too expensive to be practical. But now that my household has grown, thanks to that aforementioned poopy infant and a pair of adopted kittens, I was eager for some relief. (One of those kittens also grew into an enormous 18-pound beast \u2013 you can imagine what his litter box looks like.)</p><p>I know several people who loved the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MaXR0ZXItUm9ib3QtQ29ubmVjdC1XaGlza2VyLUJlaWdlLVNlbGYtQ2xlYW5pbmcvZHAvQjBCNjQ4WDZUWD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1vZS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjYyOGYxN2EtOWI4Yi00ZmZhLTk3Y2EtN2U1MjYwMzZiY2E4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWXLNuWuz9jGKV-FMjlkt9Tr9GdUGis5wlv-a6v2A_t9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLitter-Robot-Connect-Whisker-Beige-Self-Cleaning%2Fdp%2FB0B648X6TX%3F\">Litter Robot 3</a>, and it was <a href=\"https://technomeow.com/litter-robot-3-review/\">generally well-reviewed</a>, despite being simultaneously bulky on the outside <em>and </em>a bit too small for cats on the inside. The Litter Robot 4 improves on its predecessor with a sleeker design (it's a bit less wide, so it should fit better in small rooms), as well as a larger opening for big cats. It's also Wi-Fi connected, which makes it easy for you to check on litter and waste levels with Whisker's app. Thanks to new weight sensors, you can track how often your cats are using the Robot, and the company is also planning to launch more individualized tracking later this year. In theory, that should let you know if one of your cats is using the litter box too often, or not enough.</p><p></p><figure><img alt=\"Litter Robot 4\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/14964e70-bebb-11ed-9f7b-81fd003a45c7\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Setting up the Litter Robot 4 was fairly easy \u2013 until I ran into some software issues. You just have to yank the 24-pound egg-like bot out of its box, dump some clumping litter into the main compartment, and throw an included bag in the waste bin. The device itself is made entirely out of plastic, making it fairly light and easier to maneuver. The inner portion where the litter sits is covered in a rubber-like material, which should make it fairly durable and easier to clean than hard plastic.</p><p>After plugging in and turning on the Litter Robot, though, I was faced with my worst fear with any new smart gadget: Pairing issues. Without being paired to the app, the Robot wouldn't self-clean at all. A few hours of frustration later, I learned that Whisker was having a system-wide issue and I had to wait a few days for the company to deliver a fix.</p><p>So it goes with smart devices, you might say. But it definitely felt silly (and a bit enraging) to be manually cleaning this $699 litter box. Without that initial connectivity, it was no better than the $20 litter tray my cats use upstairs. Once the app was set, the Robot ran through a cleaning cycle and evenly sifted the remaining litter. Upon seeing this new litter box move and make sounds (it's surprisingly quiet!), my three cats wouldn't go near it. At that point, it was just a $699 monument to pet excess.</p><p>A few days later, the bravest of the bunch \u2014 my 18-pound tuxedo cat named \"Jiji\" \u2014 finally jumped into the Litter Robot to explore. After several hops in and out, he deemed it safe and left his first offering, which was promptly cycled into the waste bin. The Litter Robot seemed pleased. Within a week, all of my cats were onboard. And around then, I noticed something strange: I couldn't smell any poop or pee! Sure, the Whisker app told me the waste bin was full, but you wouldn't know that while standing right in front of it. That's a good sign for anyone who wants to place the Litter Robot in a cramped living room.</p><figure><img alt=\"Litter Robot 4\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/13c60620-bebb-11ed-9774-bd5177957ee0\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>My honeymoon period ended when one of my cats left a streak of feces inside the Robot. No amount of sifting and cycling got rid of that. Eventually, I started to notice some strange behavior from the device (perhaps in protest to what that cat did). Sometimes its indicator lights would flash red \u2014 a sensor fault, according to the Whisker app. The only way to fix that was by turning the unit on and off. Occasionally, the Robot wouldn't fully clean itself after one of my cats used it. So I had to hit the cycle button up top to get it going.</p><p>Over the course of a week, I typically have to deal with three of four issues like this from the Litter Robot. Few of those involve touching actual poop, and it's far less than I'd be cleaning a normal litter box. Still, for $699, I wish it were more reliable. I wouldn't trust it to work for an entire week if my family went on vacation. Just don't lose your cat sitter's number.</p><p>Cleaning out the Litter Robot's waste bin is a cinch \u2014 just yank out the liner bag and replace it with another. While you could stick with Whisker's products, I haven't had any trouble using Glad's 13-gallon ForceFlex bags. The company also recommends wiping down the Litter Robot's internals once a month, as well as refreshing the litter with an entirely new batch. That process isn't tough, but I found it easiest to accomplish by dragging the device outside. And yes, it also means you'll need to get your hands dirty a bit. There's just no escaping the poop.</p><p>Whisker's mobile app does a great job of alerting me when the waste bin is full, or when litter is running low. And it may sound strange, but I genuinely appreciate seeing how often my cats use the box. It's particularly helpful if one cat is feeling sick \u2013 going to the Robot frequently could be a sign of illness. The app also keeps track of your cat's weight, which could help you avoid over or under-feeding. (And of course, a big weight drop could be another health concern.)</p><figure><img alt=\"Litter Robot 4\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/13cd3210-bebb-11ed-bfff-ab60104fd362\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>After a few months of testing, only two of my cats continue to use the Litter Robot 4. Still, they use it frequently enough to fill up its waste bin every week. (We also have two normal litter boxes around the house for the lone renegade.) My one major annoyance, aside from all of those random errors, is the Litter Robot's open design. I'm aware it's something cats prefer, but it also leads to litter being strewn around the floor. Unfortunately, Whisker's bundled gate and front step for the Litter Robot don't really help much. If you do end up getting this thing, I'd suggest adding a litter mat up front, and be prepared to vacuum or sweep every few days.</p><p>The Litter Robot 4 is an extravagance, but it's one that tired cat owners may find useful. Just don't expect any miracles. You'll still need to watch out for errors, do some manual scrubbing and sweep up stray litter. The perfect self-cleaning litter box isn't here yet, but the Litter Robot 4 is as close as you'll get.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/litter-robot-4-review-great-imperfect-self-cleaning-litter-box-140022763.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/litter-robot-4-review-great-imperfect-self-cleaning-litter-box-140022763.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-14 14:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Cowboy\u2019s \u2018Adaptive Power\u2019 update breathes new life into its flagship bike", "description": "<p>When Cowboy, a premium European e-bike company, invited the media to an event in Paris, France, it faced some unexpected challenges. Along with torrential rain, there also were strikes and protests against changes to the country\u2019s pension system. And then the big reveal was\u2026 <em>not</em> a new bike. Instead, the announcement was three springtime color options for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cowboy-4-electric-bike-launches-with-a-step-through-model-121513629.html\">Cowboy 4</a> and 4ST (step-through) plus Adaptive Power, a software upgrade coming to Cowboy 4 bikes this month. So when I met the company\u2019s execs, I already had my question: Where\u2019s the new model?</p><p>But before I sat down to speak with them, I was able to try out Adaptive Power, touring a few blocks and dipping down and out of Parisian car parks. Would this smarter e-bike (with the same motor) translate to any tangible improvements? Fortunately, yes. Adaptive power works by tapping into the e-bike\u2019s accelerometer and other sensors, based on the rider\u2019s weight, momentum and other factors \u2013 even wind. The new feature adjusts the motor\u2019s power without the need for gears or tapping a boost button. The sensors also seemingly detect inclines as soon as your front wheel hits them, increasing motor assistance. The update taps into the same sensors and tech already used for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cowboy-ebike-crash-detection-173051437.html\">crash detection</a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Cowboy 4 Adaptive Power test ride\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/c7c53d20-c25e-11ed-bb76-cc478683d662\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>According to Cowboy, the e-bike should offer equivalent battery life between the two iterations, as the motors will likely work more than the last version when the bike needs more power, but also work less when it doesn\u2019t. If you\u2019re riding an updated Cowboy 4, you won\u2019t be able to return to the previous system, but using the app, you can choose between adaptive and eco modes, with the latter offering reduced assistance.</p><p>I was able to compare the C4, both with and without the feature, and the biggest improvement from Adaptive Power was how it kicked in at the perfect moment while accelerating from stationary. That\u2019s not to say the Cowboy 4, pre-Adaptive Power, was slow, but it felt smoother and more responsive \u2013 it\u2019s impressive for a single-gear bike. Previously, the bike\u2019s motor would respond to your pedal pushes. This time it takes in more information to decide whether to boost.</p><p>While that was the most convenient benefit, there\u2019s also a tangible improvement when tackling hills and inclines. With Adaptive Power, steep hills demanded a bit of pedaling but were surmountable. Downgrading to a bike without Adaptive Power \u2013 but the same motor with 45 Nm of torque \u2013 it\u2019s a journey on the struggle bus. This was a common complaint from Cowboy 4 riders, with several saying that hilly environments were difficult to tackle, even with electric support. This new feature seems to address that, judging by my brief ride on the updated Cowboy 4. (If Cowboy is looking for what to improve when it eventually gets to its fifth-generation bike, this city rider would appreciate a more comfortable saddle.)</p><div id=\"4291d2ffbc56459db0ad0120472f9ae1\"></div><p>This update plays to the Cowboy 4\u2019s design, too. Unlike many e-bikes, there are no controls to tap directly into the electric motor. It\u2019s meant to look (and ride) like a normal push bike and that\u2019s what it does. The Cowboy 4 is also, still, a few kilograms lighter than VanMoof\u2019s latest e-bike, its most comparable rival. Both are premium e-bike options with similar pricing and features, but if you\u2019re lifting your bike up stairs, or into buildings, it\u2019s worth considering.</p><p>While Adaptive Power has been in beta testing with users before now, the official launch coincides with three new color options of both the Cowboy 4 and 4ST. While it\u2019s an impressive way to upgrade the e-bikes of existing users \u2013 and do it without having to take it to a service center\u2013  these are the same bikes that first launched in 2021.</p><p>Until now, Cowboy has iterated fast, with new models arriving at a similar cadence to flagship smartphones. We reviewed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-03-cowboy-electric-bicycle-battery-review.html\">its first bike</a> in 2019, which wasn\u2019t long ago. But there are a few reasons for the company to stick with the Cowboy 4.</p><p>&nbsp;A lot of e-bike tech will not change hugely in the next few years. Barring incremental efficiency updates, the motor inside most e-bikes likely won\u2019t see generational updates. I also wonder how existing Cowboy e-bike owners see the company's updated models, having spent thousands on an e-bike 18 months earlier, only to see it replaced so soon. So why no Cowboy 5? For <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/cowboy/\">Cowboy</a>, CEO and cofounder Adrien Roose told me the focus is on improving quality, efficiency and all the things that come with scaling up to sell more bikes. <a href=\"https://us.cowboy.com/\">The C4 and C4 ST both remain priced at around $3,000</a>, depending on region, and the challenge is getting e-bike prices low enough for wider-spread adoption.</p><figure><img alt=\"Cowboy 4 Adaptive Power test ride\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/c7de4360-c25e-11ed-a7fd-0d5ed2018e90\" /><figcaption>Cowboy has a retail space on the first floor of a prestigious Parisian department store.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>The company has opened up flagship stores in Germany, Belgium and France \u2013 the countries Cowboy is intently focused on, and where it sells most of its bikes. So far it\u2019s sold over 50,000 bikes, globally. But while the C4 is available in the US (and being a company called Cowboy), earnestly targeting the American market remains a future challenge. Roose told me they\u2019re in \u201clearning mode\u201d regarding the US. The plan appears to focus on keeping the company healthy and profitable. Roose added that he believes that Cowboy should get to that point by next year.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/\">says</a> the company is letting go of another 10,000 workers or so and closing &quot;around 5,000 additional open roles that we haven\u2019t yet hired.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Meta will reduce the size of its recruiting team imminently and inform affected employees on Wednesday. The company will then announce layoff and restructuring efforts of its tech departments in late April and business teams in late May. Zuckerberg said it might take until the end of 2023 to complete the process, but the timelines might be different for Meta's operations outside the US. After restructuring, Meta plans to lift the hiring freeze.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;This will be tough and there\u2019s no way around that. It will mean saying goodbye to talented and passionate colleagues who have been part of our success,&quot; Zuckerberg wrote. &quot;They\u2019ve dedicated themselves to our mission and I\u2019m personally grateful for all their efforts. We will support people in the same ways we have before and treat everyone with the gratitude they deserve.&quot;</p><p>In addition, the company will &quot;announce restructuring plans focused on flattening our orgs&quot; and canceling lower priority projects, Zuckerberg said. Reports have suggested that the layoffs will impact teams working on wearable devices as part of the Reality Labs hardware and metaverse division. The &quot;flattening&quot; involves removing layers of management, while Meta will &quot;will ask many managers to become individual contributors&quot; \u2014 in other words, it seems managers will have to take on some of the tasks their employees focus on.</p><p>&quot;We still believe managing each person is very important, so in general we don\u2019t want managers to have more than 10 direct reports. Today many of our managers have only a few direct reports,&quot; Zuckerberg wrote. &quot;That made sense to optimize for ramping up new managers and maintaining buffer capacity when we were growing our organization faster, but now that we don\u2019t expect to grow headcount as quickly, it makes more sense to fully utilize each manager\u2019s capacity and defragment layers as much as possible.&quot;</p><p>In November, Meta <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html\">laid off more than 11,000 people</a>, which equated to around 13 percent of its headcount at the time.

Four months later, Meta announced planscutting thousands more workers.</p><p>The latest cost-cutting drive was widely expected. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57d43e90-f23e-48c4-8f62-2b6981e136e4\"><em>The Financial Times</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-07/meta-is-said-to-plan-thousands-more-layoffs-as-soon-as-this-week\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/23/23612833/metas-next-big-round-of-layoffs-are-coming\"><em>The Verge</em></a> have all reported in recent weeks that more layoffs were in the pipeline. Zuckerberg, who will soon go on paternity leave for his third child, recently described 2023 as a &quot;year of efficiency&quot; for the company and doubled down on that in his note to employees today.</p><p>&quot;Since we reduced our workforce last year, one surprising result is that many things have gone faster. In retrospect, I underestimated the indirect costs of lower priority projects,&quot; he wrote. &quot;A leaner org will execute its highest priorities faster. People will be more productive, and their work will be more fun and fulfilling.&quot;</p><p>The latest layoffs follow a year in which Meta saw <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-q2-2022-earnings-203433373.html\">declines in quarterly revenue for the first time</a> as its ad business slowed down. In October, the company also said it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-q3-2022-earnings-211903277.html\">expected to lose more money on Reality Labs</a> (the division that runs Meta's virtual and augmented reality initiatives) in 2023 as it continues to build its vision of the metaverse.

Hygiene aside, you should clean your earbuds (and their charging case) because it may result in better-sounding, longer-lasting headphones.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The widespread update of wireless buds has several companies now offering all-in-one cleaning kits too. These include established peripheral companies like <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e6618fee-bbbf-4638-9bf5-e216442c18d0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Belkin&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlNjYxOGZlZS1iYmJmLTQ2MzgtOWJmNS1lMjE2NDQyYzE4ZDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVsa2luLmNvbS9haXJwb2RzLWNsZWFuaW5nLWtpdC9BVVowMDVidEJLLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVlZWZmZjA3LTA4ZTEtNGM5NC1hODg2LWFiNWMzOTgyNzJmMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXrVE9XFDEy1jQ4ZmEn7yh7mlNJu3aJDz5eTJ4rzFjAl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fairpods-cleaning-kit%2FAUZ005btBK.html\">Belkin</a>, which features cleaning fluid to loosen up any tough build-up of wax and grime. That said, you may not need an entire kit, but suitable tools will make things easier.</p><p>You should always use the gentlest cleaning equipment before going ham with rubbing alcohol or a metallic tool. Doing so will reduce the chances of damaging your headphones' often glossy plastic casing and lessen the chances of damaging the delicate membranes that many buds (and some eartips) have. I speak from experience, having perforated two AirPod membranes due to over-enthusiastic cleaning. Even when removing the tips, take care: With <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LVdGLTEwMDBYTTQtSW5kdXN0cnktQ2FuY2VsaW5nLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMvZHAvQjA5NEM0VkRKWj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1vai0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWVlZmZmMDctMDhlMS00Yzk0LWE4ODYtYWI1YzM5ODI3MmYzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXljfbJaihXMRHww8o7OMv1sOH2J7AA6D7ttzOnIQrkl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-WF-1000XM4-Industry-Canceling-Headphones%2Fdp%2FB094C4VDJZ\">Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM4</a>, you need to <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1OWWdnMEpsR3BYOCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWVlZmZmMDctMDhlMS00Yzk0LWE4ODYtYWI1YzM5ODI3MmYzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAY14eDR3ih7ESnIA7uEsLe1fd56aoaYN6zc70m4T60db&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNYgg0JlGpX8\">twist and pull them off</a>.

With deep crevices to pick up dirt from your buds when they\u2019re charging, the case can also pick up pocket-lint from being in, well, pockets and your bag. These cases typically use metal contacts to connect to and charge the buds, so any build-up of dirt or earwax can actually affect recharging your headphones. It pays to keep those charging contacts clean. A soft cloth, or a cotton swab for more difficult-to-reach locations, should be able to capture anything blocking your buds from charging. You could also use a bit of air from a bulb air blower \u2013 I find the ones with a brush attached are perfect for this.</p><p>For both the earbuds and the case, you can use a thin toothpick to pull away any grime or wax trapped in the seams of the device. Most earbuds are molded plastic, but some have edges and lines that collect dirt together.</p><h2>How to keep your wireless earbuds clean</h2><p>Now your buds are looking pristine, try to keep them looking that way. If you\u2019re using your AirPods or Galaxy Buds during your workouts, wipe them down with a cloth afterward to reduce the chances of moisture getting inside. The more frequently you check on the state of your wireless earbuds, the easier they are to clean.</p><p>We\u2019ll finish this guide with a little bit of digital hygiene: make sure any companion TWE apps are up-to-date. These updates can sometimes add notable <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-2020-updates-transcribe-translate-sharing-detection-assistant-150028423.html\">new features</a> or improve performance. Your smartphone will usually transmit firmware updates to your earbuds automatically after OS and app updates, so make sure you keep them nearby to your phone. This is especially true with iPhones and AirPods, which will not notify you when firmware updates are available. Check that you\u2019ve got the latest version of the firmware in iOS settings (you probably do), and if it\u2019s not up-to-date, make sure both your iPhone and AirPods are plugged into power and (crucially) near each other. The update should be beamed to the AirPods pretty quickly, but you can also leave the devices next to each other overnight to ensure the update happens.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-clean-airpods-earbuds-150023325.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/how-to-clean-airpods-earbuds-150023325.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-14 13:15:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Waze can now direct you to charging stations that support your EV", "description": "<p>You might need one less app \u2014 and forego a headache \u2014 next time you're out driving and need to find an EV charging station.

The company has <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8dd3026f-7e6b-45a3-80ce-ce5bc76dcf43&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=NETGEAR&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4ZGQzMDI2Zi03ZTZiLTQ1YTMtODBjZS1jZTViYzc2ZGNmNDMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV0Z2Vhci5jb20vaG9tZS93aWZpL3JvdXRlcnMvcnM3MDBzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDBhMTA1YzAtYWRlNC00Y2FkLTg1N2ItNTlmNmUyMzhlNmFiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYM7WZQcRoNcoD1fLHwk-Mfg6KvXW1vhvjfxOjDiCbI4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netgear.com%2Fhome%2Fwifi%2Frouters%2Frs700s%2F\">launched</a> its first WiFi 7 router, the Nighthawk RS700S, and it's clear the speed isn't the only draw. While the 320MHz channels promise up to 5Gbps on WiFi 7, the main allure may be the very low lag \u2014 Netgear claims \"100x lower\" latency that should help with gaming, VR and other timing-sensitive apps. You may not be in a rush to plug your PC into an Ethernet jack, then.</p><p>The tri-band router offers coverage up to 3,500sq. ft thanks in part to a new antenna design, and can handle up to 200 simultaneously connected devices. You can create a mesh network if you need to cover a large home. A 10Gbps WAN Ethernet port makes sure the RS700S can support the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-fiber-launches-5gbps-service-for-125-per-month-214732336.html\">fastest home fiber connections</a>, although Netgear curiously limits the four local Ethernet ports to 1Gbps. You'll have to use WiFi if you want to make the most of this hardware.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Nighthawk RS700S arrives in the US in the second quarter of the year, and will cost a steep $700. You're paying for the privilege of being first. With that said, it costs less than Netgear's WiFi 6-based Orbi 860 two-pack despite much stronger performance in its (admittedly smaller) coverage area. If you're more interested in raw throughput than range, this may be the better value.</p><p>The greater issue is compatibility. Only a limited number of devices have the components needed to support WiFi 7, and the new format isn't enabled. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-specs-price-photo-and-video-take-center-stage-140034341.html\">Galaxy S23 series</a> is technically capable of WiFi 7, for example, but Samsung's phones officially support 'only' WiFi 6e. And while multi-gigabit internet service is becoming more commonplace, it's still rare enough that the RS700S' headroom may go unused. You're buying this router to future-proof your setup, not to realize any immediate speed gains.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netgears-first-wifi-7-router-offers-extra-low-latency-for-gaming-123037814.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/netgears-first-wifi-7-router-offers-extra-low-latency-for-gaming-123037814.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-14 12:30:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "It took a TikToker barely 30 minutes to doxx me", "description": "<p>In 30 minutes or less, TikToker and Chicago-based server Kristen Sotakoun can probably find your birth date.

My second thing is to show you cracks in your social media, which was the totally accidental thing that I became on TikTok,\u201d Sotakoun, who goes by <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7f992370-cf7e-4c1c-a82c-b28638fde669&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TikTok&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3Zjk5MjM3MC1jZjdlLTRjMWMtYTgyYy1iMjg2MzhmZGU2NjkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGlrdG9rLmNvbS9Abm90a2Fobmp1bmlvcj9sYW5nPWVuIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZWQ5YjUyMS0zNDhlLTQ0YTQtYmIzMy0zZmU1N2ExZDlhMTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARvZKkt4sR7ZvkzY-bB-fex15BaM4PXVXQ_Awb--4YoE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40notkahnjunior%3Flang%3Den\">@notkahnjunior</a>, told me.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It\u2019s not quite doxxing, which usually refers to making private information publicly available with malicious intent. Instead, it\u2019s known in the cybersecurity field as open-source intelligence, or OSINT. People unknowingly spell out private details about their lives as a bread crumb trail across social media platforms that, when gathered together, paint a picture of their age, families, embarrassing childhood memories and more. In malicious cases, hackers gather information based on what you or your loved ones have published on the web to get into your accounts, commit fraud, or even socially engineer a user to fall for a scam.</p><p>Sotakoun mostly just tracks down an anonymous volunteer's birth date. She doesn\u2019t have malicious intent or interest in a security career, she said she just likes to solve logic puzzles. Before TikTok, that was spending a ride home from a friend\u2019s birthday dinner at Medieval Times discovering the day job of their \u201cknight.\u201d Sotakoun just happened to eventually go viral for her skills.</p><p>So, to show me her process, I let Sotakoun \u201cconsensually doxx\u201d me. She found my Twitter pretty quickly, but because I keep it pretty locked down, it wasn\u2019t super helpful. Information in author bios from my past jobs, however, helped her figure out where I went to college.</p><p>My name plus where I studied led her to my Facebook account, another profile that didn\u2019t reveal much. It did, however, lead her to my sister, who had commented on my cover photo nine years ago. She figured out it was my sister because we shared a last name, and we\u2019re listed as sisters on her Facebook. That\u2019s important to note because I don\u2019t actually share a last name with most of my other siblings, which could\u2019ve been an additional roadblock.</p><p>My sister and I have pretty common names though, so Sotakoun also found my stepmom on my sister\u2019s profile. By searching my stepmom\u2019s much more unique name on Instagram, it helped lead Sotakoun to mine and my sister\u2019s Instagram accounts, as opposed to one of the many other Malones online.</p><p>Still, my Instagram account is private. So, it was my sister\u2019s Instagram account \u2013 that she took off \u201cprivate\u201d for a Wawa giveaway that ultimately won her a t-shirt \u2013 featuring years-old birthday posts that led Sotakoun to the day I was born. That took a ton of scrolling and, to correct for the fact that a birthday post could come a day late or early, Sotakoun relied on the fact that my sister once shared that my birthday coincided with World Penguin Day, April 25.</p><p>Then, to find the year, she cross-referenced the year I started college, which was 2016 according to my public LinkedIn, with information in my high school newspaper. My senior year of high school, I won a scholarship only available to seniors, Sotakoun discovered, revealing that I graduated high school in 2016. From there, she counted back 18 years, and told me that I was born on April 25, 1998. She was right.</p><p>\u201cMy goal is always to find context clues, or find people who care less about their online presence than you do,\u201d Sotakoun said.</p><p>Many people will push back on the idea that having personal information online is harmful, according to Matt Edmondson, an OSINT instructor at cybersecurity training organization SANS Institute. While there are obvious repercussions to having your social security number blasted online, people may wonder what the harm is in seemingly trivial information like having your pet\u2019s name easily available on social media. But if that also happens to be the answer to a security question, an attacker may be able to use that to get into your Twitter account or email.</p><p>In my case, I\u2019ve always carefully tailored my digital footprint to keep my information hidden. My accounts are private and I don\u2019t share a lot of personal information. Still, Sotakoun\u2019s OSINT methods found plenty to work with.</p><p>Facebook and Instagram are Sotakoun\u2019s biggest help for finding information, but she said she has also used Twitter, and even Venmo to confirm relationships. She specifically avoids resources like records databases that could easily give away information.</p><p>That means that there\u2019s still <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/senators-reintroduce-bill-to-protect-personal-data-online-222057399.html\">a lot of data out there</a> on each of us that Sotakoun isn\u2019t looking for. Especially if you\u2019re in the US, data like your date of birth, home address and more are likely already out there in some form, according to Steven Harris, an OSINT specialist that teaches at SANS.</p><p>\u201cOnce the data is out there, it\u2019s very hard to take back,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhat protects people is not that the information is securely locked away, it\u2019s that most people don\u2019t have the knowledge or inclination to go and find out.\u201d</p><p>There are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-30-security-experts-on-how-to-stay-safe-online.html\">simple things you can do</a> to keep attackers from using these details against you. Complex passwords and multi-factor authentication make it harder for unauthorized users to get into your account, even if they know the answers to your security questions.</p><p>That gets a bit more complicated, though, when we think about how much our friends and family post for us. In fact, Sotakoun said she noticed that even if a person takes many measures to hide themselves online, the lack of control over their social circle can help her discover their birth date.</p><p>\u201cYou have basically no control on your immediate social circle, or even your slightly extended social circle and how they present themselves online,\u201d she said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/it-took-a-tiktoker-barely-30-minutes-to-doxx-me-120022880.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/it-took-a-tiktoker-barely-30-minutes-to-doxx-me-120022880.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-14 12:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Master & Dynamic gives its MH40 headphones new drivers and longer battery life", "description": "<p>Master &amp; Dynamic debuted its first headphones, the MH40, in 2014.

It offers refined navigation and compass-based features, like the ability to set waypoints and ability to retrace your steps if you get lost. For scuba enthusiasts and others, there's a depth gauge and dive computer too. As such, it's the ideal wearable for hikers and divers.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Other features are geared toward endurance athletes, like the accurate route tracking and pace calculations that make use of a dual-frequency GPS. And Apple still includes the health features found in other Watch models too, like sleep tracking, temperature sensing and electrocardiogram readings, along with messaging, audio playback and Apple Pay. It offers a stellar 36 hours of battery life as well and up to 60 hours in low-power mode.</p><p>On the downside, the Apple Watch Ultra has a chunky (though rugged) case that you may not find comfortable to wear to bed. Moreover, the positioning of the action button is a little awkward, because it's right where many people will go to steady the Apple Watch Ultra with one finger while they press the digital crown or side button.

Meanwhile, in the pro audio world, it\u2019s perhaps most famous for its microphones - some of which have achieved <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sennheiser_MD_421\">legendary status</a> (I\u2019ll also personally recommend the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70a41cf2-0944-4b2e-9fdd-51f91494e8aa&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sennheiser&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MGE0MWNmMi0wOTQ0LTRiMmUtOWZkZC01MWY5MTQ5NGU4YWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9lbi11cy5zZW5uaGVpc2VyLmNvbS9jb25kZW5zZXItbWljcm9waG9uZS1zdHVkaW8tcmVjb3JkaW5ncy1wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwtbWstNCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzZjOTA1MzUtYTQwZC00YTJiLWFkYzYtNDk1NGI3NmZjZDE3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAeYNBG43WyWJCMQbw_SJw8ADe2L0OIKgrrq-TyO04H5g&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fcondenser-microphone-studio-recordings-professional-mk-4\">MK4</a> for podcasting to anyone who asks). Enter the company\u2019s newest offering - the $130 Profile USB microphone - that aims to bring some of that pro-audio magic to the podcasting or streaming worlds.</p><p>The company doesn\u2019t make a lot of USB microphones, so it\u2019s fair to say that the Profile is Sennheiser\u2019s play for the creator market. The space that\u2019s dominated right now by the Blue Yeti or Rode\u2019s NT-USB among others. Not only is it priced similarly, it offers the same key features such as gain control, direct monitoring and a mute button (something not every USB mic has, but probably should).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>One little touch that makes the Profile stand out is its built-in \u201ctilt\u201d mechanism. Where the Yeti and the NT-USB, for example, can be tilted via their stands, the Profile can be adjusted to your preferred angle without an additional mount. There\u2019s a standard  5/8\u201d thread underneath for fixing to boom arms and stands. You can also buy the Profile in a $199 bundle that comes with a dedicated boom, which has its own original design that\u2019s a little less imposing than rivals like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rodes-psa-1-podcasting-boom-arm-230009046.html\">Rode\u2019s PSA1+</a>.</p><div id=\"88a4be5c98a04236b1ae8547ff0b8da8\"></div><p>Thankfully, Sennheiser has bucked the general trend of making podcasting/streaming mics larger than they need to be. The Yeti ($100) is imposing (even <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/blue-yeti-nano-microphone-irl-143058272.html\">the Nano</a> is on the chonky side), the NT-USB ($170) isn't much smaller and other popular options like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-hyperxs-first-standalone-microphone-is-built-for-game-streamers.html\">HyperX Quadcast</a> ($140) and even Elgato\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elgato-wave-3-microphone-hands-on-150021908.html\">Wave 3</a> ($150) feel large by comparison. At $130, the Profile also sits on the more affordable end among its rivals.</p><p>Of course, no amount of features matter if it doesn\u2019t sound any good. Of the three mics mentioned here \u2013 which is far from exhaustive but covers two popular alternatives \u2013 the Profile most closely resembles the Blue Yeti, which is no bad thing given its sustained popularity. There\u2019s a pretty steep shelf off under 100Hz with some light enhancement around the 5- and 12kHz areas - the latter of which is common for adding some of that elusive vocal \u201csparkle.\u201d</p><p>Overall, the sound profile is very much in line with what most streamers and podcasters will be looking for - fairly neutral with a slight enhancement in the frequencies that give most voices extra clarity. Combined with the competitive pricing and the full suite of gain/mix/mute settings the Profile makes a very compelling case for itself.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sennheisers-profile-microphone-for-streamers-gets-a-lot-right-090017043.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/sennheisers-profile-microphone-for-streamers-gets-a-lot-right-090017043.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-14 09:00:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Court rules that Uber and Lyft can keep treating drivers as contractors in California", "description": "<p>Uber and Lyft don't have to worry about reclassifying its workers in California for now.

That means providing them with all the appropriate benefits and protections, such as paying for their unemployment and health insurance. As a response, Uber, Lyft, Instacart and DoorDash poured over $220 million into campaigning for the Prop 22 ballot measure, which would allow them to treat app-based workers as independent contractors. It ended up <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/california-voters-reaffirm-that-uber-drivers-are-indeed-employees-091216147.html\">passing by a wide margin</a> in the state.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In 2021, a group of critics that included the Service Employees International Union and the SEIU California State Council filed a lawsuit in 2021 to overturn the proposition. The judge in charge of the case sided with them and called Prop 22 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/california-judge-finds-prop-22-unconstitutional-043822868.html\">unconstitutional</a>. He said back then that the proposition illegally \"limits the power of a future legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers' compensation law.\"&nbsp;</p><p>The three appeals court judges have now overturned that ruling, though according to <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy8xMy9idXNpbmVzcy9wcm9wLTIyLXVwaGVsZC1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVmOWQyZGE1LWMxZTctNGM2Ni1hMThhLTI1MTFiZWRhOWRiNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdIc5rqG7QXzdW41Ioden-R3togOGmJPU71UqlpRABbM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F03%2F13%2Fbusiness%2Fprop-22-upheld-california.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, one of them wanted to throw out Prop 22 entirely for the same reason the lower court judge gave when he handed down his decision. While the appeals court upheld the policy in the end, it ordered that a clause that makes it hard for workers in the state to unionize be severed from the rest of the proposition. That particular clause required a seven-eighths majority vote from the California legislature to be able to amend workers' rights to collective bargaining.&nbsp;</p><p>David Huerta, the president of the Service Employees International Union in California, told <em>The Times</em> in a statement: \"Every California voter should be concerned about corporations\u2019 growing influence in our democracy and their ability to spend millions of dollars to deceive voters and buy themselves laws.\" The group is now expected to appeal this ruling and to take their fight to the Supreme Court, which could take months to decide whether to hear the case.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/court-rules-uber-lyft-keep-contractors-classification-drivers-california-054040457.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/court-rules-uber-lyft-keep-contractors-classification-drivers-california-054040457.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-14 05:40:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
