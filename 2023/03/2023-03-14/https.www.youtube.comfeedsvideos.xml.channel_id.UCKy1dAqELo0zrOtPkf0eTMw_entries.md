In today's Daily Fix:
Nintendo of America's president, Doug Bowser, believes their first $70 game will be worth the price. Via the Associated Press, Bowser said "I think fans will find this is an incredibly full, deeply immersive experience. The price point reflects the type of experience that fans can expect when it comes to playing this particular game." But for Nintendo fans worried about shelling out 70 bucks for all their first-party games, fear not. Bowser said this isn't necessarily going to be the price for every game. According to him, it's fairly common in Europe and other parts of the world to vary the price depending on the game. In other news, it seems like IO Interactive is full speed ahead on their James Bond 007 game, and confirmed that any new Hitman games are on pause at the moment. And speaking of game delays, the System Shock remake has been pushed back a couple of months.

Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon reviewed by Michael Higham on Nintendo Switch.

This spin-off is an absolute joy through and through. From its impressive, fantastical story moments full of childlike charm to its clever platforming puzzles and satisfying battles, this is a superb action-adventure where every piece comes together to create a wondrous playable storybook. Its dual-character concept doesn’t evolve that much once you get the hang of it, and its conclusion could have done a bit more to leave a lasting impact. But it’s a journey you’ll cherish all the same, and one that’s been brought to life through a beautiful art style, stellar voice performances, and an outstanding soundtrack.
