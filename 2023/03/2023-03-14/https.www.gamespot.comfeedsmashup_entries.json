Oh, and maybe the best battle pass in the game's history, which comes with the much-anticipated Eren Jaeger skin from Attack on Titan.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's no small praise considering how high the quality of the passes in Chapter 3 were, not to mention the excellent Season 1 pass that just ended. No, this battle pass lineup is truly next-level, offering up an unprecedented selection of cool freaks, creatures, and interesting people. There are several skins here that would be <em>very </em>popular if they were sold in the item shop, but as battle pass offerings--meaning everybody and their mothers are gonna own these skins--some of these are going to be ubiquitous in battle royale for years to come.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But which skin from the Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2 battle pass is truly the best? That's probably something we'll all never be able to agree on, because this Suicide Squad-esque lineup of weirdos caters to so many different tastes. But here's one stance that doesn't seem to be all that controversial: no matter what kind of weirdo you may be in real life, this battle pass has a skin that matches it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now, let's rank these skins.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Stray</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4111137-strayfortnitechapter4season2battlepassskinsranked.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>There's nothing wrong with this season's Drift remix, but he's just a little bit too neat and clean for a group of skins that is otherwise pretty freakin' chaotic. That said, his lankiness does give him a little bit of a creepy vibe when he's got his mask on, so Stray could very well be the sort of skin that grows on you over time. Or maybe, like the original Drift, people will wear him so much that the sight of him is revolting.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Renzo the Destroyer</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4111141-renzothedestroyerfortnitechapter4season2battlepassskinsranked.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This very classy terminator looks incredible, but he has a major flaw: He doesn't have a working mouth or eyes. So he's a skin that looks amazing standing still and in general gameplay, but he's kinda \"meh\" doing emotes. For some of you that won't be that big of a deal. But for those of us who like for our skins to entertain us while we wait for matchmaking, Renzo is a little bit frustrating. But only a little bit. He's still a <em>beautiful </em>skin--but without a working face his comedy potential is a lot lower than I expected.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Imani</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4111140-imanifortnitechapter4season2battlepassskinsranked.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Imani is the obligatory regular person in the Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2 battle pass, and since this pass is so loaded with awesome weirdos she's kind of the odd one of the group. As part of this package, she kinda gets lost a little bit--but we'll be able to appreciate her more over time once we wear out our obsessions with Thunder and Empress Mizuki.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Eren Jaeger</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4111133-fortnitechapter4season2battlepassskinsrankederenjaeger.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>While the protagonist of Attack on Titan isn't quite so inherently hilarious as Goku or Naruto are, Attack on Titan is so earnest that it's gonna be just as much fun using this skin in Party Royale as it will be in Battle Royale. The more sincere and serious the character, the better the Fortnite collab is. It's why Darth Vader will probably always be the funniest Fortnite battle pass guy, and it's why Eren Jaeger is pretty much guaranteed hilarity.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Highwire</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4111136-highwirefortnitechapter4season2battlepassskinsranked.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This off-brand combo of Harley Quinn and Catwoman is sure to be a hit with the 500-crowned-victories type of folks who make my solo lobbies so outrageously sweaty. But also this is a great character design, and the bonus style that comes in Easter colors is a nice touch--I always appreciate it when they throw us a holiday style or two in a battle pass.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Mizuki</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4111135-empressmizukifortnitechapter4season2battlepassskinsranked.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We're not totally sure why Mizuki is the tier-100 skin on the Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2 battle pass--unlike with the Ageless Champion boss last season, we don't really know anything about her or what her role is in the story yet. But I do know this: This is gonna be one of the skins I pull out when I keep getting killed as soon as I drop and need to get serious. She just has that vibe.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Thunder</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4111139-thunderfortnitechapter4season2battlepassskinsranked.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Considering how many animal person skins Fortnite has, it's frankly shocking there aren't more lizard guys around. This is our first one in years--and he was well worth the wait. In any other battle pass Fortnite has ever had, Thunder would be the best skin, hands down, especially with all three of his styles that you can unlock. But it's a testament to the quality and audacity of this pass that there's something better, and not a knock on Thunder's design at all. He's perfect.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Mystica</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4111138-mysticafortnitechapter4season2battlepassskinsranked.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>But Mystica is <em>more</em> perfect. She is, perhaps, the greatest freak Fortnite has ever known. This is a skin I can barely even comprehend, no matter how long I spend staring at it. And I've spent a lot of time staring at it. People who discover this skin after Chapter 4 Season 2 ends will <em>weep</em> when they realize they can never have her.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-4-season-2-battle-pass-skins-ranked/2900-4677/", "date_published": "2023-03-14 19:28:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "John Wick Director: There Is No Reason For Hollywood To Still Use Real Guns On Set", "description": "<p>Following the tragic shooting that occurred on the set of the movie Rust that led to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, John Wick director Chad Stahleski has said there is no reason to have a live gun on a set.

According to Twitter user LuigiBlood, two screenshots from Metroid Zero Mission were left in the Metroid Fusion folder on the Japanese version of the Game Boy Advance emulator, and it raises a few questions.</p><div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Japanese GBA NSO 1.1.0 is interesting... they accidentally left these screenshots about link functionality in Metroid Fusion folder. <a href=\"https://t.co/aJ0q3STmGt\">pic.twitter.com/aJ0q3STmGt</a></p>  \u2014 Yakumono (@LuigiBlood) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LuigiBlood/status/1633647505148633088?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">March 9, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir=\"ltr\">For one thing, Metroid Zero Mission is not yet available on NSO in any territory, so this suggests that the game is likely coming to the service sooner rather than later. This isn't exactly surprising, given that it's one of the most beloved GBA games ever. However, the stranger news here is that the two screenshots detail how to use the GBA console's link functionality. While we don't have any word about that yet from Nintendo, this might mean that the NSO emulator might be able to replicate the real console's link feature, which was an important part of games like Zero Mission and the Golden Sun series.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's not clear if this will actually happen, but it would seem to be an obvious feature that Nintendo could add to the emulator, and it seems that the company has looked into it. Upcoming games on the GBA NSO service include Kirby &amp; The Amazing Mirror, Fire Emblem, F-Zero Maximum Velocity, and Golden Sun.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-zero-mission-may-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-along-with-gba-link/1100-6512330/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-zero-mission-may-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-along-with-gba-link/1100-6512330/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-14 16:17:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "DRAGON BALL Xenoverse 2 Free Update Teaser Trailer", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4111995-dragonballxenoverse2-freeupdateteasertrailer.mp4.00_02_02_12.still002.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Check out the trailer of the new DLC Hero of Justice Pack 2 &amp; Free Update.", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-free-update-teaser-trailer/2300-6460849/", "date_published": "2023-03-14 16:01:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "WWE 2K23 Official Launch Trailer", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4111994-cena.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> WWE 2K23 early access is available NOW for Deluxe and Icon Edition users!", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/wwe-2k23-official-launch-trailer/2300-6460848/", "date_published": "2023-03-14 15:58:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "FTC Finalizes Order Making Fortnite Dev Pay $245 Million In Refunds", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>[UPDATE] </strong>The Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-finalizes-order-requiring-fortnite-maker-epic-games-pay-245-million-tricking-users-making\">announced</a> today, March 14, that it has finalized its order for Epic Games to pay $245 million to settle claims that Epic \"used dark patterns to trick players into making unwanted purchases and let children rack up unauthorized charges without any parental involvement.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Commission voted 4-0 to approve the order, which was <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-agrees-to-pay-500-million-in-fortnite-ftc-case/1100-6510151/\">first announced in December 2022.</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The millions will be used for refunds to customers.

In place of the self-assured dominatrix we know and love is a timid young girl who is far more comfortable clutching a stuffed animal than she is a pistol. Instead of large-scale, action-packed set pieces and the mainline series' unapologetically over-the-top style, we are treated to enchanted forests, well-worn book pages adorned with soft illustrations, and gentle, childlike curiosity. As such, the first few hours I spent with Bayonetta Origins were filled with complete and utter confusion. I couldn't find the connection between Bayonetta Origins and the Bayonetta trilogy, or the threads that connected the two experiences to one another. But thankfully, the team behind Bayonetta Origins could.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Bayonetta Origins is an achievement, both within the Bayonetta series and games as a whole. It is proof the rules and limitations placed on certain, big budget series are made to be broken--especially when you can do it with this much creativity and tact. The charming adventure-puzzler is also just delightful to play, and is far more than what it appears on the surface. As its story unfolds, it slowly builds into a recognizably Bayonetta game--one filled with excitement, darkness, subversions, and feminine liberation--all while maintaining an identity all its own. All this combined with a touching tale of companionship and maternal love--that may or may not have made me cry <em>a lot</em>--makes for a game I urge you not to overlook whether or not you're a fan of the Bayonetta games.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Set long before Cereza steps into the souped-up shoes of Bayonetta, Origins is best described as a \"coming-of-half-lumen-sage\" story. After witnessing her mother's imprisonment due to a forbidden romance with Cereza's father, the young girl is forced to seek refuge under the tutelage of a powerful witch who lives on the outskirts of the forbidden Avalon forest. Her teacher is firm-yet-kind--clearly intended to show in part where Bayonetta's cool demeanor comes from--but is often frustrated by Cereza's cowardice.
