So Ancelotti says Madrid will \u201cattack more than defend\u201d. He speaks from experience: he lost the most absurd final of all having been 3-0 up against Liverpool in Istanbul and 17 years later won an even more incredible European Cup after beating the same team, the conclusion of a collection of comebacks that was barely believable.

That money can\u2019t buy you happiness | Arwa Mahdawi", "description": "<p>New studies confirm that having more money can improve our wellbeing. So much for the story powerful people have always tried to push</p><p>News just in: money <em>does </em>buy you happiness. Duh, you might say. Anyone could have told you that; it\u2019s hardly a Nobel-prize winning insight. Well, actually, it kinda is: in 2010, Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel prize-winning economist and psychologist, came out with the theory that there was a monetary \u201chappiness plateau\u201d. Once you hit <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/150671/happiness-is-love-and-75k.aspx\">an annual household income of $75,000</a> (\u00a362,000), earning more money didn\u2019t make you any happier. In 2021, the happiness researcher Matthew Killingsworth released <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2016976118\">a dissenting study</a>, showing that happiness increased with income and there wasn\u2019t evidence of a plateau. Now the pair have teamed up in a process known as \u201c<a href=\"https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/does-more-money-correlate-greater-happiness-Penn-Princeton-research\">adversarial collaboration</a>\u201d and released a new study finding that they were both sort of right, but Killingsworth was more right: for most people, earning more money makes you happier.</p><p>There is some nuance to this. If you are extremely unhappy, happiness apparently increases with household income up to $100,000 (\u00a382,000), then it \u201c<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/money-can-buy-you-happiness-economy-wealth-research-paper-kahneman-2023-3\">abruptly</a>\u201d levels off: there are some problems money can\u2019t fix. For people who are in the \u201cmiddle range of emotional wellbeing\u201d, happiness increases linearly with income. And for very happy people, happiness accelerates above $100,000. The study didn\u2019t look at incomes <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/08/money-wealth-happiness-study/\">above $500,000</a>, so we don\u2019t have any insight into whether joyriding around space is making Jeff Bezos feel truly fulfilled.

Last night, Florida\u2019s Republican governor and all-but-declared 2024 presidential contender <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong> said he was opposed to further American aid to Ukraine, via a statement read on the air by Fox News commentator <strong>Tucker Carlson</strong>. The decision aligns DeSantis with his rival <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, who is seen as the frontrunner for the GOP\u2019s presidential nomination next year, but creates daylight between him and many other Republicans who say backing Kyiv is a national security priority. With Democrat <strong>Joe Biden</strong> a staunch friend of Ukraine, the governor\u2019s stance makes clear the potential consequences if the GOP retakes the White House next year.

The bank had only been spun out in to a separate entity last summer, after its few thousand corporate customers pushed it over a regulatory threshold, and while SVB had grown to almost hold \u00a310bn of deposits, with \u00a35.5bn of outstanding loans, it was very much a specialist player.</p><p>The bank\u2019s selling point was that it understood the needs of the \u201cinnovation economy\u201d, something that high street banks frequently failed to acknowledge. A startup might have zero revenue, yet hold \u00a35m in the bank and have 10 employees, a profile fundamentally different from a typical small business. As a result, trying to get something as simple as a corporate credit card could be a surprising hassle, and when SVB arrived on the UK scene, it was enthusiastically adopted by founders and venture capitalists alike.</p><p><em>Spotify is redesigning the core homescreen of its app, trying to make it easier for users to find new stuff to listen to \u2013 and watch.

In 1970, heavy music was a sprawl of bands mostly savaged by the press: Robert Christgau lambasted Black Sabbath\u2019s debut as \u201cbullshit necromancy\u201d.
