And they did so with graphic photos of what Joe Biden endorses and says you're the sinful one for opposing.</p><p>Biden, who critics say is afraid to tackle tough questions from even friendly reporters, did an interview for Comedy Central with an actor who used to work for him. After <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/politics/joe-biden-claims-to-have-had-high-school-epiphany-on-gay-marriage-neglects-to-mention-50-years-of-public-opposition-to-it-afterwards/" target="_blank">attempting to rewrite history with "invalid truths" about his support for gay marriage</a>, he launched an attack on <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/desantis-journalist-hot-mic" target="_blank">Gov. DeSantis</a>.</p><p>“What is going on in Florida is, as my mother would say, close to sinful. I mean, it is just terrible what they are doing.[...] It's cruel. And the way we do it is we make sure we pass legislation like we passed on same-sex marriage. You mess with that, you're breaking the law, and you’re going to be held accountable.”</p><p>Team DeSantis disagreed. Please be forewarned that these images of the surgery Biden endorses for minors are graphic.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Team DeSantis responds to Biden’s approval of trans surgeries for kids: <a href="https://t.co/9GZ7savbV7">pic.twitter.com/9GZ7savbV7</a><br />— Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryMargOlohan/status/1635647555705946113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Governor DeSantis spoke out himself as well, saying "it is not 'sinful' to prohibit the mutilation of minors," nor is it "acceptable for the federal government to mandate that procedures like sex change operations be allowed for kids."</p><p>It's a contentious debate. On one side, the DeSantis side, they believe that children need to be protected from being peer-pressured from permanent, life-altering surgery until they are of legal age. They also believe in biology science. <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/380/bmj.p553" target="_blank">A recent report from the British Medical Journal</a> states the US guidance is not based on evidence as “more and more young people are being offered medical and surgical intervention for gender transition, sometimes bypassing any psychological support."</p><p>The other side, the Biden side, thinks your a transphobe for even reading the proceeding paragraph. As of this writing, the Biden side has not bullied the British Medical Journal into retracting its report.</p><p>It would be nice if the President of the United States sat down for a real interview where he was challenged by his beliefs. If minors are young enough to decide to have their genitals mutilated, does he agree with democrats who say <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/380/bmj.p553" target="_blank">you aren't mature enough to know murder is bad if you're under twenty-five</a>? Does he support public schools keeping things from parents, and that parents don't have a right to know things about their children? </p><p>Serious answers to serious questions would be a nice change of pace. </p><p><p>

## 'This Dude Crazy, Man': Brothers Hired By Jussie Smollett Break Their Silence About 'Hate Crime' Hoax

As a quick refresher, the brothers were paid $3,500 to stage a mugging in Chicago that Smollett then claimed was a hate crime. Smollett said his attackers were MAGA hat-clad white supremacists who yelled, "this is MAGA country". This was clearly not true, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jussie-smollett-found-guilty" target="_blank">Smollett's conviction in 2021</a> of five counts of disorderly conduct for lying to police. </p><p>The brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, spoke out for the first time in a five-part docuseries on Fox Nation that <a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/jussie-smollett-anatomy-of-a-hoax-nation/" target="_blank">aired</a> last night. One of the brothers explained they took up <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jussie-smollett-trial-update" target="_blank">Smollett's</a> offer because they thought he would help their career afterward. But they were shocked at how he lied and tried to play innocent after the hoax: <em>"Insane. That's when I really saw a different side of Jussie. Like, dude, really? This is when I knew that this dude was like a supervillain."</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p><em>"'I thought he was a good actor, but I also thought this guy was a fraud. This guy is really just sitting here, lying to these people. Lying through his teeth, and not caring. I think he shed a tear." </em></p><p>He then said through laughter, <em>"This dude crazy, man. He shed a tear, man. This dude wild." </em><em> </em>They went on to explain hat Smollett's motive for staging the attack seemed to be that he <em>"wanted to be the poster child for activism" </em>and<em> "wanted to be the hero for gay people, for black people"</em>. They also somewhat denied previous reports that they were in a gay relationship with Smollett and masturbated at bathhouses, jokingly saying, <em>"We would go to nightclubs, the infamous bathhouses, and that was about it."</em></p><p>After their arrest, they were held in Cook County jail for 47 hours before they finally told police about Smollett's bizarre plot. They said they were dumbfounded by how, even after the story was clearly unraveling and they had been caught, Smollett still refused to acknowledge the hoax: <em>"It was a crazy scene that Jussie put on. He even said 'I wouldn't be my mother's son if I did what you guys said I did.' I'm like, then you're not your mother's son, buddy."</em></p><p>This story is just the gift that keeps on giving. The more details come out, the crazier it gets. And the more I wonder how in the world Jussie thought he'd get away with it. </p>

<p><em>"Women are losing their space for men who feel like women. And so you can have an idea of how dangerous that is. You can ask, what is the danger of that Mrs. Nicole? I will answer, they want to impose a reality that is not real." </em></p><p>And that is really what this all comes down to. It is not kind to encourage the delusions of transgenderism. Ultimately, even though it's much harder, the correct and charitable thing to do is always to tell the truth. Even when it offends people. </p><p>He continued,<em> "</em><em>This is, in fact, an imposition. You agree with what they're saying, otherwise, you are transphobic, homophobic, and prejudiced. And I'm not here defending myself, my freedom. I am here so I can defend your freedom. The freedom, for example, of a father refusing to allow a 6.5 foot man, a grown-up, to enter the same restroom as his daughter without being considered a transphobe."</em></p><p>He then listed out examples of women being replaced by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/marcellus-wiley-trans-sports" target="_blank">biological men in things like sports</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/british-model-public-places" target="_blank">modeling</a> campaigns, and the recent Hershey's ad. He concluded,<em> "Now I'm going to take it [the wig] off because I'm gender fluid, and then I'm back to being Nikolas, a man, to say: Women, you owe nothing to feminism. On the contrary, feminism exalts women who did nothing for women."</em></p><p>And hilariously, he is now being attacked as a "transphobe" for this speech. Just like he said would happen. Federal Deputy Erika Hilton <a href="https://www.cartacapital.com.br/politica/erika-hilton-pede-ao-stf-medidas-cautelares-contra-nikolas-ferreira-por-transfobia/" target="_blank">submitted a request</a> to the Federal Supreme Court to adopt "precautionary measures" against Ferreira for "for transphobic statements in the Chamber of Deputies and on social networks." </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Hilton wrote<em>,  "It is evident that Deputy Nikolas Ferreira, in addition to maintaining constant criminal activity by spreading false news, transphobia and incitement to transphobia across all of his social networks, is still intentionally taking advantage of criminal practice." </em></p><p>Homophobia and transphobia are literally crimes in Brazil, with the penalties ranging from one to three years in prison. So Ferreria could be in some trouble. Can we start a petition to bring him to the United States? Seriously. He's more based than probably about 85% of "conservatives" in our federal government right now. We could use his help. </p>

Lavigne said, “Get the f*ck off, b*tch" as Tits McGee was removed.</p><p>Later in the evening when Lavigne received the fan's choice award -- it appears in Canada, Lavigne is still happening -- the singer warned the audience, “Now nobody try anything this time.

</p><p>Here's the thing. I love boobs as much as the next guy. And, as I've learned over the years, quite a number of girls too. But I need someone to once and for all explain topless protests to me like I'm five.

Someone will always have their shirt off with their chesticles flopping out. </p><p>I don't get it. They are never impressive titties. The naked breast is no longer shocking, we all have access to an internet. And it takes away from whatever cause you are about this week because all onlookers remember is your sloppy funbags. Case in point, I don't even care enough to look up what the Green Belt is or why it needs saving.</p><p>We at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website still salute Avril Lavigne for taking charge of the situation. And if we're being honest with ourselves, "Love It When You Hate Me" was a decent track.</p><p><p>

It's as universal a truth as whoever smelt it dealt it.</p><p>Not since the launch of Mug Club (<a href="https://mugclub.rumble.com/support" target="_blank">which returns on March 20th</a>) has such a powerful exhibition of free speech been made in a public setting.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The word hero gets thrown around a lot these days… <a href="https://t.co/W5DWnEn3Zm">pic.twitter.com/W5DWnEn3Zm</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1635601674260606981?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Though as hard as I'm laughing, I feel like this video is missing something. After letting one rip and having it echo throughout the Costco as a legion of Karens and Beckys all load up on 172-count boxes of string cheese -- hey, there one is now...</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

With their shirts pulled up over their noses. Because there is no denying who supplied this one.</p><p>As my man here implies, it's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-upside-down" target="_blank">popped off at the Waffle House</a> over <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-grits" target="_blank">a lot less</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Imagine if this started (or ended) one of those store fights we've grown to love 🤗<br />— Ulysses S Rant (@green_geaux) <a href="https://twitter.com/green_geaux/status/1635605646161883141?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The best part is our hero looks like a middle-aged man. He probably had his nephew recording the phone on a dare. That reveals another universal truth. Deep down, we're all thirteen years old at heart.</p><p>Commenting on politics and culture can be a lot of "everything sucks," "everything is terrible," "and oh my God, why are you the way you are?" For the sake of all our sanity, it's good to take a mental health break on occasion. Remember to take the time to smell the roses. Or in this case, the White Castle from the night before.</p><p><p>
