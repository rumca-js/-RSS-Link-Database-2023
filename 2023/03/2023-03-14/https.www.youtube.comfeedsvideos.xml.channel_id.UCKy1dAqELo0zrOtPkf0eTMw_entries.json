Via the Associated Press, Bowser said \"I think fans will find this is an incredibly full, deeply immersive experience. The price point reflects the type of experience that fans can expect when it comes to playing this particular game.\" But for Nintendo fans worried about shelling out 70 bucks for all their first-party games, fear not. Bowser said this isn't necessarily going to be the price for every game. According to him, it's fairly common in Europe and other parts of the world to vary the price depending on the game. In other news, it seems like IO Interactive is full speed ahead on their James Bond 007 game, and confirmed that any new Hitman games are on pause at the moment. And speaking of game delays, the System Shock remake has been pushed back a couple of months.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6_3atgeriY", "date_published": "2023-03-14 23:09:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Shame Legacy - Official Announcement Trailer", "description": "Shame Legacy is a first-person survival-horror, set in a 19th-century forsaken cultist village.
