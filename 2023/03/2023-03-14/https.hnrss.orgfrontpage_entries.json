I\u2019m Samir, and my co-founder Neil and I are building Blyss (<a href=\"https://blyss.dev\">https://blyss.dev</a>). Blyss is an open source homomorphic encryption SDK, available as a fully managed service.<p>Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computation on encrypted data. This is essentially the ultimate privacy guarantee - a server that does work for its users (like fetching emails, tweets, or search results), without ever knowing what its users are doing - who they talk to, who they follow, or even what they search for. Servers using FHE give you cryptographic proof that they aren\u2019t spying on you.<p>Unfortunately, performing general computation using FHE is notoriously slow. We have focused on solving a simple, specific problem: retrieve an item from a key-value store, without revealing to the server which item was retrieved.<p>By focusing on retrievals, we achieve huge speedups that make Blyss practical for real-world applications: a password scanner like \u201cHave I Been Pwned?\u201d that checks your credentials against breaches, but never learns anything about your password (<a href=\"https://playground.blyss.dev/passwords\">https://playground.blyss.dev/passwords</a>), domain name servers that don\u2019t get to see what domains you\u2019re fetching (<a href=\"https://sprl.it/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sprl.it/</a>), and social apps that let you find out which of your contacts are already on the platform, without letting the service see your contacts (<a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/edit/blyss-private-contact-intersection\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://stackblitz.com/edit/blyss-private-contact-intersecti...</a>).<p>Big companies (Apple, Google, Microsoft) are already using private retrieval: Chrome and Edge use this technology today to check URLs against blocklists of known phishing sites, and check user passwords against hacked credential dumps, without seeing any of the underlying URLs or passwords.<p>Blyss makes it easy for developers to use homomorphic encryption from a familiar, Firebase-like interface. You can create key-value data buckets, fill them with data, and then make cryptographically private retrievals. No entity, not even the Blyss service itself, can learn which items are retrieved from a Blyss bucket. We handle all the server infrastructure, and maintain robust open source JS clients, with the cryptography written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. We also have an open source server you can host yourself.<p>(Side note: a lot of what drew us to this problem is just how paradoxical the private retrieval guarantee sounds\u2014it seems intuitively like it should be impossible to get data from a server without it learning what you retrieve! The basic idea of how this is actually possible is: the client encrypts a one-hot vector (all 0\u2019s except a single 1) using homomorphic encryption, and the server is able to \u2018multiply\u2019 these by the database without learning anything about the underlying encrypted values. The dot product of the encrypted query and the database yields an encrypted result. The client decrypts this, and gets the database item it wanted. To the server, all the inputs and outputs stay completely opaque. We have a blog post explaining more, with pictures, that was on HN previously: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32987155\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32987155</a>)<p>Neil and I met eight years ago on the first day of freshman year of college; we\u2019ve been best friends (and roommates!) since. We are privacy nerds\u2014before Blyss, I worked at Yubico, and Neil worked at Apple. I\u2019ve had an academic interest in homomorphic encryption for years, but it became a practical interest when a private Wikipedia demo I posted on HN (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31668814\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31668814</a>) became popular, and people started asking for a simple way to build products using this technology.<p>Our client and server are MIT open source (<a href=\"https://github.com/blyssprivacy/sdk\">https://github.com/blyssprivacy/sdk</a>), and we plan to make money as a hosted server. Since the server is tricky to operate at scale, and is not part of the trust model, we think this makes sense for both us and our customers. People have used Blyss to build block explorers, DNS resolvers, and malware scanners; you can see some highlights in our playground: <a href=\"https://playground.blyss.dev\">https://playground.blyss.dev</a>.<p>We have a generous free tier, and you get an API key as soon as you log in. For production use, our pricing is usage-based: $1 gets you 10k private reads on a 1 GB database (larger databases scale costs linearly). You can also run the server yourself.<p>Private retrieval is a totally new building block for privacy - we can\u2019t wait to see what you\u2019ll build with it! Let us know what you think, or if you have any questions about Blyss or homomorphic encryption in general.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35153344\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35153344</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35153344", "date_published": "2023-03-14 15:42:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Launch HN: CodeComplete (YC W23) \u2013 Copilot for Enterprise", "description": "<p>Hello HN! We\u2019re Max and Lydia, co-founders at CodeComplete AI (<a href=\"https://codecomplete.ai\">https://codecomplete.ai</a>), an AI-powered coding assistant for enterprise companies. Many large companies can\u2019t use products like GitHub Copilot because of the security and privacy risks, so we\u2019re building a self-hosted version that\u2019s fine tuned to the company\u2019s codebase.<p>We love Copilot and believe that AI will change the way developers work. Max wanted to use Copilot when he was an ML engineer at Meta, but leadership blocked him because Copilot requires sending company code to GitHub and OpenAI. We built CodeComplete because lots of other companies are in the same boat, and we want to offer a secure way for these companies to leverage the latest AI-powered dev tools.<p>To that end, our product is really meant for large engineering teams at enterprise companies who can\u2019t use GitHub Copilot. This generally means teams with more than 200 developers that have strict practices against sending their code or other IP externally.<p>CodeComplete offers an experience similar to Copilot; we serve AI code completions as developers type in their IDEs. However, instead of sending private code snippets to GitHub or OpenAI, we use a self-hosted LLM to serve code completions. Another advantage with self-hosting is that it\u2019s more straightforward to securely fine-tune to the company\u2019s codebase. Copilot suggestions aren\u2019t always tailored to a company\u2019s coding patterns or internal libraries, so this can help make our completions more relevant and avoid adding tech debt.<p>To serve code completions, we start with open source foundation models and augment them with additional (permissively-licensed) datasets. Our models live behind your firewall, either in your cloud or on-premises. For cloud deployments, we have terraform scripts that set up our infrastructure and pull in our containers. On-prem deployments are a bit more complicated; we work with the customer to design a custom solution. Once everything\u2019s set up, we train on your codebase and then start serving code completions.<p>To use our product, developers simply download our extension in their IDE (VS Code currently supported, Jetbrains coming soon). After authentication, the extensions provide in-line code completion suggestions to developers as they type.<p>Since we\u2019re a self-hosted enterprise product, we don\u2019t have an online version you can just try out, but here are two quick demos:  (1): Python completion, fine-tuned on a mock Twitter-like codebase: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YqkqtGY4qmc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/YqkqtGY4qmc</a>. (2) Java completion for \"leetcode\"-style problems, like converting integers to roman numerals: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/H4tGoFNC8oI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/H4tGoFNC8oI</a>.<p>We take privacy and security seriously. By default, our deployments only send back heartbeat messages to our servers. Our product logs usage data and code snippets to the company\u2019s own internal database so that they can evaluate our performance and improve their models over time. Companies have the option to share a subset of that data with us (e.g. completion acceptance rate, model probabilities output, latencies, etc), but we don\u2019t require it. We never see your code or any other intellectual property.<p>We charge based on seat licenses. For enterprise companies, these contracts often demand custom scoping and requirements. In general though, our pricing will be at a premium to GitHub Copilot since there is significant technical and operational overhead with offering a self-hosted product like this.<p>Having access to these types of tools would have saved us a bunch of time in our previous jobs, so we\u2019re really excited to show this to everyone. If you are having similar issues with security and privacy at your current company, please reach out to us at founders@codecomplete.ai! We\u2019d love to hear your feedback.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35152851\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35152851</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35152851", "date_published": "2023-03-14 15:16:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Silicon Valley, once the underdog, is now too big to fail", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/14/tech-startups-bailout-silicon-valley-bank/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/14/tech-startups-bailout-silicon-valley-bank/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35152613\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35152613</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 14</p>", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/14/tech-startups-bailout-silicon-valley-bank/", "date_published": "2023-03-14 15:02:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Binance Halts Deposits and Withdrawals for Customers in the UK", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-14/binance-halts-deposits-and-withdrawals-for-customers-in-the-uk\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-14/binance-halts-deposits-and-withdrawals-for-customers-in-the-uk</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35152357\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35152357</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-14/binance-halts-deposits-and-withdrawals-for-customers-in-the-uk", "date_published": "2023-03-14 14:47:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "The Door Close Button", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://computer.rip/2023-03-13-the-door-close-button.html\">https://computer.rip/2023-03-13-the-door-close-button.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35152341\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35152341</a></p>\n<p>Points: 25</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "link": "https://computer.rip/2023-03-13-the-door-close-button.html", "date_published": "2023-03-14 14:46:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "NordVPN library and client code open-sourced", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/NordSecurity\">https://github.com/NordSecurity</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35152278\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35152278</a></p>\n<p>Points: 68</p>\n<p># Comments: 37</p>", "link": "https://github.com/NordSecurity", "date_published": "2023-03-14 14:41:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "OpenSSL 3.1 Released", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2023/03/07/OpenSSL3.1Release/\">https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2023/03/07/OpenSSL3.1Release/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35151940\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35151940</a></p>\n<p>Points: 19</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2023/03/07/OpenSSL3.1Release/", "date_published": "2023-03-14 14:19:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Using GPT-3 and Whisper to save 40% of doctors\u2019 time", "description": "<p>Hey HN,<p>We're Alex, Martin and Laurent. We previously founded Wit.ai (W14), which we sold to Facebook in 2015. Since 2019, we've been working on Nabla (https://www.nabla.com), an intelligent assistant for health practitioners.<p>When GPT-3 was released in 2020, we investigated it's usage in a medical context[0], to mixed results.<p>Since then we\u2019ve kept exploring opportunities at the intersection of healthcare and AI, and noticed that doctors spend am awful lot of time on medical documentation (writing clinical notes, updating their EHR, etc.).<p>Today, we're releasing Nabla Copilot, a Chrome extension generating clinical notes from video consultations, to address this problem.<p>You can try it out, without installation nor sign up, on our demo page: https://www.nabla.com/copilot-demo/<p>Here\u2019s how it works under the hood:<p>- When a doctor starts a video consultation, our Chrome extension auto-starts itself and listens to the active tab as well as the doctor\u2019s microphone.<p>- We then transcribe the consultation using a fine-tuned version of Whisper. We've trained Whisper with tens of thousands of hours of medical consultation and medical terms recordings, and we have now reached an error rate which is 3\u00d7 lower than Google's Speech-To-Text.<p>- Once we have the transcript, we feed it to a heavily trained GPT-3, which generates a clinical note.<p>- We finally return the clinical note to the doctor through our Chrome extension, the doctor can copy it to their EHR, and send a version to the patient.<p>This allows doctors to be fully focused on their consultation, and saves them a lot time.<p>Next, we want to make this work for in-person consultation.<p>We also want to extract structured data (in the FHIR standard) from the clinical note, and feed it to the doctor\u2019s EHR so that it is automatically added to the patient's record.<p>Happy to further discuss technical details in comments!<p>---<p>[0]: https://www.nabla.com/blog/gpt-3/</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a
