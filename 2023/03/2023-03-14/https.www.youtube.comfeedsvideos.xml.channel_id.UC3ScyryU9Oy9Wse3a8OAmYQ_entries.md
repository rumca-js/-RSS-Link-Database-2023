Premiering March 14, 2023, “Age of Easy Money” examines how the policies of the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve, ushered in an age of easy money — and explores the potential consequences of the Fed’s decision last year to start hiking interest rates at a historic pace in an effort to fight inflation. 

This excerpt shows how many economic experts FRONTLINE spoke with alluded to a particular quote to describe the current economic moment, in which the risks and excesses that had been building in the age of easy money are beginning to surface.
 
“When interest rates start to rise, and the tide pulls out, as Warren Buffett would say ... you begin to see who's not been swimming with their shorts on,” Foroohar says in the clip.
