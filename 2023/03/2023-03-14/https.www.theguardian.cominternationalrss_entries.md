The most prominent and controversial proposal is a “one time lump sum payment” of $5m to all eligible Black people, a number that the chair of the city’s reparations committee called “actually low when you consider the harm”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/14/san-francisco-reparation-plans-black-residents">Continue reading...</a>

Yet, in professional basketball this is the case. The game is just too fast, too physical for someone who has lost a step. It’s tough to swap the excitement and money for a more humdrum life. Some in professional sports, including Hall of Fame quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-legend-likens-retirement-dying-talking-aaron-rodgers-possibly-walking-away">Steve Young</a>, have even likened retirement to “death”.</p><p>So, how do NBA players decide when it’s time to go?

<p>The deliciously dark comedy about a man with cerebral palsy is back – and now, celebs are lining up to star in it … and to make you squirm like never before</p><p>Standup comedian Tim Renkow’s blacker-than-black comedy Jerk is upping its game for its third series. The sitcom, about a man called Tim who has cerebral palsy and is a self-described terrible person, deserves a bigger audience. It has been given more episodes, moving from four guest stars per series to six – in the form of Sally Phillips, James Norton and Big Zuu – and a bump up to BBC One, all of which should help it to gain the recognition it deserves.</p><p>Renkow, who co-writes with Shaun Pye (There She Goes, The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret) has come up with the sort of comedy that wants you to laugh and dares you to laugh, at the same time. This is a show that began, in 2019, with the fictional Tim pretending to wet himself in a cafe to embarrass a fellow customer for using the disabled toilet. This turned out to be a relatively gentle start. The first series saw Tim testing whether, as a disabled employee, he was “unsackable”, what happens when you pose as an asylum-seeker for free food, and the surprise discovery of Nazi relatives. The second kept it breezy with methadone, going to the gym and organised religion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/14/james-norton-as-a-disabled-jazz-drummer-how-jerks-black-humour-is-revolutionising-comedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A young couple and their child move into possessed home in this turgid tale plagued by diabolical dubbed-in dialogue</p><p>This turgid horror feature starts with a young couple in the present: American-accented Alyson (Jennifer Mischiati) and faintly German-sounding Richard (Christoph Hülsen), who move into Alyson’s old home with their infant son after her father commits suicide. That sounds like a bad idea from the start, but then it gets markedly worse. Alyson is plagued by memories of her unhappy childhood in the house, abused by a seamstress mother with mental health issues, while a ghostly apparition that looks like a ravaged mannequin in a greasy wig crops up on the regular to make everyone scream. Eventually the baby gets abducted soon after a visit from a priest (Sean James Sutton) who proves useless at ridding the house of its demonic presence.</p><p>Soon after, a bespectacled psychic (Michael Segal) comes to help and reveals that the house is haunted by a bride who lost her child and then called up a demon called Asmodeus, who is apparently a “very evil force, the lord of wrath and vengeance”. Said demonic force has granted the bride’s spirit to return from the dead, so the house is much more crowded than it seems at first, like an illegal Airbnb with guests that can’t be evicted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/14/dead-bride-review-packed-out-haunted-house-horror-is-like-an-airbnb">Continue reading...</a>

## The Hopeful Hat by Carole Satyamurti review – somewhere towards the end

<p>In this posthumous collection, the poet explores losing the power of speech and her final days with grace and wit</p><p>Carole Satyamurti died on 13 August 2019, leaving this collection behind her. She had gathered the poems, which have an elegant, sympathetic and – in as far as it is possible to judge – finished quality, into sections before her death and her instructions have been followed wherever possible. In a moving introduction, Emma Satyamurti explains that her mother was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in 2012, which led to the removal of her voice box and part of her tongue – a cruel theft from a poet who had always had, on and off the page, a beautiful speaking voice. Looking back, it seems a further irony that Satyamurti should have first come to public attention as the winner of the National Poetry competition in 1986 with Between the Lines, a poem concerning words, euphemisms and silences.</p><p>What is particularly arresting about this volume are the ways in which she explores her new situation and starts to think about verbal excess. In Sea Change, she writes: “I mouth words as if you were a foreigner, / ration them to crude essentials / How redundant most words are.” Struggling to speak, she finds herself listening to others more keenly and in Overtones observes: “Beyond their mundane utterance / I hear their grief, anxiety, the way they criticise companions, silently.” Her ability to read what people are unconsciously expressing astonishes her interlocutors. In Necklace of Wasps, she listens, dispassionately, to her own voice: “Voice is capricious, / strangled, or a repertoire / of frog-like utterance.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/14/the-hopeful-hat-by-carole-satyamurti-review-somewhere-towards-the-end">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘She’d been sending herself payments from me’: Venmo users on discovering secrets on the app

<p>Two in five Venmo users reveal ‘sensitive information’ on the app – we hear from those who discovered something big</p><p>Officially, Venmo is an app for transferring money from one person to another. In the US, where most banks do not offer instant free money transfers, it was revolutionary for simple things like splitting the bill on dinner, or send their roommates half of the rent. But because the Venmo app has a “home feed”, an endless scroll that shows payments between users, it’s also a sneaky form of social media. You can see how your friends spend their money – and who they spend it with.</p><p>After looking through my account, I now know that my high school soccer coach gave his wife money to spend at Petco last night. A friend of a friend went out for pizza. An old co-worker paid her dad for HBOMax. A man I met once exclusively sends people payments for the horse emoji – I assume this is code for ketamine, the horse tranquilizer/party drug, but maybe he has a secret gambling habit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/14/venmo-users-discovering-secrets-app">Continue reading...</a>
