One of the bigger surprises at The Game Awards last year was 505 Games' Crime Boss: Rockay City. Surprisingly not because of its gameplay (of which little was seen), but due to the sheer number of big-name Hollywood actors attached. 

Releasing on March 29th for PC via the Epic Games Store, we've since learned many more details about this co-op multiplayer shooter. Let's go over 15 of them here.

Video games are arguably the best form of art, on account of them being able to transport players to magical places that blur the lines between imagination and reality. 

Technology has enabled developers to craft wondrous worlds with striking levels of detail, and when that technology combines with great art direction we get imaginary worlds that are simply unforgettable. Gamers have been treated to many such levels, and we will look at a few such examples today.

Don't get me wrong, FATAL FRAME / PROJECT ZERO: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is still a game that I'd recommend to fans of the horror genre, and especially to fans of the series. Those looking for good scares and palpable atmosphere will find them in abundance here, and the fact that this is the first time the game has released in the West is also significant, making it much easier to recommend for those who haven't played it. 

But above all else, what this remaster proves most through its deficiencies is that a new, modern Fatal Frame game that irons out the clunkiness and hones in on the series' biggest strengths could easily go toe to toe with the genre's biggest giants. Hopefully, Koei Tecmo will find enough success with its recent Fatal Frame re-releases that it decides that it's finally time to develop a full-fledged new entry in the series. Until that happens though, this will do well enough.
