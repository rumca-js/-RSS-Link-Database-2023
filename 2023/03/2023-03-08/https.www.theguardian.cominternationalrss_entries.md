<p>The manager will not prioritise Premier League over Europa League but the demands of both will test his squad to the full</p><p>After the chaos and cavorting came the cold-blooded calculations. Nobody of an Arsenal stripe was in a rush to let the headiness of Saturday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/04/arsenal-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">momentous comeback against Bournemouth</a> subside but, when it did, the fretfulness that lurks just beneath the surface of most clubs’ fanbases reared its head.</p><p>The rest of their campaign may come to resemble a Europa League sandwich and, with the precious gift of an improbable five-point lead in the Premier League looking too delicious to relinquish, the question was predictable: would it not be better for Mikel Arteta to ditch any quest for continental honours and go for broke at home?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/08/mikel-artetas-balancing-act-keeps-arsenals-nerves-in-checkfor-now">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thousands of Georgians took to the streets of the country's capital, Tblisi, on Wednesday, in a second day of large-scale protests against a controversial law on media funding that demonstrators fear could take the country off the path to EU membership. Police were seen using teargas, water cannon and stun grenades to disperse protesters who had gathered outside the country's parliament.&nbsp;</p><p>The new law would require media organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'foreign agents' or possibly face large fines. Critics of the new law, which is supported by the governing Georgian Dream party, fear it could hamper press freedoms and mirrors a similar bill introduced in Russia in 2012</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/georgia-opposition-protests-tbilisi-law-parliament">Protesters and police clash in Georgia for second day over ‘foreign agents’ law</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/mar/08/thousands-of-georgians-protesting-against-authoritarian-law-clash-with-police-video">Thousands of Georgians protesting against 'authoritarian' law clash with police –&nbsp;video</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2023/mar/08/police-fire-water-cannon-and-stun-grenades-as-thousands-of-georgians-protests-for-second-day-video">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PlayStation 4/5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC; Grasshopper Manufacture/Koei Tecmo<br /></strong>The original was originally launched on Wii 15 years ago and it still offers a highly atmospheric adventure with many moments of fear and dread</p><p>In the triumvirate of classic Japanese horror game franchises, Project Zero (known as Fatal Frame in its domestic market) is the one that’s been most overlooked by western players – which is a real shame. While Resident Evil is all about zombie gore, and Silent Hill focuses on psychological tension, Tecmo’s horror series provides straight-up supernatural terror, masterfully employing folkloric tropes and ghostly enemies that would be familiar to anyone who loved Onryō and Jidaigeki movies such as Onibaba, Gu-On and Ring. When this game originally arrived on Wii 15 years ago, it never even got a release outside its home country, a stunning omission when you consider it was co-directed by Goichi Suda, creator of cult hits Killer7 and No More Heroes. Now, Koei Tecmo has produced a refreshed version, allowing a new generation to discover a fine addition to this genuinely spooky series.</p><p>The action takes place on the remote Rogetsu Island, where five abducted schoolgirls were once discovered, mentally scarred and unable to remember the bizarre ritual they had been forced to take part in. Years later, two of the survivors have returned to discover the truth of what happened to them – and they find an isle crowded with vengeful spirits and haunted buildings. You play several roles through the course of the game as you explore an abandoned psychiatric hospital, lighthouse and other unsettling locales, searching for clues about the past. Your only weapon is the camera obscura, a device that allows you to see ghosts and capture their tormented souls in photographs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/08/project-zero-mask-of-the-lunar-eclipse-review-playstation-xbox-nintendo-switch">Continue reading...</a>
