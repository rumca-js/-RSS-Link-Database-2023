<p>It appears that Valve is in no rush to release a more powerful version of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/">Steam Deck</a> just yet. Currently, the Steam Deck can run over 8,000 games spanning indie titles to more hardware-intense games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent interview, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais told <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-community-continues-to-blow-our-minds-valve-talk-the-steam-deck-one-year-on">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a> that he believes that the Steam "Deck has the potential to be a solid target throughout the generation." Griffais then explains how Valve plans to improve Steam Decks specs "but the work involved is trickier than the typical Deck UX tweaks developers have had to do for games that already perform well."</p><p dir="ltr">In the same interview, Valve designer Lawrence Yang echoes Griffai's thoughts on the Steam Deck's longevity by explaining how he feels that "a true next-gen Deck with a significant bump in horsepower wouldn't be for a few years." This makes sense because the Steam Deck has only been out for a little over a year.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-more-powerful-steam-deck-is-years-away-valve-says/1100-6512173/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Scream 6 Review - Ghostface Takes Manhattan

<p dir="ltr">For over 25 years, the question "Do you like scary movies?" has sent chills down the spines of horror lovers. Hell, even non-horror lovers know Billy Lumis' (Skeet Ulrich) famous line before slicing and dicing Drew Barrymore to pieces in the first Scream movie. Last year, directors Tyler Gillet and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin proved <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/scream-review-ghostface-cuts-loose-in-this-killer-new-installment/1900-6417811/">they were worthy of following in Wes Craven's iconic footsteps</a> by bringing Ghostface back for a new killing spree while paying homage to the beloved '90s film that started it all. But could they do it again without screwing up all the good they've done so far?</p><p dir="ltr">The short answer is: Yes. Scream VI does everything a sequel--excuse us, requel--should do. The body count is higher, the kills are gorier, and the final showdown between the survivors and Ghostface is a spectacle unlike any Scream movie that's come before. What's really cool is how Gillet and Bettinelli-Olpin set up their own Scream playground to play in without losing sight of the original series that paved the way for these new adventures.</p><p dir="ltr">The first rule you learn in screenwriting class is that a good movie comes with a surprising but inevitable end. That sounds like an oxymoron, and it is a difficult needle to thread, especially in the slasher genre, but it gets pulled off here. Without spoilers, the Ghostface reveal in Scream VI is layered and surprising, but once the truth is out you realize the killer couldn't have been anyone else. The setting for the final showdown also allows Scream VI to pay homage to every Ghostface that came before so it feels like all of them have a moment to shine.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/scream-6-review-ghostface-takes-manhattan/1900-6418043/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Call of Duty players will soon be able to play as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' most notable villain, as the Call of Duty Twitter account has teased a Shredder operator skin for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Warzone 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/">Modern Warfare 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1633528133436739584">Call of Duty's tweet</a> says, "A new evil will rise."

He even has a canister of TGRI's famous green ooze strapped to his armor. Players will want to get their pizza and nunchucks ready for Shredder's arrival on March 21.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">A new evil will rise 🥷⚔️ <a href="https://t.co/jA5f7ogAbp">pic.twitter.com/jA5f7ogAbp</a></p>  — Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1633528133436739584?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">March 8, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">It's uncertain if the turtles themselves will also be joining the collaboration, but it seems odd to have Shredder without the heroes in a half shell to fight him.

## Sony Worries That Microsoft Could Intentionally Make Call Of Duty Worse On PlayStation

<p>Sony has submitted new documents regarding Microsoft's planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard and has expressed concern to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority about Call of Duty potentially being sabotaged on PlayStation. In a hypothetical situation cited by Sony (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630700/sony-microsoft-call-of-duty-sabotage-cma-documents-activision-deal">The Verge</a>), the PlayStation manufacturer said that it was worried that Microsoft could release a Call of Duty game on PlayStation that has poorer quality and performance when compared to the Xbox version.</p><p>"Microsoft might release a PlayStation version of Call of Duty where bugs and errors emerge only on the game's final level or after later updates," <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64086532d3bf7f557532cefc/2023-03-07_Microsoft-Activision_-_SIE_Observations_on_Remedies_Notice__Revised_NCV__redacted.pdf">Sony explained</a> in its new documents. "Even if such degradations could be swiftly detected, any remedy would likely come too late, by which time the gaming community would have lost confidence in PlayStation as a go-to venue to play Call of Duty. Indeed, as Modern Warfare II attests, Call of Duty is most often purchased in just the first few weeks of release. If it became known that the game's performance on PlayStation was worse than on Xbox, Call of Duty gamers could decide to switch to Xbox, for fear of playing their favorite game at a second-class or less competitive venue."</p><p>Sony didn't outright accuse Microsoft of plotting intentional sabotage, but the company does fear that its rival could strategically derail the momentum of Call of Duty on PlayStation.

## The Mandalorian Season 3, Episode 2 Easter Eggs: 8 Things You Missed in 'Chapter 18: The Mines of Mandalore'

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4109452-mandalorianchapter18eastereggs.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Season 3 of The Mandalorian has a substantially different vibe from the previous two seasons and The Book of Boba Fett. This time around the series has been spending less time bombarding us with empty references to other Star Wars things and more time trying to be a real TV show. The apparent change in approach benefits "Chapter 18"hugely--it's much easier to enjoy this particularly personal chapter of this series when we're not being distracted by endless references. <strong>Warning: This gallery contains major spoilers for Chapter 18 of The Mandalorian.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars fans will still find that their knowledge of the franchise is well rewarded by this episode, since it deals with very personal and intimate narratives for both the Mandalorian Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and the former Mandalore Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) as they make a fateful journey to the planet Mandalore. Almost as awesome is the way the episode pulls an obscure droid out of Star Wars's distant past and makes it a proper player in the franchise for the very first time.</p><p dir="ltr">All in all, Chapter 18 is a high-quality and meaty episode of The Mandalorian that gives both hardcore and casual Star Wars fans plenty to enjoy and chew on, but trust us when we say that it gets even better when you understand the full context. So without further ado, let's dive into it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. The Boonta Eve holiday</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4109456-themandalorianboontaeve.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">When Mando and Grogu arrive on Tatooine to visit Peli Motto's garage, the locals are in the midst of celebrating Boonta Eve, the holiday that was first mentioned back in The Phantom Menace. The podrace that Anakin raced in during that film was the Boonta Eve Classic, meaning this episode begins on the anniversary of that race. It's at least the 41st anniversary of Anakin's win, but it could be the 42nd or 43rd depending on how much time has actually passed across these three seasons of The Mandalorian.</p><p dir="ltr">In the current canon, Boonta Eve simply celebrates the ascension of the ancient Boonta the Hutt to godhood, without any context. But before Disney took over, Boonta was one of three Hutts who led Hutt forces against Xim the Despot way back before the formation of the Galactic Republic, and it was that effort that earned him his godhood and very own holiday. But since Xim the Despot is from an old Expanded Universe novel, those specific details are no longer canon.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. The Rodian's speeder</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4109455-themandalorianrodianspeeder.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>That damaged landspeeder that Peli Motto is haggling with a Rodian over as the episode begins isn't really special--it's just there as setup for a joke about auto mechanics pulling fast ones on their customers. But we've seen it (or rather the same model) before only one single time, in a previous episode of The Mandalorian: "Chapter 12, The Siege." In that episode, Mando, Cara Dune, Greef Karga and that annoying green alien guy use an identical speeder to infiltrate an Imperial base on Nevarro. Later, when the group is breaking back out of the base in a much larger vehicle, they run over the blue speeder, destroying it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. R5-D4</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4109372-themandalorianr5d4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Quite possibly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mandalorian-just-salvaged-one-of-the-original-star-wars-droids/1100-6512142/">the most famous original trilogy Star Wars droid who wasn't named on screen</a>, R5-D4 is well known among Star Wars fans as the droid that Uncle Owen <em>tried</em> to buy from the Jawas at the beginning of A New Hope instead of R2--only for R5 to break down while trying to roll over to him. A recent short story, however, revealed that R5 sabotaged himself to help R2, making him a secret hero of the Rebellion.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite having so little screen time, R5 was apparently memorable enough to have action figures back in the day--I had one!--and now on The Mandalorian he finally gets to have his time in the sun.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Bo-Katan and the Purge of Mandalore</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4109454-mandalorebo-katanthemandalorianchapter18.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While this episode and previous ones have discussed Bo-Katan's past as Mandaloriane and the destruction of Mandalore itself by the Empire enough that you get the point, now that we actually have seen the surface of Mandalore and the ruins of its capital city Sundari on The Mandalorian, it bears looking a little deeper at what kind of baggage Bo-Katan is carrying here.</p><p dir="ltr">During the Clone Wars, Mandalore was ruled by Darth Maul. But he was defeated, the Republic won the Clone Wars, and Bo-Katan became the new leader of the Mandalorians, aka Mandalore. But there was no lasting peace to be found. As soon as Chancellor Palpatine became Emperor Palpatine and founded the Galactic Empire, he ordered the occupation of Mandalore, which he put under the rule of a Mandalorian servant of the Empire named Gar Saxon.</p><p dir="ltr">Bo-Katan didn't take all that lightly, but many Mandalorians were content to live under Saxon and the Empire. But a little over a decade prior to the events of The Mandalorian, one of those Mandalorian clans, Clan Wren, had enough and started an uprising against the Empire and their loyalist Mandalorians. Clan Wren recruited Bo-Katan to the cause, gifting her the Darksaber and propping her up once more as Mandalore during this new Mandalorian Civil War.</p><p>But the war didn't last long. The Empire realized it couldn't hold Mandalore, so they bombed it into oblivion. The Mandalorians have been scattered ever since, with survivors believing the surface of Mandalore to be too tainted to visit. But as we saw in this episode, the surface was actually quite livable, and in fact some people <em>have</em> been living there. For example...</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. That very creepy droid creature who captured Mando</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4109453-weirddroidcreaturethemandalorianchapter18.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Deep in the ruins of Mandalore is this horrifying disembodied head thing that drives a little crab tank and walks around in the creepiest robot body. If you can believe it, this guy is completely new--we've never seen him or his like before. That said, he certainly reminds us of General Grievous, both because of his weird and gross cyberpunk thing and because they re-used some of Grievous's sound effects for this guy. That detail is probably not a coincidence--hopefully we'll learn more about this guy as Mando and Bo-Katan spend more time on Mandalore.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. The living Mythosaur</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4109460-themandalorianchapter18mythosaur.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Until this episode, we had never seen nor even heard of a Mythosaur actually being alive in the present in any Star Wars narrative. They've always been creatures of legend native to Mandalore that were conquered by the original Mandalorians, both in the Disney canon and in the old Expanded Universe. As Bo-Katan says in this episode, the Mandalorian logo is based on its skull. And now it turns out these Mythosaurs aren't so mythical after all.</p></h3></p><br />

## Resident Evil 4 Remake Rain Effects Will Be Adjusted In Day One Patch

<p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> Remake will get a day-one patch that aims to address the game's rain effects, which had gotten some criticism amongst the community. As part of a <a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2023/03/08/capcom-are-fixing-the-infamous-rain-in-resident-evil-4-with-a-day-1-patch/">Press Start</a> interview, Resident Evil 4 Remake producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki said, "We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments."</p><p>As shown in a preview video from <a href="https://youtu.be/9Pd-LZqooiU?t=28">Game Informer</a>, the rain effects in Resident Evil 4 Remake seemed overbearing, causing the community to refer to it as “raingate."</p><p>It's unclear how the day-one patch will impact the rain since Capcom did not specify. But many are likely hoping it will be toned down to match the rest of the game's aesthetics. It's also unknown what else--if anything--the day-one patch will address, aside from fixing "miscellaneous bugs." The patch, version 1.02, will clock in at around 4GB, and will release when the game launches on March 24, 2023.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-rain-effects-will-be-adjusted-in-day-one-patch/1100-6512160/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a> will finally allow for cross-faction guilds, almost a year after Blizzard allowed members of the Horde and Alliance to group together for certain content and nearly 20 years after the game's initial launch.</p><p dir="ltr">The ability to create cross-faction guilds that are composed of players from both factions is coming as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflights-embers-of-neltharion-update-will-take-players-deep-underground-to-discover-deathwings-secrets/1100-6512139/">Dragonflight 10.1, Embers of Neltharion</a>, and will additionally introduce a new zone, raid, UI improvements, and story content.</p><p dir="ltr">Cross-faction guilds is a feature Blizzard has said in the past that it wanted to deliver.

## Grail Pokemon Card Draws Zero Bids For Asking Price Of Nearly $500,000

<p dir="ltr">Thanks to the likes of Logan Paul and the pandemic-era hobby boom, Pokemon card collecting is enjoying a big moment right now. Though apparently not big enough for some, as one collector put up a mint condition grail card for $480,000 on eBay, but received zero bids in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">That card is Illustrator Pikachu, widely considered the rarest and most valuable card on the current market. The item was offered only as a promo card in Japan, and only 40 copies are currently known to exist. Last year, another mint copy of the card sold for $900,000 in a Goldin auction, shattering the then-record of $375,000. Influencer and sports entertainer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/logan-paul-spent-3-5-million-on-fake-pokemon-cards/1100-6499638/">Logan Paul</a> said that he spent $5 million to obtain one in 2022 in order to wear it to Wrestlemania.</p><p dir="ltr">Ebay sent out press releases to try to drum up interest in the auction. The PR firm representing the auction told <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-illustrator-pikachu-charizard-ebay-auction-1850200024">Kotaku</a> in an email that the card may be re-listed at some point. This comes at a moment when Pokemon cards are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pokemon-go-tcg-expansion-cards-include-hidden-ditto-legendary-birds/1100-6503699/">doing quite well</a> in stores, but it's unclear if the very top-end of the collectors market will continue to bear transactions in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for these beloved cards. Given that multiple notable sales in that range happened just months ago, it seems unlikely to collapse anytime soon.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grail-pokemon-card-draws-zero-bids-for-asking-price-of-nearly-500000/1100-6512152/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A number of Lego games under development at TT Games have reportedly been quietly canceled, including a high-profile title that was set to feature several of Disney's biggest IPs.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/report-lego-disney-and-guardians-of-the-galaxy-projects-among-multiple-cancellations-at-tt-games">Nintendo Life</a> report, the game that was codenamed Project Marley would have a "Diablo-like" design focused on exploring dungeons, and had a roster that included characters from The Muppets, Toy Story, Frozen, Winnie the Pooh, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and more. A Lego Guardians of the Galaxy game codenamed Project Cosmic, a mobile port of Lego Worlds, and a non-Lego shooter featuring Warner Bros. IP from Rock and Morty, DC Comics, Stranger Things, and Looney Tunes--codenamed Project Rainbow Road--was also reportedly in development.</p><p>It's claimed that the Lego Guardians of the Galaxy project was set to be a more traditional Lego game but was canceled after 18 months of development. The Disney game is said to have been in development for four years, but after the release of Disney Dreamlight Valley, this project reportedly lost direction and was eventually canned. Project Rainbow Road reportedly started life as a Funko project at TT Games before developer 10:10 was awarded the license to that toy brand, and TT tried to salvage its work before it pulled the plug on that project.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/several-lego-games-including-a-diablo-like-disney-project-have-been-canceled-report/1100-6512147/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is almost upon us. The Paramount/Entertainment One production will premiere at this year's South By Southwest festival, hitting nationwide on March 31. The story is centered around an unlikely group of adventurers who have to save the world after unknowingly helping in its impending destruction. </p><p>The group consists of a bard, rogue, sorcerer, druid, paladin, and barbarian, which is a pretty well-rounded team for standard adventures. Who are these adventurers though? Well, the cast of the film explains their character and role in the party in a new clip. </p><div>          </div><p>Each member of the party gives a brief description of their class and characteristic. Pine says that his Edgin the Bard is "charming and likable" while Michelle Rodriguez describes Holga the Barbarian as someone who lives to fight foes and "everyone else." We knew that Justice Smith's Simon was a Sorcerer, but we have information on Doric, played by Sophia Lillis (2017's It), who is a tiefling Druid that specializes in her shapeshifting abilities. Regé-Jean Page describes his Paladin character, Xenk (pronounced ZAYNK) as a fearless warrior with "good manners". </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/come-meet-the-party-from-dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves/1100-6512153/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

When it's working in ideal conditions, this will let you play a game with more of the most eye-popping effects turned on without tanking your frame rate down into the single digits. Nvidia's RTX cards have their own temporal upscaling tech, called Deep Learning Super Sampling, or DLSS, which is also in its third iteration.</p><p>AMD first talked about FSR 3.0 when it released its Radeon RX 7900 XTX and Radeon RX 7900 XT cards last November, where it said that FSR 3 would appear sometime this year. One of the highlighted features at the time was Fluid Motion Frames, which the company said could give games up to a 2x frame rate boost.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amd-is-going-to-talk-about-fsr-3-upscaling-at-gdc-2023-report/1100-6512134/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Given that Tatooine is a remote backwater planet on the Outer Rim of the galaxy, it's not exactly a convenient place to visit. You can't really swing by on the way to some other place, you know? So when our hero Din Djarin once again pops into Peli Motto's (Amy Sedaris) garage at the beginning of Chapter 18 of The Mandalorian, it initially felt like a bit of a stretch.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning. This article contains very light spoilers for Season 3, Episode 2 of The Mandalorian, Chapter 18.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">But it turned out that the writers and Powers That Be on The Mandalorian had another reason for bringing the titular Mando back to Tatooine for yet another quick, casual visit. While the quest to bring back IG-11 ended here, Motto sold Mando on a different droid she had lying around: an astromech unit named R5-D4 that would prove immediately useful in this episode--and who will very likely remain on the series as the astromech unit for Din Djarin's old Naboo starfighter.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mandalorian-just-salvaged-one-of-the-original-star-wars-droids/1100-6512142/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Bringing a Wednesday Addams solo series had been in the works for years, but it finally hit at the right time with director Tim Burton and star Jenna Ortega making the Netflix original series its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wednesday-becomes-netflixs-most-watched-show-in-a-week-with-341-million-hours/1100-6509561/">second most-watched series of all time</a>. However, making Wednesday what it eventually became from what it was initially set out to be required Ortega to put her foot down in a way she never has before.</p><p>On a recent episode of the <a href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/jenna-ortega">Armchair Expert</a> podcast, Ortega claimed that many of the original scripts made no sense to her from a character perspective. It got to be so much, that she went ahead and changed the dialogue without giving notice to any of the production staff, including the writers and director.</p><p>"When I read the entire series, I realized, 'Oh, this is for younger audiences,'" Ortega said (via <a href="https://www.insider.com/wednesday-jenna-ortega-unprofessional-changed-lines-flash-mob-2023-3">Insider</a>). "When I first signed onto the show, I didn't have all the scripts. I thought it was going to be a lot darker. It wasn't. I didn't know what the tone was, or what the score would sound like."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jenna-ortega-opens-up-about-difficulties-filming-wednesday/1100-6512146/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Nintendo has released a new free demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon-announcement-trailer-the-game-awards-2022/2300-6460199/">Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon</a> on Switch. The demo will allow you to try out "the early chapters" of the game, and your save data will carry over to the full version when it releases on March 17, 2023.</p><p>As its name suggests, Bayonetta Origins is a prequel story, offering more context for Bayonetta's backstory. Much like Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, you get to play as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon-is-a-dramatic-departure-from-bayonetta/1100-6511209/">two characters simultaneously</a> in Bayonetta Origins--the titular Cereza and her demon companion, Cheshire. The game will send you on a journey through the dangerous Avalon Forest to save Cereza's mother.</p><p>Bayonetta Origins looks and plays radically different from other games in the series, featuring a watercolor art style, and completely fresh gameplay. The demo, offers a taste of the dual-stick gameplay, as you control Cereza with the left stick and Cheshire with the right. It'll certainly be a change of pace compared to the rest of the Bayonetta series.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon-demo-available-on-switch-right-now/1100-6512144/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The big 7.0 update for PS5 has officially begun rolling out to users, with the headline feature being Discord support. Originally tested in beta, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-on-ps5-how-to-link-accounts/1100-6511123/">Discord's integration into PS5 consoles</a> will allow for voice chats across hardware platforms and Share Screen functionality.</p><div>          </div><p>One of the other new features in the update is VRR support at 1440p resolution, which will allow for smoother visual performance when using a VRR-compatible HDMI 2.1 display at that resolution if a game supports VRR. A "join game" icon in Party Chats, a "friends who play" tile so you can see which games are active in your social circle, and the option to manually upload game captures to the PlayStation App are also included in the update.</p><p>Other smaller quality-of-life features include easier PS4-to-PS5 saved data migration options, PS5-to-PS5 data transfer, screen reader improvements, and wireless device updates for the DualSense controller. Interestingly, a limited release of a new game capture feature is being rolled out in the US and UK. For users in those territories, they'll be able to use voice commands to save clips of their gameplay.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ps5-update-adds-discord-vrr-1440p-support-and-more/1100-6512143/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Riot Games' unnamed MMORPG has lost its lead this week, with executive producer Greg Street announcing his departure from the project and the company due to "a combo of personal and professional considerations." Street has been at Riot Games for nine years, and previously worked on major franchises including Age of Empires and World of Warcraft.</p><p>The MMO set in League of Legends' world of Runeterra was announced by Street in late 2020 while hiring for the project, and details about the game have been thin on the ground since then. Street has talked candidly on Twitter about the development process from time to time, claiming that the MMO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-guarantee-league-of-legends-mmo-will-ship-producer-says-but-development-is-going-super-well/1100-6502412/">may not be released</a> if it doesn't meet Riot's strict standards, as well as promising it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-mmo-will-respect-player-time-according-to-producer/1100-6503066/">respect its players' time</a>.</p><p>Street said the decision to leave Riot was down to both personal and professional reasons, explaining that he "experienced some devastating personal losses last year and I want to be closer to my surviving family." Street added that he plans to stay in game development and is currently considering multiple opportunities.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-mmos-executive-producer-is-stepping-down/1100-6512138/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Twitch Is Taking Action On Deepfake Porn

<p>Twitch has finally <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Addressing-Explicit-Deepfake-Content?language=en_US">released a statement</a> about deepfake pornography after an incident in January involving multiple high-profile streamers. The company has vowed to take immediate action, which includes a change to the platform's policy, consulting with an online safety expert, and a Creator Camp to help streamers protect themselves.</p><p>The blog post says that although deepfake porn isn't a problem on Twitch, which has pre-existing guidelines banning explicit content, it is an issue that affects mostly female streamers who use or are partnered with the platform. "Though we have the most control over what happens on our own service, we want to help streamers protect themselves or respond quickly to this kind of situation anywhere it arises," the statement from Twitch reads.</p><p>To that end, Twitch is updating its policies to include harsher penalties for anyone on its platform caught promoting, creating, or sharing this kind of imagery. The policy update includes a new term for what is generally known as "deepfake porn," with Twitch labelling it "synthetic non-consensual exploitative images" or "synthetic NCEI" for short. Twitch explains that the term "pornography" is inappropriate, as porn should refer to consensual acts undertaken by willing performers, while "synthetic images" is used to make sure the policy covers the breadth of techniques that could be used to create non-consensual imagery.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitch-is-taking-action-on-deepfake-porn/1100-6512137/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2: Lightfall Review - Deft Stranding

<p dir="ltr">With Destiny 2: The Witch Queen and its assorted seasons in the rearview mirror, 2023's Lightfall expansion has some big shoes to fill. Improved storytelling, new gameplay modes, and the ensuing seasonal content made The Witch Queen expansion a standout experience, and Lightfall doesn't manage to reach the high bar it set. Destiny 2's latest add-on introduces major gameplay tweaks, an exciting new subclass to play around with, and plenty of fresh Exotic gear for your arsenal, but this is overshadowed by a disappointing campaign and a lifeless Neptunian destination that make for an underwhelming combination.</p><p dir="ltr">Lightfall doesn't waste any time setting the stage, taking place shortly after the devastating events of Season of the Seraph. After a quick slideshow narrated by the silky-smooth voice of Lance Reddick's Commander Zavala brings everyone up to speed, it's all hands on deck as the Witness finally makes its long-awaited arrival in the Solar system to battle the Traveler. From the opening mission, the action unfolds at a breakneck pace, as a new Shadow Legion of Cabal led by a reborn Calus set a course for Neptune, and you're hitching a ride alongside them in an effort to prevent a doomsday scenario from occurring.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie has spoken several times about adopting an '80s action movie vibe for Lightfall, and that influence is felt everywhere on Neptune's primary location, Neomuna. From a city bathed in neon lights and a training montage as you master your new powers, to the introduction of a cast of characters that include analogs of loose cannon space-cops, maverick rookies, and grizzled veterans just one week away from retirement, Lightfall wears its not-so-subtle inspirations proudly.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-lightfall-review-deft-stranding/1900-6418042/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
