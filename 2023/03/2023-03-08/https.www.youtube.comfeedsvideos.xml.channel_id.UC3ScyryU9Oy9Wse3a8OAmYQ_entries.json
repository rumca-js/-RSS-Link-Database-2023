That November, attacks on multiple targets in Paris killed 130 people. Four months later, suicide bombings killed 32 people in Brussels. \n\nIn the 2016 documentary \u201cTerror in Europe,\u201d FRONTLINE and ProPublica examined whether these attacks by terrorists linked to Al Qaeda and ISIS could have been prevented and why Europe remained vulnerable to the terrorism threat.\n\nYears before the attacks in Europe, ProPublica senior reporter Sebastian Rotella was already reporting on some of the jihadists who would go on to commit them and the counter-terror officials trying to stop them. In unusually candid interviews, European counter-terror veterans told Rotella how the attackers had escaped detection and how European countries had failed to put in place effective intelligence sharing and border enforcement in the lead-up to the attacks.\n\n\u201cTerror in Europe\u201d is a FRONTLINE Production with Mongoose Pictures in partnership with ProPublica. The producer and director is Ricardo Pollack. The correspondent is Sebastian Rotella. The senior producer is Dan Edge. The executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.\n\nExplore additional reporting on \"Terror in Europe\" on our website:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/terror-in-europe/\n\n#Documentary #Extremism #ParisAttacks \n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW\u200b\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\u200b\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\u200b\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS.
