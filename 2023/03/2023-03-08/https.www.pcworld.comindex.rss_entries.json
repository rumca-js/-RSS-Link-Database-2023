[{"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Microsoft\u2019s new Windows 11 features arrive next week", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft says its new Windows 11 update will be generally available on March 14th. However, reports also indicate that the next feature update, also known as Windows 11 23H2, is due this fall&mdash;though without major changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t given its latest Windows 11 update a formal name&mdash;some have called it Windows 11 22H2 Moment 2 or the Windows 11 February 2023 Update. A <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/continuous-innovation-coming-to-windows-11-in-march/ba-p/3754057&amp;xcust=2-1-1535749-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft blog post</a> now identifies it as the &ldquo;March 2023 quality update&rdquo; and says that it will roll out on March 14th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the launch date wasn&rsquo;t a dark secret, Microsoft was expected to roll out the release on Patch Tuesday or the second Tuesday of the month, it&rsquo;s still worth knowing when you can expect these new changes on your PC. We&rsquo;ve listed the Windows 11 <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1522426/windows-11-february-update-adds-bing-ai-chat-tabbed-notepad-iphone.html\">updates that the patch will add</a> like shortcuts to the AI-powered Bing Chat plus updated apps like a tabbed Notepad, Phone Link for iOS, and even ways to save money on your power bill. We&rsquo;ve even <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1527037/windows-11s-new-features-are-ho-hum-but-the-best-one-saves-you-money.html\">gone hands-on</a> with several of the new features. (Brad Chacos <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1528312/windows-11-features-february-2023-update-bing-ai-iphone.html\">lists his favorite features,</a> too.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Microsoft makes clear is that this is <em>not</em> a so-called Windows feature update, which usually merits a larger release. &ldquo;Windows 11 will continue to have an annual feature update cadence, with a new version released in the second half of the calendar year,&rdquo; the post adds. &ldquo;Feature update releases are tied to a support lifecycle: 24 months of support for Home and Pro editions and 36 months of support for Enterprise and Education editions.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily signal a timeframe for <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/811274/windows-12-2024-microsoft-windows-11-features.html\">Windows 12, which is suspected to be coming in 2024</a>. (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1532952/windows-11s-new-canary-channel-could-be-a-test-bed-for-windows-12.html\">Microsoft is reportedly testing Windows 12</a> in its new &ldquo;Canary&rdquo; channel.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, however, the next Windows &ldquo;feature&rdquo; update doesn&rsquo;t seem to have many actual features. Windows Latest reported that Microsoft has scrapped a major overhaul in favor of pushing that update out to be branded as Windows 12. &ldquo;Microsoft is moving to Germanium for the next-gen Windows and plans to use the existing Nickel (22H2) platform for Windows 11 23H2,&rdquo; the site <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/03/08/microsoft-confirms-windows-11s-second-big-feature-update-is-arriving-in-the-fall/&amp;xcust=2-1-1535749-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote</a>, describing the code words for the various platforms. &ldquo;In other words, version 23H2 would be more about under-the-hood improvements than ground-breaking changes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, though, that Microsoft can release new bundles of features in &ldquo;Moments&rdquo; like the March 14th update. Whether Microsoft will release them or hold them back for a fall update, though, is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1535749/new-windows-11-update-arrives-in-a-week.html", "date_published": "2023-03-08 17:59:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Radeon RX 7900 XT price drops by $100, matching the 4070 Ti", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>On AMD&rsquo;s Radeon website, the price of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RX 7900 XT</a> &mdash; the slightly cheaper of its new 7000-series cards &mdash; is $900 <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://shop-us-en.amd.com/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-graphics/&amp;xcust=2-1-1535646-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">with a temporary discount to $849</a> and a bundle with <em>The Last of Us</em>. But if you look around, several US retailers are selling the card and its many manufacturer variants at $800 or a little more. That&rsquo;s a relatively fast discount for a high-end card, but no doubt a welcome one for gamers whose options in this range of power are becoming more limited and expensive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Newegg, the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/xfx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-rx-79tmercb9/p/N82E16814150877?Item=9SIAD2CJRH3855&amp;Description=rx%207900%20xt&amp;cm_re=rx_7900%20xt-_-9SIAD2CJRH3855-_-Product&amp;cm_sp=SP-_-1799461-_-0-_-0-_-9SIAD2CJRH3855-_-rx%207900%20xt-_-7900%7Crx%7Cxt-_-1&amp;xcust=2-1-1535646-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">XFX Speedster</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/asrock-radeon-rx-7900-xt-rx7900xt-pg-20go/p/N82E16814930083?Description=rx%207900%20xt&amp;cm_re=rx_7900%20xt-_-14-930-083-_-Product&amp;quicklink=true&amp;xcust=2-1-1535646-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ASRock Phantom</a> versions of the RX 7900 XT are now $799.99 while Amazon has a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMWHJ5Q7/&amp;xcust=2-1-1535646-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PowerColor &ldquo;Hellhound&rdquo; variant</a> for a hair under $804. Various news outlets are reporting similar price drops at international retailers, though there are still plenty of versions of the card selling for $900 or higher. We&rsquo;ve contacted AMD representatives for a comment to see if this is a permanent price drop or some kind of limited promotion and have yet to hear back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, this makes at least some versions of the RX 7900 XT the same price as Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4070 Ti.

While Nvidia remains a much better call for gamers who value ray tracing and a versatile software stack, AMD now has an undisputable hardware advantage at the $800 price point, at least for the time being. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether the price is a permanent drop or not, expect the various versions of the card to hit that price on a regular basis from now on. </p>\n\nGraphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1535646/radeon-rx-7900-xt-price-drops-by-100-matching-4070ti.html", "date_published": "2023-03-08 17:16:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "VPN by Google One is coming to all subscribers", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Google took another step toward expanding the footprint of its VPN by Google One service, making it available to <em>all</em> of its Google One cloud-storage subscribers, down to its $1.99 basic tier, as well as to Windows users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google also said it would provide a &ldquo;dark web report service&rdquo; to Google One users to keep tabs on whether their personal information is being trafficked online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, Google has reserved its VPN by Google One service for its premium Google One plans, which require users to pay at least $99.99 annually for 2TB of storage and other perks, including the VPN. In December, Google extended the VPN by Google One perk to Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro owners, too.  Now, the VPN capability will be offered to every member who signs up for a Google One paid plan, across 22 countries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google previously offered VPN by Google One to just Android and iOS customers; now the service will be offered to both Windows and Mac devices, too. You can share the subscription with up to five devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Google&rsquo;s Google One VPN doesn&rsquo;t make our list of either PCWorld&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/634025/best-free-vpns-for-windows.html\">best free VPNs</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html\">best VPN services</a>: Google&rsquo;s VPN doesn&rsquo;t allow you to select from any foreign servers, so it can&rsquo;t be used to sample a Netflix subscription in another region. Instead, VPN by Google One simply allows you to hide your identity while surfing, making it an appropriate choice for a coffee shop or airport but not much else. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to have changed.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"google-one-100gb-plan\">Google One (100GB plan)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Google One (100GB plan)\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/04/googlelogo-100883437-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"512\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://one.google.com/about&amp;xcust=2-1-1534539-5-392871-10535&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$ at  Google One</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"google-ones-dark-web-report\">Google One&rsquo;s dark web report</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;dark web report&rdquo; automatically ties in to Google&rsquo;s search services by trawling the dark web&mdash;i.e, parts of the web that Google supposedly <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> index.

For example, my home-built desktops have been using 32GB of RAM for more than ten years. But if you have a new build and you&rsquo;re just itching to fill it with the most DDR5 RAM possible, Corsair is here to deliver &mdash; literally.

These will cost you $274.99, or $284.99 with the RGB special sauce, with a 40-52-52-114 timing setup.

But having an unusual design doesn&rsquo;t always translate into better performance. I mean, who really needs a mouse that looks like a Klingon mother ship, anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keychron, by comparison, has added straightforward, but stylish devices to its most recent peripherals lineup, championing practicality over flamboyancy and it&rsquo;s excellent news for gamers. In fact, by homing in on the timeless basics, those undeniably winning features that make every gamer perform better, Keychron&rsquo;s gear is really flaming-hot right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the Keychron M3, for example: It dispenses with a schmancy design, instead showing off a streamlined, lightweight, and comfortable body, stellar finger grips, and quick and responsive buttons&mdash;things I actually care about. It also sports a flawless 26, 000 DPI optical sensor, thereby adding a very respectable level of power&mdash;and all for just $49.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"keychron-m3-design\">Keychron M3: Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wireless gaming mice can suffer &ldquo;heavy-mouse prejudice,&rdquo; since all that useful wireless gadgetry can weigh them down substantially over their wired counterparts&mdash;and every competitive gamer knows it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, some gamers will avoid them altogether, equating any extra weight to worse performance&mdash;especially for FPS games where speed is of the utmost importance. The Keycron M3, however, smashes that stereotype with its 79 grams feeling disarmingly light and quick&mdash;especially given it has the full gamut of connectivity options: 2.4GHz low-latency Wi-Fi connectivity as well as Bluetooth 5.1 <em>and</em> wired connectivity via its USB cable.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron M3\" class=\"wp-image-1527038\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Keychron-M3-09.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Keychron</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This one factor alone makes this mouse worth buying, but if you need other reasons, there are plenty. The M3&rsquo;s proportions are another big one, being just perfect for any kind of precision movement you care to do. It measures a well-proportioned 4.9 x 2.7 x 1.6 inches.

Additionally, all six buttons on the top were always within my reach, including the two left-side buttons that can be awkwardly positioned in some mice.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Keychron M3 is so quick it feels like your crosshairs arrive long before your brain has time to register what the heck you&rsquo;re doing.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top is noticeably tall, which is just ideal if you want to get down and tango in firefights with foes at long range. It nestled nicely into the palm of my hand, giving me really fine control of movement down the centerline rather than from my wrist&mdash;so targeting was very accurate and there was also little chance of me developing any painful RSI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are the grips and the customizable RGB lighting, both of which deserve praise. The RGB forms a ring around the base and inside the mouse wheel adding a nice touch of flair, while the grips are some of the most sensible, I&rsquo;ve used. They seem to stick your fingers like glue, really heightening your sense of control. Plus, I&rsquo;m not going to lie, putting on my own grips out of the box can be as fiddly as hell, so it was a real relief knowing they came molded into the device, right out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"keychron-m3-the-buttons\">Keychron M3: The buttons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the two left-side buttons, on top you get two main clicks, a sturdy mouse wheel, and an RGB button for switching RGB profiles just behind it. It&rsquo;s a familiar setup that will do well for most of your gaming needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I could change one thing, I would have switched the placement of the RGB toggle button with the DPI toggle button on the mouse&rsquo;s underside. Both are great to have, but being able to switch DPI settings without lifting the mouse is far more valuable than changing up how your mouse looks, when performance depends on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, thanks to these two buttons and an additional polling and connectivity mode buttons underneath, you can change almost all the settings you need without having to go into the Keychron Engine companion software app&mdash;which means you can stay gaming for longer.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron M3\" class=\"wp-image-1525662\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230228_145050.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Engine M3 is great little app that lets you assign all of the M3&rsquo;s buttons and make changes to more specialized settings like your mouse&rsquo;s lift off distance&mdash;so it&rsquo;s well worth a visit between games, when you do feel like taking a breather.  A Windows 10/11 version of the software is currently available; however, Mac users will have to sit tight for a Mac version to arrive, which Keychron says will likely be in June 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"keychron-m3-performance\">Keychron M3: Performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The M3 boasts a PAW3395, a flawless PixArt-branded sensor that you&rsquo;ll commonly find discussed on Reddit, and in other corners of gaming forums, as one the best around. A quick glimpse of its specifications shows why. I&rsquo;ve got to admit, I was super eager to try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize, it has a maximum resolution of 26,000 DPI and a tracking speed of 650 IPS (inches per second). A top-level acceleration of 50g, polling rate of 1,000ms, and adjustable lift-off distance of 1 to 2mm round out the drool-worthy attributes that gamers will love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All things considered, I found it to be a killer performer, smoother and less labored than sensors like the PixArt PAW3370 and PAW3335. It&rsquo;s without a doubt going to make your precision gaming even tighter if you pride yourself on hitting small targets. From spinning around to catch foes behind my position, to zipping my cursor up to catch snipers dug into the peskiest camping spots, it handled just about every movement I tried on it without a hint of lag.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Keychron M3 gaming mouse\" class=\"wp-image-1525668\" height=\"831\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Keycrhon-Engine-M3.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Settings changes can be made in the Keychron Engine M3 app.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s so quick it feels like your crosshairs arrive long before your brain has time to register what the heck you&rsquo;re doing, which means there&rsquo;s plenty of scope to improve your responsiveness&mdash;especially in games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em>, where microseconds can make a big difference to your play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The buttons, too, feel very light and frighteningly fast. They&rsquo;ll equally challenge your reflexes for speed, seemingly only limited by how fast you can trigger them. They feature Kailh G Master 8.0 Micro Switches, which are rated up to a maximum of 80 million clicks&mdash;here&rsquo;s a mouse that will last you a very long time, no matter how much gaming you do per day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"should-i-buy-the-keychron-m3\">Should I buy the Keychron M3?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At just $49 the Keychron M3 already seems astronomically cheap for a 79 gram, RGB gaming mouse with a 26,000 DPI sensor and dual wireless / wired connectivity. But what you get in the box should seal the deal if you&rsquo;re still teetering on the brink of deciding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some gaming mice offer just a single dongle or wired USB cable with adapter, with the M3 you also get an extra dongle thrown in&mdash;so you get both USB-C and USB-A dongles, plus a USB-C cable with a USB-A adapter <em>and</em> extension adapter. For $49 this is fantastic value and another reason the Keychron M3 will undoubtedly just zoom off retailers&rsquo; shelves this year, so it might be worth snapping one up before they do.</p>\n\nGaming, Mice</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525656/keychron-m3-gaming-mouse.html", "date_published": "2023-03-08 16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Windows 11 might bring back the top taskbar", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally new versions of operating systems are supposed to have <em>more </em>features than the old ones, not fewer.

It turns out that with a little tweak, it&rsquo;s possible to get that topside taskbar that some users have been missing. Don&rsquo;t get too excited, though: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-could-finally-fix-windows-11s-strangest-design-choice&amp;xcust=2-1-1535435-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">As TechRadar reports</a>, the functionality is broken at the moment.

With these releases, come a slew of new motherboard choices. There are many familiar faces from past generations, loaded up with the latest tech like DDR5 and PCIe Gen 5.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the last several months we&rsquo;ve been painstakingly going over these motherboards with a fine-tooth comb: What features do they offer for everyday gamers? How good is the build quality and design? How good is the performance offered? These considerations come together to create the intrinsic value offered by each motherboard, and to answer the all-important question:&nbsp;&ldquo;Is this motherboard worth it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each motherboard brings with it a nuanced experience: from opening the box, to holding it in your hands, to updating drivers, and to finally using it for gaming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll also make a big deal out of pricing, because it&rsquo;s a vital step in choosing a motherboard. We won&rsquo;t sugar coat it: Motherboard prices have gone up on average with the new generation, so we want to make sure you&rsquo;re getting value for your dollar. From expensive enthusiast motherboards, to a more affordable ones&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got you covered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this gaming motherboard roundup, we&rsquo;re going to cover premium options, midrange options, and more affordable options. (Truly &ldquo;budget&rdquo; motherboard options will be for a future roundup, as AMD is still releasing more affordable options to compete with Intel, and Intel has more coming as well.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"best-gaming-motherboards-for-intel\">Best gaming motherboards for Intel</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"1-asus-rog-maximus-z790-hero-best-premium-intel-gaming-motherboard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

The Intel i9 13900K makes an excellent pairing here, with twin 20+1 power stages offering overkill performance.</p>\n\n<p>Packing DDR5, PCIe Gen 5, and loads of USB ports, it has plenty of I/O, too. M.2 drive slots are plenty&mdash;with three onboard, plus an included ROG M.2 PCIe card that lets you add two more. Other standout features include Thunderbolt 4, Wi-Fi 6E, 2.5Gb networking, and more &ldquo;heatsinks&rdquo; than you count.</p>\n\n<p>Packaging is nicely done, with a premium box and accessory inclusion to match the $629.99 MSRP. The motherboard is also very well-built and feels substantial in the hands, with a weighty heft.</p>\n\n<p>The ROG, or &ldquo;Republic of Gamers,&rdquo; branding has been popular with enthusiast gamers. Part of the reason is the gamer-centric design, which this motherboard has in spades. Like RGB? You&rsquo;ll be at home here, with a beautiful I/O area display. The rest of the motherboard is adorned with high-quality finishes and plenty of thermal &ldquo;armor&rdquo; covers, too.

Besides boasting a healthy feature set, the board comes in either DDR5 or DDR4 versions, giving you even more flexibility in your budget, should you choose to stick with memory you already have or to save on purchasing last-gen modules. (We&rsquo;d go for the DDR5 version ourselves, as a means of future-proofing, but you can expect to pay about $30 extra for that support.) </p>\n\n<p>Both versions support 12th-gen and 13th-gen Intel CPU&mdash;the 16+1+1 phase VRM can handle even the i9 13900K for gaming. However, a midrange CPU such as the 13600K or 13700K would make an excellent pairing here.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll also get lots of I/O&mdash;with 10 USB ports, including fast 20Gb/s. Five M.2 slots and PCIe Gen 5 in the form of a 16x slot round out the offerings.</p>\n\n<p>Aesthetics are king with this board&mdash;the white and silver design will be an elegant foundation for any build. The entire motherboard is covered with nice thermal armor and tasteful accents. The build quality is solid, to boot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With a price of $369, and the ability to pair with cheaper DDR4 and an older Intel 12th-gen CPU, there is great value here. While it doesn&rsquo;t have the fancy box or accouterments of more expensive motherboards, it&rsquo;s got the features you&rsquo;ll need at an excellent price range.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"3-msi-mag-z790-tomahawk-wifi-ddr4-best-bang-for-the-buck-intel-gaming-motherboard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.

Sure, it&rsquo;s not a premium $500-plus behemoth, but it has exactly the features you&rsquo;ll need to have a great experience. And sure, there are some cheaper options out there, but this board will give you loads of features for the price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As with the Edge WiFi Z790 above, opting for DDR4 helps cut the build costs considerably. Support for 12th- and 13th-gen Intel CPUs gives you lots of options and price flexibility You&rsquo;ll get the same 16x PCIe Gen 5 found on many more expensive motherboards, plus Wi-Fi 6E and 2.5Gb LAN. No skimping on M.2 slots here, either&mdash;you&rsquo;ll get a total of four PCIe Gen 4 slots! That&rsquo;s followed by 10 USB ports on the back, (20Gb/s) and even BIOS Flashback and Clear CMOS. All told, it should leave only the most demanding gamers needing more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Top it off with a clean, no-frills design, and you&rsquo;re most of the way there in terms of features compared to pricier options. The motherboard is basic in terms of RGB, but you do get RGB headers. You also get PWM fan headers and even great VRM performance, with a fancy-sounding 16+1+1 &ldquo;Duet Rail Power System&rdquo; that can handle even an i9 Intel CPU!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In terms of value for what you&rsquo;re getting, it&rsquo;s a great package. You&rsquo;ll also have a significantly cheaper platform cost by combining the $309 MSRP, cheaper DDR4, and wide array of Intel CPUs to pair with.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1398387/msi-mag-z790-tomahawk-wifi-ddr4-motherboard-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\tMSI MAG Z790 Tomahawk WiFi DDR4 review \t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"best-gaming-motherboards-for-amd\">Best gaming motherboards for AMD</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"1-asus-rog-crosshair-x670e-hero-best-premium-amd-gaming-motherboard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

With this power, you&rsquo;ll need a premium motherboard to pair with it: Enter the Asus ROG X670E Hero. Repeating much of what makes the Hero an enthusiast favorite on Intel and past AMD X570, it&rsquo;s back with even more features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>DDR5, PCIe Gen 5, all there&mdash;and these PCIe lanes are very expansive on the X670E chipset. Not only will you get two PCIe Gen 5 16x slots, but you&rsquo;ll also get four onboard M.2 NVMe slots. Two of them are PCIe Gen 5, and two are Gen 4&mdash;now that&rsquo;s storage performance! Wait, there&rsquo;s more! With the included accessory PCIe Gen 5 card, you can add an additional NVMe drive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nestled amongst the 12 rear USB ports, you&rsquo;ll find USB4, which has similar 40Gb/s speeds to Thunderbolt 4. The usual Wi-Fi 6E and Intel 2.5Gb LAN are here too, plus a few nice usability features: Asus Q-Release and Q-Latch, for the PCIe slot and M.2 slots, respectively. These make swapping out components effortless.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But you want a ROG Hero because of the aesthetics and RGB, right? With a resoundingly weighty build quality, the overall design is also gorgeous. There are glossy and matte finishes throughout, but your eye will quickly be drawn to the showy RGB instead. Nicely done&mdash;and best of all, it completely fits the design and makes for a premium experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With new Ryzen CPUs such as the 7950X3D models coming out, those seeking maximum performance will do well with the ROG Hero, which has the 18+2 teamed power stages to handle blazingly fast CPUs.</p>\n\n<p>The combination of excellent features and mouth watering eye-candy certainly justifies its $699 MSRP.

The price is also reduced&mdash;and in our opinion, you&rsquo;ll still get most of the goodies. It just has a few less PCIe Gen 5 lanes, USB ports, and SATA ports. Keep in mind that AM5 only gives you access to Ryzen 7000 CPUs, since it&rsquo;s a completely new platform. (Sorry, Ryzen 5000 fans, you&rsquo;ll have to stick to X570 Or B550)</p>\n\n<p>The Gigabyte B650E Aorus Master brings its $349 MSRP to the Ryzen AM5 lineup. While it only has four PCIe Gen 5 lanes, it&rsquo;s more than you&rsquo;ll get with B650&mdash;thanks to the &ldquo;E&rdquo; designator.&nbsp;They&rsquo;re used optimally here, with four onboard M.2 NVMe slots. SATA ports top out at four&mdash;but given the generous NVMe storage, you&rsquo;ll likely never saturate these options for most gaming builds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The I/O doesn&rsquo;t stop there, with a whopping 13 USB ports on the back, up to 10Gb/s USB Gen 2. While you won&rsquo;t get USB4, you&rsquo;d have to pay more for the privilege. Other great options include Wi-Fi 6E, 2.5Gb LAN, and HDMI-out for the integrate iGPU.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Gigabyte B650E Aorus Master still looks premium&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s cheaper than its X670E brethren. With a straightforward monochromatic design, it has the right nuanced touches just in the right places.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A lot of those visual niceties also translate to performance&mdash;with the impressive VRM heatsinks having some real presence. You&rsquo;ll also have thermal pad &ldquo;armor&rdquo; covering the NVMe slots, for functional aesthetics. 16+2+2 Digital VRM not only looks great, but it can handle the glorious performance of even the Ryzen 9 CPUs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, gamers who chose the B650E Aorus Master won&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re missing anything. It&rsquo;s a premium design with a fair price for next generation technology.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1363181/gigabyte-b650e-aorus-master-motherboard-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\tGigabyte B650E Aorus Master review \t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"3-msi-mag-b650-tomahawk-wifi-best-bang-for-the-buck-amd-gaming-motherboard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.

We&rsquo;ll refrain from calling these &ldquo;budget,&rdquo; but they do represent a great bang-for-buck value.</p>\n\n<p>The MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk enters the fray at $239 MSRP and packing the B650 chipset. You&rsquo;re not paying for expensive overhead features here that you may never use, such as those found on X670E. Instead, you&rsquo;re getting just the right compliment of specs that will keep your gaming build humming along.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s all DDR5 here&mdash;so while you can&rsquo;t save money by using DDR4, you&rsquo;re at least on the same level ground as the more expensive motherboards for capabilities. You&rsquo;ll also get the same Wi-Fi 6E and 2.5Gb LAN as on more expensive motherboards. Add to that three PCIe Gen 4 NVMe M.2 slots, but no PCIe Gen 5. That&rsquo;s okay&mdash;the tradeoff is worth it since nothing can saturate PCIe Gen 5 slots currently.</p>\n\n<p>The board&rsquo;s USB is no slouch, with up to 20Gb/s Type C available. Performance continues with the 14+2+1 VRM power system, perfectly capable of taming the Ryzen CPUs&mdash; although the Ryzen 5 and 7 pair best with this value-oriented offering.</p>\n\n<p>How about aesthetics? They&rsquo;re minimalist, in a good way. Attractive design with stealthy dark colors abounds. Granted, you don&rsquo;t get the RGB party or overkill armor plates on the PCIe area of more expensive motherboards, but that&rsquo;s fine. The VRM heatsinks are more than sufficient and look great. The understated look has the bonus of fitting almost any build&rsquo;s design aesthetic.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a great performer with just the right features&mdash;without skimping on important elements. Best of all, it keeps the price significantly lower than other options.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1522279/msi-mag-b650-tomahawk-wifi-motherboard-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\tMSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi review \t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-to-look-for-in-a-gaming-motherboard\">What to look for in a gaming motherboard</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&rsquo;re choosing your motherboard for your gaming rig, there are many important things to consider. We&rsquo;ve narrowed down the most vital and essential for your purchase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"choose-your-platform-intel-or-amd\">Choose your platform: Intel or AMD&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first item on your list should be whether you&rsquo;re going with team Blue (Intel), or team Red (AMD). For example, do you want the most future-proof motherboard available as of today for CPU upgrades? Then AMD is your best bet, because AM5 just launched and should have more support than Intel&rsquo;s older 13th-gen platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or perhaps you&rsquo;d prefer to save a few bucks and are okay with either 12th- or 13th-gen Intel CPUs for a while.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"know-the-hardware-you-want-to-use-in-advance\">Know the hardware you want to use in advance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan out the hardware you plan to use on your motherboard, to make sure it will be sufficient. For example, only Intel currently supports both DDR4 and DDR5 RAM, if you&rsquo;d like to still use the former.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also be aware of certain PCIe lane and bandwidth limitations. For example, if you&rsquo;re planning to use three or more NVMe PCIe Gen 4 drives, you may want the higher-end AMD X670E platform or Intel Z790 platform. These typically will give you more PCIe lanes. If you&rsquo;re fine with just a couple, the cheaper B650 AMD motherboards may work just fine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll also want to look closely at CPU-cooler compatibility; some newer motherboards may need adapters to work with older brackets. The same holds true for motherboard size &mdash;ATX being the standard for most. If you have a small form factor case, you&rsquo;ll likely need Mini-ITX or Micro-ATX to fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"know-the-basic-specs-and-what-youre-likely-to-use\">Know the basic specs and what you&rsquo;re likely to use&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While gamers may not be as demanding as content creators who may require features like Thunderbolt and 10Gbe networking, there are still essential basic features you should be aware of.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to use Wi-Fi, make sure your motherboard comes equipped with it&mdash;not all of them do. If you plan to set up a beefy flight- or racing-simulation rig, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure to have plenty of USB ports, for example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"price-to-performance-matters-pay-attention-to-the-details\">Price to performance matters&mdash;pay attention to the details</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Motherboards can have so many variations that it&rsquo;s often confusing to the consumer, so pay attention to the details and features. If your particular use case doesn&rsquo;t require fancy features like USB4 or 10Gb networking, you can often save large amounts of money foregoing them&mdash;and get most of the performance otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-we-evaluate-gaming-motherboards\">How we evaluate gaming motherboards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We take a systematic approach in every motherboard evaluation, with a careful eye on the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"specs-and-features\">Specs and features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The nuts and bolts of each motherboard: For the price, does it have the requisite features that a gamer would need and appreciate, and how are those features implemented in the user experience?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are the visual aesthetics appealing, and do they represent the board&rsquo;s intended purpose? Is it well laid-out, and does it incorporate PC build-friendly design considerations?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"performance\">Performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How well does it handle the latest CPUs and tech like DDR5? Does it have fast USB, PCIe lanes, and other I/O? Do BIOS updates address important issues in a timely manner?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"value\">Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Given everything the motherboard offers for its asking price, does it provide good value for the gamer and an overall good experience?&nbsp;</p>\n\nDesktop PCs, Gaming PCs</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html", "date_published": "2023-03-08 15:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Save $120 on this high-speed 1440p Samsung gaming monitor", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing is more frustrating than gaming on a slow monitor that can&rsquo;t keep up with your games.

We&rsquo;d recommend grabbing it sooner rather than later, as we don&rsquo;t expect this deal to last much longer.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-odyssey-27-ips-led-qhd-freesync-g-sync-compatible-gaming-monitor-with-hdr-display-port-hdmi-black%2F6471364.p%3FskuId%3D6471364&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Samsung Odyssey G5 gaming monitor for $279.99 at Best Buy</a></p>\nMonitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1535426/1535426.html", "date_published": "2023-03-08 15:19:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "8 ways Microsoft\u2019s free PowerToys make your life easier", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably have a &ldquo;tool drawer&rdquo; in your house or apartment with a wrench, a few screwdrivers, and other tools for simple home projects. That&rsquo;s what PowerToys is&mdash;just for Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s PowerToys <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398010/windows-10-powertoys-app-tutorial-for-beginners.html\">debuted more than three years ago</a>, evolving from a single utility to sixteen Windows tools that perform specialized tasks to improve your life. Some can be extremely powerful! I will show you a number of ways I use Microsoft&rsquo;s PowerToys within Windows 10 and 11, as examples for you to accomplish more, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who want to dive into the code, you can visit <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys&amp;xcust=2-1-563788-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">PowerToys&rsquo; GitHub page</a>. But if you simply want to download and use PowerToys, there are two simple ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://aka.ms/getPowertoys&amp;xcust=2-1-563788-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download PowerToys from the Windows Store</a>, or</li><li>Use WinGet: Open PowerShell from the Start menu and type in or copy this code: <strong>winget install Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget </strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, you&rsquo;ll end up with a small utility that will live in your Taskbar. At any time, you can click on it to open its Settings menu and play around with the various tools. Each PowerToy offers a ton of configurability&mdash;that&rsquo;s the whole point!&mdash;but the basic functions are simple enough that you should be able to easily grok what each does. And each PowerToy has a master on-off switch, so you can disable each if you don&rsquo;t need to run it. (This isn&rsquo;t particularly necessary, but it&rsquo;s an option.)</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft PowerToys Feb 2023\" class=\"wp-image-1528709\" height=\"763\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PowerToys.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"what-are-microsofts-powertoys\">What are Microsoft&rsquo;s PowerToys?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of each PowerToy and what it does.

(Right now, the tool only records MP4 video.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"how-powertoys-can-improve-your-life\">How PowerToys can improve your life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are several quick ways PowerToys improve my productivity:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1-keep-a-calculator-or-other-app-always-on-top\">1) Keep a calculator or other app Always on Top</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally, I&rsquo;ll have to run a few quick calculations on benchmark data, some of which I may not have programmed Excel to accommodate. If I need to enter the data somewhere else, the Calculator app can get buried behind the other window. Pinning the app to keep it in focus using Always on Top prevents that from happening, which is far more useful than you might think.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft PowerToys always on top\" class=\"wp-image-563923\" height=\"904\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/always-on-top-copy.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>You can put one or more apps Always on Top.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-quickly-label-vacation-photos-with-powerrename\">2) Quickly label vacation photos with PowerRename</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably don&rsquo;t want to micro-manage vacation/event photos, and I don&rsquo;t either. But cloud services aren&rsquo;t great at grouping photos besides location and the time they were shot. With PowerRename, you can go into OneDrive, lasso a group of photos with your mouse, and PowerRename them something simple, such as &ldquo;EricElaineWedding.&rdquo; The tool will assign each photo its own unique name, such as &ldquo;EricElaineWedding4.&rdquo; In this way you can avoid having to create special folders for each event, and the process takes just a few seconds&mdash;once you know what you&rsquo;re doing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>PowerRename works more like a &ldquo;find/replace&rdquo; for filenames than anything else, though you can use a wildcard (*) like I did below to accomplish my task. (I used Surface shots, rather than the actual wedding, to preserve the attendees&rsquo; privacy.)</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"PowerRename Windows PowerToys\" class=\"wp-image-563910\" height=\"919\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PowerRename-in-action.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-keep-my-pc-awake-while-downloading-games\">3) Keep my PC Awake while downloading games</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>California&rsquo;s electric utility charges an arm and a leg for electricity, and our home doesn&rsquo;t have solar, yet. We also pay for a mid-tier broadband connection. There have been times that I want to leave a computer on to download a game or two, without tweaking Windows&rsquo; power and sleep settings. I simply check the estimated time to download the game, flip Awake on for that amount of time via the tool&rsquo;s settings, along with the option to turn off the screens. The game downloads and then my PC goes back to sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4-image-resize-photos-quickly\">4) Image Resize photos quickly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking, editing, and publishing photos is part of my job, and the photos <em>I</em> take are large enough for publication. That&rsquo;s not always the case for vendor photos, which might not meet the minimum size our content management system requires. I finally set up a custom Image Resizer configuration so I can quickly resize photos, then upload what I need to meet a deadline. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only annoying aspect of this is that &ldquo;Image resize&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t in the main drop-down menu that appears when you right-click a file in Windows 11. You&rsquo;ll need to go into the &ldquo;Show more options&rdquo; menu at the bottom, and from there to the submenu. It&rsquo;s much more convenient on Windows 10.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"PowerToys resize images\" class=\"wp-image-563929\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/powertoys-resize-images.gif\" width=\"869\" /><figcaption>PowerToys Image Resizer running on Windows 10.</figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/image-resizer&amp;xcust=2-1-563788-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5-hide-yourself-in-a-videoconference-with-video-conference-mute\">5) Hide yourself in a videoconference with Video Conference Mute</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being part of a global media organization means that meetings aren&rsquo;t always scheduled at the most convenient times for my time zone. Sometimes I&rsquo;m forced to listen in on an early morning Zoom or Teams call, where my presence is required, but not necessarily my participation. With the Video Conference Mute shortcut, I can be sure that any mics and cameras are off.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6-find-my-mouse\">6) Find My Mouse</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in multiple monitors to maximize productivity, and sometimes even doing something like wiggling the mouse won&rsquo;t make the cursor&rsquo;s location obvious. Plugging in a double-tap of the left <strong>CTRL </strong>key into your<strong> </strong>muscle memory (alongside <strong>CTRL-V</strong>, say) triggers Find My Mouse. It just takes a second and gets you back on track.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Find my mouse Windows PowerToys\" class=\"wp-image-563917\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/where-is-my-mouse.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>A spotlight &ldquo;zooms in&rdquo; on your mouse cursor, which looks a lot better in reality than on a screenshot.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7-fancyzones-is-a-power-version-of-windows-snap\">7) FancyZones is a power version of Windows Snap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Weirdly, I don&rsquo;t use FancyZones&mdash;once <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398010/windows-10-powertoys-app-tutorial-for-beginners.html\"><em>the</em> reason to use PowerToys</a>&mdash;as much as I used to, if only because Windows 11 basically has a simplified version of FancyZones built right in. But if you&rsquo;re on Windows 10, FancyZones is <em>incredible</em>. You can organize windows however you&rsquo;d like, tweak and resize them as you&rsquo;d like, and the window &ldquo;zones&rdquo; will remain in place. It&rsquo;s an absolutely fantastic way of working, and arguably one of the strongest selling points of Windows 11. Below is the how-to video we shot in the early days of PowerToys.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"8-text-extractor\">8) Text Extractor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&rsquo;t used Text Extractor yet, but I certainly plan to. You probably don&rsquo;t live in a world where if someone shows you a screenshot or a video, you can&rsquo;t ask for a proper, editable PowerPoint file. That&rsquo;s not in the case with technology journalism: information is presented in multiple ways, quickly. Transforming visual information into editable text is a necessary skill. I can see Text Extractor helping me to cheat a bit: I can snap a screenshot, then use Text Extractor to copy down the relevant facts quickly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only issue with Text Extractor is that it reads information like a book: top to bottom, left to right. Visually presented information doesn&rsquo;t always hold to those rules, so you&rsquo;ll have to make sure that you either apply it when the image meets those rules, or else spend some time reorganizing the information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line: PowerToys is free, convenient, and available to Windows users. It&rsquo;s a must-have, and it just keeps getting better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated on March 2 to add additional new PowerToys and update the story&rsquo;s information.</em></p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/563788/seven-ways-in-which-microsofts-powertoys-improves-my-life.html", "date_published": "2023-03-08 11:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM review: This monitor packs an HDR punch for less", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Excellent HDR brightness</li><li>Crisp motion clarity</li><li>Lots of connectivity</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Stand is too large</li><li>Sharpness could be improved</li><li>Mini-LED backlight needs more dimming zones</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">The AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM is a Mini-LED monitor with excellent HDR brightness that often limbos under $1,000.

This includes two HDMI 2.1 ports and a USB-C 3.2 port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 65 watts Power Delivery. The USB-C port connects to four additional USB-A ports. That&rsquo;s good to see on a gaming monitor&mdash;though, at $899.99, such extras might be expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-design\">AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM: Design&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM\" class=\"wp-image-1528898\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Red chrome accents and RGB lights give the AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM a gamer appeal.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM has an aggressive design with red chrome accents and RGB lighting. It&rsquo;s an in-your-face look that&rsquo;s better suited to a gamer&rsquo;s desk than a home office. I admire it, though, for doing a few things differently: The RGB light bar along the chin is a nice touch, and the red chrome badging adds an over-the-top, supercar feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build quality is not as nice as monitors from Alienware or the Asus Republic of Gamers line, as the design is not as cohesive and doesn&rsquo;t gel around a recognizable brand identity. It&rsquo;s close, though, and AOC deserves credit for delivering a handsome piece of kit for the price. The AG274QZM is among the least expensive Mini-LED monitors on the market today, yet feels nearly as premium as competitors sold for hundreds more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor includes a sturdy stand that offers ergonomic adjustments such as height, tilt, swivel, and pivot (rotate) for use in landscape orientation. The stand is too wide, however, and also too deep, so it takes up more desk space than it should. That could prove annoying if your desk is small or narrow. A 100x100mm VESA mount is available for third-party monitor stands and arms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>If you want solid HDR in games and movies, and want to pay as little as possible, the AG274QZM is hard to beat.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-features-and-menus\">AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM: Features and menus&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM offers excellent connectivity for a gaming monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One USB-C port is available, and includes both DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 65 watts of USB Power Delivery. The USB-C port also serves as a USB-C hub driving four USB-A ports.This is still rare among gaming monitors, though it&rsquo;s starting to become more common. Gamers are unlikely to use the USB-C port, even with gaming laptops, because it doesn&rsquo;t deliver enough power to charge a gaming laptop. Still, it&rsquo;s a useful inclusion for PC gamers who have a gaming desktop and a less powerful laptop with USB-C ports (such as a MacBook Air or Dell XPS 13).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A USB-B upstream port is also available, making the USB hub available to devices without USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video connectivity includes two HDMI 2.1 inputs and two DisplayPort inputs, one of which is handled over USB-C. All of the monitor&rsquo;s ports can handle the monitor&rsquo;s native 1440p resolution at its maximum refresh rate of 240Hz.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 3.5mm audio-out is available for passing audio through to speakers or a headset. The monitor also has speakers built-in, but they&rsquo;re weak and deliver a lackluster experience with any content more complex than a podcast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM\" class=\"wp-image-1528906\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM&rsquo;s menu joystick on the rear is easy to use.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor&rsquo;s menu system is controlled with a joystick on its right rear flank. AOC&rsquo;s menu system is attractive, but a bit more confusing than those used by Dell, BenQ, and Viewsonic, among others. Most menu options are nested, with no previews of what&rsquo;s inside a menu, and some menu labels aren&rsquo;t ideal. The menus are speedy and responsive, though, so accidentally opening the wrong item isn&rsquo;t much hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image-quality options are a bit limited. The monitor has several gamma modes, but none promise a particular gamma curve. It&rsquo;s a similar story with color temperature. Color customization is only available in the custom color temperature mode, and this offers only three-way color adjustment. There&rsquo;s no sRGB or DCI-P3 mode, either (there is an sRGB color temperature mode, but seems to only adjust color, not brightness or gamma).</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"nzxt-canvas-27q\">NZXT Canvas 27Q</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"NZXT Canvas 27Q\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nzxt-canvas-27q-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/828353/nzxt-canvas-27q-monitor-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nzxt.com/product/canvas-27q&amp;xcust=2-1-1528866-5-828357-14418&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$249.99 at  NZXT</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;d prefer to see a wider range of image-quality options, as those available on the AG274QZM will fall short for most serious content creators, and may also cause problems for anyone looking to precisely calibrate the monitor. Some less expensive monitors, like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/700448/gigabyte-m27q-x-review-lush-color-in-a-240hz-monitor.html\">Gigabyte M27Q X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/828353/nzxt-canvas-27q-monitor-review.html\">NZXT Canvas 27Q</a>, do better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-sdr-image-quality\">AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM: SDR image quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AOC Agon Pro AG27QZM promises excellent HDR performance, but SDR performance remains important. Most content you&rsquo;ll view when browsing the web or writing in Word will be in SDR. The AG274QZM is no slouch here, but doesn&rsquo;t always impress.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM\" class=\"wp-image-1528900\" height=\"824\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AOC-agon-pro-ag274QZM-brightness.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Brightness starts off strong with a maximum SDR brightness of 602 nits. That&rsquo;s an excellent result for a monitor and, as the graph shows, generally superior to the competition. This level of brightness is enough for use in nearly any situation, including a room lit by multiple large, sunlit floor-to-ceiling windows.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM\" class=\"wp-image-1528901\" height=\"829\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AOC-agon-pro-ag274QZM-contrast.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The maximum contrast ratio came in at 2,950:1. That&rsquo;s a good result compared to an IPS monitor without a Mini-LED backlight system, yet also behind top-tier competitors such as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\">Alienware AW3423DWF</a>. Make no mistake: OLED still has a big advantage when it comes to contrast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM&rsquo;s performance delivers an obvious boost over most monitors on the market. Images have an excellent sense of depth and dimensionality, with many appearing to leap out of the screen. The monitor achieves a dark, convincing black level in dark scenes, though it may still seem ever-so-slightly hazy when viewed in a pitch-black room.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM\" class=\"wp-image-1528902\" height=\"828\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AOC-agon-pro-ag274QZM-color-gamut.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Color gamut is a major strength, as the AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM delivers 100 percent of sRGB, which is common, and 100 percent of AdobeRGB, which is extremely rare even among top-tier OLED and IPS monitors with Quantum Dots panels. The monitor handles 95 percent of DCI-P3. It has a 10-bit panel, as well, which means color banding is rarely visible due to the extreme number of colors available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These results add up to one simple conclusion: The AG274QZM can deliver a spectacular range of color. It&rsquo;s a real knockout when displaying bright, vivid content like animated movies or punchy, vibrant games such as <em>Overwatch 2</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM\" class=\"wp-image-1528903\" height=\"884\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AOC-agon-pro-ag274QZM-color-accuracy.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Color accuracy is not as strong, but certainly more than adequate for nearly all situations. The monitor&rsquo;s color appears realistic and lifelike. As mentioned, though, the monitor doesn&rsquo;t have preset modes tailored to a particular color gamut, so colors may appear oversaturated depending on the content shown.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor&rsquo;s default color temperature came in at 6600K, which is slightly off the target of 6500K. This means the image is slightly cooler and more blue than the target, but it&rsquo;s close enough that the difference is tough to notice. The default gamma curve came in at gamma 2.3, off the target of 2.2, which means content is a bit darker than expected. Once again, this is close enough that the difference can be hard to notice.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"alienware-aw3423dwf\">Alienware AW3423DWF</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Alienware AW3423DWF\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Sharpness is a problem. The AG274QZM&rsquo;s native resolution of 1440p is reasonably sharp for a 27-inch monitor, providing a pixel density of 109 pixels per inch. Despite this, I noticed some color fringing and pixelation around small fonts and text. It&rsquo;s an unexpected result for a modern IPS monitor, and one that replicates the sub-pixel issues found in many OLED monitors including the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\">Alienware AW3423DWF</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mini-LED backlight also has unique downsides. This monitor has 576 dimming zones, which is less than what&rsquo;s found in more expensive monitors like the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1511598/viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-review.html\">Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K</a>. That&rsquo;s a fair number, but it can cause problems around high-contrast borders. When placing a bright, white Word document over a dark desktop background, for example, you may notice blooming (the light leaking into the dark areas of the image) or vignetting (the edges of the document not lighting as brightly as they should).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, SDR image quality can be excellent but also suffers some noticeable flaws. The AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM is a stellar performer in color gamut, delivering a huge range of colors with minimal banding. It&rsquo;s also extremely bright and offers a good contrast ratio. The monitor&rsquo;s sharpness issues are a disappointment, though, and some may find the Mini-LED backlight distracting, especially when using the monitor for basic desktop productivity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-hdr-image-quality\">AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM: HDR image quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM supports HDR and is VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified. It&rsquo;s generally a good HDR performer, and certainly far better than most monitors that lack a Mini-LED backlight. But it&rsquo;s not perfect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with brightness. I measured a maximum HDR brightness of 948 nits, which is very close to the promised maximum of 1,000 nits. The monitor delivered a slightly lower maximum brightness in a 10 percent window, with a maximum brightness of 814 nits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This level of brightness is excellent, and definitely enough to deliver a real punch in HDR. I also noticed the monitor&rsquo;s contrast ratio increased to 4,210:1 in HDR. This doesn&rsquo;t happen on most IPS monitors because any increase in brightness also increases the brightness of the entire display, including dark areas of the image. But with a Mini-LED monitor, such as the AG274QZM, only the bright areas need to be lit, while others can remain dark. It&rsquo;s a major upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the benefits when viewing any HDR content, whether it&rsquo;s games, HDR movies, or even HDR clips on YouTube. A sunset will appear bright, crisp, and detailed, while a flashlight in a foggy midnight forest will appear as a spot of brilliance in an otherwise foreboding scene.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet I said it wasn&rsquo;t perfect&mdash;and that&rsquo;s because the monitor&rsquo;s 576 dimming zones remain an issue. Notice, for example, that my tests show the monitor is brighter when displaying a full, white screen than when only 10 percent of the screen is lit. Usually, the situation is the opposite. In this case, it appears the monitor is slightly decreasing the brightness to limit how severely a brightly lit zone will bleed into other, darker areas of the screen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM is a good HDR performer, and certainly stands out when compared to most monitors in its price bracket. It&rsquo;s a tantalizing compromise for those who want super-bright HDR on their desktop PC but don&rsquo;t want to go broke obtaining it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-motion-performance\">AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM: Motion performance</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM\" class=\"wp-image-1528899\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>240Hz motion performance on the AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM is impressive.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM is a 240Hz display that promises a gray-to-gray response time as low as one millisecond. It also supports Adaptive Sync, with official support for Nvidia G-Sync. AMD FreeSync is not listed, but FreeSync functioned when the monitor was connected to an AMD Radeon RX 6600.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motion performance is excellent. The AG274QZM delivers an extremely crisp image that&rsquo;s right on par with other excellent 240Hz monitors, such as the Gigabyte M27Q X and Sony InZone M3. Scrolling test images of <em>DOTA 2</em> and <em>League of Legends</em> showed that most fine details, including character names and enemy health bars, were visible, and that character outlines were easy to make out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AOC includes three overdrive modes: Weak, Medium, and Strong. The feature is turned off by default. When turned on, overdrive doesn&rsquo;t cause distracting image quality problems. This is true even at the highest preset. Competitive gamers will be pleased to see a minor improvement in motion clarity with overdrive on, and that using this mode doesn&rsquo;t reduce image quality to an ugly mess. The monitor doesn&rsquo;t have a backlight strobing feature, though, so gamers who like that particular form of motion clarity enhancement will need to look elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm\">Should you buy the AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM is a solid choice if you want a good HDR experience on your PC but don&rsquo;t want to pay more than $1,000. OLED competitors have better contrast, but fall behind in brightness, while IPS monitors without a Mini-LED backlight are inferior in both. This makes the AG274QZM a practical compromise. It&rsquo;s rarely perfect, but often good enough.
