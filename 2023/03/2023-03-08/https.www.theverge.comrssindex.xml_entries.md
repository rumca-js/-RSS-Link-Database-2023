<p id="4pl4Ya">Last month, Microsoft signed a binding 10-year agreement to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> games to Nintendo players day and date as on Xbox with <a href="https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/1629180356359495680">“full feature and content parity”</a> if its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch">proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> goes through. In the CMA filing, Microsoft makes two main points to argue that it’s possible to bring games like <em>Call of Duty: Warzone </em>and “buy-to-play” titles like <em>Modern Warfare II </em>to Switch:</p>
<ul>
<li id="o4PKRy">Microsoft says the engine behind <em>Warzone</em> has been “optimized to run on a wide range of hardware devices,” including the Xbox One...</li>

  <p id="k9LbfE">You don’t have to sell me on the <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/benefits-of-waking-up-early">benefits of being an early bird</a>. I’ve seen dozens of articles and studies breaking down how getting up early is better for your health, productivity, and stress levels. But becoming an early riser isn’t easy. Speaking from experience, it’s much harder if you’re naturally a night owl and there’s no particular reason — like getting your kids to school — to be up before 7AM. Plus, alarm clocks and phone alarms don’t always work for the sleepiest of sleepyheads. </p>
<p id="Cjkndv">That said, there <em>are</em> other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23291925/best-sleep-tech-trackers-earbuds-wearables">sleep gadgets</a> and apps that can be a huge help. </p>

<p id="xCJPiV">At the company’s Stream On event in Los Angeles, head of global podcast studios Julie McNamara unveiled new video podcasts that’ll appeal to younger listeners. Video episodes of <em>Distractable</em> from Markiplier, the popular gaming YouTuber, are coming exclusively to the platform. The podcast ranks at number 36 on Spotify’s top podcast chart.

  <p id="izTrVS">Spotify is redesigning the core homescreen of its app, trying to make it easier for users to find new stuff to listen to — and watch. The new design goes heavy on imagery and vertical scrolling, turning your homescreen from a set of album covers into a feed that much more closely resembles TikTok and Instagram. As you scroll, Spotify is also hoping to make it easier to discover new things across the Spotify ecosystem.</p>
<p id="D8er3i">The new look, which Spotify just announced at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630401/spotify-is-holding-a-big-event-today">its Stream On event</a>, is clear evidence of the kind of company (and product) Spotify wants to be.

  <p id="eUq4F4"><em>Nothing, Forever</em>, the show that streams an AI-generated <em>Seinfeld</em> parody, is returning this evening after it received a temporary ban from Twitch due to transphobic content. The show will be back on Wednesday, March 8th, at 8PM ET, <a href="https://twitter.com/mismatchmediahq/status/1633256482681819139">according to a tweet from Mismatch Media</a>, which created the show. </p>
<p id="vcdvW3"><em>Nothing, Forever</em> had become something of a Twitch sensation before the ban. For 24 hours a day, it would generate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23581186/ai-seinfeld-twitch-stream-chatgpt"><em>Seinfeld</em>-like scenes</a> and jokes with crude pixelated graphics and bizarre robotic voices. It was absolutely absurd, and I regularly found myself tuning in to hear the next ridiculous non-sequitur and read Twitch chat’s responses.</p>

And if you’ve never played a <em>Metroid</em> before, it’s a great place to start. <em>Fusion</em> combines depth and accessibility, while also nailing all of the things that make <em>Metroid</em> so distinct — namely, its moody exploration and the feeling of being isolated in a dangerous place. Plus, it has a smartass robot and a terrifying villain.</p>
<p id="ddicEY">First, some caveats. <em>Fusion</em> isn’t the first in the series chronologically — and obviously isn’t the only place to get started with <em>Metroid</em>.

  <p id="cVNWF7">Auto safety regulators in the US have opened an investigation into Tesla following reports that steering wheels on Model Y SUVs have fallen off while the vehicle is being driven. In <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2023/INOA-PE23003-5769.PDF">documents posted</a> on Wednesday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it’s aware of two separate incidents involving 2023 Tesla Model Y vehicles in which the SUV’s steering wheel completely detached from the steering column.</p>
<p id="ZNusQs">The preliminary evaluation was opened on March 4th and, according to NHTSA, applies to over 120,000 vehicles. In both instances, the brand-new vehicles were delivered without a necessary retaining bolt to attach the steering wheel to the column and had low mileage during the time of the incidents.</p>

  <p id="oITRDM">Two weeks ago, Meta announced its latest AI language model: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/24/23613512/meta-llama-ai-research-large-language-model">LLaMA</a>. Though not accessible to the public like OpenAI’s <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=theverge.com+chatgpt&amp;oq=theverge.com+chatgpt&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l4j69i60l2.1498j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">ChatGPT</a> or Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams">Bing</a>, LLaMA is Meta’s contribution to a surge in AI language tech that promises new ways to interact with our computers as well as new dangers.</p>
<p id="hkIcyX">Meta did not release LLaMA as a public chatbot (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23617477/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai-tools-personas">though the Facebook owner <em>is</em> building those too</a>) but as an open-source package that anyone in the AI community can request access to. The intention, said the company, is “further democratizing access” to AI to spur research into its problems. Meta benefits if these systems are less buggy, so will happily spend the money to create the model and distribute it for others to troubleshoot with. </p>

  <p id="AiYErV">DuckDuckGo has become the latest search engine to incorporate artificial intelligence. <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/p/80864b48-df90-4281-90e8-e43ac6707b74/">The company has announced a new tool</a>, called DuckAssist, that automatically pulls and summarizes information from Wikipedia in response to certain questions.</p>
<p id="3AaxJr">DuckAssist’s beta is live on the search engine right now — but only through DuckDuckGo’s mobile apps and browser extensions. Gabriel Weinberg, the founder and CEO of DuckDuckGo, says the company will add it to the web-based search engine if the trial “goes well.” </p>

  <p id="i43A3N">Volkswagen has announced changes to its Car-Net security system after a “<a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2023/02/24/vw-atlas-stolen-kidnapping-car-net-subscription-fiasco/">serious breach in process</a>” delayed law enforcement from using the service to locate a vehicle stolen with the victim’s child still inside.

  <p id="4HzMhq">Less than six months after it debuted on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23351948/apple-iphone-14-pro-review">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, Apple’s Dynamic Island has made it to an Android phone as a native feature.

  <p id="NxnlzZ">Sony has released a new PS5 update that includes the highly anticipated Discord integration. Version 7 of the PS5 software is available for all consoles right now, allowing PS5 owners to join Discord calls on their console, alongside improvements to 1440p resolution, the ability to transfer data between PS5 consoles, and a new option to use your voice to capture clips of your gameplay.</p>
<p id="g0jEY1">PS5 owners will be able to use the Discord app on mobile or a PC to transfer a Discord call to their console. It’s very similar to how Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/20/23271170/discord-xbox-voice-calls-integration-hands-on">initially launched Discord support</a> on the Xbox last year, which means you can’t directly access Discord servers on a PS5 without using a mobile device or a PC to transfer the call.</p>

  <p id="D1yMnm">The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had its eye on Twitter since well before Elon Musk bought the outfit, but now we have a better idea about what questions it’s been asking lately. Not only have the investigations continued, but the FTC has been looking into the company’s abilities to keep user data secure, the development of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/12/23506335/twitter-blue-verified-checkmarks-return-impersonation">Twitter Blue subscription plan</a>, and pulling together information on the actions of the company’s new owner. </p>
