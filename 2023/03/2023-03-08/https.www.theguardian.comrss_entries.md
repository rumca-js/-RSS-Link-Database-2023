<p>The president’s mandate for sweeping reform is weaker today than it was in his first term</p><p>As Emmanuel Macron sought radically to reform France’s pensions system in 2019, one of his senior lieutenants warned that intense opposition in the streets would cut no ice. “We are not slowing down anything,” <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d6427032-e677-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc" title="">said</a> Gilles Le Gendre, the then leader of Mr Macron’s La République En Marche party in the national assembly. “This is the emblematic reform of Macronism.”</p><p>In fact, things subsequently slowed down to a complete halt, as Covid forced the proposed changes to be put to one side.

## Typist Artist Pirate King review – generous portrait of neglected artist Audrey Amiss

<p>Carol Morley’s warm and sympathetic film imagines the artist, whose mental illness curtailed her ambitions, on a tragicomic road trip to exhibit her work</p><p>With natural sympathy and warmth, film-maker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carol-morley">Carol Morley</a> has created this likable, generous, imaginative response to the work of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/20/carol-morley-discovers-amazing-life-of-artist-audrey-amiss">the neglected English artist Audrey Amiss</a>, played here with beady-eyed gusto by Monica Dolan. And if the movie finally has a bit of a soft centre, then this is partly because of Morley’s refusal to fetishise the supposedly transfigurative pain of mental illness. <br /><br />Sunderland-born Amiss trained as a painter at the Royal Academy in the 1950s, had a breakdown and was in and out of institutions for the rest of her life, finally taking a secretarial job but restlessly creating unsold and unseen art, in the form of raw impressionistic sketches of her daily existence and an autofictional collage-journal of found objects – packaging, flyers, leaflets – to which she added stream-of-consciousness diary entries, a continuously updated real-time manuscript record of a hidden life. It is held in an archive at the Wellcome Library in London, which Morley was the first to examine (biographers will surely come later). She discovered Amiss’s passport with its scribbled entry under Occupation: “Typist Artist Pirate King”.</p><p><br />In some ways, this is like Morley’s 2011 documentary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/15/dreams-of-a-life-film-review">Dreams of a Life</a>, which sought to reconstruct the life of a mysterious forgotten woman who left no direct testimony after her tragic death. Here, Morley has a huge amount of archive material to draw on, but has chosen instead to springboard an imagined narrative from just a few telling details: an old-fashioned road movie.<br /><br />Dolan plays Amiss in a chaotic London flat, twitching and flinching with a kind of hypervigilant defiant unhappiness, always suspecting conspiracies against her, brooding over the past. Kelly Macdonald plays an imaginary social worker Sandra who comes once a fortnight to endure a nonstop barrage of abuse from Amiss. Cantankerous and impossible and entirely ungrateful, Amiss demands that Sandra drive her to a “local” art gallery advertised in the paper where she is sure she can finally get exhibited. Against her better judgment, Sandra agrees, with Audrey revealing no address but airily assuring Sandra that she will give directions. It is only after they have been on the road awhile that Audrey reveals she means “local” in the sense of local to where was born: they are driving to Sunderland for a great reckoning with her childhood and her sister Dorothy (Gina McKee). Sandra has no choice but to agree and to add insult to injury, Audrey nicknames her Sandra Panza.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/08/typist-artist-pirate-king-review-artist-audrey-amiss-carol-morley">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The sponsor of the Science Museum’s climate gallery is part of the controversial Adani conglomerate, writes <strong>Dr Chris Garrard</strong></p><p>Hannah Jane Parkinson’s piece underscores the importance of cultural organisations having effective due diligence processes in place to “know your donor”, a key fundraising principle set out by the Charity Commission (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/28/art-galleries-sackler-gambling">First Sackler, now Bet365. The art world can’t keep taking money from companies that do us harm, 28 February</a>). Right now, the Science Museum is facing the risks of having not given this principle enough consideration, after it was recently revealed that the sponsor of its climate gallery – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/science-museum-chooses-fossil-fuel-company-as-new-climate-show-sponsor">Adani Green Energy</a>, part of the controversial Adani conglomerate – had been used by the parent company as a way to generate investment for its coalmining projects.</p><p>There are significant funding pressures across the arts, but we need to discriminate between private donations that are genuinely philanthropic, and the money paid by the Sackler family or a fossil fuel company such as BP, which is clearly a transaction undertaken with the aim of enhancing their reputations. Furthermore, an unethical sponsor with an image problem is much more likely to target its payments on the larger and better funded institutions, where their association with the arts will gain greater public profile, than community-based organisations that are struggling to make ends meet. When many of these smaller organisations are taking on the difficult ethical questions associated with their collections, programmes and sources of funding, it is disappointing that institutions that should be offering an example of best practice – such as the British Museum and Science Museum – continue to lag behind.<br /><strong>Dr Chris Garrard</strong><br /><em>Co-director, Culture Unstained</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/08/museums-must-take-more-care-with-their-donors">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sunak was thrilled to get the opportunity to cosplay the hard man in front of his own MPs as he defended his immigration bill</p><p>Appearances can be deceptive. When Rishi Sunak became prime minister last October he presented himself as a break from the past. Gone was the small island populism. Gone were the lies and half truths. Here was a moderate man who could be trusted not to crash the economy. A cosmopolitan politician who could be trusted not to embarrass us all on the global stage. A leader who might even occasionally put country before party.</p><p>Five months on and Rish! looks more and more to be the continuity candidate. A third-rate, ineffectual rent-a-gob who is most at home in the Tory echo chamber. Oblivious both to reality and his own failures. Weirdly, Conservative MPs love the new Sunak. They don’t want to face hard truths. That they are comfortably on course to lose the next election, leaving many of them out of a job. That their policies are failing. Have failed. That voters have finally run out of patience. After 13 years of Conservative government, no one can think of anything that works better than it did in 2010.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/08/rent-a-gob-rish-plays-to-the-tory-echo-chamber">Continue reading...</a>

## Scream VI review – Ghostface takes Manhattan in standout slasher sequel

<p>There’s plenty of fun to be had in a gorier and smarter follow-up to last year’s franchise relauncher</p><p>There’s a moment in the uncommonly good slasher sequel Scream VI when Hayden Panettiere’s returning fan favourite character says she died for four minutes after being stabbed in 2011’s fourth instalment. That film, now viewed as a rather under-appreciated entry, killed the franchise for far longer, positioned as the start of a new trilogy but instead stopping the series for over a decade, its wounding box office proving far harder to heal.</p><p>But easy access to the series via streaming and an increased appetite for the horror genre led to a hyped resurrection and last year’s simply titled Scream became a surprise hit, re-engaging the OG 90s kids while also inspiring a legion of new bloodthirsty fans. As a legacy sequel it was only half-successful, juggling the old and the new with shaky hands, but it was good enough in a landscape where that’s <em>more</em> than enough, and cautious intrigue awaited wherever the franchise might go next.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/08/scream-6-review-ghostface-manhattan-horror-sequel">Continue reading...</a>

They tell us a fair amount about him and his vanity. He has a laser-like focus on claiming credit. “I CALLED FOR THIS TWO MONTHS AGO,” he writes in shouty caps, to an aide, about the plan to cut the approval time for a vaccine. “This is a Hancock triumph.” His tone is jokey and casual, his response to criticism querulous and brittle. “What a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are,” Hancock texts, to which the then education secretary, Gavin Williamson, replies: “I know they really really do just hate work.” Hancock replies with two laughing emojis and a bullseye. They do not sound remotely like government ministers making high-stakes decisions: they sound like the thick two out of The Inbetweeners, moaning about their head of year and backslapping each other for their bons mots.</p><p>Hancock has a pretty high tolerance for situations that should have been intolerable to a health secretary: the “eat out to help out” policy, for example, was thought to have been driving infections – but not to worry, because he’d <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/03/matt-hancock-rishi-sunak-eat-out-to-help-out-whatsapp-messages">“kept it out of the news”</a>.

For most people, it was unnecessary detail added to one of the most nauseating moments in modern politics. But for Dan Douglas, a 39-year-old from London, it served as artistic inspiration.</p><p>“It reminded me of a map from a video game,” he says. As a 90s teenager, Douglas had adored the first-person shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/434050/">Duke Nukem 3D</a>. “I was the perfect age for its relentless pixelated gore and crude humour. Playing it felt almost illicit,” he says. So wouldn’t it be fun, he thought, to re-create the Hancock scandal using that game’s built-in level editor? That should get a few laughs <a href="https://twitter.com/dandouglas">on Twitter</a>, he reasoned.

I knew the basics and had check-ups regularly, but instead of learning how to live with it, it was always a matter of mitigating side-effects. When I was 15, a doctor asked why I was still menstruating and prescribed birth control to take continuously to stop it, but I chose not to use it. However, as time went by, I decided to “solve” that problem. It’s been nearly 15 years since I had a period without any influence from pills or a hormonal IUD.</p><p>Nowadays information is more available than ever. We have apps to track our cycles, we see athletes speaking openly about it – a few months ago, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/16/lets-talk-about-periods-how-research-and-apps-help-female-footballers">we discussed it with Beth England</a>.

## ‘For now, music is a weapon’: the Ukrainian musicians playing on as an act of resistance

<p>Whether as simple consolation, celebration or to gird nerves for battle, musicians in Kyiv have found an important role in the war. Six of them tell us how they fight</p><p>At first glance, Kyiv looks and feels relatively normal. One year on from the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the streets, bars and restaurants once again bustle with people going about their lives. Look a little closer however, and it becomes clear how completely transformative and tragic the war has been. Bombed-out Russian tanks, missile ravaged skyscrapers, checkpoints, sandbags and tank-traps all scar the city. Life plays out to the daily wailing drone of the air raid sirens, bouncing off buildings. Worse is the constant fear for loved ones fighting further east on the frontline. People dread their phones pinging with more bad news.</p><p>It is hard to imagine living in such circumstances but for many, solace has been found in music. Despite the war – in fact, because of it – Ukraine’s cultural scene is fizzing with artists who have turned to music for comfort and resolve in the darkest of moments. They are using music to steel their souls, assert their identity and inspire opposition to the invasion. At a time of unimaginable fear and suffering, the musicians of Ukraine have decided that playing and listening to music is an act of resistance. Six of them – from orchestras to punk bands and radio broadcasters – tell their stories.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/08/for-now-music-is-a-weapon-the-ukrainian-musicians-playing-on-as-an-act-of-resistance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Grumpy coach Harrelson trains a team of teens with learning disabilities in this remake of the Spanish film Campeones </p><p>This big-hearted underdog sports comedy runs on rails, with no great surprises, but it’s likable. It’s the story of Marcus (Woody Harrelson), a washed-up, grumpy basketball coach with a booze problem who gets busted for drunk driving: the judge sentences him to 90 days’ community service coaching a basketball team of teens with learning disabilities.</p><p>It’s a remake of a Spanish film called Campeones and inspired by a true story from Spain, but the fact that this film is directed by the broad comedy maestro Bobby Farrelly might remind you of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/24/9">The Ringer</a>, the Johnny Knoxville comedy from 2005 that Farrelly produced with his brother Peter. The Ringer had Knoxville pretending to have a mental disability to compete in the Special Olympics. That film toyed with some grossout bad taste before the inevitable segue to sentimental maturity. Champions doesn’t go anywhere near that kind of laugh-at irony, despite a few initial gags in which Marcus is unsure of what to say instead of the R-word.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/08/champions-review-woody-harrelson-goes-for-slam-dunk-in-likable-basketball-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The best retellings of these archetypal stories can restore a childlike wonder – and offer startling new reflections of the world we live in now</p><p>Recasting a fairytale is like shattering an old mirror. In hammering at the tale’s surface, in picking up the splinters and reconfiguring them, riveting new reflections of our own era appear. “You shift time and location,” author Helen Oyeyemi says of her reconfigured fairytales, “to see what holds true, and why or why not.” Contemporary retellings provide another deep pleasure, of revisiting one’s childhood mind, flickers of that brighter, less inhibited self before the dimming constraints of adulthood.</p><p>My new novel, <a href="https://dauntbookspublishing.co.uk/book/take-what-you-need/">Take What You Need</a>, revealed itself early on to be a fairytale. It is about polarisation and it’s possible that any art imagining a dissolving of cultural divides, even in small ways, is a fairytale too. Take What You Need takes place in a former steel town like the one where I grew up. A stepmother estranged from her adult daughter begins to weld metal sculptures and memorise lines from Louise Bourgeois. The stepmother brings in a ladder and her sculptures get taller. They become towers covered with bits of mirror in which her estranged daughter eventually comes to recognise her own face.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/08/top-10-retold-fairytales-idra-novey">Continue reading...</a>

Instead, esports professionals have been despairing over the games that have been included. Instead of selecting well-established esports titles – the kind played in stadiums and whose top players earn six- or seven-figure prizes – the Olympics esports series has picked ones based, sometimes loosely, on real-world sports. Instead of Dota 2, Counter-Strike, Hearthstone, Valorant or Overwatch, there will be a free-to-play archery game called Tic Tac Bow, Just Dance, the VR motion-tracking game Virtual Taekwondo, and Gran Turismo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/08/pushing-buttons-olympic-games-esports-competition">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A fascinating study of the fraught relationship between human beings and our feathered friends</p><p>Taking a numerical approach to the natural world – as in Simon Barnes’s History of the World in 100 Plants, for example – is a handy way to carve off a manageable slice from a potential plethora of examples. There are, for instance, nearly 10,000 bird species worldwide. In his new book, naturalist Stephen Moss wisely chooses just 10, but in doing so tells the story of the long relationship between birds and humanity – and it has mostly been a disastrous one.</p><p>Egrets, for instance, were hunted almost to extinction for their snow-white feathers, or aigrettes, which became the accessory of choice for wealthy women. During the first three months of 1885, 750,000 skins of little and snowy egrets were auctioned in London. In China, Mao Tse-Tung ordered the mass extermination of sparrows as part of a campaign against the Four Pests (the other targets were rats, flies and mosquitos). Some 1bn birds were slaughtered – one boy became a national hero for single-handedly strangling 20,000 sparrows with his bare hands. This led to their near extinction and contributed indirectly to the Great Famine that killed between 15 and 55 million people, since the sparrows were no longer available to prey on the insects that ruined crops.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/08/ten-birds-that-changed-the-world-by-stephen-moss-review-on-a-wing-and-a-prayer">Continue reading...</a>

## Why The Banshees of Inishiren should win best picture

<p>Martin McDonagh’s well-crafted tragicomedy says something original about our relationships with ourselves. His characters are outlandish but relatable</p><p>There’s something about The Banshees of Inisherin that feels a bit unreal. Maybe not just something; a lot, perhaps all of it. It starts from the moment you see dull old Padraic marching across the green hills of his unspoilt home with an enormously gormless look on his face. From that point, you know something is up.</p><p>Pádraic is played by Colin Farrell, someone who can try to cover himself in as many layers of tediousness as he likes but will still exude hot sex. The backdrop, too, an Ireland that may never have existed and certainly annoys some who live in the actual version, is just too bucolic for its own good. Every single Inisherian, meanwhile, appears to be both dumb as a rock and possessed of lightning-quick wit. And that’s before we get to the bloke who is so desperate to be left alone to the play the fiddle that he starts hacking off his playing fingers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/08/why-the-banshees-of-inisherin-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was great for a while. Then people started finding their ‘host’ was a lettings agency, and communities weren’t keen on guests</p><p>In the US, the canary in the coalmine may turn out to have been the Super Bowl last month, when the confluence of the biggest game in American football, a huge international golf tournament and annual spring training should have brought a windfall to the landlords of Phoenix, Arizona. Unlike some cities – notably, Barcelona and Los Angeles – that have introduced measures to curb the growth of short-term rentals, in Phoenix there are few restrictions. And so, in February, hosts of Airbnb, Vrbo and similar properties-for-let companies stood by for a bonanza, hiking prices to an average of $1,000 a night. And then they waited. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/realestate/phoenix-rentals-airbnb-super-bowl.html">And waited.</a></p><p>I remember the promise of early stays at Airbnbs. It seemed like such a win, a wild combination of more space for less money, deeper engagement with a local community and, by circumventing hotel chains, the obscure but unavoidable sense present at the start of so much disruptive technology, that you were getting one over the Man. If you were travelling with kids, the mere presence of a <em>kitchen</em> made Airbnb properties seem like a dream. And look, here came a nice host to tell you which local diner to eat at.

<p>There are sloppy geezerisms, flat-pack tough talk and an overexplaining narration that kneecaps the tension in Patrick McKnight’s dud crime thriller</p><p>‘How someone can inflict such sadistic brutality on another is beyond me.” So says Dublin ganglord Valentino “Val” Fagan (Rob McCarthy) when one of his underlings is raped – but it’s rich coming from someone seen executing his own men, dousing innocent security personnel in petrol and slapping his wife. But Patrick McKnight’s crime thriller isn’t overburdened in the self-awareness department – it’s too busy trying to romanticise the Irish capital as a tempestuous urban battlefield of cops and robbers. But with its flat-pack tough talk and wine bar decor, it winds up more like a Premier Inn-grade travesty of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/17/heat-crime">Heat</a>.</p><p>Val is in a spot of bother: his Amsterdam partners, the Corrigan brothers, have lost a large transatlantic drug shipment, so they are rattling the can among their associates to buy in an even bigger one. Asked to pony up €1m, Val asks right-hand man Renno (Liam Griffin) to come up with a way to bust into a secure facility holding stacks of ATM cash. But the gardaí, led by DI Delahunt (Pauline O’Driscoll), have already got the crazy wall mapping his outfit and are working their way to the top, beginning with one of Val’s street-level goons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/08/the-irish-mob-review-cat-and-mouse-with-the-gardai-in-knock-off-gangster-flick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With sold-out club nights from Bristol to Birmingham, a long-marginalised subculture is enjoying a brilliant post-pandemic resurgence</p><p>I am at a dinner table in south London, in the middle of which sit ceremonially placed items evoking butch culture: a carabiner, a sex harness and an edition of Quim – a lesbian erotic magazine from the late 80s and 90s. It is a Saturday evening in mid-February, and also eating bowls of dal around me are nine regulars from Bristol Butch Bar, set up last spring as a hub for the city’s butch community: among them lesbians, bisexuals, transgender people and non-binary people. I’ve joined them on a “field trip” to the club night Butch, Please! Between us, we have shaved heads, corduroy, jeans, vests, chain necklaces, black trousers, statement shirts and leather.</p><p>The butch identity seems to be having a moment. Tonight’s event, as normal, is sold out. “I see about 1,000 people come through a month now – there’s just huge demand for this space,” says Tabs Benjamin, who set up <a href="https://www.instagram.com/butchpleaselondon/">Butch, Please!</a> at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in 2016. Nights are themed, often with a nod to queer history. This evening there’s a handkerchief code: a discreet way of signalling sexual orientation used by gay men in the 70s who would stuff coloured handkerchiefs in their back pockets.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/08/tell-me-about-it-stud-the-rapturous-return-of-the-butch-lesbian-scene">Continue reading...</a>

Once the storm has passed, six-year-old Denny Wallace is missing from his parents’ smallholding. Has he strayed into the bush or been snatched by someone? Word of Denny’s disappearance spreads from house to house and, as it does so, McFarlane carries us off on a whirlwind tour of this fictional colonial outpost.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/08/the-sun-walks-down-by-fiona-mcfarlane-review-the-lost-boy">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I was the Spotify of the 1980s!’ The Italian pirate mixtape empire that brought pop to the people

<p>Started from an illegal market stall, Mixed By Erry became Italy’s third biggest record label – until police cracked down. A new film asks whether the founders were heroes or criminals</p><p>In 90s Italy, the ultimate seal of approval on a tape wasn’t that of a cutting-edge record label or a stickered quote from a tastemaker publication: it was the varsity-style, hand-printed banner that read “Mixed by Erry”. It adorned everything from regional rap records to collections of Gregorian chants and birdsong, and the fact that it was far from legal was no deterrent – not for customers, nor even the musicians that the lord of Italy’s pirate cassette business was ripping off.</p><p>Enrico Frattasio created the pirate mixtape label in the early 1980s, selling his tapes to<strong> </strong>illegal stallholders in his working-class neighbourhood in Naples, which they flogged alongside bootlegged cigarettes. By the late 80s, Erry had spread throughout Italy and beyond, to Romania and Hong Kong. At its peak, the Mixed by Erry group employed 100 people – including Enrico’s brothers, Claudio, Peppe and Angelo – with an annual gross of around £4m in today’s money.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/08/i-was-the-spotify-of-the-1980s-the-italian-pirate-mixtape-empire-that-brought-pop-to-the-people">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former Manchester City manager will renew acquaintances with United when he leads out Real Betis in the Europa League</p><p>“It was tackles and muddy pitches and heads crashing together,” Manuel Pellegrini says. “And that’s the football that fans like.” The first time he came to England was to complete his coaching qualification; it would need 15 years for him to return, taking on the man who had taught him then, and 26 to win the league there; now he’s there again for a night, back to the country where it all began and one of the nine cities across five countries and three continents he has made home since leaving Santiago. Thirty-five years have passed, much has changed, but don’t bet on this being the last.</p><p>The Real Betis manager hasn’t come to reminisce, although the memories are fond, if some a little fuzzy, and being 69 doesn’t mean stopping.

## The Patriarchs by Angela Saini review – the roots of male domination

<p>A scientific and historical survey of patriarchy shows that there’s nothing inevitable about it</p><p>Are men and women naturally different, and do the roles socially assigned to us proceed from those differences? Refreshingly, science journalist and broadcaster Angela Saini begins her stirring interrogation of patriarchy by arguing that it is neither constant, inevitable nor unshakeable. “By thinking about gendered inequality as rooted in something unalterable within us, we fail to see it for what it is,” she writes, “something more fragile that has had to be constantly remade and reasserted.”</p><p>Anthropologists, political theorists, feminists and, importantly, patriarchs themselves have often reached across time and space to look for the origins of sex and gender division. In 1680, Sir Robert Filmer’s Patriarcha invoked ancient and biblical authorities as evidence that patriarchy (with the divine right of kings at its head) was natural and ordered by God. Even when later revolutionaries rejected the idea of a king as the head of a nation-family, they were reluctant to let go of elite male power. Thomas Jefferson wrote, creepily, that “the tender breasts of ladies were not formed for political convulsion”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/08/the-patriarchs-by-angela-saini-review-the-roots-of-male-domination">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The UK’s already woeful nursery provision is getting even worse, and that hurts everyone, from parents and children to the wider economy</p><p>Last month, my daughter got the flu. Days bled into miserable weeks of cancelled work and missed nursery as the virus hopped from her to my husband to me; a groundhog day fever dream of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/21/the-10-best-bluey-episodes-for-both-kids-and-parents-sorted">Bluey</a>, Calpol syringes and animal crackers. Financially, it was just as ruinous. Patchy earnings, alongside the nursery fees we paid despite her being unable to attend, left us at least £700 in the red – for the second time in three months (in December, three weeks of unexplained fever culminated in my daughter’s eardrum exploding; a relief for all of us).</p><p>Those calculations may look stark on the page, but working families are now being expected to swallow gargantuan losses like this on a month-to-month basis. Britain’s nursery fees are some of the most expensive in the world: a full-time place for a child under the age of two costs on average <a href="https://www.daynurseries.co.uk/advice/childcare-costs-how-much-do-you-pay-in-the-uk#:~:text=A%20full%2Dtime%20(50%20hours,%C2%A314%2C000%20in%20the%20UK.&amp;text=Parents%20can%20expect%20to%20pay,for%20a%20child%20aged%20two.">more than £14,000 a year</a> in the UK (in London, it’s at least £19,000 a year).

<p>An elderly couple staying in the UK were due to travel to Odesa to inspect bomb damage at their house. But then a catalogue of blunders began</p><p><strong>Last December, two elderly Ukrainian refugees who I am supporting had to fly back to their home in </strong><strong>Odesa</strong><strong> to collect medicines they cannot get in the UK, and to sort out bomb damage to their property. They used </strong><strong>Opodo</strong><strong> to book a return flight to </strong><strong>Chisinau</strong><strong> with Austrian Airlines. When they arrived at Heathrow, they were informed that the promised automatic check-in had not been successful and they would have to go to the check-in desk. There they were told that, despite having been issued with boarding passes, there were no tickets in their name. Airport staff spent three hours on the phone trying to sort something out, but with no success.</strong></p><p><strong>They were then stuck because of heavy snow and train strikes and had to spend two nights in a London hotel. They eventually returned to their host’s home by coach via Brighton two days later. There was no word from Opodo, apart from two automated emails telling them it was</strong><strong> in the process of cancelling their booking. I have called Opodo every day since early January. It has so far only repaid half the £370 fare and says it is waiting for Austrian Airlines to return the rest. It blames the airline for the failed booking. Austrian Airlines say it is Opodo’s fault because it did not issue the tickets. The couple are pensioners and war refugees and they have been left distressed and out of pocket.<br /></strong><em><strong>AD, </strong></em><em><strong>Heathfield, East Sussex</strong></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/mar/08/opodo-and-austrian-airlines-wrecked-ukrainian-refugees-journey-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Low-budget take on the evergreen tale already feels overshadowed by the grand French retelling due next door</p><p>This British stab at the deathless Dumas novel refuses to heed its own running gag: always run in the face of overwhelming odds. In this case it’s the imminent arrival of a star-bejewelled, two-part French adaptation with Vincent Cassel, Eva Green, Romain Duris and Vicky Krieps. Instead, it puts up a valiant stand – led by pretty plush production and costume design for what is presumably a low-budget affair. But finally it waves its colours in surrender, let down by patchy acting and unimaginative direction.</p><p>It at least boasts one first: a black D’Artagnan (Malachi Pullar-Latchman). Whatever your stance on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/13/how-heathcliff-got-a-racelift">“racelifting”</a>, in this instance it works pretty well: emphasising the would-be musketeer’s outsider but upwardly mobile status as he arrives in Paris, and lines up back-to-back duels with Athos (Ben Freeman), Porthos (David O’Mahony) and Aramis (Jake J Meniani).

## What fresh misogynist hell is this? Why a new ‘maid’ cafe is causing a ruckus | Arwa Mahdawi

<p>I assumed an establishment where young women dress as maids and perform submissively would be a den of depravity. The truth may be more complicated</p><p>Let’s play a quick round of a game I just invented called Is This Perverted and Misogynistic Or Is This Fine, Actually? The subject is an eatery in Manchester called Animaid that describes itself as “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/animaid.cafe/?hl=en">the UK’s only maid cafe</a>.” What’s a maid cafe? Well, if you want to read various academic studies dissecting the phenomenon, they’re available on Google – but the quick and dirty version is that they’re cafes that feature waitresses dressed up like maids, in exaggerated uniforms, who interact with customers in character, sometimes calling them “master”. They’ve been around <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272119432_Maid_Cafes_The_Affect_of_Fictional_Characters_in_Akihabara_Japan">since the 1990s in Japan</a> and were inspired by dating simulation video games. While they initially catered to male nerds (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/26/ryan-cleary-lulzsec-otaku">“otaku”</a>, as they’re known in Japan), they have become <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-03-16/maid-cafes-arent-just-for-male-otaku-anymore/.183120">more mainstream</a>.</p><p>Young women performing exaggerated submissiveness? I mean … it kinda screams Perverted and Misogynistic to me. And I’m not the only one getting those vibes. The Animaid cafe caused quite a stir online after a <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/uk-maid-caf-where-customers-224403101.html">local councillor saw</a> its “no touching” policy displayed in the window and tweeted: “What fresh hell is this in Manchester?” Vigorous discussion ensued and Graham Linehan, once known as the creator of Father Ted and now known for his obsession with transgender people, dubbed it “<a href="https://twitter.com/Glinner/status/1619321585688788992?s=20">a Hooters for incels”</a>. Which, credit where it’s due, is a nice turn of phrase. But I’ve always thought the Hooters for incels was just called Hooters.</p><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>On international women’s day, we celebrate the grassroots groups giving women the confidence to enjoy the great outdoors</p><p>It was a little after midnight when I heard footsteps approaching my bivvy bag. Normally when wild camping, a sound like this would cause me to sink further into my sleeping bag, hoping I wouldn’t be seen. Yet that night, sleeping on a hillside on the western escarpment of the Chilterns in Buckinghamshire, there was no need – or indeed chance – to remain hidden. I was surrounded by six other women in bivvies, giving a whole new meaning to the phrase “girl’s night out”.</p><p>As an adventurer and ardent solo wild camper, I have for more than 15 years been voluntarily plunging myself into the wilderness – in the UK and overseas – alone. I have never needed company on adventures. I’m not afraid of the dark, or worried about going for a pee in the middle of the night. Sleeping out solo doesn’t scare me. But wild camping in a group – especially a group of other women – terrified me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/mar/08/rise-of-all-women-outdoor-activity-groups-hiking-paddleboarding-camping">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The tutor on my exercise science course pointed me towards literature, and I began to read voraciously. It was the start of a love affair that led to my first novel</p><p>Mid-2012, I was trying to read a book on the physiological and biological changes that occur when a person begins training, and I was failing. I had passed my level 3 qualification for personal training and fitness instructing some years before and was trying to get ahead of my colleagues by going further than the qualification required.</p><p>I wasn’t doing very well and was explaining this to my cousin, who was now my client – we spoke during most of our training sessions to extend his rest periods. It was during one of these interludes that he started going on about the benefits of university and how well he was doing. He was 19 and I was 23. My only thought while he was talking was how smart he must be, and how much I enjoyed talking to people who were at university.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/08/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-was-a-personal-trainer-then-my-teenage-cousin-pushed-me-to-go-to-university">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Friends are essential to our health and happiness, and even affect how long we live. But how do you keep a relationship alive when you are living in different places and can barely make time for yourself?</p><p>Trish and Mick started chatting about music on a staircase in 1970, when Trish and her flatmates (“strange, slightly hippy people,” Mick laughs) were trying to stop a neighbour’s party guests, including Mick, from getting into their flat. Julia and Susan found friendship when they became neighbours at the age of seven. Susan’s parents disapproved of Julia’s single mother’s lifestyle and forbade them to meet: “We developed a system of sound signals, found a place to hide notes to each other and met secretly in the local park,” Susan says. Ian and Roger bicker gently over which was the first Nottingham gig where they shared a bill in 1965, but say that Roger persuaded their bands (<a href="https://bigsixties.blogspot.com/2020/01/tony-d-and-shakeouts.html" title="">Tony D and the Shakeouts</a> for Ian; <a href="https://dungeonmods.wordpress.com/tag/sons-of-adam/" title="">The Sons of Adam</a> for Roger) to jam together on stage.</p><p>Friendships start with these accidents – choosing a locker at school, who’s in the next room in your hall of residence, or attending the same protest – but staying friends over a lifetime can’t be accidental. “Friendships are a voluntary type of relationship,” says Mahzad Hojjat, a professor of psychology and friendship researcher at the University of Massachusetts<strong>-</strong>Dartmouth. “In some ways they are the weakest tie, because you could just disconnect.” What stops friends from doing this? As <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/chinese-b2295363.html" title="">new research shows that socialising</a> helps people to live longer, I spoke to friendship lifers who have stayed close over decades of good and bad times and everything in between. Are there any secrets, and do they have advice for the rest of us?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/08/it-feels-unconditional-the-secrets-of-lifelong-friendships-according-to-lifelong-friends">Continue reading...</a>

<p>US news report suggests pro-Ukrainian group carried out Nord Stream attack; Ukraine names unarmed prisoner of war shot in video</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>It will be an “open road” for Russian troops to capture cities in Ukraine should they seize control of Bakhmut,</strong> Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned in an interview with CNN. “This is tactical for us, we understand that after Bakhmut they could go further,” said Ukraine’s president. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister told regional media on Tuesday that fewer than 4,000 civilians, including 38 children, remained in Bakhmut. The city, the focus of fierce fighting in the Donbas region, had an estimated prewar population of about 70,000.</p><p><strong>Russia has sustained “20,000 to 30,000 casualties’’ – killed and wounded – in trying to capture the city, </strong>western officials estimated at a briefing on Tuesday. While no firm figure was offered for Ukrainian losses, the official said it was “significantly less”. Ukraine’s defence of Bakhmut is forcing Russia to engage in a costly battle for a city that “isn’t intrinsically important operationally or strategically”, according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War.</p><p><strong>Intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022,</strong> the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/nord-stream-pipeline-sabotage-ukraine.html">New York Times has reported</a>. There was no evidence Zelenskiy or his top lieutenants were involved, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials, said the report, citing US officials.</p><p><strong>Russia said media reports about Nord Stream underscored the need to answer Moscow’s questions about what happened.</strong> Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said those responsible for leaks to the media wanted to divert the public’s attention and avoid a proper investigation.</p><p><strong>Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the Ukrainian Presidency, said 130 prisoners of war had been returned home in an exchange.</strong> Russia’s ministry of defence said 90 prisoners of war had been returned by Ukraine.</p><p><strong>A court in Moscow has jailed a student</strong> <strong>activist for eight and a half years for social media posts criticising Russia’s war in Ukraine. </strong>Dmitry Ivanov was convicted on Tuesday of spreading false information about the Russian army, AP reported.</p><p><strong>Ukraine has named the unarmed prisoner of war who appeared to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers</strong>, as the president delivered an overnight message resolving to “find the murderers”. In the graphic 12-second clip that first circulated on Telegram on Monday, a detained combatant, named by the Ukrainian military as Tymofiy Mykolayovych Shadura, is seen standing in a shallow trench smoking a cigarette before apparently being shot with automatic weapons.</p><p><strong>Ukraine has started talks with partners on extending the Black Sea grain initiative aimed at ensuring Kyiv can keep shipping grain to global markets,</strong> a senior Ukrainian government source has said.<strong> </strong>The source said Ukraine had not held discussions with Russia, which blockaded Ukrainian Black Sea ports after its invasion last year, but that it was Kyiv’s understanding that its partners were talking to Moscow.</p><p><strong>Belarus detained on Tuesday what it said was a Ukrainian “terrorist group” working with Kyiv’s intelligence services to carry out sabotage at a Belarusian airfield.</strong> Belarusian anti-government activists said last month they had blown up a sophisticated Russian military surveillance aircraft in a drone attack at an airfield near the Belarusian capital, Minsk, a claim disputed by Moscow and Minsk. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has denied Kyiv was involved.</p><p><strong>China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, has said China must strengthen its relationship with Russia in the face of continued hostility from the US.</strong> In a fiery press conference, his first appearance as foreign minister, Qin outlined China’s foreign policy agenda for the coming years, presenting its relationship with Russia as a beacon of strength and stability, and the US and its allies as a source of tension and conflict.</p><p><strong>A 14-year-old Ukrainian girl who died after she was found unconscious on a beach in south Devon on Saturday has been named as Albina Yevko</strong>. The teenager was found on Dawlish town beach, near where she was living, on Saturday evening after a search involving a police helicopter and the coastguard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-378-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
