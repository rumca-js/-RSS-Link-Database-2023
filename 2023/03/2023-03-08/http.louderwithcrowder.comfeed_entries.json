So, DeSantis had to bring the receipts. The pornographic receipts, to be exact. </p><p>DeSantis's office released a very graphic video today that showed some of the books his administration so cruelly banned from being seen by kindergarteners.

Forty-five minutes before his <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/spirit-airlines-brawl\" target=\"_blank\">flight</a>, he cancels the two refundable tickets so he can have the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/american-airlines-woman-complains\" target=\"_blank\">whole row </a>to himself.

As you can probably guess, it's Rumble. </p><p>Crowder explained that Rumble became the show's safety after YouTube censorship continued to ramp up. Four days a week, the daily show will be on Rumble for an hour to an hour and a half. There will now be an added Friday show, as well as a few new hosts and comedians, including Bryan Callen and our very own Gerald Morgan Jr. </p><p>Crowder also explained that Rumble has never asked them to modify the show's content in any way or demand an exorbitant amount of live reads. Plus, they want to be a space for <em>all</em> voices, not just conservatives. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble\">\n\n</p><p>Brand and Crowder also discussed ideas they agree on. One thing <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/russell-brand-joe-rogan-pills\" target=\"_blank\">Brand</a> brought up was his disdain for the condescension and authoritative position taken by centralized media organizations. Crowder then brought up how Dr. Anthony Fauci also exercised authoritative power that he did not deserve. But ultimately, the biggest enemy is Big Tech. </p><p>Crowder went on to explain that he isn't trying to get banned from YouTube. The problem with YouTube is the necessity of being advertiser friendly, which acts as a form of censorship. Ultimately, they're benefitting from Section 230 and acting as both a platform and a publisher. And just about no one is trying to stop them. </p><p>There's a lot more Crowder and Brand got to, including how Crowder got his start as a child voice actor in Arthur, and who his role models were in the political and comedy spheres. You don't want to miss it, so be sure to tune in for the whole episode.  And of course, get ready for March 20th, when the show will make its glorious return on Rumble. Here we go. </p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/steven-crowder-mugclub-rumble", "date_published": "2023-03-08 11:44:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Crowder announces MugClub's new home...powered by Rumble", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=33228023&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C2\" /><br /><br /><p>It\u2019s official.

It is bigger, it is better, it is more affordable, it will include MORE content than ever AND it\u2019s powered by Rumble! More on that in a second.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">It\u2019s official\u2026 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rumblevideo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@rumblevideo</a> is the new home for Mug Club. <a href=\"https://t.co/5UAJzdKdhc\">pic.twitter.com/5UAJzdKdhc</a><br />\u2014 Steven Crowder (@scrowder) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scrowder/status/1633290721863032834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Did I mention that the annual price <a href=\"http://louderwithcrowder.com/MugClub\" target=\"_blank\">has been lowered from $99 to $89</a>?<br /></p><p>Oh, and we\u2019ll be producing approximately double the content (including an exclusive Friday show for members). </p><p>What I\u2019m most excited about in partnering (key word being \u201cPARTNERING\u201d) with Rumble is that for the first time, a company with the capabilities to do so, truly has all of our backs in the fight for free speech against BigTech. And by \u201cour\u201d I mean \u201cyours, mine and ours.\u201d Our goal has never been to be suspended from YouTube or any other like-minded, leftist platforms\u2026 but we can\u2019t be beholden to them. In order to serve you and our country, we need to be able to speak the truth and accept the consequences. Our new full-time partnership with Rumble will allow exactly that, without risking the loss of our platforms permanently. </p><p>The entire team appreciates your loyalty, support, and most of all, patience throughout this entire ordeal. Me, most of all.</p><p>Hold onto your butts. It\u2019s all gas, no breaks starting March 20th!</p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/crowder-mugclub-powered-rumble", "date_published": "2023-03-08 02:14:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
