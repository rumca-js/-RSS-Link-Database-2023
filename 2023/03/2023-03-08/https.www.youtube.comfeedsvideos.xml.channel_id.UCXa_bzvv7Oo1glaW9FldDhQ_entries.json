Surprisingly not because of its gameplay (of which little was seen), but due to the sheer number of big-name Hollywood actors attached. \n\nReleasing on March 29th for PC via the Epic Games Store, we've since learned many more details about this co-op multiplayer shooter. Let's go over 15 of them here.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNq2nlus1Ow", "date_published": "2023-03-08 15:30:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "9 GRAPHICALLY STUNNING Video Game Levels That Blew Us Away [4K]", "description": "Video games are arguably the best form of art, on account of them being able to transport players to magical places that blur the lines between imagination and reality. \n\nTechnology has enabled developers to craft wondrous worlds with striking levels of detail, and when that technology combines with great art direction we get imaginary worlds that are simply unforgettable. Gamers have been treated to many such levels, and we will look at a few such examples today.\n\nPart 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_fvjzdFCNs", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8ntURV0VZI", "date_published": "2023-03-08 13:30:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Fatal Frame / Project Zero: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "Don't get me wrong,\u00a0FATAL FRAME / PROJECT ZERO: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\u00a0is still a game that I'd recommend to fans of the horror genre, and\u00a0especially\u00a0to fans of the series. Those looking for good scares and palpable atmosphere will find them in abundance here, and the fact that this is the first time the game has released in the West is also significant, making it much easier to recommend for those who haven't played it. \n\nBut above all else, what this remaster proves most through its deficiencies is that a new, modern\u00a0Fatal Frame\u00a0game that irons out the clunkiness and hones in on the series' biggest strengths could easily go toe to toe with the genre's biggest giants. Hopefully, Koei Tecmo will find enough success with its recent\u00a0Fatal Frame\u00a0re-releases that it decides that it's finally time to develop a full-fledged new entry in the series. Until that happens though, this will do well enough.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEfL0ly73GA", "date_published": "2023-03-08 13:00:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
