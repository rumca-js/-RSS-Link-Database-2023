Having performed in intimate venues including homes and cabins, as well as stages, being at the Tiny Desk may have felt right at home for the Canadian duo. Lisa Maria Bates and Amy Lou Keeler make powerful songs with haunting harmonies and a mesh of fiddle, banjo, mandolin and guitar. You\u2019ll hear unique rhythms as Amy takes her chopsticks to Lisa\u2019s fiddle and Lisa takes her heels to the floorboard.\n\nElements of Appalachian folk, Celtic ballads, Nova Scotian traditions and Ukrainian folk from Lisa\u2019s grandfather\u2019s collection are woven into the duo\u2019s music. The frantic pace of touring came to a halt for Amy and Lisa when the COVID pandemic started, like it did for much of the world, and they had some time to write tunes and try out new tunings. The opening song, written in Lisa\u2019s uninsulated Nova Scotia cabin in the throes of the first pandemic winter, is filled with poignant resignation.\n\nJust pick one, it\u2019ll hurt some if it needs to \nI know weakness is a sickness and a virtue\nAnd cold bitter winds are never-ending\nSo just pick one, it\u2019s a season, it\u2019ll run through\n\nThe songs come from Mama\u2019s Broke\u2019s new album, Narrow Line, and its2017 debut, Count The Wicked. There are moments of hope in this set of somewhat dark songs: \u201cWhat Can May Come\u201d is one of those moments, and also, in the final tune \u201cThe Ones That I Love,\u201d where Amy and Lisa put down their instruments and send love through those perfect harmonies. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cJust Pick One\u201d\n\u201cWrecking Need\u201d\n\u201cWhat Can May Come\u201d\n\u201cEven Though\u201d\n\u201cThe Ones That I Love\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nLisa Maria Bates: vocals, fiddle, foot board, mandolin\nAmy Lou Keeler:  vocals, guitar, banjo, fiddlesticks\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Alex Drewenskus\nAudio Mix: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Josephine Nyouani\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Kara Frame, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galvan\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #mamasbroke", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeFcUbGW1gA", "date_published": "2023-03-08 14:51:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
