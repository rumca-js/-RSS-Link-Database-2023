The company isn't completely ignoring cloud gaming, but it's now relegating itself to support. As the firm's Jack Buser tells <em>Axios</em> in an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/03/08/google-stadia-live-service-games\">interview</a>, the focus now is on supporting others' <em>Destiny</em>-style live service games by providing a server platform, data management and analytics. Developers may not need to invest as much in online infrastructure, or worry about scaling as their player bases grow. Niantic, Ubisoft and Unity are among the existing customers.</p><p>The Immersive Stream shutdown isn't surprising. While it didn't require Stadia's heavily subscription-driven model it suffered from the same limitations as many game streaming services. You needed a fast, stable internet connection, and you still had to contend with increased lag and reduced visual quality compared to a locally-stored game. That limited the appeal, particularly for gamers with sufficiently powerful PCs and consoles.</p><p>At the same time, the closure limits the industry's choices. There's no longer a true turnkey cloud gaming option. Companies either have to build their own platforms or bring their games to existing services like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-ge-force-now-ultimate-hands-on-the-enthusiasts-choice-for-cloud-gaming-specs-release-140035365.html\">GeForce Now</a>. As such, it might be a while before you see more AT&amp;T- or Capcom-style forays.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-stadia-shutdown-also-killed-its-white-label-game-streaming-offering-223135946.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/googles-stadia-shutdown-also-killed-its-white-label-game-streaming-offering-223135946.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-08 22:31:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Microsoft Edge can now use AMD and NVIDIA GPUs to upscale web videos", "description": "<p>NVIDIA video card owners already have the luxury of video upscaling in Chrome or Edge, but what if you have an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-7900-xtx-xt-review-better-4k-gaming-140002305.html\">AMD board</a>? Microsoft thinks it can help. It's <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2023/03/08/video-super-resolution-in-microsoft-edge/\">testing</a> a Video Super Resolution feature in Edge Canary that upscales and removes artifacts on web videos below 720p using both AMD- and NVIDIA-powered GPUs (sorry, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/intel-arc-a750-a770-review-mid-range-gpu-rivals-nvidia-amd-130032507.html\">Intel Arc</a> fans). You'll need at least a GeForce RTX 20 series or Radeon RX5700, but this could help if you're watching an ancient YouTube video or want to save bandwidth on a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/comcast-data-caps-northeast-indefinite-delay-000739663.html\">capped data plan</a>.</p><p>There are some conditions. This is only for Windows users, for a start. You have to plug in if you're using a laptop, and the video can't use a digital rights management (DRM) system like PlayReady or Widevine. At present, you'll also have to force Edge to use your dedicated GPU if your laptop has a hybrid graphics setup. Automatic hybrid video support is in development, Microsoft says.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The technology relies on GPU-agnostic algorithms. Microsoft had to add a DirectX 12 pipeline to Google's Chromium engine (which normally uses DirectX 11) so that its machine learning framework can interact with the browser. Compression helps keep the computational load relatively light.</p><p>Video Super Resolution is only available to a handful of Edge Canary users at the moment, but should come to more users in the &quot;coming weeks,&quot; the company adds. It also plans to widen the list of supported GPUs, so don't be disheartened if your hardware isn't initially compatible. Just be patient if you aren't willing to use experimental software \u2014 it'll likely take a while before betas and polished versions support the feature.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-can-now-use-amd-and-nvidia-gpus-to-upscale-web-videos-202557842.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-can-now-use-amd-and-nvidia-gpus-to-upscale-web-videos-202557842.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-08 20:25:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sony's concerned Call of Duty will be worse on PlayStation if Microsoft buys Activision", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/sony/\">Sony</a> has laid out more concerns about Microsoft's planned takeover of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/activision-blizzard/\">Activision Blizzard</a> in its latest response to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Sony has opposed the deal from the start. Now, it's suggesting that Microsoft could (perhaps unintentionally) kneecap the performance and quality of Call of Duty on PlayStation, which might result in fans switching to Xbox.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a> might release a PlayStation version of Call of Duty where bugs and errors emerge only on the game\u2019s final level or after later updates,&quot; the letter (<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64086532d3bf7f557532cefc/2023-03-07_Microsoft-Activision_-_SIE_Observations_on_Remedies_Notice__Revised_NCV__redacted.pdf\"><ins>PDF</ins></a>) reads. &quot;Even if such degradations could be swiftly detected, any remedy would likely come too late, by which time the gaming community would have lost confidence in PlayStation as a go-to venue to play Call of Duty. Indeed, <a href=\"https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modern-warfare-ii-crosses-1-billion-sell-through-10-days-fastest\">as <em>Modern Warfare II</em> attests</a>, Call of Duty is most often purchased in just the first few weeks of release. If it became known that the game\u2019s performance on PlayStation was worse than on Xbox, Call of Duty gamers could decide to switch to Xbox, for fear of playing their favourite game at a second-class or less competitive venue.&quot;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Sony claims there wouldn't be a viable way for it or the CMA to assess how &quot;Microsoft chooses to allocate its resources and the quality/quantity of engineers it devotes to the PlayStation version of Call of Duty to ensure that SIE would be treated fairly and equally.&quot; Degrading the quality of Call of Duty on PlayStation, intentionally or not, perhaps wouldn't be the wisest course of action, as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630700/sony-microsoft-call-of-duty-sabotage-cma-documents-activision-deal\"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>points out. A buggy Call of Duty release on PlayStation would probably lead to a bigger backlash against Microsoft and Activision than Sony.</p><p>In any case, Microsoft noted in its latest response to the CMA (<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64088cf9d3bf7f25f61ff804/Microsoft.Activision_-_Response_to_Remedies_Notice_-_NCV__2_.pdf\">PDF</a>) that it has offered to &quot;provide Sony with parity on release date, content, features, upgrades, quality and playability with the Xbox platform.&quot; That is, if Sony accepts Microsoft's proposed 10-year agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation. Microsoft would be willing to agree to a third-party assessor to oversee the platform parity.</p><p>Sony's letter reiterates its concern that Microsoft would make Call of Duty a Game Pass exclusive and away from PlayStation. Again, that's something Microsoft has refuted. \u201cAs we have said all along: it makes zero business sense to take Call of Duty off of PlayStation,\u201d Microsoft Competition Law Group corporate vice president Rima Alaily recently told <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/03/06/microsoft-key-call-of-duty-sony-uk-cma\"><em><ins>Axios</ins></em></a>.</p><p>It will be a while yet before we know for sure whether Microsoft will be allowed to buy Activision Blizzard. The CMA is set to make a final ruling on the deal by April 26th. It has millions of Microsoft and Activision documents, and thousands of emails from the public to take into account, according to Sony. The CMA <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uks-competition-watchdog-says-microsofts-activision-merge-could-harm-uk-gamers-132410352.html\">raised concerns</a> about the deal in February, suggesting it could &quot;harm UK gamers&quot; and lead to a &quot;substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles.&quot;</p><p>Other major regulators have yet to rubberstamp the takeover, including in the US, where the Federal Trade Commission has <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html\"><ins>attempted to block it</ins></a>. However, reports suggest the European Union is set to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-activision-blizzard-purchase-will-reportedly-be-approved-by-the-eu-174012371.html\"><ins>give the merger the green light</ins></a> following news that Microsoft will bring Call of Duty and other games to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-makes-its-10-year-call-of-duty-pact-with-nintendo-official-091655095.html\">Nintendo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-putting-xbox-games-on-geforce-now-in-an-attempt-to-win-over-regulators-184818183.html\"><ins>GeForce Now platforms</ins></a>.</p><p>In case you're wondering, Microsoft's letter details how Activision would get Call of Duty games to run on Nintendo Switch, which is much less powerful than PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It would do so &quot;by optimizing the display resolution, in-game texture resolution, reducing the rendering speed (i.e., frames per second) and simplifying advanced rendering techniques (e.g., raytracing, shadow, lighting and antialiasing techniques).&quot; In other words, it'd make the game look and run worse than on other systems.</p><p>In the meantime, it seems Call of Duty fans have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-warzone-godzilla-vs-kong-crossover-194022250.html\">another bizarre crossover</a> coming their way soon.

The retooled Pi7 also packs in adaptive active noise cancellation (ANC) and a case capable audio retransmission to set itself apart from the new Pi5. However, the S2 variants of the company\u2019s high-end model are considerably more expensive than the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html\">best wireless earbuds</a> we\u2019ve reviewed and they lack polish in several key areas.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>Bowers &amp; Wilkins didn\u2019t reinvent the wheel when it came to the design of the Pi7 S2. The company stuck with the overall look from 2021\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-wilkins-pi-7-pi-5-premium-true-wireless-earphones-080322096.html\">Pi7</a>, but it did change up the colors. Like the previous model, this IP54-rated S2 version comes in black and white options, but the previously copper-hued components are now silver. That change is primarily to the round exterior panel where the company\u2019s branding and touch controls reside. There\u2019s also a new third color \u2013 dark blue \u2013 which has gold accents. Bowers &amp; Wilkins calls it Midnight Blue, but in person it\u2019s more purple than blue to me.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>All told, the Pi7 and Pi7 S2 have a unique shape that\u2019s a flat oval with a circular touch panel on top. They aren\u2019t the most comfortable earbuds to wear for long periods of time, but they stay in place when you move around. In terms of on-board controls, basic playback functions are here and they\u2019re mirrored on both sides. A long press on the right side will summon your voice assistant, while doing the same on the left cycles between ANC and off. The Pi7 S2 does remember if you had the earbuds set to regular noise cancellation or the company\u2019s auto-adjusting option. However, there\u2019s no way to trigger transparency mode on the earbuds themselves and there\u2019s no option for volume controls. Both are pretty big omissions for a $400 set.</p><h2>Software and features</h2><figure><img alt=\"Bowers &amp; Wilkins once again delivers the outstanding audio quality we\u2019ve come to expect from the company, but the Pi7 S2 is far from perfect.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/262b3413-bdd6-11ed-a8b4-6f185d367f64\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Like recent Bowers &amp; Wilkins headphones, the Pi7 S2 settings are accessible inside the company\u2019s Music app. Here, you can select your noise cancellation mode (on, auto or off), activate passthrough (transparency mode), manage connections (multipoint available for two devices), disable the wear sensor (automatic pausing) and determine streaming quality. The main view for the Pi7 S2 also displays battery life for the earbuds and the case separately, but you only get one number for the buds \u2013 not an individual percentage for each one. The app also lets you connect a handful of music services to use the software as your media player. Qobuz, Tidal, Deezer, TuneIn, SoundCloud and NTS are the supported options here.</p><p>And that\u2019s really it. There\u2019s no option to adjust EQ to select from presets the company made for the Pi7 S2. Even with its recent headphones, Bowers &amp; Wilkins included treble and bass sliders so you could make adjustments. Sure, the changes from those controls are basic and fairly subtle, but the option is there. You also can\u2019t switch up the on-board controls, like reassigning the long press action. Which means you\u2019re stuck with the left side cycling between ANC on or off, with no quick access to transparency mode.</p><p>One feature that sets the Pi7 S2 apart from much of the competition is its wireless transmission case. You can take the included USB-C to 3.5mm cable and use the earbuds with devices where a straight Bluetooth connection isn\u2019t possible \u2013 like an in-flight entertainment system. All you have to do is plug the cable into both the case and the other device and the earbuds will automatically connect. The charging/pairing indicator on the outside of the case will slowly blink white when everything is in sync. Bowers &amp; Wilkins <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/polys-voyager-free-60-might-be-the-coolest-earbuds-for-work-yet-130016200.html\">isn\u2019t the only company to offer this</a> and it included the tool on the Pi7 too. However, the feature is far from commonplace at this point though it is popping up more frequently on new models.</p><h2>Sound quality</h2><figure><img alt=\"Bowers &amp; Wilkins once again delivers the outstanding audio quality we\u2019ve come to expect from the company, but the Pi7 S2 is far from perfect.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/262c93a0-bdd6-11ed-bddf-0bebda51569a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Bowers &amp; Wilkins\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2-review-170001854.html\">Px7 S2</a> headphones were some of the best we reviewed last year in terms of pure sound quality. The company took things a step further with its high-end <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html\">Px8</a>, continuing its track record of well-balanced tuning with outstanding clarity and detail. While the Pi7 S2 aren\u2019t quite on par with the company\u2019s headphones, the overall audio here is still very good. I wouldn\u2019t put these earbuds ahead of Sennheiser\u2019s premium true wireless option, but Bowers &amp; Wilkins isn\u2019t far off. In fact, when it comes to reproducing subtle details, I\u2019d argue the Pi7 S2 is slightly better than the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-earbuds-announced-220016884.html\">Momentum 3</a> \u2013 but only on that one specific criteria.</p><p>The stunning detail is apparent when you listen to Makaya McCraven\u2019s <em>In These Times </em>and other jazz albums. Ditto for multi-instrumental bluegrass. These genres showcase what the Pi7 S2 is capable of when it comes to clarity and subtlety. In the case of McCraven, it\u2019s not <em>just </em>a kick drum, you can hear the nuance that this is that trademark, kind of muffled bass drum that\u2019s a mainstay of the musical style. Horns float on top of everything else when they\u2019re present, giving the instrumental tracks a vocal cadence even when there isn\u2019t one.</p><p>More chaotic genres like hard rock and metal are a mixed bag. Some tracks are open, airy and bombastic while others come across slightly muffled and subdued. There\u2019s ample bass throughout though, which means the kick drum is tight and punchy no matter the rest. When it comes to hip hop and electronic music \u2013 anything with a constant, driving bass line \u2013 the Pi7 S2 does better. More specifically, these earbuds are among the few that allow you to almost feel the low-end tone in a rap track when it hits <em>that </em>certain frequency. Earl Sweatshirt\u2019s <em>SICK! </em>exhibits this quality well. For synth-heavy styles, like Sylvan Esso\u2019s electro-pop <em>No Rules Sandy</em>, the Pi7 S2 perfectly captures the oscillation in Nick Sanborn\u2019s composition on songs like \u201cEcho Party.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of finer synthesizer work here and the Pi7 S2 doesn\u2019t miss a single detail.</p><p>One area where the Pi7 S2 is just OK is canceling out noise. The earbuds do an admirable job in most scenarios, combatting constant annoying sounds that could otherwise hinder productivity. Like many sets of true wireless buds, these aren\u2019t the best with human voices and other sounds will occasionally pierce through. The Auto noise canceling setting does improve ANC performance over the default \u201con'' option, but the Pi7 S2 is nowhere close to what <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html\">Sony</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-2-review-130026306.html\">Bose</a> and others at the top of the heap can muster. And, again, when you\u2019re evaluating a set of $400 earbuds, adequate just isn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>In terms of call quality, the Pi7 S2 is a capable option. They\u2019re not the absolute best, and they don\u2019t handle background noise well, but the earbuds won\u2019t leave you sounding like you\u2019re on speaker phone, which is the case with most of the competition. You\u2019ll definitely want to activate transparency mode here, even though that setting isn\u2019t as natural-sounding as it is on Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro and others. Bowers &amp; Wilkins allows you to hear what\u2019s going on around you, so you won\u2019t feel the need to shout to hear yourself. However, the earbuds don\u2019t feed your voice back through, so it\u2019s not nearly the pristine experience as using the AirPods Pro or AirPods Max for calls.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><figure><img alt=\"Bowers &amp; Wilkins once again delivers the outstanding audio quality we\u2019ve come to expect from the company, but the Pi7 S2 is far from perfect.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/262c6c90-bdd6-11ed-93fb-19757bf1270d\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Bowers &amp; Wilkins promises up to five hours of battery life on a charge on the Pi7 S2, up from four hours on the Pi7. You\u2019ll also get an additional 16 hours in the case and the ability to charge wirelessly. During my tests, I was able to hit this mark reliably with ANC on even though the company\u2019s estimate is based on it being turned off. However, unlike recent Bowers &amp; Wilkins headphones I\u2019ve tested, the Pi7 S2 didn\u2019t surpass the stated figures. The company has also included a quick-charge feature that will give you two hours of use in 15 minutes.</p><p>Five hours is significantly less than much of the competition. Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM4, for example, clocks in at eight hours with active noise cancellation. For a set of $400 earbuds, I\u2019d expect at least that much or more.</p><h2>The competition</h2><p>Despite being nearly two years old, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html\">Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM4</a> are still the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html\">best true wireless earbuds</a> you can buy right now. Simply put, no other company comes close to offering the truckload of features Sony has crammed into its premium buds. On top of great sound quality and capable noise cancellation, the M4 can automatically pause when you start talking, is equipped with a quick attention mode and can change sound settings based on your activity or location. Currently $278, they\u2019re a huge savings over the Pi7 S2 and you can typically catch them on sale for even less.</p><p>In terms of pure sound performance, the closest competition to the Pi7 S2 is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-earbuds-announced-220016884.html\">Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 3</a>. They\u2019re available for half of what you\u2019ll pay for the latest Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium earbuds, the audio quality is very good and they  pack in more battery life than the Pi7 S2 \u2013 seven hours on the earbuds with three full charges in the case. If you\u2019re looking for the best noise-canceling chops, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-2-review-130026306.html\">Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Earbuds II</a> should be considered. They\u2019re $100 less than the Pi7 S2 and do a much better job of blocking out distractions.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=\"Bowers &amp; Wilkins once again delivers the outstanding audio quality we\u2019ve come to expect from the company, but the Pi7 S2 is far from perfect.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/262ba940-bdd6-11ed-bfd5-98671ace7d8b\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Bowers &amp; Wilkins has established itself as one of the best audio companies in terms of pure audio performance.

While the overall sound quality is great, these earbuds fall short in terms of battery life, customization and ANC performance. Bowers &amp; Wilkins\u2019 ability to consistently deliver pristine sound isn\u2019t enough to make up for what the Pi7 S2 lacks, which is unfortunately quite a bit.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-pi7-s2-review-excellent-sound-only-goes-so-far-200024887.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-pi7-s2-review-excellent-sound-only-goes-so-far-200024887.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-08 20:00:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "'Call of Duty: Mobile' will likely be phased out in favor of 'Warzone Mobile'", "description": "<p>The Microsoft-Activision Blizzard saga is still trundling on.

After announcing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-canvas-loops-tiktok-feed-clone-131103707.html\">a beta test</a> last year, Spotify will begin rolling out <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-03-08/spotify-previews-clips-music-podcasts-audiobooks-home-feed/\">a new design</a> for the Home section of its mobile app with a &quot;more visual, dynamic&quot; look. The company says the visual feeds are &quot;built for deeper discovery and more meaningful connections between artists and fans.&quot;</p><p>Music, Podcasts and Audiobooks sections will also give you the ability to &quot;scroll purposefully&quot; through the new feeds where Spotify will offer audio and video clips for you to preview. If you find something you want to hear in its entirety, there are options to save, share, preview multiple songs (playlists or albums), read episode transcriptions and watch video podcasts. These visual feeds will also be in the Search interface, where you can scroll through clips arranged by genre. Additionally, Spotify says it will put the visual content inside of its curated playlists like Discover Weekly, Release Radar, New Music Friday and Rap Caviar. The company sees this as a way to offer previews for songs in those collections before you hit play. Unlike some of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-is-testing-a-tik-tok-style-vertical-feed-called-discover-103009169.html\">the early tests</a>, Spotify hasn't added a fourth button to the app's navigation bar for these newly scrollable feeds.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>For the Music tab, users in the US and Canada will see <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotifys-new-ai-dj-will-talk-you-through-its-recommendations-140052560.html\">Spotify's AI DJ</a> just below the collection of eight personalized shortcuts. When you begin to scroll, the app will serve up audio and visual snippets of a song (you can watch muted if you prefer). From here, you can preview up to five different songs from an album or playlist by tapping on the cards \u2014 much like you would for Instagram Stories. Spotify will also give you some brief context as to why you're seeing these recommendations.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Spotify redesign\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/f0c2e410-bdc3-11ed-9ff7-af99c323577b\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Spotify</div></figure><p>For the Podcasts section, you'll still see those eight shortcuts up top while the rest of the feed will preview selected shows for you. Each recommendation will have an audio sample and real-time transcription or a video clip if the show was recorded in that format. If you want to continue listening, you'll have the option of picking up at the part you previewed or starting from the beginning. Spotify says the Audiobook feed will function much like the Podcast previews.&nbsp;</p><p>Spotify is also renaming its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-enhance-playlist-song-suggestions-180749023.html\">Enhance</a> tool that debuted in 2021. Now called Smart Shuffle, the feature not only adds suggestions to playlists &quot;that perfectly match the vibe,&quot; it also mixes up the order. You can activate it by double tapping on the shuffle icon. When you've done so you'll notice a shuffle icon with a star in the top left and any track that is added by suggestion will be highlighted in the list. You can quickly remove all of the app's recommendations by tapping on the Smart Shuffle button once more, reverting the playlist back to your carefully constructed collection.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the company is adding auto play for podcasts to its app. Just like it does for music, Spotify will give you the ability to automatically begin &quot;another relevant episode&quot; based on what you were listening to. Also like it does for music, the company is giving you the ability to turn auto play off, so when your podcast ends you can enjoy the silence.&nbsp;</p><p>Spotify says some of these new features will be available today, while others will debut in the coming months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-debuts-its-tiktok-style-music-discovery-feed-183359654.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/spotify-debuts-its-tiktok-style-music-discovery-feed-183359654.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-08 18:33:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Microsoft 365 will soon have an accessibility assistant", "description": "<p>This year's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/\"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> Ability Summit is underway and the company has revealed its latest advancements for accessibility and disability inclusion.

Combined with autonomous robotics, the construction process theoretically leads to fewer parts, a more reliable design, cheaper launches and quick assembly times. Relativity claims it can build a Terran 1 from raw materials within 60 days, and even an exclusive mission costs <em>just</em> $12 million. The combination of liquid oxygen and liquid natural gas for propulsion also helps with long-term reusability efforts. It can carry up to 1,250kg (2,756lbs) into low Earth orbit, and 700kg (1,543lbs) to a high-altitude mission.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"ef7babc77823464aba0941c4be8df964\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Relativity is small compared to private spaceflight rivals like Blue Origin, SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (ULA), but has enjoyed rapid growth and privileged access since Tim Ellis and Jordan Noone founded it in 2015. The company had received over $1.3 billion in funding as of June 2021. Ellis, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-21-vp-mike-pence-space-council-commercial-interests.html\">got a seat</a> on the National Space Council's Users Advisory Group in 2018. It was the fourth company to receive access to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-17-relativity-cape-canaveral-air-force-launch-complex-16.html\">Cape Canaveral's Launch Complex 16</a> following Blue Origin, SpaceX and ULA.</p><p>Terran 1 is an expendable rocket. If the launch is successful, though, it will pave the way for a reusable medium-duty Terran R rocket slated to reach orbit no earlier than 2024. The new vehicle is poised to carry the first commercial mission to Mars (Impulse Space's Mars Cruise Vehicle and Mars Lander) and will shoulder nearly 20 times the payload of Terran 1. Relativity already has contracts for other Terran R missions, including the deployment of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/space-oneweb-agreement-220556058.html\">OneWeb's</a> second-generation internet satellites. Eventually, Relativity foresees its rockets using methane on Mars for interplanetary missions.&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge, of course, is that other companies aren't standing still. NASA recently chose Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-blue-origin-new-glenn-escapade-science-mission-mars-110049165.html\">fly science payloads to Mars</a>, and SpaceX has long-term visions of using its Starship rocket <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spacex-plans-floating-spaceports-230144280.html\">for Mars missions</a>.

It\u2019s a showcase of a lot of eye-catching phones and devices that often don\u2019t make it to America, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t look on in envy or use this as a possible preview of the technology that will shape future phones in the US.</p><p>One of the first foldables we saw out of MWC was Oppo\u2019s Find N2 Flip. This thing is basically the Chinese company\u2019s version of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip 4, except its external screen is in portrait instead of landscape orientation. It\u2019s currently the largest cover screen on a flip-style foldable, at 3.26 inches. This makes the Find N2 Flip easier to use when framing up selfies with the device closed and, thanks to its size, allows for more lines of messages to be read.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Oddly, though, the home screen here doesn\u2019t take advantage of the larger canvas and its clock widget actually uses a smaller font than the Galaxy Z Flip 4. The company did take pains to emphasize that the crease on the Find N2 Flip\u2019s screen is 65 percent less visible than the last generation. According to Engadget UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith, though, you can still see the little wrinkle, so \u2026 [[shrug]]</p><p>For those of us in the US, this comparison is more of a theoretical exercise since the Oppo phone won\u2019t be available stateside, retailing only in Europe and China. If you still want more details on this device, make sure to check out <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n2-flip-hands-on-fixing-the-foldables-shortcomings-150021728.html\">Mat\u2019s hands-on</a>.</p><div id=\"937e34c2794f4c57af1a45fc49949054\"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This week, we also learned that Honor\u2019s Magic VS is coming to more parts of the world. Specifically, it\u2019ll be <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic-vs-europe-price-availability-133824755.html\">coming to Europe for 1,599 Euros</a>, or about $1,690. This is the first time since we saw a prototype in December that the company is sharing availability info outside of China.</p><p>The Magic VS is similar to Samsung\u2019s <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sHcU3PHxmYEtKYjUN_nVxg9XLu8e56xQ\">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, which is to say that it is a regular-sized smartphone that opens up to become a roughly 8-inch tablet. It\u2019s not a brand new product at MWC, but it\u2019s nice to see more information about more foldable phones giving Samsung some competition in the space.</p><p>It\u2019s not just Oppo and Honor ramping up the competition, either. Relatively lesser known phone maker Tecno <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tecno-phantom-v-fold-pricing-availability-mwc-2023-174526995.html\">showed up at MWC with the Phantom V Fold</a> \u2014 a more affordable foldable with fairly impressive specs. The Phantom V Fold has a 7.85-inch screen on the inside with the company touting a \u201cvirtually crease-free\u201d display like Oppo did.&nbsp;</p><p>Senior editor Richard Lai said that at the right angle, the wrinkle is certainly not obvious and it\u2019s better than Samsung\u2019s, but he added that it\u2019s still not as subtle as the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mix-fold-2-leica-pricing-availability-124434422.html\">Xiaomi Mix Fold 2</a>. On the outside, the Phantom has a 6.42-inch Full HD panel, as well as a round camera hump housing a triple-sensor imaging system. The main and telephoto cameras are 50-megapixels, while the ultra-wide setup is 13MP. There\u2019s also a pair of punch-hole cameras on the two screens.</p><figure><img alt=\"Tecno Phantom V Fold\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/47476fe0-b789-11ed-b78d-6e010897e3bc\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Phantom V Fold is powered by the same MediaTek Dimensity 9000+ processor as the one in the Oppo Find N2 Flip, and for the base model that comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, the company is charging $1,099. Compared to the Samsung and Oppo versions of tablet-sized foldables, that\u2019s hundreds of dollars less. But again, as with so many products that were announced at MWC this year, the Phantom V Fold will not be coming to the US. It\u2019ll be available to those in India, Latin America and parts of Africa where Tecno is typically active.</p><p>The fact that we\u2019re reaching a point where foldables are starting to get relatively affordable means, unfortunately, that they\u2019re about to become common. And therefore, they\u2019re going to be passe. <em>So 2022</em>. In 2023, the hot buzzword is <em>rollables</em>. At least, based on the concept devices Lenovo and Motorola brought to MWC.</p><p>Lenovo showed off a laptop with a screen that extends upwards and away from the keyboard, and the prototype itself appeared impressively thin and sturdy. Meanwhile, Motorola <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/27/motorolas-rizr-is-back-as-a-concept-phone-with-a-rollable-screen/\">brought back its Rizr concept device</a> and this second version has a 5-inch display that rolls out to hit 6.5 inches when you need a larger canvas for video or a long Best of Redditor Updates post. The device that was shown off in Barcelona appeared to work, but multiple outlets like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/moto-rizr-rollable-phone-shows-why-rollables-dont-work-in-the-real-world/\"><em>ArsTechnica</em></a> and <em>Techcrunch </em>expressed reservations about build quality so\u2026 Don\u2019t be surprised if this format never comes to market.</p><p>It\u2019s not like Motorola and Lenovo are the first companies to try rolling screens, by the way. Far from it. <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15vYbDorUIaLad6eZIO3heTU0Lsk_0INp\">LG</a> and <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MyhuSt_UTD2YewpQbpnchO3_dXh5CNtj\">TCL </a>have made various prototypes showcasing different form factors with flexible, sliding and rolling screens. In fact, LG\u2019s first rolling screens prototypes showed up <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-09-lg-roll-up-tvs-flexible-oled.html\">as far back as CES 2014</a>. It\u2019s clear manufacturers know smartphones have gotten good enough that people don\u2019t want to buy a new one every year or two, and are trying to find a new shape that will entice shoppers this decade. The current camera and software race between Apple, Google and Samsung is starting to induce yawns, and the new features they are adding aren\u2019t particularly exciting.</p><figure><img alt=\"Xiaomi 300W charging demo\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/407ebee0-b723-11ed-b6dd-bd16d50be8e0\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>Other phone makers have spent the last few years focusing on battery and charging tech, and we saw some of that at MWC this year too. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-300w-charging-five-minutes-062341344.html\">Xiaomi</a> showed off a demo of 300-watt charging that could fully charge a device in just 5 minutes.

With the drops in temperature that this should bring, OnePlus could deliver boosts to games by three to four frames per second, as well as saving 30 to 45 seconds of charging time.</p><p>Besides new formats and battery tech, we also saw companies focus on sustainability and repairability. The Nokia G22, for example, is the result of a collaboration between parent company HMD and iFixit, and follows in the footsteps of Apple, Google and Samsung in offering official repair guides and parts. As Right to Repair bills and laws get passed in multiple states in the US and elsewhere in the world, this looks to be a growing trend in mobile phones that can help us be more environmentally conscious.</p><p>There was plenty of other news out of the show, including<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-shows-off-its-new-wireless-ar-glasses-102134685.html\"> Xiaomi\u2019s new concept AR glasses</a>, and you can get all the details <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/mwc%202023/\">here</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-most-interesting-foldables-rollables-and-demos-at-mwc-2023-153042604.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-most-interesting-foldables-rollables-and-demos-at-mwc-2023-153042604.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-08 15:00:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "VW's connected emergency service is free for 5 years after botched carjacking response", "description": "<p>Volkswagen is dealing with one of the risks of tying important car features to paid services.

Instead, think about the phones you\u2019re likely to use down the road. If you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll use iPhones for a long time, a MagSafe charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android or think you might switch sides, however, you\u2019ll want a more universal design.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>You\u2019ll also want something that accepts a variety of device sizes. Certain wireless charging stands don\u2019t work well with the iPhone 13 mini or other particularly small phones, for instance. If you think you may change phone sizes at some point, a pad charger is a wiser choice. With that said, you\u2019ll still want to pay attention to any potentially limiting design features, such as prominent cradles and lips.</p><p>Also, consider wireless chargers with modular components. While you\u2019ll have to invest exclusively in one company\u2019s ecosystem, this gives you room to grow as your device needs change. You can add a charger for a second phone or smartwatch, and some systems even offer modular batteries to supply power on the go. Just be sure to look at a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-multi-device-wireless-chargers-130020900.html\">multi-device charger</a> if there\u2019s a very good chance you\u2019ll expand your setup in the future.</p><h2>Where and how will you use your charger?</h2><figure><img alt=\"iPhone on wireless charger\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c9a24a20-b7a0-11ed-b3cd-16d5d607f8d1\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Pontus Wellgraf on Unsplash</div></figure><p>Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside for quick access in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging. If you intend to place your charger on a nightstand, you\u2019ll usually want a pad. With a stand, even a dim always-on display can prove distracting when you\u2019re trying to sleep. You may also want a wireless charging pad if your phone will sit on a low table, as it might be easier to grab in a rush. Look at compact models if space is tight.</p><p>On your desk, you may prefer a stand to quickly glance at alerts or make video calls. Want something more travel-friendly? A puck or similarly minimalist design is typically best. You may also want a charger with a battery (either modular or built-in) for camping or whenever an outlet isn\u2019t nearby.</p><h2>Performance matters, to a point</h2><p>Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed is still an important consideration. A <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html\">fast charger</a> can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits.</p><p>In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you\u2019ll need a MagSafe charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you\u2019ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you\u2019ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones.</p><p>There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone. Google\u2019s second-generation Pixel Stand, for example, delivers up to 23W for a Pixel 6 Pro or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html\">Pixel 7 Pro</a>. Optimized designs like this can make sense if you\u2019re loyal to one brand. Be sure to get a charger that still works well with other manufacturers\u2019 phones, though, as you don\u2019t want to replace your accessory (or endure sluggish speeds) if you switch brands.</p><h2>Quality, box contents and the little details</h2><figure><img alt=\"iPhone on wireless charging stand\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/50a7df30-b7a1-11ed-bfef-883a433a4df2\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Michael Soledad on Unsplash</div></figure><p>Once you\u2019ve chosen the form factor and performance levels that meet your needs, you\u2019ll want to consider the fit and finish. You\u2019re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in quality could make the difference between joy and frustration.</p><p>If your charger doesn\u2019t use MagSafe, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won\u2019t slide around. If you\u2019re buying a stand, check that it won\u2019t tip over or wobble.</p><p>Pay attention to what\u2019s included in the box. Some models don\u2019t include power adapters, and may even ask you to reuse your phone\u2019s USB cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it. Also, some cables and chargers are better than others. A USB-C charger is more future-proof, while braided cables may be less likely to break or tangle.</p><p>You\u2019ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch.</p><p>By now, you should know what to look for. While it would be impossible for us to test every charger, we\u2019ve tried numerous models and have some favorites.</p><h2>Best overall wireless charging pad: Otterbox OtterSpot Wireless Charging System</h2><p></p><p>There\u2019s no shortage of portable wireless chargers, but it\u2019s rare that you can find one which is as well-suited to your desk as it is your bag. The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=bd89df68-d794-46df-9d47-227b1088ae2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OtterBox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiZDg5ZGY2OC1kNzk0LTQ2ZGYtOWQ0Ny0yMjdiMTA4OGFlMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3R0ZXJib3guY29tL2VuLXVzL290dGVyc3BvdC13aXJlbGVzcy1jaGFyZ2luZy1zeXN0ZW0tYmxhY2svNzgtNTIxNjMuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWZlM2QxZTgtNTVlMS00MGQ1LWE0NjMtMTMzNmRkOTE2ZjE5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAX8k9uEp8X-WmWLKnshIEbdCVEXuiv1J4PCXoOO7cnjo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fotterspot-wireless-charging-system-black%2F78-52163.html\">Otterbox OtterSpot system</a> is our top pick precisely because it\u2019s so versatile. The base unit is stable, includes a power adapter and accommodates a wide range of phone sizes. But it really shines when you want to leave home. You can buy as many as three 5,000mAh portable batteries that optionally stack on top of the base to recharge, and serve as completely wireless chargers on the go. Those batteries can power wired devices through USB-C, too.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the fastest charger given its 10W output, and the base alone is normally expensive at $55 (though it\u2019s down to $38 as we write this). If you want a station you really can use everywhere, though, the OtterSpot is an obvious choice that can grow along with your needs.</p><h2>Runner up wireless charging pad: Belkin BoostCharge Pro Portable Wireless Charger Pad</h2><p></p><p>It\u2019s easy to find wireless charging pucks that are fast or portable, but rarely both \u2014 and certainly not as well-considered as <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e6618fee-bbbf-4638-9bf5-e216442c18d0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Belkin&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlNjYxOGZlZS1iYmJmLTQ2MzgtOWJmNS1lMjE2NDQyYzE4ZDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVsa2luLmNvbS9wb3J0YWJsZS13aXJlbGVzcy1jaGFyZ2VyLXBhZC13aXRoLW9mZmljaWFsLW1hZ3NhZmUtY2hhcmdpbmctMTV3L1AtV0lBMDA0Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFmZTNkMWU4LTU1ZTEtNDBkNS1hNDYzLTEzMzZkZDkxNmYxOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAR1SwMD20XeGVPvHCRBqK7HI_Tge020v6EI1R2OEJa0b&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fportable-wireless-charger-pad-with-official-magsafe-charging-15w%2FP-WIA004.html\">Belkin\u2019s BoostCharge Pro Portable Wireless Charger Pad</a>. Its extremely compact design not only offers 15W MagSafe charging (plus Qi charging when flat), but includes a kickstand that lets you watch videos while you power up. Add a long 6.6ft braided cable and this is an ideal charger whether you\u2019re traveling or catching up on TV shows.</p><p>The emphasis on MagSafe may make the BoostCharge less appealing if you\u2019re an Android user. It\u2019s a definite step up from Apple\u2019s more affordable but simpler MagSafe Charger, however. And importantly, you have the choice of buying Belkin\u2019s accessory with ($80) or without ($60) a power adapter.</p><h2>Best budget wireless charging pad: Anker 315 Wireless Charger</h2><p></p><p>If you just need the basics, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Bbmtlci1XaXJlbGVzcy1DaGFyZ2luZy1Db21wYXRpYmxlLUluY2x1ZGVkL2RwL0IwQjQ2OUhMTkw_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbXctMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFmZTNkMWU4LTU1ZTEtNDBkNS1hNDYzLTEzMzZkZDkxNmYxOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXM1cKAiN5HW9eMUUcGAdwn4Tcym6hSYK7s0ZBVsiNkC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-Wireless-Charging-Compatible-Included%2Fdp%2FB0B469HLNL\">Anker\u2019s 315 Wireless Charger</a> offers significant value from a well-known name. It tops out at 10W (7.5W for iPhones), doesn\u2019t include a power adapter and relies on a microUSB cable, but it also costs only $15. Even if you have to buy an adapter, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a better deal.</p><h2>Best overall wireless charging stand: Belkin BoostCharge 15W Wireless Charging Stand</h2><p></p><p>There\u2019s fierce competition in the wireless charging stand space, and it\u2019s easy to get a good 15W charger if you\u2019re willing to pay. Belkin, however, is one of the few that promises truly solid value.

The lip at the bottom will keep your phone stable, and dual coils let you charge while watching a video in landscape mode.</p><p>There\u2019s no MagSafe or other device-specific charging optimizations on this one. And like many wireless charging stands, this doesn\u2019t officially support the iPhone 13 mini and similarly small handsets. But there\u2019s otherwise little to complain about here \u2014 this is a no-nonsense power solution at a good price.</p><h2>Runner-up wireless charging stand: Spigen ArcField PF2102</h2><p></p><p>There aren\u2019t many great options for wireless chargers that use Samsung\u2019s fast power delivery technology, particularly if you want a stand. Thankfully, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TcGlnZW4tQXJjRmllbGQtV2lyZWxlc3MtRGVzaWduZWQtSW5jbHVkZWQvZHAvQjA5UDhGRFlSOD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1tdy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWZlM2QxZTgtNTVlMS00MGQ1LWE0NjMtMTMzNmRkOTE2ZjE5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAT5dwkcMQscrvTrhGwVZBoHZTHOZNRPcIz0p53QUqe0F&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpigen-ArcField-Wireless-Designed-Included%2Fdp%2FB09P8FDYR8\">Spigen\u2019s ArcField PF2102</a> is up to the job. It delivers 15W to all Galaxy phones that support Super Fast Wireless Charging, and it\u2019s a well-made (if unspectacular) perch that prevents your device from sliding around. The universal form factor works with other phone brands, too.</p><p>You\u2019ll want to shop carefully. Some versions don\u2019t include a power adapter, and some stores sell for less than the official $80. If you can score a good deal, though, this is an ideal way to charge your Galaxy device while providing a clear view of the always-on display.</p><h2>Best budget wireless charging stand: Anker 313 Wireless Charger</h2><p></p><p>Anker\u2019s strong value in pad chargers also applies to stands.

You can buy an adapter and still undercut the price of some equally competent alternatives. It can charge while your phone is in landscape orientation, too. You might want to look at competing products  if they cost under $40 with an adapter included, but the 313 is otherwise difficult to top.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-08 14:15:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Ring\u2019s latest doorbell offers head-to-toe views of your visitor", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-law-enforcement-disclosure-224557384.html\">Ring</a> may boast that it\u2019s good to monitor when visitors and packages arrive at your front door, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to see everything that\u2019s going on.

Those who've already installed <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-update-7-0/\">System Update 7.0</a> can now activate Discord calls on their console, so long as they don't mind setting it up. They'd have to link their PlayStation Network account to Discord to start with, and then they'd have to select Discord under \"Linked Services\" before completing the integration through either a QR code or the PS5 browser. Every time they want to chat with their friends, they'd have to use a mobile device or a PC to transfer a call to the PS5 first.</p><p>The process is a bit involved, but Microsoft made it possible to join Discord calls <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xbox-november-update-discord-twitch-181425153.html\">directly from the Xbox</a> in November last year.

Seeing as Musk seems to be focusing on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-monday-11-per-month-ios-221436172.html\">monetizing Twitter</a> at the moment, and there are barely any employees left at the company, its Tor service may remain unavailable for a long time, if not for good.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tor-service-no-longer-working-063541843.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tor-service-no-longer-working-063541843.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-08 06:35:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
