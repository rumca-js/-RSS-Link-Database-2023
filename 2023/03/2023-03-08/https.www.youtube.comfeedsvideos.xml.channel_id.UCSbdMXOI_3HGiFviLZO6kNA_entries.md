Other than that.. this was a really great week for VR.. We've been having a very rough few months of VR coverage for pretty much everything OTHER than the PSVR2 launching... so hearing all of this positivity is making my heart happy. Population one is going free to play.. with some caveats, some VRChat news, Quest 2 and Quest Pro dropping in price, AND of course the Quest 3 and Meta's future Roadmap are looking incredibly exciting. 

We've got all that and so much more.. I HOPE YOU ENJOY!
