Equity [1] for our cap table management. We were told in writing that it is an annual plan that then goes month-to-month.<p>Fast forward 16 months and we haven't been using it. It's just not that useful of a tool for us, so we are switching to a competitor.<p>The button to change plans in LTSE's dashboard doesn't work, it just shows a spinner. So we contacted support, who insisted on a meeting before cancelling the plan. We said we are not interested in meeting, and now they are saying our plan is annual, and we have 8 months remaining.<p>We plan to file chargebacks as we have in writing that the plan is month-to-month, but I wanted the community to know that LTSE Equity uses dark patterns to avoid cancellation, and is doing business dishonestly in general.<p>[1] https://equity.ltse.com/</p>\n<hr

"Launch HN: Vellum (YC W23) \u2013 Dev Platform for LLM Apps", "description": "<p>Hi HN \u2013 Noa, Akash, and Sidd here. We\u2019re building Vellum (<a href=\"https://www.vellum.ai\">https://www.vellum.ai</a>), a developer platform for building on LLMs like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 and Anthropic\u2019s Claude. We provide tools for efficient prompt engineering, semantic search, performance monitoring, and fine-tuning, helping you bring LLM-powered features from prototype to production.<p>The MLOps industry has matured rapidly for traditional ML (typically open-source models hosted in-house), but companies using LLMs are suffering from a lack of tooling to support things like experimentation, version control, and monitoring. They\u2019re forced to build these tools themselves, taking valuable engineering time away from their core product.<p>There are 4 main pain points. (1) Prompt engineering is tedious and time consuming. People iterate on prompts in playgrounds of individual model providers and store results in spreadsheets or documents. Testing across many test cases is usually not done because of the manual nature of prompt engineering. (2) LLM calls against a corpus of text are not possible without semantic search. Due to limited context windows, any time an LLM has to return factual data from a set of documents, companies need to create embeddings, store them in a vector database and host semantic search models to query for relevant results at runtime; building this infrastructure is complex and time consuming. (3) There is limited observability / monitoring once LLMs are used in production. With no baseline for how something is performing, it\u2019s scary making changes to it for fear of making it worse; and (4) Creating fine-tuned models and re-training them as new data becomes available is rarely done despite the potential gains (higher quality, lower cost, lower latency, more defensibility). Companies don\u2019t usually have the capacity to build the infrastructure for collecting high-quality training data and the automation pipelines used to re-train and evaluate new models.<p>We know these pain points from experience. Sidd and Noa are engineers who worked at Quora and DataRobot building ML tooling. Then the three of us worked together for a couple years at Dover (YC S19), where we built features powered by GPT-3 when it was still in beta. Our first production feature was a job description writer, followed by a personalized recruiting email generator and then a classifier for email responses.<p>We found it was easy enough to prototype, but taking features to production and improving them was a different story. It was a pain to keep track of what prompts we had tried and to monitor how they were performing under real user inputs. We wished we could version control our prompts, roll back, and even A/B test. We found ourselves investing in infrastructure that had nothing to do with our core features (e.g. semantic search). We ended up being scared to change prompts or try different models for fear of breaking existing behavior. As new LLM providers and foundation models were released, we wished we could compare them and use the best tool for the job, but didn\u2019t have the time to evaluate them ourselves. And so on.<p>It\u2019s clear that better tools are required for businesses to adopt LLMs at scale, and we realized we were in a good position to build them, so here we are! Vellum consists of 4 systems to address the pain points mentioned above:<p>(1) Playground\u2014a UI for iterating on prompts side-by-side and validating them against multiple test cases at once. Prompt variants may differ in their text, underlying model, model parameters (e.g. \u201ctemperature\u201d), and even LLM provider. Each run is saved as a history item and has a permanent url that can be shared with teammates.<p>(2) Search\u2014upload a corpus of text (e.g. your company help docs) in our UI (PDF/TXT) and Vellum will convert the text to embeddings and store it in a vector database to be used at run time. While making an LLM call, we inject relevant context from your documents into the query and instruct the LLM to only answer factually using the provided context. This helps prevent hallucination and avoids you having to manage your own embeddings, vector store, and semantic search infra.<p>(3) Manage\u2014a low-latency, high-reliability API wrapper that\u2019s provider-agnostic across OpenAI, Cohere, and Anthropic (with more coming soon). Every request is captured and persisted in one place, providing full observability into what you\u2019re sending these models, what they\u2019re giving back, and their performance. Prompts and model providers can be updated without code changes. You can replay historical requests and version history is maintained. This serves as a data layer for metrics, monitoring, and soon, alerting.<p>(4) Optimize\u2014the data collected in Manage is used to passively build up training data, which can be used to fine-tune your own proprietary models. With enough high quality input/output pairs (minimum 100, but depends on the use case), Vellum can produce fine-tuned models to provide better quality, lower cost or lower latency. If a new model solves a problem better, it can be swapped without code changes.<p>We also offer periodic evaluation against alternative models (i.e. we can see if fine-tuning Curie produces results of comparable quality to Davinci, but at a lower price). Even though OpenAI is the dominant model provider today, we expect there to be many providers with strong foundation models, and in that case model interoperability will be key!<p>Here\u2019s a video demo showcasing Vellum (feel free to watch on 1.5x!): <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/5dbdb8ae87bb4a419ade05d92993e5a0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/5dbdb8ae87bb4a419ade05d92993e5a0</a>.<p>We currently charge a flat monthly platform fee that varies based on the quantity and complexity of your use-cases. In the future, we plan on having more transparent pricing that\u2019s made up of a fixed platform fee + some usage-based component (e.g. number of tokens used or requests made).<p>If you look at our website you\u2019ll notice the dreaded \u201cRequest early access\u201d rather than \u201cTry now\u201d. That\u2019s because the LLM Ops space is evolving extremely quickly right now. To maximize our learning rate, we need to work intensively with a few early customers to help get their AI use cases into production. We\u2019ll invite self-serve signups once that core feature set has stabilized a bit more. In the meantime, if you\u2019re interested in being one of our early customers, we\u2019d love to hear from you and you can request early access here: <a href=\"https://www.vellum.ai/landing-pages/hacker-news\">https://www.vellum.ai/landing-pages/hacker-news</a>.<p>We deeply value the expertise of the HN community!

It is a complete solution that comes with its own backend service, allowing you to instantly share a link of your recording as soon as it is finished. The video is streamed directly to the backend service as the recording happens to make this possible.<p>With both founders based in different countries, we needed a tool to quickly share screen recordings to keep us up to date or to ask for feedback. Meetings are cool if you need to discuss something deeply, but for almost everything else a quick recording works better.<p>We had to settle for one of the proprietary solutions because none of the open source tools allowed us to quickly share something with each other. Doing the recording is one aspect, but having the ability to instantly share a link was crucial. Waiting on a 400mb video upload to a Dropbox is just too much interruption if you want to quickly share something.<p>The tipping point for us to actually build this open source tool came via an interaction from one of our day jobs. A third party provider sent a screen recording full of confidential information and to make things worse, all of it was uploaded by them to a different third party service. We strongly believe that information like this should stay within a company, ideally on infrastructure that they control themselves. Having a fully integrated open source solution is the best way to go for this.<p>Our goal with this first public release is to gather feedback. The critical code paths are working, but it is still a bit rough to use. We deliberately \ncut out all non-essential features, but have a clear roadmap on what we want to release this year.<p>There are a couple of known issues like audio glitches, non-working videos in Safari and crashing binaries that we hope to fix in the coming weeks. Later this \nyear, we plan on releasing a cloud hosted version of Sorbay that would let you connect your own S3 storage provider. Additionally, we will be releasing an on-prem option focused on features for enterprises (SSO, RBAC, compliance).<p>Both the Sorbay Client and the backend service are completely open source. For licensing we choose the AGPLv3 throughout the stack. The client is built \nwith Vue.js on top of Electron. The use of Electron might be a bit controversial here on Hackernews but given the resources we currently have that was \nthe only way that allowed us to get a working client out on all major platforms. The backend service is realized with Django. We use Keycloak for \nauthentication and Minio for S3 compatible storage. All of this is run alongside Postgres and Redis, running on Docker containers which are managed by Docker Compose.<p>We invite you to try Sorbay for yourself and join us on our issue tracker[1][2], Slack channel[3] or here on HN.<p>Thanks for checking out Sorbay!<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay\">https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay-client\">https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay-client</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/slack-oso6527/shared_invite/zt-1qd8gm543-KGdb5gD4WqikZEKEk8sSTA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://join.slack.com/t/slack-oso6527/shared_invite/zt-1qd8...</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35042662\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35042662</a></p>\n<p>Points: 38</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>", "link": "https://sorbay.io/", "date_published": "2023-03-06 16:05:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "The Waluigi Effect: an explanation of bizarre semiotic effects in LLMs", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post\">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35042431\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35042431</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post", "date_published": "2023-03-06 15:50:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Alaska\u2019s Fisheries Are Collapsing", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/03/03/alaskas-fisheries-collapsing-peltola-industry-blame-00066843\">https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/03/03/alaskas-fisheries-collapsing-peltola-industry-blame-00066843</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35042338\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35042338</a></p>\n<p>Points: 20</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/03/03/alaskas-fisheries-collapsing-peltola-industry-blame-00066843", "date_published": "2023-03-06 15:43:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Up to 100x Faster FastAPI with simdjson and io_uring on Linux 5.19", "description": "<p>A few months ago, I benchmarked FastAPI on an i9 MacBook Pro. I couldn't believe my eyes. A primary REST endpoint to `sum` two integers took 6 milliseconds to evaluate. It is okay if you are targeting a server in another city, but it should be less when your client and server apps are running on the same machine.<p>FastAPI would have bottleneck-ed the inference of our lightweight UForm neural networks recently trending on HN under the title \"Beating OpenAI CLIP with 100x less data and compute\". (Thank you all for the kind words!) So I wrote another library.<p>It has been a while since I have written networking libraries, so I was eager to try the newer io_uring networking functionality added by Jens Axboe in kernel 5.19. TLDR: It's excellent! We used pre-registered buffers and re-allocated file descriptors from a managed pool. Some other parts, like multi-shot requests, also look intriguing, but we couldn't see a flawless way to integrate them into UJRPC. Maybe next time.<p>Like a parent with two kids, we tell everyone we love Kernel Bypass and SIMD equally. So I decided to combine the two, potentially implementing one of the fastest implementations of the most straightforward RPC protocol - JSON-RPC. ~~Healthy and Fun~~ Efficient and Simple, what can be better?<p>By now, you may already guess at least one of the dependencies - `simdjson` by Daniel Lemiere, that has become the industry standard. io_uring is generally very fast, even with a single core. Adding more polling threads may only increase congestion. We needed to continue using no more than one thread, but parsing messages may involve more work than just invoking a JSON parser.<p>JSON-RPC is transport agnostic. The incoming requests can be sent over HTTP, pre-pended by rows of headers. Those would have to be POSTs and generally contain Content-Length and Content-Type. There is a SIMD-accelerated library for that as well. It is called `picohttpparser`, uses SSE, and is maintained by H2O.<p>The story doesn't end there. JSON is limited. Passing binary strings is a nightmare. The most common approach is to encode them with base-64. So we took the Turbo-Base64 from the PowTurbo project to decode those binary strings.<p>The core implementation of UJRPC is under 2000 lines of C++. Knowing that those lines connect 3 great libraries with the newest and coolest parts of Linux is enough to put a smile on my face. Most people are more rational, so here is another reason to be cheerful.<p>- FastAPI throughput: 3'184 rps.\n- Python gRPC throughput: 9'849 rps.\n- UJRPC throughput:\n-- Python server with io_uring: 43'000 rps.\n-- C server with POSIX: 79'000 rps.\n-- C server with io_uring: 231'000 rps.<p>Granted, this is yet to be your batteries-included server. It can't balance the load, manage threads, spell S in HTTPS, or call parents when you misbehave in school. But at least part of it you shouldn't expect from a web server.<p>After following the standardization process of executors in C++ for the last N+1 years, we adapted the \"bring your runtime\" and \"bring your thread-pool\" policies. HTTPS support, however, is our next primary objective.<p>---<p>Of course, it is a pre-production project and must have a lot of bugs. Don't hesitate to report them. We have huge plans for this tiny package and will potentially make it the default transport of UKV: <a href=\"https://github.com/unum-cloud/ukv\">https://github.com/unum-cloud/ukv</a></p>\n<hr
