In this episode, we take a look at the Adani vs Hindenburg scandal. What happened, and how could a company lose $130 billion in a matter of days over a few tweets? Was what Hindenburg did legal? In this episode we'll cover all of this. PS: I was sick through half of this recording, so ignore the voice change, I'm only human.
