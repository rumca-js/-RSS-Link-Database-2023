<p>Keanu Reeves is known for playing a deadly killer in the John Wick series, and his reputation helped encourage scientists to name a deadly new bacteria after him.</p><p>Researchers from the Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology discovered a new substance that can help kill fungal diseases and fungi that affect humans. The name? "Keanumycins," which is named after Reeves.</p><p>"The lipopeptides kill so efficiently that we named them after Keanu Reeves because he, too, is extremely deadly in his roles," researcher Sebastian Götze <a href="https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/press-release/keanu-reeves-the-molecule.html">explained.</a></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-now-has-a-fungi-killing-substance-named-after-him/1100-6512086/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Riot Games has introduced Gekko, a new Los Angeles-based Agent for its shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/">Valorant.</a> Gekko is the 22nd playable agent. He has the ability to summon a crew of calamitous creatures that'll hunt down enemies. Gekko's looks are heavily inspired by skater/punk culture, as seen in the trailer, with his skateboard and style of clothes. The minions he can summon even look graffiti-like to help give his character a more East LA look, to reflect his background.</p><div>          </div><p>Gekko has a wide variety of abilities that players can use, such as Dizzy. Gekko will fire Dizzy into the air, and when it's up there, it'll shoot any enemy in its sight, temporarily blinding them. Another of his minions is Wingman. When this ability is activated, he'll shoot Wingman towards enemies, and it'll fire a concussive blast at the first enemy it sees. This ability can also be used to defuse or plant the Spike.</p><p dir="ltr">His other abilities include Mosh Pit, which allows him to throw a Mosh like a grenade, and when it lands, the Mosh will duplicate across the area and then explode. Gekko's final ability, Thrash, lets him link fire with Trash's mind, and when it's activated, it'll lunge forward and explode, detaining any enemies in its radius.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valorant-introduces-gekko-a-new-la-based-agent/1100-6512088/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Tim Schafer Addresses Crunch In Psychonauts Documentary And How He's Working To Prevent It

<p>As part of an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKoy_KMVIyU&amp;ab_channel=DoubleFineProd">IGN</a>'s Rebekah Valentine, legendary game developer Tim Schafer shed some light on the ways he and his team at Double Fine are working to maintain a healthy workplace while also reducing crunch. Schafer is known for transparency, and you can see this on display in the 32-part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKoy_KMVIyU&amp;ab_channel=DoubleFineProd">Psychonauts 2 documentary</a> from 2 Player Productions. This is unusual, given the high degree of secrecy in the video game industry.</p><p>Schafer, best known for his work on The Secret of Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, Psychonauts, and, most recently, Psychonauts 2, wants to make it easier -- and healthier -- for people to make video games. He notes that the documentary's goal is "pulling back the curtain and letting people see that they could probably get a job in games.”</p><p>But making video games is no easy task, and is plagued by crunch, a term used to describe employees working extended overtime in order to meet deadlines. Despite being frowned upon, this practice is common in the video game industry, as many developers work upwards of 80-hour weeks (or more).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tim-schafer-addresses-crunch-in-psychonauts-documentary-and-how-hes-working-to-prevent-it/1100-6512085/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The white-knuckled action roguelike Dead Cells has introduced a bunch of expansions, but none of them have gotten the fanfare of its latest, Return to Castlevania. The new expansion adds biomes, enemies, characters, and weapons modeled by the classic series Castlevania, which developer Motion Twin says was a big influence on its own game. But how exactly to find the new Castlevania content isn't immediately apparent.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers follow.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The level design in Dead Cells is mostly structured, but with some random elements. As you venture through the main quest you'll come across branching paths leading to different biomes. Like the other Dead Cells expansions, the new Castlevania content is integrated into the existing biomes, so you'll have to find the entrances. We say entrances, plural, because the content is spread across at least two separate runs.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-cells-how-to-start-the-castlevania-dlc/1100-6512064/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Troy Baker, who played Joel in The Last of Us video game series, has commented on what it was like to pass the baton, so to speak, to Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel on the HBO series. Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/the-last-of-us-troy-baker-james-david-joel-1235541775/">Variety</a>, Baker said he is a big fan of Pascal and went on to sing his praises.</p><p>"He does this thing where he's so confident in his grasp on the character that it allows him to just sit comfortably in his own conviction," Baker said. "He does everything on a knife's edge. There's nothing that's wild. If you watch all of his choices, [they're] so minimal, and because of that, they're profound. And it makes Joel, in a lot of ways, more dangerous."</p><p>Baker went on to say that Pascal brings a new layer of physicality to the role of Joel that wasn't possible in the video game series. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-joel-actor-troy-baker-discusses-passing-the-baton-to-pedro-pascal/1100-6512081/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After more than 15 years, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi is getting a revival. Announced at the Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2023 event, Bandai Namco's reveal for the game started with a highlight reel of previous games in the series and culminated with a brief glimpse of Dragon Ball protagonist Goku preparing for battle and powering up to Super Saiyan Blue.</p><div>          </div><p>Beyond that, Bandai Namco is keeping a tight lid on any other details, such as release date, platforms, or which one of its studios is handling development duties. While there have been <em>a lot </em>of Dragon Ball Z games over the years, the Budokai Tenkaichi series has been a cult-classic thanks to its intense 3D action gameplay and groundbreaking visuals at the time. Developer Spike Chunsoft was responsible for producing the series, which had infamously stacked and broken rosters, and the first game arrived in 2005 for the PS2.</p><p>Two more sequels would quickly follow, and spin-offs included Ultimate Tenkaichi for Xbox 360 and PS3, Tenkaichi Tag Team for the PlayStation Portable, and even a Kinect game that most Dragon Ball fans would like to forget about. While Dragon Ball fighting games of the 2010s received a more mixed reception, the 2020s have mostly seen a drastic improvement in quality. Dragon Ball FighterZ from Arc System Works is widely regarded as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-the-fast-and-the-furio/1900-6416837/">best fighting game in the entire franchise</a>, while Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is an action-RPG that chronicles the entire history of Goku.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-15-years-dragon-ball-z-budokai-is-finally-being-revived/1100-6512078/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The folks at the helm at Embark Studios are no strangers to shooters--most are ex-DICE developers who worked on the Battlefield series--and the team is sticking to their guns (heh) for their first two projects, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/">Arc Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-finals/">The Finals</a>. The Finals, a free-to-play first-person shooter with an emphasis on environmental destruction and teamplay, is scheduled to launch first and looks a whole lot more like the high-octane action in the Battlefield series. It's the type of game Embark co-founder and chief creative officer Rob Runesson thought he'd left behind.</p><p>"To be completely honest, I didn't, or we didn't think that we would ever build a first-person shooter game again," Runesson said during a preview event for The Finals. "But after a year or so we actually started talking a little bit about first-person shooters among ourselves again and questions started growing in the studio."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Runesson, the team brainstormed about why the first-person shooter genre felt stale and not as fun for them. The studio believes that innovation has stalled in the genre, preventing new types of fun from being created.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-embark-is-making-the-finals-another-first-person-shooter-in-a-sea-of-fps-games/1100-6512049/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Amazon Studios has released the first trailer for Citadel, an upcoming spy series featuring Game of Thrones and Marvel actor Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. The trailer sets up the show's massive scope and high-stakes storyline. The show is produced by Joe and Anthony Russo, the directing duo behind Marvel's Avengers movies.</p><p>Madden and Chopra Jonas play agents of Citadel, a spy agency with loyalty to no nation. Eight years before the series begins, they were double-crossed by another Citadel agent, and that's where the drama begins. Take a look at the trailer below to see Madden and Chopra Jonss in action. The series also stars Stanley Tucci.</p><div>          </div><p>In September, it was reported that Citadel's production was facing major issues, with about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-directors-new-tv-show-is-now-the-second-most-expensive-ever-after-lotr-report/1100-6507089/">half of the creative team quitting the project due</a> to differences in vision against what the Russo brothers had in mind.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trailer-for-avengers-directors-new-tv-series-citadel-arrives-with-lots-of-action/1100-6512071/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Minecraft's Steve Is Finally Being Banned In Major Smash Bros. Tournaments

<p dir="ltr">It's fair to say that Steve from Minecraft has been considered a controversial character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate since he was added in late 2020. Now, however, as noted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-smash-bros-tournament-ban-steve-minecraft-glitch-1850185818">Kotaku</a>, a number of major tournaments are outright banning the character, thanks to the discovery of a meta-destroying glitch that's brought Steve back to the forefront.</p><p dir="ltr">To be clear, Steve haters have called the character overpowered for years now. A recent tierlist put together by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SmashBrosUltimate/comments/11b1jrg/ultrank_2023_official_smash_ultimate_tier_list/">UltRank</a> that tallied votes from 71 pro Ultimate players ranked Steve in the top tier of characters in the game, along with Joker and Pyra/Mythra. However, Steve isn't getting banned because he's just too good, but because he can use a certain exploit to essentially break the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the past few weeks, Steve players have discovered that they can <a href="https://twitter.com/XCidoClipDump/status/1629450984190537728">use a glitch</a> to recover more quickly than every other character in the game, meaning that he can break combos, react to animations before they even finish, and generally undermine the game's rules at a basic level. Influential Smash player <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-EvpwYjAOA">Hungrybox</a> recently announced that this glitch will result in Steve being banned at his Coinbox events, and it seems that a number of major tournaments have followed suit.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-steve-is-finally-being-banned-in-major-smash-bros-tournaments/1100-6512075/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Of course, it's also worth noting that Lister competed in the WWE (then WWF) between 1989 and 1990 as Zeus.</p><p dir="ltr">You can check out the full DLC roster, along with release dates, below.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k23-dlc-includes-legends-nxt-stars-bray-wyatt-and-zeus-from-no-holds-barred/1100-6512062/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Broken Destiny 2 Lightfall Farm Lets You Open Same Chest Three Times, Will Likely Be Nerfed Soon

<p dir="ltr">Farms and exploits are nothing new in the world of online games like Destiny 2, and Lightfall is no exception. As revealed in a video from YouTuber Fallout Plays, Destiny 2 Lightfall has a farming trick that allows players to open a chest at least three times for completing just one activity, and it's likely that the trick isn't long for this world.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">As the above video shows, the farm gives you Neomuna reputation, weapons drops, crafted weapon progress, and more. The trick involves going to Neptune and loading into a zone where the public event Terminal Overload is happening. Once you load in, you should look for a Terminal Overload activity that's approaching its conclusion.</p><p dir="ltr">You should then kill the boss, open the two chests, ride your Sparrow into a new area, and then come back. If you do it fast enough, you can open the same free chest three times. Some commenters on the video suggest that you can open it four times with the right route, so it's worth experimenting with to maximize your returns. Given that this farm lets you triple or quadruple-dip the same chest, don't be surprised if it gets nerfed by Bungie soon.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/broken-destiny-2-lightfall-farm-lets-you-open-same-chest-three-times-will-likely-be-nerfed-soon/1100-6512068/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Knockout City Dev Explains What Went Wrong

<p>Knockout City, the "dodgebrawl" game from Velan Studios, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/knockout-city-is-going-offline-forever-in-june/1100-6511140/">coming to a close this June</a> after launching in May 2021. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/knockout-citys-closure-is-part-of-a-painful-truth-of-the-games-industry-studio-says/1100-6511390/">didn't have the long life its developer was hoping for</a>. But what went wrong?</p><p>Co-founder Guha Bala told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/where-did-knockout-city-go-wrong">GI.biz</a> that Knockout City hit the ground running with marketing support from publisher EA, solid sales, and a surge in players thanks to its inclusion with Xbox Game Pass. However, a "mid-price premium" business model was "pretty uncommon" for a multiplayer-only title like Knockout City, with many similar titles adopting a free-to-play model instead, Bala said. Knockout City was priced at $20 before it later changed business models.</p><p>"So the competitive environment changed for pricing. It sold fairly well but not well enough to as a mid-price premium title to continue to support an additional flow of content," the developer explained.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/knockout-city-dev-explains-what-went-wrong/1100-6512063/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Meta Quest 2 And Pro Models Get Big Price Cuts

As of today, you can find the Meta Quest 2 (256GB) available for just $430, down from $500, and the Meta Quest Pro for $1,000, down from $1,500. The standard 128GB model of the Quest 2, meanwhile, will remain $400.</p><p>The price cuts come not long after price <em>hikes </em>on the Meta Quest 2 went into effect last summer. At that time, Meta raised the price of both models of the Quest 2 by $100, so the price drop brings the 256GB model pretty close to the price it was before the increase. Now that we've got that out of the way, here's where you can buy the Quest 2 and Quest Pro at their new prices.</p><div class="norewrite" title="6512067 - Meta Quest Discounted">  <div class="buylink-container">                                                                     <div class="js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container">             <h2 class="item-title">                    <a href="https://howl.me/cjgI2hqJdFC?u1=subid_value">Meta Quest 2 (256GB)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3 class="item-deck">                      <a href="https://howl.me/cjgI2hqJdFC?u1=subid_value">$430 (was $500)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <div class="image-container">                                  <img class="main-image" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1702/17023653/4108332-quest2.jpg" />                             <a href="https://howl.me/cjgI2hqJdFC?u1=subid_value"></a>                        </div>              <div class="item-description"><p>The Meta Quest 2 (256GB) is less than half the price of the Meta Quest Pro, making it an ideal headset for newcomers to the world of VR.

<p dir="ltr">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the most popular games on Steam, but that hasn't stopped rumors that the game will soon get a massive update that will transform it overnight. According to <a href="https://richardlewis.substack.com/p/sources-yes-counter-strike-2-is-real">a new report</a> from journalist Richard Lewis, sources have confirmed that a hypothetical "Counter-Strike 2" is indeed real, and the planned release date for the beta is March or early April.</p><p dir="ltr">The report suggests that this new game will be on the Source 2 engine, rather than the aging original Source engine that powers Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It will feature an improved match-making system and 128-tick servers, intended to compete with its major rival in the competitive shooter space, Valorant.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear if the two versions of Counter-Strike will coexist, or if Valve plans to pull an Overwatch and replace the original Global Offensive entirely. It's also likely that the move to Source 2 will require higher minimum specs to run well.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/counter-strike-2-is-legit-coming-just-round-the-corner-report/1100-6512065/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The latest episode of HBO's The Last of Us takes Bella Ramsey's Ellie through the winter chapter of the first game where she's on her own and trying to keep herself and Joel (Pedro Pascal) alive. However, this will be their greatest challenge yet.</p><p>At the end of Episode 6, we find Joel having been accidentally stabbed and Ellie is trying to save him, with Episode 7 being a flashback to the last time Ellie experienced loss. In Episode 8, Ellie is fending for herself as she kills a deer, and stumbles upon the small town of Silver Lake led by the ultra-religious David, played by Scott Shepard (A Bridge of Spies, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie). </p><p>This episode goes hand-in-hand with Episode 7 as maybe the most faithful adaptation of the game, but the challenges the cast faced to make the episode were anything but easy.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-emotional-and-icy-challenges-that-hbos-the-last-of-us-cast-faced-with-episode-8/1100-6512073/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Joel and Ellie's journey across the country will soon come to an end in The Last of Us season finale. The pair are seen entering Salt Lake City in the trailer for the ninth episode, where they continue to search for the Fireflies. <strong>Warning: Spoilers ahead.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The teaser only features lines of dialogue from Ellie. She begins the preview by saying, "After all we've been through, it can't be for nothing." This is followed by a grenade of some sorts (most likely chemical or smoke) landing at their feet. The trailer cuts away from the explosion.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Afterward, Joel is seen searching on his own through what is likely a hospital.

<p>Actor Keanu Reeves recently conducted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11ia0od/hi_im_keanu_reeves_ama/">Reddit AMA</a> to promote his new movie, John Wick: Chapter 4, but naturally people asked him about many things unrelated to that movie. One question in particular was posed to Reeves about aliens. Specifically, "If aliens came to Earth, would you accept the responsibility of being the first to contact them?"</p><p>Reeves responded as you knew he would. He would be up for it, and he would have some questions for the visitors. "Heck yea. How's it going? How was your trip? You hungry? Want anything to drink?"</p><p>Wouldn't that just be incredible?

Produced by Seth Rogen and directed by The Mitchells vs. the Machines Jeff Rowe, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem isn't straying too far from the source material established over decades of live-action films, animated TV series, and comic books, but it has a design that makes it stand out visually from all the other adaptations of the past.</p><div>          </div><p>Set in the familiar sewers of New York City, Mutant Mayhem sees the Turtle brothers head to the surface in an effort to step out of the shadows, and along the way, they'll meet familiar allies, take on a criminal syndicate, and tangle with an army of Manhattan mutants.</p><figure style="width: 2025px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4108287-tmnt-poster.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4108287-tmnt-poster.jpg" /></a></figure><p>"In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, after years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts," the film's official synopsis reads.

## Daughter Of Frankenstein Explores Horror In A Resident Evil-Inspired, ADHD-Accessible Adventure

<p>I adore Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. It's a story that awoke an insatiable desire within little Jordan to consume gothic horror and science fiction in equal measure--a hunger I'm sure will plague my mind for the rest of my days. The novel has been a large inspiration in the types of stories I like to tell in tabletop roleplaying games, both as a game master and player. So it comes as very little surprise to me that I'd be immediately smitten with the idea of Daughter of Frankenstein, an upcoming TTRPG campaign sourcebook. Daughter of Frankenstein is the first project from Bardhouse Media, a publisher looking to focus on accessibility and collaboration in the tabletop gaming space to welcome new and lesser-heard voices.</p><p dir="ltr">The team of writers contributing to Daughter of Frankenstein is led by a name that many folks in the TTRPG community may find familiar: Beth the Bard. Beth the Bard is a professional game master, co-founder of Bardhouse Media, and the best-selling author of She is the Ancient: A Genderbent Curse of Strahd. She is the Ancient reimagines and rewrites the backstory, societal role, gender, race, and connections of the NPCs found in Wizards of the Coast's popular gothic horror adventure, Curse of Strahd.</p><p dir="ltr">Writing She is the Ancient is part of Beth the Bard's inspiration for Bardhouse Media. She points to the help and support she received from those already well-known and published within the community as part of why she was even able to get a foot in the door to create something like She is the Ancient. The goal is for Bardhouse Media to help prop that door open so new game masters and tabletop gaming writers can follow Beth into the space, receiving the necessary support to get their work out there.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/daughter-of-frankenstein-explores-horror-in-a-resident-evil-inspired-adhd-accessible-adventure/1100-6512047/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Dead Cells: Return To Castlevania Review - Pay ME Tribute

<p dir="ltr">I loved Dead Cells, but it never struck me as particularly Castlevania-like. The acclaimed action roguelike from Motion Twin certainly had some passing resemblance in some of its combat mechanics, but not so much that I ever made any association to Konami's vampire-hunting franchise. So when the studio announced it was making an expansion modeled after Castlevania, I was certainly intrigued, but also surprised. How would that work, exactly? Pretty well, it turns out, as Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is a clever fusion of Castlevania homages and Dead Cells' structure, and helps to illustrate how Castlevania DNA has been a part of Dead Cells all along.</p><p dir="ltr">The similarities between the two are cut into stark relief by their differences. Castlevania, and especially the Symphony of the Night sub-genre that serves as the basis for most of this expansion, is an exploration-based action game, with a castle full of tightly-knit secrets and clockwork-like precision to its progression gating. Dead Cells very much isn't that, as its roguelike biomes mix and match different pieces like Lego bricks. You'll recognize certain pieces after you've played it enough, but it will always be impossible to draw a consistent map or to tell a friend exactly where to find a secret key. In this regard, they couldn't be more different.</p><p dir="ltr">So the blending in Return to Castlevania can best be described as Dead Cells doing its best Castlevania impression. The Castlevania biomes are still randomized in the roguelike style, but the pieces do feel more oriented around puzzle-solving and secrets than in the main Dead Cells game. In fact, that's one of Return to Castlevania's most impressive tricks--it's still built around interlocking pieces, but the more secret-solving components don't feel contained to small, individual parts. It's almost as if the game is building a fresh, albeit relatively small, Castlevania map every time you respawn.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-review-pay-me-tribute/1900-6418041/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2: Lightfall's New Strand Subclass Lets You Do Some Wild Stuff

<p>Destiny 2: Lightfall's new Strand subclass, a set of destructive powers that combines destructive offense with a heightened sense of mobility, is one of the more exciting additions in the expansion. With all the Fragments for the subclass being unlocked ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-raid-the-root-of-nightmares-start-time-details/1100-6511185/">this week's raid</a>, players have begun experimenting more with these new abilities, and so far, some of the builds have been incredibly wild to see in action.</p><p>So far, players have been using the new Grapple ability for both offense and defense as that ethereal tangle of psychic energy can latch onto almost anything. While you do have to sacrifice your grenade ability to equip it, using the Strand Grapple on moving objects is proving to have several advantages. Combined with the ability to unravel enemies and reform them as balls of destructive energy, players are performing a one-two move in which they hurl the orb and latch a ride onto it. The results are <em>very </em>impressive in action.</p><p>Here's a look at Strand being used to deal with a pesky invader in Gambit:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-new-strand-subclass-lets-you-do-some-wild-stuff/1100-6512054/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
