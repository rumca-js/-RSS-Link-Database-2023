## Adopting Audrey review – Jena Malone shines in kooky adult adoption tale

<p>Her nuanced portrayal of a directionless thirtysomething seeking new parents redeems the annoyingly implausible tale unfolding around her</p><p>Here’s another cutesy-sentimental American indie about a character struggling to grow up, and drifting with no real sense of what to do in life. Adopting Audrey takes it one further, turning the quirky dial up to 11 with its story about a woman who puts herself up for adoption in her 30s. (Adult adoption is legal in the US, though not in the UK)</p><p>Audrey is played by Jena Malone with warmth and thoughtfulness; her performance the most distinctive thing about this otherwise forgettable movie. Audrey is single and often unable to pay the rent, flitting from job to job. You sense depression or loneliness creeping in, spending her evenings watching cute animal videos. One night YouTube’s algorithm pings her from puppy adoption videos to ones about human adult adoption; Audrey decides to give it a go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/adopting-audrey-review-jena-malone-shines-in-kooky-adult-adoption-tale">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gut-churning battlefield realism and the unfamiliar German perspective take this powerful first world war film outside the usual war movie territory</p><p>I bet no one gave <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/12/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-review-anti-war-nightmare-of-bloodshed-and-chaos">All Quiet</a> more than a few seconds’ thought as a potential Oscar winner until last fortnight, when its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/19/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-sweeps-baftas-as-banshees-also-gets-an-oscar-boost">run of success at the Baftas</a> – seven awards, including best picture and best director – had even its own director shaking his head in disbelief. Repeating the trick seems unlikely, but stranger things have happened: remember when Green Book nipped in between Roma, The Favourite and BlacKkKlansman to win <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/green-book-wins-oscar-for-best-picture-2019">best picture in 2019</a>? And non-English language films do have some form: All Quiet is the 15th to get a best picture nomination, though admittedly Parasite, in 2020, was the only one to actually go on and win the thing).</p><p>All Quiet’s achievements at the Baftas may have gotten a bit lost in the post-show roar over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/is-baftas-work-to-increase-diversity-in-danger-of-being-undone">diversity</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/23/actor-phil-davis-resigns-bafta-membership-over-embarrassing-travesty-of-tv-awards-show">Bernard Cribbins</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/20/angela-bassett-did-the-thing-deconstructing-ariana-debose-bafta-performance">Angela Bassett Did the Thing</a>, but while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/15/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-review-michelle-yeoh-jamie-lee-curtis-daniel-kwan-daniel-scheinert">Everything Everywhere All at Once </a>is the clear favourite for the Oscars, All Quiet is on its shoulder, having picked up as many noms as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/05/the-banshees-of-inisherin-review-martin-mcdonagh">The Banshees of Inisherin</a>. Could it go all the way? Well, it’s certainly a brilliantly made film, achieving a level of battlefield realism for the first world war that is gut-churning. Plus the unfamiliar perspective – that of the hapless, naive German soldiers whom we Brits are more used to thinking of as efficiently murderous killers mowing down Our Boys – gives the film a patina of strangeness and takes it outside the usual territory. (This even applies to the distinctly odd final-armistice scenes, which seek to cast the French top brass as heartless warmongers in contrast to the pleadingly humane Germans.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/why-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar">Continue reading...</a>

Arenado’s teammate on the Cardinals, reigning National League MVP Paul Goldschmidt, was also on the 2017 squad.

## India should put anomaly behind them and resume normal service in fourth Test | Geoff Lemon

<p>Despite some gloom at home the only thing that could hamper the hosts in Ahmedabad would be if they psych themselves out against Australia</p><p>If you believed some Indian media coverage or supporters online, you would think that the home team is on the brink of disaster. After losing the third Border-Gavaskar Trophy match in Indore, criticisms have flowed: that the batting is broken, that no one can play spin any more, that the lower order papers over the cracks, that India’s spinners are no good after failing to bowl out Australia for 70, and especially that the preparation of turning pitches was a disaster waiting to happen, a tiger pit that India dug and then fell into themselves.</p><p>That’s an extensive list of diagnoses for a team that is leading the series 2-1, and has now lost a total of three home Tests in the last decade. A team that came back to win both series after the first two of those losses, and will most likely go on to win the current one. There is consternation about how India might fare in the fourth Test in Ahmedabad, and scolding about the dangers of shootout pitches – that is, surfaces where batting is so difficult that luck plays a greater part than skill. But the weight of statistical probability says that with the scales so sharply tilted by home advantage, home concern is unwarranted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/06/india-should-put-anomaly-behind-them-and-resume-normal-service-in-fourth-test">Continue reading...</a>

## We can’t afford to choose adaptation over cutting emissions – suggesting otherwise is dangerous | James Shaw

<p>Despite what some New Zealand right-wingers are arguing, adaptation will not help us in a world three degrees warmer</p><p>I cannot say how the world will look for our kids, but what I do know is that it will reflect the decisions we take today. The past two years we’ve witnessed a seemingly never-ending cascade of climate-turbocharged disasters. Canterbury, the West Coast, Nelson-Tasman, Tairāwhiti, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/01/auckland-floods-biggest-climate-event-new-zealand-history-flooding">Auckland</a>, Waikato, and Northland. Aotearoa New Zealand knows clearer than ever the immediacy of the climate crisis. We simply cannot rest. Far from it: despite huge progress, we are still nowhere near where we need to be.</p><p>A slew of opportunistic right-wing voices is lining up to use recent disasters to argue that the government should <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/matthew-hooton-its-too-late-to-avoid-climate-change-now-we-have-to-adapt/LMBGHC5XUZEWBP4T2OM6UE4DI4/">shift its efforts away from cutting emissions towards adaptation</a>. This is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/22/preventing-global-warming-cheaper-than-adapting">as unscientific as it is dangerous</a>. It is also utterly out of touch with the needs of the people they purport to represent. It is a disingenuous, harmful and bad faith argument that distracts from the conversations we need to be having.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2023/mar/06/we-cant-afford-to-choose-adaptation-over-cutting-emissions-suggesting-otherwise-is-dangerous">Continue reading...</a>
