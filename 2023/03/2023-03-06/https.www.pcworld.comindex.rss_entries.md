<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in trying out the far future of Windows features &mdash; say, Windows 12? &mdash; the new Windows Insider &ldquo;Canary&rdquo; channel may be right up your alley.</p>



<p>Microsoft debuted the fourth new Windows Insider Channel on Monday morning. &ldquo;Canary&rdquo; joins the other Windows Insider channels as a way for you to try out new features before they arrive on Windows 11. Typically, the arrangement goes as follows: Release Preview is for code that&rsquo;s just about to be released, while the Beta Channel is code that&rsquo;s definitely scheduled, through a bit further out.</p>



<p>The Dev Channel and the new Canary Channel are more experimental. Microsoft &ldquo;relaunched&rdquo; the Dev Channel on Monday, with an eye toward enthusiasts who want to try out new code that may never see the light of day. &ldquo;Canary&rdquo; is even riskier, and the new channel was accompanied by warnings that it could end up putting your PC into a state where you might have to reinstall Windows.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Canary Channel may end up as a way for you to see what Microsoft is working on for the next release of Windows. What Microsoft <em>won&rsquo;t</em> do, apparently, is always tell you what those features may be. &ldquo;We will offer limited documentation for the Canary Channel, but we will not publish a blog post for every flight &ndash; only when new features are available in a build. We will continue to provide blog posts for Dev, Beta, and Release Preview releases like we do normally,&rdquo; Microsoft said in a blog post.</p>

<p>Windows Central <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-windows-12-2024-early-platform-testing-new-canary-channel-preview-builds&amp;xcust=2-1-1532952-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">points out</a> that the new channel may be used to debut so-called Windows vNext, code that won&rsquo;t end up in Windows 11 but may be released in an entirely new version, aka Windows 12. Put another way, the Dev Channel is being designed for enthusiasts who want to try out code within the Windows 11 timeframe, but the Canary Channel could wind up reserved for Windows 12 (or 13?) experiments. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/419826/how-to-join-the-windows-10-insider-preview-program.html">Joining the Windows Insider program for Windows 11 is easy</a>. In its blog post, Microsoft suggested that now might be a good time for switching channels, which you can do via the <em>Windows Insider</em> portion of the <em>Settings&gt;Windows Update </em>section of the Settings menu. Just remember that while it&rsquo;s easy to switch to more advanced channels (from Release Preview to Beta to Dev to Canary), it&rsquo;s more difficult to go backwards. That&rsquo;s because Windows doesn&rsquo;t want you to go &ldquo;update&rdquo; to an earlier build. In that case, you may have to reinstall Windows, which will erase all of your installed applications. In other words, Insider builds are still best left for a secondary machine that&rsquo;s tolerant of bugs and other glitches.</p>



<p>Rumor has it, though, that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811274/windows-12-2024-microsoft-windows-11-features.html">Windows 12 could debut in 2024</a>. If you&rsquo;d like to roll the dice and start getting an early peek, than the Canary Channel may be for you.</p>

## Twitter is broken after API fail

<p>Is Twitter finally hitting the breaking point? Twitter users reported that Twitter&rsquo;s incoming and outgoing API started failing on Monday morning, breaking many of the site&rsquo;s core features. </p>



<p>The API outage appeared to prevent Tweetdeck from working, as well as even blocking access to the Twitter home page for some people (including PCWorld editor Brad Chacos, shown below). When users tried to post screenshots of the API breaking features&hellip; those screenshots were broken, too. The outages generated error messages:  &ldquo;{&ldquo;errors&rdquo;:[{&ldquo;message&rdquo;:&rdquo;Your current API plan does not include access to this endpoint, please see <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/ZYadQrUVg6&amp;xcust=2-1-1532861-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api&hellip;</a> for more information&rdquo;,&rdquo;code&rdquo;:467}]&rdquo; </p>



<p>Unfortunately, even the link in the error message failed to work. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Twitter API broken" class="wp-image-1532862" height="489" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-3.png" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos / iDG</p></div>



<p>Naturally, &ldquo;Twitter API&rdquo; trended as a result, as did related searches like &ldquo;Did Twitter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Images.&rdquo; Some began speculating that Twitter hadn&rsquo;t paid one or more bills. Twitter had a different explanation, however. &ldquo;Some parts of Twitter may not be working as expected right now,&rdquo; Twitter Support tweeted. &ldquo;We made an internal change that had some unintended consequences. We&rsquo;re working on this now and will share an update when it&rsquo;s fixed.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Twitter blog didn&rsquo;t have an explanation for the issue &mdash; it, too, was blocked by the error message. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Twitter, hadn&rsquo;t tweeted about the issue as of 9:23 AM PT. Musk has reportedly slashed Twitter&rsquo;s headcount down to a fraction of what it once was, and the Twitter community has wondered when all of the layoffs would end up breaking critical Twitter features. Now we know. </p>

## Microsoft Edge’s Video Super Resolution upscaling works on AMD and Nvidia

<p>Souped-up graphics cards aren&rsquo;t just for playing video games, you know. They can also play&hellip;videos. Sans games. Or more accurately, they can enhance them, at least with powerful software like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525299/nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution-tested.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX Video Super Resolution</a>. This tool uses an extra bit of GPU <em>oomph </em>to upscale and clean low-res videos. But if you prefer something a little more agnostic, Microsoft just released its own version in Edge&hellip;and it plays nice with the newer cards from both Nvidia and AMD. </p>



<p>Video Super Resolution is the latest feature <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/whats-new&amp;xcust=2-1-1532564-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">baked into the experimental Canary release</a> of Microsoft&rsquo;s Edge browser. It can examine web video running at 720p resolution or lower and automatically upscale it using your GPU. The tool will work on any streaming video that&rsquo;s not copyright protected (so most of YouTube, but not streaming services like Netflix or Disney+), sharpening and cleaning the look in real-time. It&rsquo;s not as good as actual high-quality video, but in the right circumstances it&rsquo;s a dramatic improvement. </p>



<p>For the initial release, Video Super Resolution works on machines with Nvidia GeForce RTX 20-series cards or newer, or AMD Radeon RX 5700 cards or newer. Laptop users will also need to be plugged into AC power, because spinning up that graphics card in addition to the high CPU usage of streaming video is going to go through your battery like a bull charging through a Pamplona tourist. Even so, Microsoft says it&rsquo;s only enabling the feature for 50 percent of users at the start, so it&rsquo;s a coin flip on whether you&rsquo;ll actually see it. </p>



<p>Typically new features in the Edge Canary build take a couple of months to get to the release build installed on hundreds of millions of Windows machines. Video Super Resolution might be an exception, because it&rsquo;s much more complex than the usual engine tweak or user interface adjustment. It could take Microsoft a bit longer to iron out the kinks. </p>



<p>If you have an RTX 30- or 40-series GPU, you can already try out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525299/nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution-tested.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s awesome RTX Video Super Resolution</a>, which works on <em>any</em> web video&mdash;including copyright protected ones. In fact, RTX VSR works best with high-quality streams from the likes of Netflix and Disney+.</p>

## AOC I1601FWUX review: A budget portable monitor with a touch of class

</div>


<p>The AOC I1601FWUX is a portable 15.6-inch monitor at a rock-bottom price. It&rsquo;s slim enough to fit in a backpack and is powered by a single USB-C cable, so it&rsquo;s a good match with a USB-C laptop. Just be mindful: This is a budget display better suited to basic productivity than entertainment or content creation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">best monitors</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a monitor, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="aoc-i1601fwux-the-specs">AOC I1601FWUX: The specs</h2>



<p>AOC&rsquo;s I1601FWUX is similar to most in the budget portable-monitor category. It has a 15.6-inch IPS display with 1080p resolution and a 60Hz refresh rate.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Display size: 15.6-inch</li><li>Native resolution: 1920&times;1080</li><li>Panel type: IPS monitor</li><li>Refresh rate: 60Hz</li><li>Adaptive sync: None</li><li>HDR: None</li><li>Ports: 1x USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode</li><li>Stand adjustment: Tent, rotation</li><li>VESA mount: None</li><li>Speakers: None</li><li>Price: $139.99</li></ul>



<p>Both power and video come over a single USB-C cable with DisplayPort Alternate Mode. The monitor lacks USB-A, HDMI, or DisplayPort input, so it&rsquo;s best paired with a laptop or desktop that has USB-C out.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="aoc-i1601fwux-design">AOC I1601FWUX: Design&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC I1601FWUX" class="wp-image-1521002" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aoc-I1601-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The AOC I1601FWUX has a solid, if not understated build quality.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The AOC I1601FWUX&rsquo;s rear panel has a silver metal finish that looks attractive, delivering a more premium look than expected for the price. However, the front bezels are made of black plastic, which detracts from the look of the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Build quality is solid. The rear panel doesn&rsquo;t easily flex and only allows for a few degrees of movement. There&rsquo;s minimal flex in the display panel, too, which provides hope that dropping an item on it wouldn&rsquo;t cause too much damage. I&rsquo;d still recommend buying a sleeve for the display, as any display is prone to scratches when left unprotected.</p>



<p>A detachable kickstand is included with the monitor and works magnetically to support the device in either a landscape or portrait orientation. The stand is very stable in portrait orientation, though using it this way means the USB-C power cable awkwardly juts out the &ldquo;top&rdquo; of the display.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC I1601FWUX" class="wp-image-1521003" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aoc-I1601-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Stand included with the AOC I1601FWUX.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The stand offers about 20 degrees of adjustment for tilt, which isn&rsquo;t much, but a perk in this price range. Some competitors don&rsquo;t adjust for tilt or, if they do, allow just a couple fixed positions. The AOC&rsquo;s stand is designed to allow tilt adjustment across the entire range of tilt supported.</p>

<p>The stand doesn&rsquo;t adjust for height, and a VESA mount is not an option. This is true for most portable monitors, however&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1500398/viewsonic-colorpro-vp16-oled-review.html">Viewsonic&rsquo;s ColorPro VP16 OLED is an exception</a>, but also more than twice the price.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="aoc-i1601fwux-features-and-menus">AOC I1601FWUX: Features and menus&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The AOC I1601FWUX has a single USB-C input that supports DisplayPort Alternate mode. This bundles USB-C, DisplayPort connectivity, and USB Power Delivery, offering a one-cable connection. That&rsquo;s a useful advantage over older portable monitors, which often have separate video and power inputs.</p>



<p>This is a blessing and a curse, as the monitor doesn&rsquo;t come with any other ports, such as HDMI or DisplayPort. It&rsquo;s USB-C or bust. The single port also means the monitor doesn&rsquo;t work as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html">a USB-C hub</a> and can&rsquo;t connect to multiple inputs for easy switching between devices. Most of AOC&rsquo;s competitors offer additional input options besides USB-C.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC I1601FWUX" class="wp-image-1521004" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aoc-I1601-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>A few basic image adjustment options are available in the AOC I1601FWUX&rsquo;s menu.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The monitor has just one button: power. That&rsquo;s it. Despite this, the monitor offers a few basic image quality adjustments (such as brightness and contrast). The menu is opened with a quick press of the power button when the power is on, and additional quick presses move through the options. It&rsquo;s a bit awkward, but not unusual for a monitor in this price range&mdash;and, given the lack of options available, there&rsquo;s rarely a need to access the menu.</p>



<h2 id="aoc-i1601fwux-sdr-image-quality">AOC I1601FWUX: SDR Image Quality</h2>



<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear: The AOC I1601FWUX is a budget monitor, and that impacts its performance. Unlike the Viewsonic VP16-OLED, which is several times more expensive, the AOC I1601FWUX is built to provide basic productivity at a cut-rate price.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC I1601FWUX" class="wp-image-1521005" height="838" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aoc-i1601fwux-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The monitor reached a maximum brightness of 228 nits, which is a hair above the promised peak brightness of 220 nits. That&rsquo;s a modest level of brightness for a modern monitor, though typical at this price point.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the I1601FWUX has a matte display coat that reduces glare and makes the most of the brightness available. The monitor is usable, though not brilliant, in most rooms with artificial lighting. Sunlit windows can overwhelm it, though, so it&rsquo;s an iffy choice for travelers looking to use it outdoors or in offices with big windows lacking blinds or shades.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC I1601FWUX" class="wp-image-1521006" height="839" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aoc-i1601fwux-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The contrast ratio comes in at a respectable 930:1. Contrast is far from exceptional, but also much better than the worst: in short, it&rsquo;s average. That&rsquo;s a solid result for a budget monitor, and it provides a reasonable sense of depth and dimensionality. My review unit&rsquo;s uniformity was good, too, without large blotches or variances in brightness that might cause the contrast to appear lower across portions of the display.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC I1601FWUX" class="wp-image-1521007" height="842" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aoc-i1601fwux-color-gamut.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Color gamut is where the I1601FWUX&rsquo;s budget focus is most obvious, as it covers just 63 percent of sRGB and 47 percent of DCI-P3. This level of color performance is relegated to only to the least expensive monitors and appears noticeably duller and more muted than most displays. It&rsquo;s fine for document editing or browsing the web but won&rsquo;t hold up in content creation and entertainment.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AOC I1601FWUX" class="wp-image-1521008" height="911" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aoc-i1601fwux-color-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The I1601FWUX disappoints in color accuracy, too, with a much higher color error than most monitors we&rsquo;ve recently tested. I noticed that colors which should appear punchy and impactful instead shifted towards a more pastel look.</p>



<p>I noticed similar inaccuracies in the gamma performance, which came in at a gamma curve of 2.5. This is off the target of 2.2 and indicates that content will appear a bit darker than it should. I noticed this most in scenes where people wore dark clothing, which lacked texture that should be visible. Color temperature came in at 7400K, which is cooler than the target of 6500K. I noticed this most in skin tones, where warmer tones melted away to a flatter, more sterile appearance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the I1601FWUX&rsquo;s color performance is unremarkable, it does look sharp. The 15.6-inch 1080p panel packs 141 pixels per inch. For comparison, that&rsquo;s much higher than a 27-inch 1440p monitor (109 ppi) and close to a 27-inch 4K monitor (163 ppi). Videos and games look crystal-clear and small fonts appear crisp.</p>



<p>It may seem like I don&rsquo;t have many kind words for the monitor&rsquo;s image quality, but the price must be remembered. Portable monitors sold below $150 can&rsquo;t afford to ensure precise factory quality control, so the I1601FWUX&rsquo;s performance is about what I expected. The good news is this: The monitor avoids any obvious, unexpected image woes, and its high sharpness makes it well-suited to the basic productivity tasks owners are likely to demand of it.</p>



<h2 id="aoc-i1601fwux-hdr-image-quality">AOC I1601FWUX: HDR Image Quality</h2>



<p>The AOC I1601FWUX doesn&rsquo;t support HDR. That&rsquo;s good news. A few monitors in the same price range claim HDR support, but don&rsquo;t be fooled&mdash;they offer little more than the ability to accept an HDR signal and don&rsquo;t offer a passable HDR experience. AOC&rsquo;s decision to keep HDR off the feature list is an honest, accurate representation of the monitor&rsquo;s capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="aoc-i1601fwux-motion-performance">AOC I1601FWUX: Motion Performance</h2>



<p>Gaming isn&rsquo;t a priority for the AOC I1601FWUX. It offers a standard 60Hz refresh rate and doesn&rsquo;t support adaptive sync. Still, it works well enough in a pinch.</p>



<p>Motion performance is fine for casual gaming. Ghosting is kept to a minimum and scenes are reasonably clear during fast camera pans or when scrolling across a map. Small details, like character names or floating hitpoint bars, seem blurry and obscured. This is typical for any 60Hz IPS monitor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AOC offers three Overdrive modes: Weak, Medium, and Strong. The Weak mode offers some improvement in clarity without significant problems, but the Medium and Strong settings introduce a lot of noise into moving images. I&rsquo;d recommend sticking to Weak.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-aoc-i1601fwux">Should you buy the AOC I1601FWUX?</h2>



<p>The AOC I1601FWUX&rsquo;s build quality and design stand out, offering a more robust and premium feel than typical in this price range, and the stand works better than similarly priced competitors. The versatile USB-C input is another perk, but the lack of additional ports limits the monitor&rsquo;s versatility. Image quality doesn&rsquo;t stand out and will be a drawback for content creators. On the whole, it&rsquo;s a sensible choice if you want a basic USB-C portable monitor that feels more robust than the alternatives.</p>

<p>Sometimes all you need is the basics to get the job done. Well, this Lenovo mouse is about as basic as you can get and that&rsquo;s a really good thing. Amazon&rsquo;s selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Wireless-Mouse-Graphite-Battery/dp/B08D6VD9TR&amp;xcust=2-1-1532569-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lenovo 530 wireless mouse (with battery!) for just $14.89</a>, which is 26 percent off of the original $19.99 price tag. If you add the on-page coupon, you&rsquo;ll get an additional $3 off. That&rsquo;s a great value. Not only is the minimalist aesthetic really cool, but it also features some good specs.</p>



<p>The Lenovo 530 has a 1,200 DPI, 2.4 GHz wireless connectivity, and an ambidextrous design. The 1,200 DPI sensor resolution is ideal for office work and day-to-day tasks. Gaming mice, for example, can have a maximum DPI of 20,000, which is ridiculously fast and takes time getting used to. For general use, you definitely want a lower DPI, otherwise the mouse will quickly get away from you. The Lenovo 530 also weighs just 65 grams, so it&rsquo;s easy to travel with. </p>



<p>This is a fantastic deal. You better swoop in now and nab it.</p>

## Nvidia confirms latest GeForce driver is causing CPU spikes

<p>PC gamers love performance, and that performance isn&rsquo;t limted to games themselves. So when some of them started noticing abnormally high CPU usage after the latest Nvidia GPU driver update, it threw up some red flags. After a bit of investigation, Nvidia itself has confirmed the problem: Some users are seeing inflated CPU usage after closing 3D games, which persists until a reboot. </p>



<p>The company confirmed the problem with the latest driver update, 531.18, which was published on February 28th. An updated list of open issues (including some that didn&rsquo;t make it into the full release notes) was <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/512048/geforce-grd-53118-feedback-thread-released-22823/&amp;xcust=2-1-1532492-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">posted to Nvidia&rsquo;s support forum</a>, and spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-acknowledges-10-cpu-usage-driver-bug-after-exiting-games&amp;xcust=2-1-1532492-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">VideoCardz.com</a>. Issue number 4007208 reads, &ldquo;Higher CPU usage from NVIDIA Container may be observed after exiting a game.&rdquo; Some users are showing CPU usage of up to 10-15 percent in these conditions &mdash; not enough to seriously hamper most gaming desktops, but more than enough to be an annoyance, especially if you use your PC for other intensive tasks. Like opening three Chrome tabs at once.</p>



<p>At the moment there&rsquo;s no easy fix, so the immediate solution if you&rsquo;re affected is to roll back your driver to version 528.49 from February 8th, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us&amp;xcust=2-1-1532492-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available for manual download here</a>. Hopefully Nvidia will be able to patch the newer driver sooner rather than later. </p>



<p>Of course modern GPU drivers are stupendously complex pieces of software, and Nvidia isn&rsquo;t the only one dealing with bugs at the moment. AMD has a rather embarrassing issue on its hands with the latest high-end Radeon cards, which under the right circumstances, can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1529986/rare-amd-radeon-driver-bug-corrupt-windows-fix.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">totally tank a Windows installation</a>. In contrast, Intel seems to be <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448060/checking-up-on-intels-arc-gpu-driver-performance.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">steadily improving</a> the software side of its Arc GPUs, which are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526632/intel-is-already-tied-with-amd-for-desktop-gpu-sales.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">gaining surprising traction</a> in the budget market. </p>

<p>Windows is, by and large, pretty good. There&rsquo;s a reason it&rsquo;s remained the number one PC operating system for decades, and it isn&rsquo;t because Microsoft beat the crap out of the industry with cutthroat business practices in the 90s. Not <em>just </em>that, anyway: it&rsquo;s because the software has gently but steadily innovated ever since, and become, well, pretty good! But it can always be better. </p>



<p>Third-party developers are always looking for ways to improve Windows. Microsoft has even borrowed some of their ideas on occasion. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/&amp;xcust=2-1-547570-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">UltraMon</a> is a great example: Microsoft copied its multi-monitor taskbars for Windows 8. But there are still plenty of tools out there that can make Windows 10 or 11 easier to use, from the most basic newbie to the most office-hardened power user. </p>



<p>Here are five power user tools that are small, simple, and free (though most developers welcome donations if you find their software invaluable). Better yet, all of them work with both Windows 10 and Windows 11.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397575/how-to-get-windows-cheap-or-even-for-free.html">how to get Windows for cheap (or even for free)</a></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="soundswitch-quickly-switch-sound-devices-with-a-keyboard-command">SoundSwitch: Quickly switch sound devices with a keyboard command</h2>



<p>Windows still isn&rsquo;t great at managing more than one sound device. Even in Windows 11 it&rsquo;s at least three clicks to switch from, say, your laptop speakers to Bluetooth headphones, or vice versa. (Though this may be fixed in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1531212/windows-11s-new-volume-panel-is-super-helpful.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a newer version of Windows in 2023</a>.) This can get old quickly if you&rsquo;re swapping between speakers and headphones on a regular basis for video meetings.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="SoundSwitch" class="wp-image-547588" height="496" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/soundswitch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="874" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://soundswitch.aaflalo.me/&amp;xcust=2-1-547570-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SoundSwitch from developer Antoine Aflalo</a> fixes this. Once installed the tiny program lives in your toolbar, waiting for you to input a keyboard shortcut (I use Ctrl + Alt + ~). When you do, it&rsquo;ll switch between any number of sound devices, with no need to dig into the clunky sound menu. SoundSwitch also supports a separate list of recording devices with their own hotkey, and it&rsquo;s being constantly updated and improved.</p>



<h2 id="spacesniffer-track-down-the-files-clogging-your-drive">SpaceSniffer: Track down the files clogging your drive</h2>



<p>Managing your computer&rsquo;s storage space is kind of an all-or-nothing experience. Windows will tell you how much space is left on your drive, and that&rsquo;s it; it&rsquo;s up to you to dive into a million different directories and clear out the gunk when you&rsquo;re running low on space. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/&amp;xcust=2-1-547570-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SpaceSniffer</a> (try not to giggle) from Uderzo Software solves this by scanning an entire drive and presenting your files and folders in a visual grid.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="SpaceSniffer" class="wp-image-547589" height="609" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/spacesniffer.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>With each directory taking up a proportional amount of space on your screen, it&rsquo;s easy to see where the huge programs and media files are hiding. You can clear out unwanted folders (and even drill down to individual files!) right in the program, and delete them without ever needing to open a file browser. It&rsquo;s a fantastic way to clean up drive space quickly.</p>



<h2 id="minibin-move-the-recycling-bin-off-your-desktop">MiniBin: Move the Recycling Bin off your desktop</h2>



<p>How often do you actually use your Recycling Bin? If you&rsquo;re anything like me, it&rsquo;s perhaps once a month, during a busy time. So why does this thing which usually takes care of itself need a dedicated spot on your desktop? If you&rsquo;d like to clear it off, check out <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://e-sushi.net/&amp;xcust=2-1-547570-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MiniBin from e-sushi</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Minibin" class="wp-image-547587" height="271" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/minibin.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="397" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>This tiny tool replicates your Recycle Bin as a taskbar icon in the notification area. The icon shows you roughly how full it is, and you can right-click to open the Recycling Bin or empty it. With MiniBin installed, you can <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-or-hide-the-recycle-bin-0d4d40aa-be23-91ec-96ab-338818d5e5fb&amp;xcust=2-1-547570-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">clear off the Recycle Bin icon</a> for a nice, clean desktop.</p>



<h2 id="sharpkeys-reprogram-any-keyboard">SharpKeys: Reprogram any keyboard</h2>



<p>If you have a full-sized keyboard, odds are there are at least one or two keys that you don&rsquo;t ever use. When&rsquo;s the last time you had to hunt for the Scroll Lock key? If you&rsquo;d rather bind these to something more useful, like media controls, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.randyrants.com/category/sharpkeys/&amp;xcust=2-1-547570-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SharpKeys from RandyRants</a> is your solution.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="SharpKeys" class="wp-image-547586" height="541" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sharp-keys.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>SharpKeys actually modifies files in the Windows Registry to permanently reassign keys. So unlike, say, a programming tool for a specific Razer keyboard, this software will work on a laptop and with any third-party keyboards you plug in. Just save your settings and reboot, and you&rsquo;re good to go. I use it to disable Caps Lock (which I never use) and change Page Up, Page Down, and Home buttons to Volume Up/Down and Mute, respectively.</p>



<h2 id="powertoys-fancyzone-roll-your-own-snap-window-layouts">PowerToys FancyZone: Roll your own snap window layouts</h2>



<p>Windows 10 introduced some powerful window management tools, and Windows 11 expands on them. But if you&rsquo;re looking for more customized options &mdash; like setting up a quick window zone that&rsquo;s exactly the width of two Tweetdeck columns &mdash; you&rsquo;ll need something powerful, like UltraMon.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="PowerToys FancyZones" class="wp-image-547585" height="574" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fancyzones.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>But wait! If you don&rsquo;t need the truckload of features in UltraMon, there&rsquo;s an official add-on from Microsoft that can do it for free. The latest incarnation of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/install&amp;xcust=2-1-547570-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PowerToys</a> includes a tool called FancyZones, among many others. It lets you create custom window layouts for quickly organizing programs across your monitor. And it works great for multi-monitor setups, too.</p>

## Intel Arc A750 vs. AMD Radeon RX 6600: Which $250 GPU should you buy?

<p>The story of Intel&rsquo;s Arc GPUs&mdash;such as the Arc A750&mdash;continues to evolve. One can almost imagine Intel engineers up by candlelight at late hours tuning their drivers. They&rsquo;re up against competitive odds from established players such as AMD, so we&rsquo;d expect no less.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html">Intel Arc A750</a> fare against <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/543823/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-finally-a-true-1080p-graphics-card.html">AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 6600</a>? The Radeon RX 6600 has been a great GPU for 1080p gamers, providing tremendous bang for buck. It&rsquo;s also priced aggressively as it ages&mdash;prompting <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499123/intel-slashes-arc-a750-price-to-249-touts-substantial-gaming-improvements.html">Intel to drop the Arc A750 to $249</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll go over the price, gaming performance, and vital things to be aware of. Both GPUs focus on 1080p gamers who want to squeeze the absolute most out of their purchase. The big story here will be driver stability. Intel has an uphill battle against AMD&rsquo;s more established (read: Stable) driver implementations over time. Should you take the risk and go Intel, or stick with tried-and-true AMD? Let&rsquo;s find out!&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="intel-arc-a750-vs-amd-rx-6600-price-and-availability">Intel Arc A750 vs. AMD RX 6600: Price and availability&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Intel Arc A750 vs AMD RX 6600" class="wp-image-1527160" height="392" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-02-23-at-3.36.32-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Microcenter GPU availability Feb 23 Intel vs. AMD.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Good news: Intel recently dropped the price of Arc A750 to $249. This is due to competitive pressure from AMD&rsquo;s 6600 GPU, which has been priced at that range or lower. There&rsquo;s also a general malaise in the GPU market, with significantly less sales than we&rsquo;re used to seeing. (Sorry Intel, you missed the GPU craze by a year&mdash;where anything available was snapped up!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Availability due to this new market atmosphere is great for both GPUs&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be able to find them at their MSRP or even lower. The question then becomes if you <em>should</em>. Nvidia remains more expensive in general, with the RTX 3060 and 3050 still selling for more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even with a more relaxed GPU shopping experience, you&rsquo;re much more likely to find the AMD 6600 across more vendors due to its greater spread on the market. Intel Arc A750, being more recent and not having the same vendor reach, will be available in more selective retailers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A real-world search on Amazon provided some results for AMD&rsquo;s RX 6600 for $249 and above, but no results for Intel Arc A750 at the time of search. Newegg proved to be a bit more successful, with the Intel Arc A750 found for $249. Further, it also had more AMD RX 6600 GPUs, and some well under $249.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microcenter&mdash;another popular retailer for those lucky enough to live near one&mdash;has a significant number of well-priced AMD 6600 in stock. Some were as low as $219! By contrast, only four or five Intel Arc A750 were available, the lowest of which was $249.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This sample of large retailers is a good example of where most gamers will be searching for these products. It&rsquo;s a huge win for AMD&mdash;you&rsquo;d have to seek out the Intel GPU and be willing to pay more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intel will have to provide a significant performance advantage to make up for its market position as illustrated in the price section, together with its driver stability. </p>



<p>The big story here will be the updates to Intel&rsquo;s drivers, which will be &ldquo;revealing&rdquo; more performance and stability with time. For example, the recent update had a big boost for older DX9 games. If Intel wants to compete with the big players, they&rsquo;ll need to do the same in triple AAA titles. (You&rsquo;ll also want to check out the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00T15aL1pkA&amp;t=1s&amp;xcust=2-1-1525621-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PCWorld Youtube channel</a>, which has been posting Intel Arc updates.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting with Cyberpunk 2077 (Ray tracing and DLSS/FSR off) the Intel Arc A750 does not do very well at 1080p &ndash; 50 FPS vs 64.3 FPS of the AMD 6600. This falls shorted of the magical 60 FPS number, not to mention the 6600 is cheaper on average. At 1440p, the results are much closer &ndash; but still a paltry 38 FPS. This shows that Intel GPUs seem to favor slightly higher resolutions vs 1080p, however. In the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00T15aL1pkA&amp;t=1s&amp;xcust=2-1-1525621-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PCWorld Youtube Arc</a> update for the A770, similar conclusions show it falling behind AMD and Nvidia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving on to Watch Dogs Legion, the A750 fares much better &ndash; matching the 6600 at 1080p and beating it by 7 FPS at 1440p. (Interestingly, Keith&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00T15aL1pkA&amp;t=1s&amp;xcust=2-1-1525621-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PCworld</a> video found that A770 performance dropped slightly after the initial launch driver, so results can sway at times.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Metro Exodus is another title that shows the A750 with a pronounced lead over the AMD 6600, and Nvidia RTX 3060 too. It does this at both 1080p and 1440p, showing that often superior performance can be found on a game-by-game basis. If you&rsquo;re considering performance on the A750, it might serve you well to check comparisons on the specific titles you plan to play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we revisit Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing, we have some very interesting results. The A750 absolutely runs away with the performance here, being significantly better than the AMD 6600. It even manages to do comparatively well vs Nvidia, which isn&rsquo;t too shabby &ndash; that&rsquo;s Nvidia&rsquo;s forte!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re not likely to want to run ray tracing at this GPU level. It has just too much of a performance penalty to be worth it. It&rsquo;s interesting to see how it can be good on Intel Arc, however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if we take performance to a difference plane &ndash; and consider upscalers? Nvidia has DLSS, AMD has FSR, and Intel has XeSS. While Intel certainly has some good performance gains with XeSS, it&rsquo;s still much newer than the competition and not as widely available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it can vary from game to game, AMD&rsquo;s 6600 is overall the better performance GPU here in its entirety. If you account for its better availability, cheaper price, and more mature drivers, it will generally win out vs the A750. The A750 does outperform it in certain titles, however, which is certainly impressive. (And don&rsquo;t even bring up ray tracing, the 6600 does not do very well!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;d still give this round over to the AMD 6600, it&rsquo;s a much better overall bet for gamers who typically will seek out its 1080p performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Intel Arc A750 vs AMD RX 6600</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>Power and other things to know</strong></p>



<p>Efficiency and power draw are important for keeping your temperatures under control. It&rsquo;s also easier to budget cheaper components with lower power draw, too. Here the AMD 6600 runs away with the show &ndash; with significantly better numbers than the Intel Arc GPUs. Arc GPUs are know to be a bit more power hungry, so it&rsquo;s no surprise &ndash; but this can have an effect on your system as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Intel Arc A750 vs AMD RX 6600" class="wp-image-1527169" height="989" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/power-draw.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>Whole system power draw for the Arc A750 and RX 6600.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>Temperatures typically will be reasonable, but AMD 6600 do have a larger variety of cooler types available for case compatibility, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of other items to know &ndash; Intel Arc Control has been improving, but you&rsquo;re still potentially running into some issues with the software at times. AMD Adrenaline software is more stable overall, but it&rsquo;s not perfect. Recently AMD took a little bit longer than usual to update RX 6000 GPU drivers compared to the newer RX 7000 GPUs, which left a few folks worried. Overall, their driver support is typically fine, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Intel Arc A750 is certainly an interesting addition to the GPU landscape. We hope that with continued support and driver updates, it can mature into a very stable platform. It also has some great performance chops when it wants to. Add ray tracing and XeSS to that and it&rsquo;s all very exciting to see where it will go. Recent improvements for legacy games and DX9 have been promising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s the key issue here, however&mdash;&rdquo;where it will go.&rdquo; The AMD Radeon RX 6600 is the clear winner here for most gamers, today. It&rsquo;s much more widely available across various retailers, which in turn means that it is typically priced much more competitively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Radeon RX 6600 also competes very well against the Arc A750 across various metrics. It has stunningly good efficiency, putting out great performance and sipping less power. While the A750 can beat the 6600 in some cases, especially in DirectX 12 and ray-traced games, it&rsquo;s more of a mixed bag. The overall consistent performance will favor the AMD GPU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While ray tracing, and even 1440p performance are impressive, many gamers who are looking to spend $249 or less will likely want great 1080p performance first. This is where the AMD Radeon RX 6600 is typically more superior, making it a no-brainer.</p>
