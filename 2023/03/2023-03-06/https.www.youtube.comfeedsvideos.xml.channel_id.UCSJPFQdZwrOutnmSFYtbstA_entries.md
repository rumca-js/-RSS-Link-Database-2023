Wow, who would have thought that a sequel to a not-especially-good animated Shrek spinoff from more than a decade ago, would turn out to be one of the best animated movies in years. Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is a fantastic movie that really took me by surprise, not to mention demolishing most of the awful tropes of modern Hollywood.
