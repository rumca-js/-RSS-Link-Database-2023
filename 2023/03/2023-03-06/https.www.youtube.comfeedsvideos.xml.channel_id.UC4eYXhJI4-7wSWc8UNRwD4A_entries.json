That\u2019s exactly what we got to witness in this performance from Venezuelan cuatro master Jorge Glem and extraordinary accordionist Sam Reider, as they set up behind the Desk for a set of highly creative, original music from their project Brooklyn Cuman\u00e1.\n\nGlem\u2019s dexterity on the small, traditional guitar-like instrument is evident from the very first notes of \u201cSkeleton Rag,\u201d as he plucks out a percussive, staccato pattern that is more Brazilian than the sweeping strums of Venezuelan folk music, as Reider leans into a melody that could easily be folkloric if it wasn\u2019t something he dreamed up. Even as they end the tune at a breakneck speed, it\u2019s only the beginning of the fireworks. \u201cS\u00e1bana Blanca y Fuga con Estribillo\u201d which follows, is based on a traditional Venezuelan folk tune and eventually erupts into a rustic exhibition of Glem\u2019s vocals.\n\nAfter a brief explanation in Spanish about the traditional song forms they work from, the duo eases into \u201cMalague\u00f1a Cumanesa,\u201d a lament based on a memory from Glem\u2019s childhood.\n\u201cCoroticos\u201d is a fiery exercise in an odd time meter that is actually part of Venezuelan tradition and it\u2019s a showcase for how these two virtuoso musicians test the limits of their instruments while they expand our expectations of the accordion and cuatro. The magic of this music is watching both artists completely enjoy each other\u2019s playing, with knowing glances and spontaneous vocal encouragement.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cSkeleton Rag\u201d \n\u201cS\u00e1bana Blanca y Fuga con Estribillo\u201d\n\u201cMalague\u00f1a Cumanesa\u201d\n\u201cCoroticos\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nJorge Glem: Venezuelan cuatro, vocals\nSam Reider: accordion, vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Felix Contreras \nDirector/Editor: Sofia Seidel \nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Sofia Seidel, Zayrha Rodriguez \nAudio Assistant: Alex Drewenskus\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton \nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galvan, Maia Stern\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #jorgeglem #samreider", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxEvAHLqryg", "date_published": "2023-03-06 10:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
