What, you wondered, brought her to that already much-mythologised subject? And what could she possibly bring to it? In fact, the resulting novel, far from a curveball, makes perfect sense: a wry coming-of-age tale told by a lonely teenage girl in Warhol\u2019s orbit, <em>Nothing Special</em> could be an elaboration of one of Flattery\u2019s short stories, which frequently turn on a thirst for experience and the aftertaste of the charade required to achieve it.<br /><br />It centres on the making of Warhol\u2019s <em>a, A Novel</em> (1968), an experimental slice-of-life breeze block built from taped conversations typed up by two schoolgirls, one of whom Flattery imagines as our narrator, Mae. We join her in 2010, deep in middle age, before we cut quickly back to 1966, when she\u2019s 17, riding escalators with an eye out for male attention, having been cold-shouldered at school and left alone by her mother, a waitress with a drink problem and an on-off boyfriend whose household presence seldom seems healthy.</p><p>The tone \u2013 numb, ironic, smarter than thou \u2013 is, we understand, partly an act, as befits a teenager who steals her mother\u2019s bra to meet an older man or shoplifts a shirt for a job interview. When a doctor somewhat creepily points her towards a \u201cfriend [who] has an art studio, an expanding business, over on East 72nd Street, and always needs girls to go and do errands for him\u201d, it accelerates her desire for independence, not least because of the sexual content of the tapes she starts transcribing, to say nothing of the parties. More poignantly instructive is the precarious friendship she forms with another girl typist, likewise in flight from her upbringing.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/06/nothing-special-by-nicole-flattery-review-adventures-of-a-factory-girl\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/06/nothing-special-by-nicole-flattery-review-adventures-of-a-factory-girl", "date_published": "2023-03-06 09:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Words of Negroes review \u2013 sorcery trial documentary raises ghosts of slavery", "description": "<p>Workers at a sugar factory in Guadeloupe read the records of a trial that followed the death of a slave in 1842, with uncomfortably strong modern-day echoes</p><p>The past returns in all its ugliness and torment in Sylvaine Dampierre\u2019s rigorous documentary which challenges the preconceived notion that the march of time automatically parallels the march of progress.

The first officer, Fariq Hamid, was 27 years old and one training flight away from full certification. The pilot in command, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was, at 53, one of the most senior and respected pilots for Malaysia Airlines. They led a crew of 10 flight attendants, all Malaysian, and ferried 227 passengers.

Written by and starring Richard Mylan, consisting of two interweaving and eventually interconnected monologues, it is an unflinching account of how opioid addiction shapes the lives of two characters: Example A, a young mother whose three children have already been taken into care and Example B, an A&amp;E nurse who fakes prescriptions to feed his own addiction.<br /><br />From the outset, these are almost unceasingly grim narratives. However, imbued with sympathy and compassion, Mylan\u2019s script deftly avoids caricatures and cliches, resisting the need to arrive at neat conclusions. It demands greater empathy and understanding of its audience, even as it offers little hope or resolution for its characters. But, as if to decorate the dungeon with flowers, even in the dark there are also gentle lyrical flourishes that raise the text above kitchen-sink drudgery: telly smiles, the choreography of tug boats and cold turkey avicides.</p><p>There is some dramatic disparity. Example B\u2019s narrative thread feels shorter and less compelling than that of Example A, and as a two-hander the asymmetrical unfolding of each respective catastrophe feels uneven. This might also be due to the fact that any two-hander with Sophie Melville would shift the dramatic focus. Here, Melville is absolutely extraordinary. Example A feels as if she is in her skin and in every sinew and bone. It is an all-consuming performance, fearless and terrifying.<br /><br />Superbly staged, Francesca Goodridge\u2019s incisive, focused direction confirms that she is one of Wales\u2019s most exciting theatre directors. Evocatively lit by Cara Hood and on and in Jacob Hughes\u2019s bus stop set, the production displays a stylish theatrical cohesion; captions flash where bus routes are listed, fluorescent tubes are carried, tenderly cradled, rearranged.<br /><br />This is Swansea-based creative collective Grand Ambition\u2019s inaugural production. Rooted both in the city itself and in Mylan\u2019s own experiences and recovery from addiction, it is an often challenging watch, but also a careful and compassionate portrait, both of a city and of an illness.</p><p>From tomorrow until Friday at <a href=\"https://www.swanseagrand.co.uk/Sorter\">Swansea Grand theatre</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/06/sorter-review-an-unflinching-account-of-opioid-addiction\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/06/sorter-review-an-unflinching-account-of-opioid-addiction", "date_published": "2023-03-06 06:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Starwatch: find a dark sky to seek out Lynx", "description": "<p>This faint constellation forms a zigzag line that looks nothing like a wildcat</p><p>This month we start with a faint constellation challenge.
