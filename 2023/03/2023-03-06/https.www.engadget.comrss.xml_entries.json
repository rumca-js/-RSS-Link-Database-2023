Microsoft <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/outlook-mac-for-all/ba-p/3757787\">has made</a> Outlook for Mac free to use. You previously needed either a Microsoft 365 subscription or an Office purchase to use the email client. It's available now through <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-outlook/id985367838\">the Mac App Store</a>.</p><p>Microsoft unsurprisingly pitches this as a good complement to Outlook for iOS. You can hand off an email draft to your iPhone if you haven't finished writing it on your Mac, for instance. An upcoming Profiles feature will tie into macOS' Focus modes to help you limit notifications when you're concentrating on work. As with all Outlook versions, you can use email accounts from various third-party services, including Gmail, iCloud and Yahoo (Engadget's parent company).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The company isn't shy about some of the reasoning behind the move. The team is &quot;rebuilding&quot; Outlook for Mac with performance, reliability and accessibility in mind. The free download might spur adoption by users who'd otherwise never give it a try. And of course, this might spur adoption of Microsoft 365 and Office for customers who want tight integration between their email software and productivity apps.</p><p>The addition might be welcome. There aren't many big email clients for the Mac, with Mozilla's Thunderbird being the most notable. Some are either paid-only or unlock features with subscriptions. Even if Outlook doesn't always match their features, you now have an easy way to try it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-makes-outlook-free-to-use-for-mac-201328421.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-makes-outlook-free-to-use-for-mac-201328421.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-06 20:13:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "'FIFA 23' will add all 12 National Women's Soccer League teams on March 15th", "description": "<p>The National Women\u2019s Soccer League is <a href=\"https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2023/EA-SPORTS-Furthers-Commitment-to-Womens-Football-With-National-Womens-Soccer-League-and-National-Womens-Soccer-League-Players-Association-Partnerships/default.aspx\"><ins>heading to </ins><em><ins>FIFA 23</ins></em></a>.

That was the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playstation-vr2-review-great-headset-should-be-cheaper-130032254.html\">crux of our review a few weeks ago</a>. But our impressions of the headset were also limited by the games we were able to preview. Since then, Sony has officially launched PS VR2 support for <em>Gran Turismo</em> 7, and Capcom has done the same for <em>Resident Evil Village</em>. Both are exclusive showpieces for the PlayStation VR2 (<em>RE Village </em>also has an <a href=\"https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-villages-unofficial-pc-vr-mod-explained/\">unofficial PC VR mod</a>), and exemplify everything Sony got right with this new hardware.</p><p>Now, I'm not much of a racing sim player, I'd much rather be zooming around <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-gaming-irl-racing-154527277.html\"><em>Forza Horizon's</em> open worlds</a>, or revisiting the glory days of <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1yVG5UbnJ4d3MyYyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGUwYjcyNGEtZDlmOS00MGZiLWExNWUtMjcyMmNlZDY2YTYyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQaWix7XKgkz8cLoUmDE4CsgsnJSnJ_G3wzkKnGuDW6A&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrTnTnrxws2c\"><em>Ridge Racer Type 4</em></a> and <em>Burnout Paradise</em>. But with PS VR2 support, <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> feels like a completely different game. In VR, you're right in the driver's seat \u2014 you can almost feel Polyphony Digital's obsessive attention to detail. The game also feels more exhilarating, as it delivers a far greater sense of speed (a consequence of having your entire field of vision consumed by the world of <em>GT7</em>).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Gran Turismo 7 on PS VR2\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/392673a3-bc45-11ed-bf6f-c5d9cd88f148\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">PlayStation</div></figure><p>I've always appreciated the <em>Gran Turismo</em> games from afar, but there was a stiffness to the actual racing experience that kept me away. <em>GT7 </em>doesn't fully fix that flaw, but it's less pronounced in virtual reality. The combination of the Dual Sense controller and the PS VR2's built-in haptics delivered a genuinely realistic driving experience, I could feel bumps in the road in my hands and occasional feedback from hitting walls or bumping into opponents. (I never said I was a great virtual driver.) I'm sure <em>Gran Turismo</em> obsessives would take away even more from the virtual reality experience, especially if they're using a decent steering wheel controller.</p><p>The more time I spent in <em>GT7 VR</em>, the more I appreciated the little details in the game, similar to my time with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-vr-review-200246099.html\"><em>Flight Simulator VR</em></a>. Instead of changing camera angles or hitting a button to scope out the competition, you simply look at your side and rear view mirrors. When you're changing gears, your in-game avatar correctly shifts between the steering wheel and shifter. I occasionally had to avert my eyes from the sun while rounding a corner, a testament to the bright 4K OLED display in the PSVR2.</p><p>At one point, I was blasting down a straightaway as the sun peeked through clouds behind me, its brightness perfectly reflected in my rear view mirrors. It cast realistic shadows throughout the world, and it was so bright I couldn't properly use that mirror \u2013 just like real life! While the game doesn't look perfect in VR \u2014 there are some noticeably low-res elements in some tracks, like guardrails, signage and audiences \u2014 it's good enough to make you feel like you're actually behind a turbo-charged monster.</p><section><img alt=\"Gran Turismo 7 on PS VR2\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/39264c90-bc45-11ed-bfff-5644e59d130d\" /></section><p>There's no visible ray tracing while you're playing in virtual reality, but you still get an eye-full of that realistic lighting during replays, which are projected on the PS VR2's simulated 2D screen. You can also get an up-close look at the cars in your garage, which use ray tracing to deliver achingly perfect reflections and shadows. It's the closest you'll get without stepping into a luxury car dealer.</p><p>When it comes to <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, I expected Capcom to deliver a worthwhile VR experience after seeing what it did with <em>RE7</em>, one of the best titles on the original PS VR. Well, the company didn't disappoint. Thanks to the increased horsepower of the PlayStation 5, and the higher fidelity of the PS VR2, <em>Resident Evil Village</em> is transformed into a living nightmare in virtual reality. There should be a warning for people already skittish of survival horror games: Play at your own peril.</p><div id=\"cdea7826231d4ff0a2e74abf856050e2\"></div><p>Just like with <em>Gran Turismo</em> 7, virtual reality lets you appreciate the work that went into <em>Resident Evil Village</em> in entirely new ways. Walking through the game's creepy Eastern European village is even more chilling when it fills your field of view. You can always look away from a 2D screen, in VR you're forced to confront the horrors in front of you. (Sometimes closing your eyes isn't enough, not when you can hear the werewolf-like creatures skittering around the cottage you're hiding in.)</p><p>Since it's a first-person game, <em>Resident Evil Village</em> acquits itself well to VR. Exploration is smooth and not nausea-inducing, thankfully. And fighting off the game's various baddies is all the more thrilling when you're realistically aiming guns and other weapons. And yes, Lady Dimitrescu, the tall vampire woman who launched a thousand memes on the internet, is indeed <em>very</em> tall and imposing in VR.</p><p>I didn't have time to play through all of <em>Resident Evil Village</em> in virtual reality, but my first few hours with the game left a striking impression. Perhaps the future of virtual reality depends more on games like this, which can be enjoyed both as traditional 2D titles and with immersive headsets. We looked to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html\"><em>Half Life Alyx</em></a> to prove flagship VR games were possible. But what if we just need to think about bringing VR into more flagship games?</p><div id=\"adb186ac553c407ba240984ab51de687\"></div><p>The more time I spent with the PS VR2, the more frustrated I became with the state of the virtual reality industry. Everything I said in my review remains true: VR feels stagnant, and another expensive headset isn't going to fix that. Maybe it's okay if VR gaming never truly becomes mainstream, just like how not everyone plays racing games with steering wheels, or people can enjoy fighting games without expensive arcade sticks. Perhaps VR can just be another accessory \u2014 albeit one that takes a significant amount of development resources to support.</p><p><em>Gran Turismo 7 </em>and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> both prove that the PlayStation VR2 is a gateway to truly immersive virtual reality gaming. But a part of me still dreams for PC compatibility. While it's understandable why Sony may want to lock down its hardware, it's sort of like forcing a lion to live in a small zoo. The PS VR2 can't truly roar until it taps into the wild world of PC VR, which offers more experimental games and far faster graphical hardware than the PS5. If Sony ever wants to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/can-sony-reclaim-its-former-glory-120028019.html\">return to its innovator roots</a>, it needs to take more chances.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gran-turismo-7-resident-evil-village-ps-vr2-review-181810802.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gran-turismo-7-resident-evil-village-ps-vr2-review-181810802.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-06 18:18:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "'Cities: Skylines II' heads to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2023", "description": "<p>Eight years and 12 million sales later, <em>Cities: Skylines</em> is getting a sequel. <a href=\"https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about\"><em>Cities: Skylines II</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is due to come out in 2023 on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, from original developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive.

It's made of plastic, and its 1,280 x 800 resolution display isn't as sharp as a full 1080p screen. Still, it's durable, its battery should last more than 10 hours on a charge, it charges over USB-C and you can expand its 32GB of storage up to 1TB with a microSD card. While it won't feel fast, it's serviceable if you stick to the basics, and its display gets bright enough. As with all Fire tablets, you'll get more out of it if you already subscribe to Amazon Prime and use services like Prime Video, Audible or the Kindle app. It's not a great value at full price, but its shortcomings should be easier to accept at this deal price.</p><p>Elsewhere in the sale, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BbWF6b24tT2ZmaWNpYWwtU2l0ZS1GaXJlLUhELUtpZHMtOC1UYWJsZXQtOC1pbmNoLURpc3BsYXktMjAyMi1yZWxlYXNlL2RwL0IwOUJHNUxGR1M_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbmstMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRkYjgyZWFkLWI1NzYtNGMxNS1hYzY3LTkyNDMxYWRiZmVjMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATgcK1VmWygnedHKLaP1bJvDWhA7vnKkUi1Q3pDeY15E&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmazon-Official-Site-Fire-HD-Kids-8-Tablet-8-inch-Display-2022-release%2Fdp%2FB09BG5LFGS\">the Kids</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BbWF6b24tT2ZmaWNpYWwtU2l0ZS1GaXJlLUhELUtpZHMtOC1Qcm8tVGFibGV0LTgtaW5jaC1EaXNwbGF5LTIwMjItcmVsZWFzZS9kcC9CMDlCRzYzWk1NP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLW5rLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZGI4MmVhZC1iNTc2LTRjMTUtYWM2Ny05MjQzMWFkYmZlYzMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXt6xRwXEDwhW8GKYp9CZK1sUaM6NisREC0-W75YWLby&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmazon-Official-Site-Fire-HD-Kids-8-Pro-Tablet-8-inch-Display-2022-release%2Fdp%2FB09BG63ZMM\">Kids Pro</a> versions of the Fire HD 8 are each down to $100.

After discussions with the European Commission and EU consumer protection regulators, WhatsApp will make it easier for users to reject updates to the terms of service. The Meta-owned brand will also &quot;clearly explain&quot; when rejecting those terms will limit use of services, the Commission says. People can also dismiss notifications about these updates, and delay reviewing those updates.</p><p>The company further confirmed that it's not sharing personal data with other Meta brands, including Facebook, for the sake of advertising. It also isn't sharing that data with third-parties, the Commission says.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>WhatsApp sparked an outcry at the start of 2021 when it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-facebook-data-sharing-205451955.html\">asked users to share data</a> like connection info and transactions with sibling brands like Facebook as part of its new privacy policy. While little changed for users, some interpreted this as a sign WhatsApp was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes-statement-encryption-surveillance-172224753.html\">sharing messages and calls</a> with Facebook. That prompted a mass exodus to competing secure messaging services <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/signal-recovers-from-outage-183256503.html\">like Signal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/telegram-import-whatsapp-chat-history-142834778.html\">Telegram</a>. WhatsApp tried to reassure users that it couldn't access the end-to-end encrypted conversations, but the backlash led the company to pause the policy rollout. When it did reintroduce the new terms, it added clarifications but warned that the service would gradually stop working unless users agreed to the terms.</p><p>The European Commission got involved in January last year, when it responded to unfair practice allegations by asking WhatsApp to better explain how it uses people's data. Last June, it also asked WhatsApp to more clearly explain its business model and whether or not it profited from personal data.</p><p>We've asked Meta for comment. The Commission's Consumer Protection Cooperation Network plans to &quot;actively monitor&quot; WhatsApp's application of these promises with future policy updates. Any violations could prompt fines and other penalties. The chat giant also isn't the only one facing scrutiny. The Commission says it's continuing to look for &quot;dark patterns,&quot; or attempts to unfairly push users into accepting subscriptions, policy changes or other unwanted features. Don't be surprised if there are more agreements like WhatsApp's in the near future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-will-make-it-easier-to-reject-updates-to-its-terms-of-service-151007438.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-will-make-it-easier-to-reject-updates-to-its-terms-of-service-151007438.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-06 15:10:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: The Justice Department wants to keep Sam Bankman-Fried on a flip phone", "description": "<p>FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried may be stuck <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/justice-department-wants-sam-bankman-fried-to-use-a-flip-phone-for-the-rest-of-his-bail-201356652.html\">using a feature phone</a>.

One category would include resources his defense team says are critical to his case. The other has 23 websites SBF could use to order food, read the news and watch streaming content.</p><p>\u2013 Mat Smith</p><p></p><p><em>The Morning After isn\u2019t just a</em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/\"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> \u2013  it\u2019s also a daily podcast.

It supplied the engines with emissions-free &quot;green&quot; hydrogen (made via electrolysis from renewable power sources), connected via its own modules that keep the highly volatile gas in liquid form for up to 100 hours.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"A Dash-8 commuter plane flew for 15 minutes with a hydrogen fuel-cell engine\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/c37e10f0-bbe4-11ed-9c3a-e2711e5f74f3\" style=\"height: 3024; width: 4032;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Universal Hydrogen</div></figure><p>The Dash-8 was highly modified to accommodate the engine, 30kg (66 pounds) of liquid hydrogen and two racks of electronics and sensors. While the turbine engine was mainly used for takeoff, pilots were able to cruise mostly on hydrogen power during the second circuit. The flight attained a height of 3,500 feet.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it had some yaw due to the imbalance in power, &quot;the airplane handled beautifully, and the noise and vibrations from the fuel cell powertrain are significantly lower than from the conventional turbine engine,&quot; said chief pilot (and former US Air Force test pilot) Alex Kroll. The company received FAA approval for the flight <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230207005637/en/Universal-Hydrogen-Completes-First-Taxi-Tests-and-Is-Granted-Experimental-Airworthiness-Certificate-by-the-Federal-Aviation-Administration\">just weeks ago</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The British/American firm ZeroAvia flew with a similar configuration on its twin-engine, 19-seat Dornier 228 plane <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/zeroavia-flight-largest-aircraft-hydrogen-electric-engine-201422671.html\">earlier this year</a>.

Hydrogen has about a quarter the energy density of regular jet A fuel, so it's only good for short hops. And as I've detailed in an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-23-hydrogen-fuel-cell-explainer.html\">explainer</a>, there's very little hydrogen fuel infrastructure, it's tricky to work with and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/513855main_ASK_41s_explosive.pdf\">extremely</a> explosive. Still, Universal Hydrogen is confident it can beat the odds. &quot;Our business model resolves the chicken-and-egg problem between hydrogen airplanes and hydrogen infrastructure by developing both in parallel and with a uniquely low-cost approach,&quot; said CEO and co-founder Paul Eremenko.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/a-dash-8-commuter-plane-flew-for-15-minutes-with-a-hydrogen-fuel-cell-engine-060607763.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/a-dash-8-commuter-plane-flew-for-15-minutes-with-a-hydrogen-fuel-cell-engine-060607763.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-06 06:06:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
