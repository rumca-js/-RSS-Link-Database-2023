<p></p><p>Life, death, taxes and Ivan Toney scoring penalties. The Brentford striker may be facing a ban of up to six months for allegedly breaking betting rules but his 22nd successful spot kick in a row ensured Thomas Frank’s side took the bragging rights in this west London derby between two of the Premier League’s over-performing clubs.</p><p>While Marco Silva’s side could have major cause to complain about the penalty being awarded by the referee Anthony Taylor after Manor Solomon had cancelled out Ethan Pinnock’s deflected opening goal with his fifth goal in successive matches, Frank will not have too much sympathy as Brentford moved to within a point of Fulham in seventh having played two games less after Mathias Jensen added a late third before Carlos Vinícius netted for the visitors deep into injury time. But after a week that saw Toney ask the Football Association to carry out an investigation into leaked reports <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/02/football-gambling-hypocritically-clamps-down-ivan-toney">regarding his potential punishment</a>, the England striker did his talking with his feet as he took his season’s tally in the Premier League to 15, behind only Erling Haaland and Harry Kane.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/06/brentford-fulham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This documentary on the pop star’s arrest for a ‘lewd act’ shows an era so breathtakingly homophobic that the shaming of gay men was a blood sport – and his response to it was one of absolute grace</p><p>Los Angeles, 9 April, 1998. Two days after George Michael is arrested by an undercover police officer for performing a “lewd act” in a Beverly Hills public toilet. His cousin, Andros Georgiou, rushes from London to be by his side. Outside Michael’s house, more than 50 international camera crews are gathered. There are helicopters overhead; paparazzi everywhere. Georgiou circles the block trying to phone his cousin. Finally Michael answers and apologises for not picking up. He was blow-drying his hair. One of many details in George Michael: Outed that made me love him even more than I did as a screaming teenage girl. Which is a lot.</p><p>Inside, Michael explains to his people that he, as Georgiou puts it, “had a few glasses, got a bit horny, and fancied a bit of sex”. Hardly the stuff of the scandal of the decade, but these were viciously homophobic times, as the first episode of this two-part documentary barely needs to reminds us. The tabloids were king, and outing people in the public sphere became a national blood sport. Which is the true scandal of this story. If Outed had a hysteria-inducing headline it might be “Tabloid’s Shame”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/06/george-michael-outed-review-this-will-make-you-love-him-even-more-than-you-did-as-a-screaming-teen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The government is failing to make good on Britain’s net zero pledges to the world</p><p>Last summer, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) delivered a 600-page <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/2022/06/29/current-programmes-will-not-deliver-net-zero/" title="">assessment</a> of the United Kingdom’s journey towards net zero targets. The scathing conclusions could be summed up in a single sentence: Westminster continues to talk the talk, but a lack of follow-through means the country is failing to walk the walk.</p><p>In too many areas, the CCC found, goals were being undermined by failures in delivery programmes. There was a “shocking gap”, it reported, in policymaking to drive better insulation of homes. Progress on reducing farming emissions had been “glacial”. The bald conclusion was that the “current strategy will not deliver net zero” by 2050, as legally required.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/06/the-guardian-view-on-the-uks-net-zero-targets-time-to-walk-the-walk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A democracy would get the bailout the country needs. A dictatorship will find getting the money much harder</p><p>“Why do you think that, at 67, I would start a career as a dictator?” Tunisia’s president, Kais Saied, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/01/world/middleeast/tunisia-president-kais-saied.html" title="">told</a> the New York Times in 2021, quoting the words of the French statesman Charles de Gaulle. Mr Saied had good reason to be defensive. Just weeks before he had sacked the prime minister, suspended parliament and assumed executive power. Mr Saied’s “self-coup” took place at the height of the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/8/catastrophic-tunisia-covid" title="">pandemic</a>. His argument was that his regime might seem authoritarian but it would largely confine itself to containing political threats. However, he now appears a familiar post-revolutionary figure: a dictator who, facing multiple crises and out of his depth, opts to eliminate the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/24/tunisia-forces-arrest-senior-opposition-figure-as-crackdown-escalates" title="">opposition</a>.</p><p>The list of <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/tunisia/2023/02/15/tunisias-kais-saied-says-detainees-behind-food-shortages-and-rising-prices/" title="">critics</a> rounded up by Tunisia’s police is growing. Over the past few weeks the leaders of Islamist and secularist parties were dragged from their homes. Also behind bars are prominent critics, including lawyers, business executives and the director of a popular radio station. Mr Saied has criminalised dissent, hiding behind the absurd conspiracy theory that he was jailing “<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/02/24/tunisia-wave-arrests-targets-critics-and-opposition-figures" title="">terrorists</a>” and “traitors”. The president also launched an attack on the judiciary. He declared enemy “accomplices” those judges who might exonerate dissidents of the flimsy charge that they were part of a treasonous cabal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/06/the-guardian-view-on-tunisias-one-man-show-bad-for-the-country-and-its-people">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Known for his nuanced portrayals of men, the actor is changing perceptions of the undergarment once associated with heavily muscled hard-nuts</p><p>Paul Mescal, the actor who rose to fame after his role in the BBC’s adaptation of Normal People, loves wearing vests. He wears them to the shops, he wears them to star in musicals and he wears them to dance around hotel rooms for the Rolling Stones’ music videos. He even wore <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d29ef448-47da-4d70-86ed-1a37f27692f1">one vest on top of another vest</a> on top of a smart white shirt in the Financial Times. Most recently, he wore one under a double-breasted duck-egg blue jacket on the red carpet. He is, officially, first in line to the singlet throne.</p><p>The one place Mescal doesn’t wear them, however, is to play Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire. Many cite Marlon Brando, who wore one to play the wife-beating Kowalski on screen, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/opinion/are-we-really-still-calling-this-shirt-a-wife-beater.html">inspiration for the now thankfully sidelined term “wife-beater”</a>; the stage director Rebecca Frecknall <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/paul-mescal-banned-wearing-vest-132132457.html">reportedly banned</a> Mescal from wearing the same kind of vest for his role in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/13/a-streetcar-named-desire-review-almeida-london-paul-mescal">the new London production</a>, because she wanted to move away from the “performance baggage” involved in the play.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/06/getting-it-off-his-chest-the-myth-and-meaning-of-paul-mescals-vest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A winter of discontent at Stamford Bridge could all change if head coach can help team progress in Champions League tie</p><p>It is not Graham Potter’s style to make the story about himself. Asked whether knocking Borussia Dortmund out of the Champions League would change the story of his Chelsea career, Potter remained as measured as ever. “I’m not really thinking in that way,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “I’’m just thinking about how important it is for the team and the club. It’s a chance to get to the last eight. We’re playing against a top opponent in a really good vein of form. It’s a huge challenge.”</p><p>But not an insurmountable one. “What an opportunity,” Potter continued, briefly dropping his guard, briefly letting in some emotion. There was a line about making sure that Stamford Bridge is rocking, and hidden beneath the calm exterior was a sense that this is a defining moment for Potter; a chance for him to win over the fans and prove he belongs at Chelsea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/06/graham-potter-faces-defining-moment-in-chelsea-story-against-dortmund">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Unlike the Swedish government, the British government refuses to recognise our potential and we feel worthless, says one refugee living in a UK hotel</p><p>Re your article on halting migrant boats (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/05/tory-tough-talk-asylum-seekers-small-boats" title="">Sunak isn’t halting migrant boats or chasing traffickers: he’s just chasing headlines again, 5 March</a>), I am a refugee in the UK (previously a refugee in Sweden) and I would like to comment on the point about the participation of refugees in society. While everyone talks about refugees living in hotels, this is not much different from living in prison. It takes six months from our arrival to be able to study, and 12 months to be able to work (but only in very limited sectors). In fact, we are locked in our rooms because we don’t have money to go out. In the prime of our youth, we feel worthless and depressed. Instead of using the potential of refugees, the British government is suppressing most of them.</p><p>Scary newspaper headlines bring a lot of fear and terror to the lives of refugees. In Sweden, refugees are allowed to study and work from the first day. I worked there for two years with a contract and paid taxes for two years while studying at the same time. The British government is not trying to solve the refugee problem. It is trying to prevent people from coming, and has no real or effective solution in mind.<br /><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/06/refugees-like-myself-want-to-contribute-to-uk-society-but-we-arent-allowed-to">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Filmed in a remote Bhutan village, Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom captures a way of life that is rapidly vanishing. Its Oscar-nominated director talks about growing up in a country where prosperity is measured by happiness, not GDP</p><p>It took eight days for Pawo Choyning Dorji to trek up to the location of his debut film, a settlement of 56 people so high in the Himalayas that it had no communication with the world below. Everything his 35-strong crew might need for the shoot had to be hauled up by mule, with solar batteries for power because there was no electricity. The villagers he was enlisting to take part had never seen a lightbulb. “They’d never even seen sliced bread,” he says, “and had no idea how to eat it.” Nor did they have any understanding of what it might mean to appear in a film. “My only instruction to them was, ‘Tell your story to this box.’”</p><p>The result is a unique and beautiful film, Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom. Nominated for the best international film Oscar last year, Lunana records a way of life in Bhutan that was vanishing in real time: even as the company were packing up after the 2018 shoot, engineers were moving in to install the first 3G masts alongside the yaks grazing on the mountainside.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/himalayan-bhutan-herders-lunana-yak-in-the-classroom-oscar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Having dragged themselves away from danger, a chaotic 6-1 loss to Atlético sucked Jorge Sampaoli’s side back in</p><p>The first to leave was a kitman carrying a bag of equipment and a haunted look. At the top of the stairs, Sevilla dressing room to the right, Atlético’s to the left, a familiar face from better times was waiting to give him a hug. There were a few quiet words but no comfort. One by one the rest followed: Sevilla’s players entered the tunnel alone, lost in dark thoughts, each more broken than the last. The coach moved faster than any of them, just wanting out. Directors appeared who could do nothing. The captain’s jaw clenched so hard teeth could have crumbled. There were internal monologues, external ones too, but mostly silence, tape unravelled and thrown to the floor.</p><p>“I have no words to explain what we feel,” Lucas Ocampos said, when at last he was able to say something. “It hurts, a lot.” The day before, Jorge Sampaoli, the Sevilla coach, had insisted his side needed to “escape the desperation”, but there was no way out. Instead, the desperation deepened. Sevilla had just been hammered 6-1 by Atlético Madrid. “This goes beyond the limits,” Marcos Acuña said. When Sampaoli appeared in the press conference, he was barely intelligible. “Negativity” had surrounded his team, he said. And now? Somewhere in the words that fell almost at random was an “impotence”, a “tremendously complicated”, and an admission: Osasuna had been a blow and this was even bigger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/06/sevilla-dragged-back-into-la-ligas-sarlacc-pit-after-atletico-annihilation">Continue reading...</a>

## Harrison Birtwistle tribute – music of power and beauty as Sinfonietta remember a great friendship

<p><strong>Queen Elizabeth Hall, London</strong><br />Longtime collaborators of the late composer, this London Sinfonietta tribute concert, conducted by Martyn Brabbins, was a poignant occasion that showcased both the excoriating power and tranquillity of Birtwistle’s music</p><p>The relationship between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/harrison-birtwistle">Harrison Birtwistle</a> and the London Sinfonietta spanned more than half a century, and took in more than 30 premieres and performances in 28 countries. The orchestra’s tribute to the great composer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/18/sir-harrison-birtwistle-obituary">who died 11 months ago</a>, was fulsome and sincere – a concert conducted by Martyn Brabbins that included both the first and last of the large-scale ensemble works that the Sinfonietta introduced, and which also involved musicians from the Manson Ensemble of the Royal Academy of Music, where Birtwistle studied clarinet in the late 1950s, a connection that he renewed at the end of his life. And, with the news of the sudden death three days earlier of <a href="https://londonsinfonietta.org.uk/channel/news/nicholas-snowman-obe-1944-2023">Nicholas Snowman</a>, co-founder of the Sinfonietta, who was a close friend of Birtwistle and a steadfast champion of his music, the occasion had taken on an extra poignancy.</p><p>Snowman in fact commissioned the earliest piece in this programme, Verses for Ensembles, which the Sinfonietta first performed in 1969. With its block-like construction, raw, uncompromising soundworld of wind instruments and percussion, and mysterious elements of ritual as the instrumentalists move around the platform, Verses remains in many respects the archetypal Birtwistle score, and, as Brabbins’s performance showed, it has lost none of its excoriating power, derived in large part from its debts to Stravinsky and Varèse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/06/harrison-birtwistle-tribute-music-of-power-and-beauty-as-sinfonietta-remember-a-great-friendship">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sheep are descended from a ‘mouflon’. Yes (yes!)</p><p>The wind is blowing: it is the wind that changes the seasons, hot to cold. It blows and blows until the season knows it is time to sit on its suitcase, overstuffed with things that happened, zip it up and travel to the other side of the world. <br /><br />Sometimes, the season gets trapped for a week, like a little whirlwind of leaves, or one leaf on a small plant going round and round, or moving in a figure eight: an incantation. You get one last period of very cold or very hot. You are trapped, too, like a sheep in its wool: you are in the present, there is no going forward until the season is on its way.</p><p>In Things I Don’t Want to Know, Deborah Levy is carrying her luggage up a steep path on a mountain in Spain. “The smell of wood fired in the stone houses below and the bells on sheep grazing in the mountains and the strange silence that happens in between the bells chiming suddenly made me want to smoke.”</p><p>What was natural was hedgerows, hawthorn, skylarks, the chaffinch on the orchard bough.

<p>It may be just a game but some players have gone on to careers in physics, engineering and aeronautics. Now the team behind Kerbal Space Program 2 is working with the European Space Agency to make it even more realistic</p><p>When Dr Uri Shumlack was contacted by a video game developer who wanted to discuss his work on interstellar propulsion, for a game about spaceflight, he was wary. A professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the University of Washington, he was a busy individual, and not exactly an avid gamer. He asked some of his engineering undergraduates whether they had heard of a game called Kerbal Space Program, only to discover that half the class were there <em>because </em>of the game.</p><p>First playable in 2011, Kerbal Space Program is an idiosyncratic and extremely difficult video game that involves getting little green aliens off the surface of their planet using rockets that you must cobble together from a library of parts. To do this, though – and leave the launchpad without exploding – you have to develop a pretty good understanding of the physics of space travel, calculating orbit trajectories and figuring out how much fuel you need, and whether you can carry it without messing up your thrust-to-weight ratio. It is beloved by space and astrophysics enthusiasts, who have posted thousands of hours of gameplay video showing off their unlikely crafts and ambitious missions in this simulated solar system.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/06/kerbal-space-program-helping-space-flight-experts-of-the-future">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A former minister says that in 2020, the government considered plans to cull our furry friends. For a nation of animal lovers, it would have been the final straw</p><p>Cast your mind back to 2020, because chances are you’ve repressed it. There’s a novel coronavirus on the loose and millions of people are locked down in their homes. Some have been furloughed, others sacked. Everyone’s life plans, from holidays, weddings and trying for a baby, to house moves, funerals and exams, are cancelled. The feverish languish in their beds, and the healthy wonder when they’ll succumb. In the absence of air traffic, the birdsong is insanely loud, and punctuated by sirens. In the streets, people yell at each other for getting too close, and loitering with a coffee in a park might get you reprimanded through a megaphone. In the space of a few short weeks, the world is unrecognisable, and it would all be a bit comical if it wasn’t so scary and sad. Yet little did you or I know that – according to the former health minister Lord Bethell – behind closed doors, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/01/uk-cat-cull-was-considered-early-in-covid-crisis-ex-minister-says">government was considering</a> whether or not to mass murder our cats.</p><p>I adopted my cat – then a six-week-old kitten – in May 2020.

They play Cassie and Matthew, a couple from London, separating in their 40s.</p><p>To the outside world, Cassie and Matthew’s divorce looks like the model of amicability: they’ve managed to agree on everything without going to court. But it gets messy at their final mediation session, as years of hurt and resentment boil over. Cassie has been the breadwinner, and she can’t help bringing up the fact that she’s “giving” Matthew the house. Furious, he yells that he gave up a career in teaching to raise the kids. It’s a shaky start to the film, a bit shouty with some awkwardly clumsy comedy inserted by their hopeless mediator.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/the-wife-and-her-house-husband-review-divorce-drama-gets-under-the-skin-of-marriage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We’re used to randomised trials in medicine. Why not apply the same rigour to policy?</p><p>If you’re looking for recent reasons to be proud of Britain, it would be hard to find a better example than the Recovery series of clinical trials. Conceived in haste in the early days of the pandemic, Recovery (which stands for<a href="https://www.recoverytrial.net/"> Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy</a>) sought to find drugs to help treat people seriously ill with the novel disease. It brought together epidemiologists, statisticians and health workers to test a range of promising existing drugs at massive scale across the NHS.</p><p>The secret of Recovery’s success is that it was a series of large, fast, randomised experiments, designed to be as easy as possible for doctors and nurses to administer in the midst of a medical emergency. And it worked wonders: within three months, it had demonstrated that dexamethasone, a cheap and widely available steroid, reduced Covid deaths by a fifth to a third. In the months that followed, Recovery identified four more effective drugs, and along the way showed that various popular treatments, including hydroxychloroquine, President Trump’s tonic of choice, were useless.

## I thought my opinion of Boris Johnson couldn’t be lower. Then he nominated his father for a knighthood | Zoe Williams

<p>The former prime minister either sees the UK as his own personal fiefdom – or he has an ulterior motive …</p><p>Ah, Boris Johnson – such a safe pair of hands for any eventuality or crisis, national or international, but where you can really rely on him is in matters of discretion, judgment and not taking the biscuit. No, no, we’re not idiots, and that is not what any of us think. We know our way around this man and his traits: we know there are question marks over his truthfulness, but never any doubt as to his self-interest and brass neck. So come on, the fact that the former prime minister has managed to surprise, even shock, anyone with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/05/boris-johnson-nominates-father-for-a-knighthood">his resignation honours list</a> is surely cause for some grim admiration. How is it possible for Johnson to disappoint anyone, when our expectations were already so low? It’s like a superpower.</p><p>His list was <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-nominates-his-father-for-a-knighthood-vfj6bbjvn">revealed by the Times</a>, although has yet to be officially confirmed, presumably because officials are still speechless. It is said to be exceptionally long: 100 names, set against 60 nominations from Theresa May and 62 from David Cameron. There are four sitting MPs on it, which, being unprecedented, raises a few questions about the long game: is the plan that they sit in the Lords <em>and</em> the Commons, just for the thrill of upturning the constitutional matrix? Or will they step down from their elected positions, so that someone else, maybe some charming, floppy blond rascal, can stand in one of their seats, should his own start to look dicey?</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/06/boris-johnson-father-knighthood-opinion-couldnt-be-lower">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Little orchestrates Arsenal’s cup win, Russo helps Manchester United open gap at the top and Shaw shows golden scoring touch</p><p>Given that Kim Little is 32 years old, and 17 months on from international retirement, you could be forgiven for thinking her career is easing to its end. Technically, it probably is reaching its latter stages. However, a masterful controlling performance in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/05/arsenal-chelsea-womens-continental-cup-final-match-report">Arsenal’s 3-1 defeat of Chelsea</a> in the Continental Cup final demonstrated her continuing quality and how big a hole she will leave at the club when she goes. Emma Hayes said Little “ran the show” against her Chelsea side, and she wasn’t wrong. Little was the conductor of an aggressive and passionate Arsenal orchestra. “When you thought she couldn’t get better, she puts on that performance,” said her manager, Jonas Eidevall. “I told Kim straight after the game: ‘I wasn’t sure if it was possible [but] this is the best you’ve been since I’ve been the coach.’ She was phenomenal in the game, how she connects the team, the duels, the work rate, the decision-making on the ball. She played close to a perfect match.” <strong>SW</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/06/wsl-and-continental-cup-final-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

Now, it might be different. It felt that way when Nico Schlotterbeck, the crown prince of defensive drama in these parts, saw Timo Werner’s late shot speed past Alexander Meyer, Dortmund’s stand-in goalkeeper, and reacted to clear off the line with a mixture of chest and shoulder, all but sealing the win. Schlotterbeck clenched his fists, celebrating it like a goal.</p><p>It wasn’t quite Roman Weidenfeller smothering Arjen Robben’s penalty late on when Bayern visited Westfalen in the spring of 2012, but it was in the same sphere of emotion.

<p>A short and intriguing history of the flamboyant radicchio illustrates this recipe for a rich and satisfying way to roast a chicken</p><p><strong><br /></strong>Radicchio: a single word for a whole world of red and white leaves. As always, it began in a wild, spontaneous way, with bitter <em>Cichorium </em><em>intybus</em>, which grows all over the planet and has many names. Particular cultivation and development took place in the north of Italy: Veneto, Trentino, Friuli-Venezia Giulia.</p><p>Red leaves as we know them started in the early 1900s, when Belgian and Italian agronomists developed a technique called <em>imbianchimento</em> (whitening, blanching or preforcing). Pulled from the soil and placed in water in dark sheds, the plants’ chlorophyll production is inhibited, causing them to lose their green pigmentation and develop dark red, white-veined and sturdy leaves. Genetic selection, local competition and time saw the development of distinctive varieties, with different degrees of earthy bitterness, each taking the name of the places where they were developed. Radicchio grown in these places is protected, but of course it can be grown anywhere you care to plant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/06/roast-chicken-radicchio-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our slow travel expert reflects on a milestone in early railway history as she takes the Railjet from Salzburg to Vienna</p><p>Most travellers from Britain bound for the 1873 World Fair in Vienna would have had their first encounter with Austria in Salzburg, whence it was an easy onward journey to Vienna. In those days, the fastest train was the lunchtime express from Salzburg, which chugged to the Austrian capital in just under eight hours.</p><p>Times have changed. A glance at Table 950 in the March 2023 <a href="https://www.europeanrailtimetable.eu/pre-order-spring-2023--printed-edition-1264-p.asp">European Rail Timetable</a> shows three direct trains each hour from Salzburg to Vienna, all taking under three hours for the 200-mile journey. It’s a fine ride – every bit as engaging today as it was when Thomas Cook’s clients, clutching their hotel coupons and pocket timetables, made their way to the World Fair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/mar/06/austria-railjet-salzburg-to-vienna-rail-route">Continue reading...</a>

## No pain, plenty of gain: why taking it easy can be the key to getting fitter – and happier

<p>Whether you’re running, working out in the gym or lifting weights, the perfect workout doesn’t have you gasping for breath. Here’s why less can be more</p><p>There is something about the easy memorability of motivational quotes such as “no pain no gain” that makes them feel instinctively right<em>.</em> This could be partly because, as <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00282" title="">at least one psychological study</a> suggests, we believe things more readily when they rhyme. It also makes a sort of intuitive sense to those of us who, even if we do exercise, are not as fast, muscular or lean as we’d like. There must be something we’re getting wrong; is it our unwillingness to endure pain, or the discomfort of extreme effort? But how true is the adage, and is it possible to make gains without feeling the burn?</p><p>“In fitness, the answer is always: ‘It depends,’” says Zack Cahill, a senior trainer at Evolve Fitness in London. “What is the goal? What are you trying to achieve in the workout?” For aerobic exercise such as longer runs, the slower and longer you go, the better. So, if you’re planning on tackling your first 5k – or even a marathon – it’s fine to take your training sessions at a modest pace at which you could still hold a (slightly out-of-breath) conversation. “Most training for endurance events should be done to build a strong aerobic engine, which means easy runs,” says strength and endurance coach Beatrice Schaer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/06/no-pain-plenty-of-gain-why-taking-it-easy-can-be-the-key-to-getting-fitter-and-happier">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A lonely teenager lands a job as the artist’s typist in a wry and quietly bold coming-of-age tale</p><p>Someone should write a thesis on the titles that young women from Ireland are giving their novels. <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/26/sally-rooney-normal-people-review-elegant-intelligent-tender">Normal People</a></em>. <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/06/exciting-times-by-naoise-dolan-review-a-bracing-witty-debut">Exciting Times</a></em>. <em>Nothing Special</em>. “My characters inhabit coffee shops, they take long, pointless walks, they conduct themselves without aim or ambition,” Nicole Flattery once said, underselling her debut collection, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/09/show-them-good-time-nicole-flattery-review-darkly-funny">Show Them </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/09/show-them-good-time-nicole-flattery-review-darkly-funny">a Good Time</a></em>, about protagonists not entirely unlike herself – a reader trap common among Flattery’s cohort – navigating millennial work and womanhood in surreal tales lit up by off-kilter phrase-making.<br /><br />Yet at a time when plausibly autofictional debuts often give way to plausibly autofictional follow-ups, there was no little intrigue in the announcement that Flattery was at work on a novel about Andy Warhol and his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/dec/03/-sp-jeremy-deller-interview-my-summer-in-andy-warhol-factory">Factory</a> studio. What, you wondered, brought her to that already much-mythologised subject? And what could she possibly bring to it? In fact, the resulting novel, far from a curveball, makes perfect sense: a wry coming-of-age tale told by a lonely teenage girl in Warhol’s orbit, <em>Nothing Special</em> could be an elaboration of one of Flattery’s short stories, which frequently turn on a thirst for experience and the aftertaste of the charade required to achieve it.<br /><br />It centres on the making of Warhol’s <em>a, A Novel</em> (1968), an experimental slice-of-life breeze block built from taped conversations typed up by two schoolgirls, one of whom Flattery imagines as our narrator, Mae. We join her in 2010, deep in middle age, before we cut quickly back to 1966, when she’s 17, riding escalators with an eye out for male attention, having been cold-shouldered at school and left alone by her mother, a waitress with a drink problem and an on-off boyfriend whose household presence seldom seems healthy.</p><p>The tone – numb, ironic, smarter than thou – is, we understand, partly an act, as befits a teenager who steals her mother’s bra to meet an older man or shoplifts a shirt for a job interview. When a doctor somewhat creepily points her towards a “friend [who] has an art studio, an expanding business, over on East 72nd Street, and always needs girls to go and do errands for him”, it accelerates her desire for independence, not least because of the sexual content of the tapes she starts transcribing, to say nothing of the parties. More poignantly instructive is the precarious friendship she forms with another girl typist, likewise in flight from her upbringing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/06/nothing-special-by-nicole-flattery-review-adventures-of-a-factory-girl">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Workers at a sugar factory in Guadeloupe read the records of a trial that followed the death of a slave in 1842, with uncomfortably strong modern-day echoes</p><p>The past returns in all its ugliness and torment in Sylvaine Dampierre’s rigorous documentary which challenges the preconceived notion that the march of time automatically parallels the march of progress. In 1842 in the Guadeloupe archipelago, an enslaved man named Sébastien was accused of sorcery by his master, and left to die in his cell. Centuries later, workers at a sugar factory in Marie-Galante, the island where Sébastien died, read out transcipts from the trial surrounding his death.</p><p>In opening a portal to the cruelty suffered by Sébastien at the hands of his masters, who were acquitted, the film draws a link to labour exploitation endured by the factory workers in modern-day Marie-Galante. Their jobs are precarious and expendable. As employment opportunities on the island are scarce, the workers have little choice but to be subjected to gruelling conditions for inadequate wages. Scenes where the men harvest sugar cane under the burning sun eerily mirror passages from the historical court documents, which describe the physical toil of field work in harrowing detail. Slavery is long abolished, yet the current system of exploitation continues to leave little agency to the workers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/words-of-negroes-review-sorcery-trial-documentary-raises-ghosts-of-slavery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The changes go beyond removing one or two offensive words – they’re hamfisted and tin-eared exercises in bowdlerism</p><p>Recently it was announced that the novels of Roald Dahl, the notoriously bigoted but gifted and enduringly popular children’s author, had been edited to eliminate words, phrases and sentiments that readers might find upsetting.</p><p>Novels such as The Witches, Matilda, and James and the Giant Peach have been cleansed of negative references to a character’s appearance, race or gender. “Enormously fat” had been changed to “enormous”, “mothers” and “fathers” to the more gender-neutral “parents”. The adjective “black” was eliminated, even in reference to objects. Jokes were explained, passages modified to assure the reader that Dahl’s snarky humor was all in good fun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/06/yes-roald-dahl-was-a-bigot-but-thats-no-excuse-to-re-write-his-books">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Born of Slovenia’s rural DIY free festival scene, the band’s revelatory mix of improvisatory acoustics, post-jazz and drone music is coming to the UK this month</p><p>What is folk music? Is it music specific to a region and embodying particular cultural traditions, or could there be a more open-ended definition? Perhaps it’s a product of the imagination that can be rooted in traditional modes of expression but also take flight in wonderfully unpredictable ways. Certainly that is where Slovenian trio Širom can be found. They call their music “imaginary folk”, which suggests that in their hands, folk music can travel as far and wide as its creators desire.</p><p>The band’s Iztok Koren explains: “It could be traditional music but it’s also experimental. Living folk music is always contemporary – we don’t play museum music. We don’t believe there is only one correct way to play either an instrument or a song. The songs should be alive and that means they will be changing organically.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/06/songs-should-be-alive-slovenian-trio-sirom-on-their-imaginary-folk-music">Continue reading...</a>

## Conflict, exhaustion, joy and pain: how Alice Neel shattered the taboos around motherhood

<p>After centuries of exquisite Madonnas, the painter laid bare the complex truth about bearing and bringing up children – and inspired generations of successors</p><p>Last week, to coincide with her exhibition at the Barbican in London, I hosted a conversation about Alice Neel between the artists Chantal Joffe and Christina Kimeze. We were analysing <a href="https://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/2021/alice-neel">Spanish Party</a> (1938) when Kimeze pointed out something simple the rest of us might have missed. What at first seems like a party scene is, on closer inspection, about parent/child dynamics: each streak of fluorescent colour highlights the visibility of the children in the picture. “That makes them impossible to ignore,” Kimeze said. “You have these adults trying to have a good time, but they look miserable, like they’re going through the motions – the children are still awake!Spanish Party speaks to the complexities of trying to still do what you want after having children – the things you used to do but that just aren’t the same.”</p><p>Galleries are full of depictions of motherhood – the Madonna and Child – but so often these portrayals are idealised, symbolic rather than actualised, and from the male perspective. So how can female artists reimagine their own experiences of motherhood? “Neel made me feel that it’s possible to paint and be a mother,” Joffe tells me. “Not only that, but she makes the subject of motherhood seem legitimate.” Neel painted many aspects of motherhood – pregnancy, mothers at work, family dynamics, grief.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/06/conflict-exhaustion-joy-and-pain-how-alice-neel-shattered-the-taboos-around-motherhood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arsenal find a way, Phil Foden recaptures form but not fitness and Manchester United’s old habits resurface</p><p>Roberto Firmino scoring Liverpool’s seventh and final goal on Sunday was such an apt way to complete their perfect day. Two goals each for Mohamed Salah, Darwin Núñez and Cody Gakpo pointed to Jürgen Klopp having found his next all-star forward line, and then on came the outgoing legend to cap it all with a neat finish and that trademark smile. Neither of the new men – nor Diogo Jota – is a like-for-like replacement for what Firmino and Sadio Mané once brought to Liverpool but Gakpo’s speed and finishing, plus Núñez’s chaotic element, can still complement Salah. Gakpo arrived at Liverpool in January as a player unfamiliar with playing centrally but Sunday confirmed him as the heir apparent to Firmino. Salah, Liverpool’s new record Premier League goalscorer, was at his brilliant best, a pest to Manchester United even during his team’s difficult first half. He remains a cut above, near-impossible to stop in full flow and drove Luke Shaw, in particular, to distraction. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/05/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Liverpool 7-0 Manchester United</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/04/arsenal-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">Arsenal 3-2 Bournemouth</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/04/the-boys-have-been-suffering-they-care-potter-relieved-after-chelsea-win">Chelsea 1-0 Leeds</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/06/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘He was central to music history’: the forgotten legacy of Leon Russell

<p>In an illuminating new book, the incredible highs and devastating lows of the influential musician are remembered  </p><p>Over a decade before he died, Leon Russell began writing a never-completed memoir that highlighted a story of deep humiliation. Upon noticing, at age 4, that his genitals looked different from those of his female cousin, the two began to examine each other in a secluded playhouse. That is, until a stern aunt discovered them and, instead of recognizing their play as innocent exploration, proceeded to parade Russell in front of his entire family while accusing him of any number of high crimes and heinous acts. “That incident affected me for my whole life,” wrote Russell, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/13/leon-russell-dies-pianist-a-song-for-you">who died in 2016</a>. “I tend to freeze up around any situation that involves people watching me.”</p><p>How ironic, then, that such a man would wind up, for a certain time, in rock music’s spotlight. During the core years of classic rock – between 1969 and 1973 – Russell was music’s North Star, pioneering a distinctly American sound that changed the career paths of stars, including Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Elton John. In that timeframe, he created a band that became one of music’s most legendary live acts; made Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen, for Joe Cocker; stole the show from a white hot line-up of artists at the Concert for Bangladesh; became a star in his own right with solo albums that featured songs that became standards, including Song for You and This Masquerade; and inspired the icon Willie Nelson to create his enduring outlaw country persona. Even before he became widely known, Russell had an esteemed career as a first call session pianist, performing with the Wrecking Crew on recordings by everyone from Frank Sinatra to The Beach Boys to the rococo productions of Phil Spector.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/05/he-was-central-to-music-history-the-forgotten-legacy-of-leon-russell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We all have a subjective age, as well as a chronological one. Months of insomnia have left me feeling like a barnacle-coated relic</p><p>Last Saturday, I went birdwatching, poked the rose bushes, visited a garden centre and then listened to a podcast while my husband batchcooked. “Ha ha, I am so old,” I texted a friend, recounting this. That “ha ha” meant: “Look at my young-fogeyish affectation; see how old beyond my years I act.” But after sending it, I realised that no “ha ha” was necessary: all these activities are wholly age-appropriate, indeed bog standard, for a 48-year-old.</p><p>I didn’t think I felt younger than my chronological age, a phenomenon known as “subjective age”, explored in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/subjective-age-how-old-you-feel-difference/673086/">the Atlantic</a> recently. It related how a study of <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03193996.pdf">1,470 Danes</a> revealed that people over 40 consistently feel about 20% younger than their actual age, while people under 25 feel older than they are. The prevalent, fairly basic theory posits that the over-40s are in denial about ageing; the journalist suggested it could be an optimistic expression of how much living we feel we still have to do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/06/most-fortysomethings-feel-much-younger-than-they-really-are-my-mind-insists-im-400">Continue reading...</a>

## My Sailor, My Love review – woman on the verge in drama of male cruelty

<p>Beautifully nuanced performances underpin an interesting drama that evolves from late-life romance into study of family trauma across generations</p><p>Shot on the misty Achill island off Ireland’s west coast, Finnish director Klaus Härö’s English-language debut grapples with the rough currents of late-in-life regrets and resentment. Cranky retired sea captain Howard (James Cosmo) – once content with shutting himself off from the outside world – is forced to open his disorderly home, and subsequently his heart, to Annie (Brid Brennan), a housekeeper hired by his overworked daughter Grace (Catherine Walker).</p><p>What begins as a lighthearted autumnal romance gradually evolves into a thorny study of familial grievances. Troubled by her own unhappy marriage, Grace grows increasingly bitter about her father’s new relationship. The reasons for her disturbing, self-destructive behaviours spring from a traumatic childhood, the details of which are revealed late in the film – too late, really, to fully flesh out her character.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/my-sailor-my-love-review-woman-on-the-verge-in-drama-of-male-cruelty">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Great Hampton Works, Birmingham</strong><br />Bertolt Brecht’s tale of four agitators dispatched from Soviet Russia to foment revolution in pre-communist China is almost a parody of previous Birmingham Opera Company productions</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/20/sir-graham-vick-obituary">the director Graham Vick died in 2021</a>, one feared for the future of <a href="https://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/">Birmingham Opera Company</a>, the community-based organisation with which he had created such memorable music theatre over more than 20 years.

Directed by <a href="https://anthony-almeida.com/">Anthony Almeida</a>, it’s staged in one of the shabby post-industrial spaces that seem to abound in Birmingham, and which BOC seem able to find so unfailingly.</p><p>Written in 1930, The Decision tells the story of four agitators who are dispatched from Soviet Russia to foment revolution in pre-communist China. En route they meet a young sympathiser who offers to be their guide, but when they return to Moscow, they confess that they were forced to execute him when his enthusiasm threatened their mission; in recounting their story they ask whether their brutal actions were justified. The central committee (the chorus) determines that the agitators had made the right decision, and that as a result they had been able to spread Marxist teaching and the “ABC of Communism”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/06/the-decision-review-didactic-two-dimensional-and-dramatically-obvious">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An eloquent, vigorous study by an NHS midwife speaks eloquently for the uterus, the organ on the frontline of the culture wars</p><p>By now, most organs have their own biography. Writers have advocated with visceral passion for their chosen body part, each structure apparently overlooked and undervalued. During Covid, a spate of non-fiction was published on lungs and breathing. While the UK is thigh-deep in controversy about what it means to be a woman, the uterus is having a moment. “For a very, very long time, western medicine has not given a shit about the womb apart from it being a container for the next male heir,” a doula tells Leah Hazard. But now, this pear-shaped muscle nestled in the bellies of half the population, has become a “clenched fist” on the frontline of the culture wars.</p><p>Hazard, a practising NHS midwife in Scotland, praised for her 2019 memoir, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/27/midwife-midwives-nothing-like-tv-smiling-angels-hi-tech-cheerleaders">Hard Pushed</a></em>, is here to speak – eloquently and vigorously – for this “most vital” organ. She is tired of the uterus being treated as a deviation from the male anatomical norm and sick of gynaecology’s routine excuse that “more research is needed” to understand it. Stitching together patient, academic and clinical testimonies, Hazard is herself “a celebrant” and “devout believer in the power and wisdom of birthing bodies”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/06/womb-the-inside-story-of-where-we-all-began-by-leah-hazard-review-the-bodys-misunderstood-marvel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Netflix docuseries tries to untangle the many theories surrounding the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines flight that shocked the world</p><p>The mystery began as a standard red-eye flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Forty-two minutes after midnight on 8 March 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight 370, a Boeing 777 jet designated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370">MH370</a>, climbed into the moonlit night and turned north-east, toward the South China Sea. The first officer, Fariq Hamid, was 27 years old and one training flight away from full certification. The pilot in command, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was, at 53, one of the most senior and respected pilots for Malaysia Airlines. They led a crew of 10 flight attendants, all Malaysian, and ferried 227 passengers. The majority of those on board were Chinese, along with 38 Malaysians and citizens of Indonesia, Australia, India, France, the US, Iran, Ukraine, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Russia and Taiwan.</p><p>The first 40min of the flight were unremarkable. At 1.19am, MH370 approached the end of Malaysian airspace. Malaysian air traffic control radioed to pass the flight off to Ho Chi Minh. Zaharie answered, “Good night. Malaysian three-seven-zero” – he didn’t repeat the frequency, but not unusual. It was the last anyone heard from the flight. Zaharie never checked in with Vietnamese controllers. Seconds after it crossed into Vietnamese airspace, MH370 disappeared from radar. All subsequent attempts to contact it were unsuccessful. Commercial airplanes are supposed to be reachable at all times, known and tracked, but MH370 was gone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/05/flight-mh370-what-happened-mystery-netflix-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Swansea Grand theatre</strong><br />Richard Mylan’s grim narratives are filled with sympathy and compassion, lifted by Sophie Melville’s all-consuming and fearless performance</p><p>As noted in a programme glossary, Sorter takes its title from a term that refers to a drug (usually heroin) that is used instead of money as payment for work. Written by and starring Richard Mylan, consisting of two interweaving and eventually interconnected monologues, it is an unflinching account of how opioid addiction shapes the lives of two characters: Example A, a young mother whose three children have already been taken into care and Example B, an A&amp;E nurse who fakes prescriptions to feed his own addiction.<br /><br />From the outset, these are almost unceasingly grim narratives. However, imbued with sympathy and compassion, Mylan’s script deftly avoids caricatures and cliches, resisting the need to arrive at neat conclusions. It demands greater empathy and understanding of its audience, even as it offers little hope or resolution for its characters. But, as if to decorate the dungeon with flowers, even in the dark there are also gentle lyrical flourishes that raise the text above kitchen-sink drudgery: telly smiles, the choreography of tug boats and cold turkey avicides.</p><p>There is some dramatic disparity. Example B’s narrative thread feels shorter and less compelling than that of Example A, and as a two-hander the asymmetrical unfolding of each respective catastrophe feels uneven. This might also be due to the fact that any two-hander with Sophie Melville would shift the dramatic focus. Here, Melville is absolutely extraordinary. Example A feels as if she is in her skin and in every sinew and bone. It is an all-consuming performance, fearless and terrifying.<br /><br />Superbly staged, Francesca Goodridge’s incisive, focused direction confirms that she is one of Wales’s most exciting theatre directors. Evocatively lit by Cara Hood and on and in Jacob Hughes’s bus stop set, the production displays a stylish theatrical cohesion; captions flash where bus routes are listed, fluorescent tubes are carried, tenderly cradled, rearranged.<br /><br />This is Swansea-based creative collective Grand Ambition’s inaugural production. Rooted both in the city itself and in Mylan’s own experiences and recovery from addiction, it is an often challenging watch, but also a careful and compassionate portrait, both of a city and of an illness.</p><p>From tomorrow until Friday at <a href="https://www.swanseagrand.co.uk/Sorter">Swansea Grand theatre</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/06/sorter-review-an-unflinching-account-of-opioid-addiction">Continue reading...</a>

This is because the constellation was not named for its resemblance to the creature but because it was so faint that its inventor, the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius, quipped that to see it one would need the eyesight of a lynx. He introduced the constellation, and at least nine others, into his star charts in the 17th century to fill gaps between the 48 classical constellations listed by Ptolemy in the second century. Seven of his inventions remain in use today.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/mar/06/starwatch-find-a-dark-sky-to-seek-out-lynx">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Addiction can be funny’: the standups tackling drugs, booze, psychosis and self-harm on stage

<p>Rich Hardisty cut himself, Harriet Dyer numbed her pain with drugs. A new wave of comics are working out their issues in their acts. But is it really helping them? And should we be laughing?</p><p>The first and maybe only rule of comedy is that it has to be funny. But how do standups manage to wring laughter from life’s darkest moments? Rich Hardisty’s new show, Silly Boy, tackles his experience of mental illness, self-harm and anorexia. “Who wants to sit and hear a guy talk about that?” he asks. “But if I can tell you something funny, and drip those bits in, you’ll be like, ‘Oh yeah, good point!’ You’re more open when you’re laughing.”</p><p>Without those laughs, he says, his show would be “an ordeal”. Instead, Silly Boy is an absorbing hour in which Hardisty approaches psychosis and bipolar disorder with a surprising lightness. “I wanted to do a show where I got people to <em>feel</em> what it felt like. I want to show how we’re all just a series of events that shape who we are. We’re not as in control of our brains as we think.” Silly Boy explores how difficult childhood experiences led Hardisty to harbour a “compulsive” urge to hurt himself, escalating from biting the inside of his mouth until it bled to cutting himself so badly he was hospitalised. His mental pain eventually drove him to try heroin, although he avoided becoming addicted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/06/addiction-can-be-funny-the-standups-tackling-drugs-booze-psychosis-and-self-harm-on-stage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russian troops continue attempts to surround Bakhmut; Ukrainian special forces destroy Russian observation tower in Bryansk</p><p><strong>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has paid tribute to fighters in the Donbas, as his forces come under increasingly intense pressure in the city of Bakhmut. “</strong>It is one of the toughest battles. Painful and challenging,” he said in his nightly address.</p><p><strong>His comments came after Kyiv said it had repelled “more than 130 enemy attacks” on Sunday as Russian troops continue attempts to surround Bakhmut.</strong> Russian forces are said to be contesting lines of communication and preventing resupply.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy also said “the world was strong enough to punish Russia for the war”.</strong> Ukraine would spend the next six months working to shore up the country’s energy supply against Russian attack, he said.</p><p><strong>Ukraine special forces destroyed a Russian observation tower in the city of Bryansk with a kamikaze drone.</strong> Kraken, a special forces unit, has taken credit for the attack on a tower that was being used to monitor the border with Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Exiled mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has claimed “hundreds” of Russian solders were killed in a Ukrainian strike on the city. </strong>There was no confirmation from Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence and the Guardian could not independently verify the claim.</p><p><strong>The Russian army hit a command centre of the Ukrainian forces’ Azov regiment in the south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region</strong>, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. The Guardian could not independently verify this.</p><p><strong>Turkish</strong> <strong>foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said on Sunday that Ankara was working hard to extend the UN-backed Black Sea grain initiative. </strong>A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson indicated Moscow was unhappy with aspects of the deal, which allowed Ukraine to export grain from ports blockaded by Russia following its invasion.</p><p><strong>German chancellor Olaf Scholz told CNN it was “necessary” for Russian president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> to understand he will not win the Ukraine war, so negotiations to end the conflict can begin. </strong>“If you look at the proposal of the Ukrainians, it is easy to understand that they are ready for peace,” he added.</p><p><strong>The death toll from a Russian missile strike that hit a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city Zaporizhzhia on Thursday has risen to 13, </strong>a local official said on Sunday.</p><p><strong>A woman and two children were killed in Russian mortar shelling of a village in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson</strong>, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office said on Sunday.</p><p><strong>Ukraine</strong> <strong>MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told Sky News on Sunday that tens of thousands of Ukrainian children could have disappeared in what she described as “genocide”. </strong>Klympush-Tsintsadze said the children were potentially deported to Russia.</p><p><strong>Latvia’s prime minister said western states delivering fighter jets to support Ukraine defending itself against Russia is “only a question of time”.</strong></p><p><strong>The latest intelligence briefing from the UK’s Ministry of Defence says recent evidence suggests an increase in “close combat” in Ukraine, probably due to Russia’s shortage of “munitions”.</strong> It also refers to Russian mobilised reservists being ordered to assault a Ukrainian concrete strong point armed with only “firearms and shovels”. These shovels are likely to be the outdated MPL-50 entrenching tools used in hand-to-hand combat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-376-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
