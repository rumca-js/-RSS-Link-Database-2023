  <p id="jrBZ9u">Until last year, the way to use Zoom on a ChromeOS device was to download and use Zoom’s ChromeOS app. However, in August of 2022, that app was sunsetted and replaced by the Zoom PWA (progressive web app) for ChromeOS. According to the <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/how-to-use-zoom-on-a-chromebook/">Zoom blog</a>, the idea was to leverage “web-based technology to deliver a native desktop experience.”</p>
<p id="TpPQYF">Chromebook users were given until February 2023 to switch over to the new app. If you haven’t done that yet or if you’re a little unsure of how to use the new app, here are some quick directions:</p>
<ul>
<li id="PWHjgf">First, of course, install the app from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.pwa.twa">Google’s Play Store</a>.</li>
<li id="GZC28C">You’ll immediately have the option to either join an existing meeting or sign in. If you’re not in a hurry for a meeting, it’s a good idea to sign in and...</li>

  <p id="EKcgYf">Twitter’s website is breaking in novel new ways — and while the company managed to recover from its latest outage within a couple of hours, the story behind how it broke suggests there are likely to be similar problems in the near future.  </p>
<p id="tWHZQv">On Monday morning, Twitter users logged on to find <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/6/23627444/twitter-down-outage-images-links-error-message-api">a thicket of connected issues</a>. Clicking on links would no longer open them; instead, users would see a mysterious error message reporting that “your current API plan does not include access to this endpoint.” Images stopped loading as well. Other users reported that they could not access TweetDeck, the Twitter-owned client for professional users.</p>

  <p id="wA5xxl">Google has started to roll out an updated UI for Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides that’s meant to fit in with its Material Design 3 language. The apps still work the same way they used to, but Google writes in <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/03/refreshed-ui-google-drive-docs-sheets-slides.html">an announcement post</a> that they should now be a bit more “simplified,” with less clutter and a few improvements and additions.</p>
<p id="A9r020">Writing about the update when it was announced in February, my colleague Jay Peters noted that it’s similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23281237/google-gmail-redesign-ui-opt-out-chat-meet-spaces">Gmail’s new look</a>, which makes sense given that Google says it’s trying to “streamline core collaboration journeys across our products.” </p>

  <p id="fL69LX">The game development landscape has changed a lot in the last 10 years. The medium-size development studios are few and far between. Instead, you have a lot of behemoth AAA developers who make headlines with big games and big crunch times, and the indies — often solo developers working on contract for larger companies with the hope that their game can break away from the rest and become a big enough hit that they don’t go broke.</p>
<p id="4EoTBX">It’s a challenging and extraordinarily complex world, and to better understand it, Ashley Esqueda spoke with Madison Karrh. Madison is an indie developer, and her game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1889040/Birth/"><em>Birth</em> is available right now</a> on Steam. <em>Birth</em> is a puzzle game about building a friend to combat loneliness.
