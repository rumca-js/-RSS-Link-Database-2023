But the wait is finally coming to an end. Today, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/steven-crowder-mugclub-return\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Crowder appeared on the PBD podcast</a> with a major announcement: the return of Mug Club. </p><p>Mug Club will be back and better than ever on March 20th. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/crowder-reveals-all-tim-pool\" target=\"_blank\">Crowder</a> announced that it will have double the content with an additional show on Fridays. </p><p>Crowder also noted that the show has had a ton of people sign up at <a href=\"https://mugclubforever.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MugClubForever.com</a>. Everyone who signed up should check their spam folders tomorrow, since those who signed up over the past few months will be getting a code to preorder and get free months of MugClub. </p><p>Host Patrick Bet-David also asked about the most influential Conservative news sources, and Crowder said RedState, TownHall, Fox News, and Daily Wire. Bet-David then elaborated that his point is, there aren't enough of them. And this is why Crowder is creating a conservative media platform to bring in new talent under the Louder with Crowder umbrella. </p><p><span></span>Crowder explained this venture is different than all other conservative media outlets because every other show is just people talking about the news, whereas this is about signing people who can be who they are and be creative within the conservative sphere. He related it to when he pitched <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/change-my-mind-crowder-gabriella\" target=\"_blank\">Change My Mind</a> to Fox News and was told no one would want it. </p><p>Crowder elaborated that this will help reach younger conservatives since college-aged Americans aren't exactly tuning into Fox News every night. And Louder with Crowder's newest venture will not be about making people fit into a box - it's about letting their freak flag fly. </p><p><span></span>Crowder can't name too many names yet but noted there are equitable, transparent contracts in the works. So stay tuned for more details and, of course, hold onto your butts. </p><p><br /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n<span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span>\n<small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Steven Crowder | PBD Podcast | Ep. 243</small>\n<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsHUZD5Yyqk\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com</a>\n</small>\n</p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/steven-crowder-mugclub-return-2659512928", "date_published": "2023-03-06 22:34:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Watch As Socialist Bernie Sanders Tries To Explain Equality Vs.

Maher ended up backing him into a socialist corner with no chance of escape. And it was wonderful to watch. </p><p>Maher asked Bernie to please explain the difference between equality and equity. Sanders replied, <em>\"Well equality, we talk about, um...I don't know what the answer to that is.\" </em></p><p>Oh boy. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cBill Maher asked Bernie Sanders to explain the differences between \\u2018equality\\u2019 and \\u2018equity\\u2019\\n\\nBernie was left dumbstruck \\ud83d\\udc40\\u201d</div> \u2014 Zachery Henry (@Zachery Henry)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zhenryaz/status/1632017948062752769\">1677938374</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the audience laughed, Sanders scrambled to come up with something<em>: \"Equality is equality of opportunity...we live in a society, we want all people to have, whatever color your skin is-\"</em></p><p>But Maher cut him off before he could get to the \"racism\" part of his argument and pointed out that equity is the guarantee of outcome. He then asked Bernie which side he comes down on, and Bernie said -<em>gasp</em>- equality. Which is obviously not true. And he looked quite uncomfortable saying it. </p><p>This is hilarious considering how many of Bernie Sander's policies are based on equality of <em>outcome</em>. Medicare for all, increasing taxes on the rich, canceling student loans, ...these don't exactly scream \"equality of opportunity,\" do they? They actually seem pretty focused on...guaranteeing outcomes...</p><p>Anywho, this is the second time in the past few months that Sanders has seemingly gone against his own socialist tenets. He wrote a book about how evil capitalism is and is <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bernie-sanders-confronted-cbs\" target=\"_blank\">selling tickets to his book tour for up to $95</a>. On Ticketmaster, nonetheless, which is apparently Alexandra Ocasio Cortez's archnemesis. Due to the whole Taylor Swift debacle. </p><p>Since Bernie has now twice publicly defamed his socialist roots, it'll be interesting to see if the DNC shuns him for 2024. My guess is yes, since that's what happened during the past two election cycles. But also, Joe Biden is barely alive. So there's that. </p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bernie-sanders-bill-maher", "date_published": "2023-03-06 21:30:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "WATCH: Zoomer With HIV Is Upset Because It Means He Can't Make a Blood Pact With His Friends", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33219638&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>I regret to inform you that today, we have yet another example of how far society has fallen. The <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gen-z-womens-prisons\" target=\"_blank\">Zoomers</a> have gotten AIDS. And this particular Zoomer is upset because that means he can't make a blood pact with his friends. A natural main concern. </p><p>19-year-old TikToker  Zack Willmore explained in a recent video, <em>\"One of my big things on my bucket list was to have a blood pact with some of my friends. And I was like ugh, now that I have HIV, I'll never be able to do that. But I asked my doctor and he was like, 'even though I really highly don't recommend it because of a number of other reasons, technically HIV is not the problem there.'\" </em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201csodom and gomorrah was a warning not an instruction manual\\u201d</div> \u2014 pagliacci the hater \\ud83c\\udf1e (@pagliacci the hater \\ud83c\\udf1e)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Slatzism/status/1632520065219166208\">1678058088</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He elaborated that HIV won't be a problem once he is fully undetectable. Then he can make all the blood pacts he wants. I guess. </p><p>It is quite funny that, upon being diagnosed with HIV, one of his major concerns was about a hypothetical blood pact. But his full story is quite sad. In the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stay-at-home-husband-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok</a> where he announced his diagnosis, he said,<em> \"I just feel honestly so gross, I wish I could take like a big needle and drain all of the blood out of my body [...] This honestly feels like the end of the world to me [...] I was told people with HIV can live up to 70, but I don't even want to live past 20.\" </em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@zachwillmore/video/7203816373078871338\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n<section>\n<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@zachwillmore\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@zachwillmore\">@zachwillmore</a>\n<p>Day 1 of my video diary #hiv #gay #viral #diary</p>\n</section>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br /></p><p>So he's clearly going through it. It's a lot to handle, especially at just 19-years-old. And I can't help but wonder: if our culture were maybe a little less promotional of certain degenerate behaviors that can lead to HIV, would there be less people who have to go through this?

Hopefully, the federation will appeal, and a sane judge will realize that biological men are indeed stronger than women.
