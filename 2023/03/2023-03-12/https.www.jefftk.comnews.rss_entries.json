[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Musicians and Mouths", "description": "<p><span>\n\nMost musicians massively underuse their mouths, and the ones\nthat use their mouths underuse their fingers.  This is very\nweird and I don't understand it.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nThe most common instruments I see are probably piano, guitar, drums,\nand violin.  Add in mandolin, bass, accordion, cello, viola, and\nbanjo, and they all have one thing in common: your mouth is completely\nidle.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThen there are instruments that do use the mouth, but these don't use\nanywhere near the full capacity of your fingers.  A trumpet, baritone,\nor tuba has just three buttons and a mini slide, and the other hand\njust sits there.  The trombone and harmonica just need to be moved\nback and forth.  The flute, clarinet, sax, and oboe do at least use\nboth your hands, but using all ten fingers to select a single note is\nterrible.  Recorder, tin whistle, and bagpipes are even worse: not\nonly do they require all your fingers, but your mouth isn't doing very\nmuch.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis does make sense historically: while your mouth is incredibly\nversatile, there aren't obvious ways to combine it with a guitar,\ndrum, or violin.  And the easiest ways to build a wind instrument all\nrequire a lot of fingers so you can spread them out along a tube.  But\nwe've had serious electric and electronic instruments for decades: why\nis it still uncommon to see people using their mouth's incredible\nability to modulate sound?  Some people sing and play at the same\ntime, which is great, but probably less than half of musicians?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI wrote about this a bit in 2019 in <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/where-are-the-new-instruments\">\nWhere are the new Instruments?</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nBreath controllers, which sense breath pressure and make it available\nas one input to a synthesizer, have been around for decades, and are\nold enough to have been assigned CC-2 in MIDI. Lots of people have\ntried them, with some impressive results, and there's no risk of being\ntied to a vendor since they're so simple. But even though they would\nallow anyone playing keyboard to add a new dimension to their playing,\nmusicians are sufficiently uninterested that Yamaha discontinued their\nBC line in 2011. The electronic instruments that have taken off live\nare mostly just keyboard and maybe drums. There are so many\nfantastically creative people in the music industry, but in the 80s\ninnovation here seems to have stopped. Why aren't people coming up\nwith creative new ways of modulating the sound as you make it?\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nSince then I've been using the breath controller more live, and have\nstarted playing with a <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/playing-with-a-talk-box\">talk\nbox</a> too.  Which has the same mystery: anyone can attach a talk box\nto any electric or electronic instrument, and get far more control\nover their tone and dynamics.  But they mostly don't.  It\ncan't just be that having a tube coming out of your mouth just looks\ntoo weird since people play wind instruments.  With how innovative\npeople are in other aspects of music it feels really weird to me to\nsee so little exploration here.  Why?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(There's also an instrument in this category that could have been\nbuilt any time in the last ~500y: talkbox bagpipes.  While the\nmouth-blown pipes are probably most familiar, all the mouth is doing is\nputting air into a bag.  Bellows pipes replace this with an\narm-operated pump.  This opens up an opportunity to point the drones\ninto your mouth so you can manipulate the sound of your accompaniment,\nturning the drones from a continuous, well, drone, into something\nlively and danceable.  Or, at least, it should.  As far as I know no one\nhas built these, and my attempts to convince my <a href=\"https://www.thomfordewoodcraft.com/\">bagpipe-maker cousin</a> to\nwork on this haven't been successful.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid036SjLy3KwBG1LiWPuVVJFosDhA91xK7RydQD5UZ8xH4Yj2LqFXezAj9eu5w7DF4Yjl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/3gW4MxKdzXfXN737f\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110012737081500311\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/musicians-and-mouths", "date_published": "2023-03-12 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
