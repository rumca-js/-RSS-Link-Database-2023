There is such a huge selection of them, so narrowing them down was quite the challenge. Rather than picking the best mouse for FPSs, MMOs, or high-level competitive play, we instead wanted to choose all-around excellent mice for ANY genre you play. Some have excellent battery life and the bare necessities, some mice have great customization options, and some mice just feel great in the hand while also being great performers. Maybe all three have everything you need! In that case, what's the best mouse for your needs? Take a look at the SteelSeries Rival 3 Wireless, Razer Basilisk V3 Pro, and the Logitech G502X Plus, and let us know!\n\n#GamingMouse #2023 #BestGamingMice #BudgetToBest", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76YpmshmI5w", "date_published": "2023-03-12 13:15:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "The most awarded movie of all time #eeaao #everythingeverywhere #lotr #movies #oscars #shorts", "description": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-dAHEmJXR4", "date_published": "2023-03-12 00:31:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
