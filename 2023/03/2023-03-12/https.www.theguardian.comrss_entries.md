<ul><li>American finishes on 17 under for second win this season</li><li>England’s Tyrrell Hatton runner-up, five shots behind</li></ul><p>Even the 17<sup>th</sup> at Sawgrass, host to carnage throughout the final round of the Players Championship, could not halt Scottie Scheffler. It helped that the man who is now restored as No 1 in the world took to the iconic par three while holding a five-shot lead. As soon as his tee shot was dry, victory was secure. This was a procession.</p><p>Scheffler’s glory here, by five from Tyrrell Hatton courtesy of a 17-under-par aggregate, means he has won half a dozen times since last February. After completion of the Ryder Cup in the autumn of 2021, and aside from victories, Scheffler has 14 other top-10 finishes. His on-course reward for that is close to $25m, $4.5m (£3.7m) of which was earned here at Ponte Vedra.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/12/scottie-scheffler-reclaims-world-no-1-spot-with-players-championship-win">Continue reading...</a>

## Farewell Endeavour – what a perfect finale to one of TV’s classic crime shows

<p>This last episode of the Inspector Morse prequel had issues to wrap up – and did it with style. From brilliantly excruciating moments to its intriguing ending, it stayed true to itself</p><p>Fans of a TV show always fear the finale will end with death. In the case of Endeavour, which has just bowed out after 11 years, we knew the police protagonist – Sgt Morse, played by Shaun Evans – must survive. He needs to hand over the role to John Thaw in Inspector Morse, which preceded Endeavour on our screens but follows it in the story of the Thames Valley detective created by Colin Dexter.</p><p>The death of at least one other character was expected, though, with Morse’s boss and mentor, Roger Allam’s DCI Fred Thursday, the biggest worry. The writer of all 36 episodes, Russell Lewis, acknowledged that the real challenge of the last Endeavour was to explain why, in the 33 episodes of Morse, he never once mentions Thursday. (The logical reason is that the earlier years were written later, but Lewis had to make this psychologically plausible.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/12/farewell-endeavour-what-a-perfect-end-to-one-of-tvs-classic-shows">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The broadcasting legend takes a lovely, unparalleled look at the majestic wildlife of the UK and Ireland. If anyone can stop its terrifying destruction, it’s him</p><p>Oh, isn’t it lovely to have a new David Attenborough series for a cosy Sunday evening. And one so close to home! For the next five weeks, Wild Isles offers an unparalleled look at the spectacular, miraculous and unique natural world of Britain and Ireland. It is a stunning portrait of breeding orcas, golden eagles, foxes and dormice; woodlands, meadows and rivers. Just beautiful. Something to be immensely proud of, something to nurture and to protect.</p><p>There is nothing like an Attenborough-led nature documentary. From its majestic score to its pioneering cinematography and its clever narratives, this is education by way of awe. “The British Isles are globally important for nature,” he says, before we follow an orca pod as they strategise ways of hunting their favourite food: a nice, juicy seal. They swim on their sides to hide their dorsal fins as they approach, which is amazing to see, then teach their young how to drown their prey. Fine family entertainment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/12/wild-isles-review-david-attenborough-beautiful-tour-of-britain-is-unmissable-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bucketloads of humility are now required with drastic reform of RFU needed to prevent another decade in wilderness</p><p>It is 20 years since England became the first – and still only – northern hemisphere side to win a World Cup and some blunt home truths can no longer be avoided. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/11/england-france-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report">If their record defeat</a> in 113 years of hosting Test matches at Twickenham symbolised anything it was exactly how far English rugby has now fallen and how much it is going to take to restore the national team to former glories.</p><p>Maybe Saturday evening is the rude awakening required to alert the Rugby Football Union to the full extent of the rot that has set in, on and off the field. Because, increasingly, it does not seem to matter who is coaching England, which players they select, how they try and play or even the volume of noise made by their supporters. A bigger picture is now evident: English rugby needs saving from its bloated, short-sighted and underperforming self.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/12/english-rugby-needs-saving-from-its-bloated-self-after-france-horror-show">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on corporate greed: it’s causing inflation | Editorial

<p>Unite’s claim that firms are profiteering on the back of a crisis hitting workers is hard to dismiss</p><p>The language of the market performs a social function to obscure economic encounters. In this inflationary era, it’s worth noting that the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/dec/20/highereducation.uk1" title="">invisible hand</a>” of the economy has not put up prices all at once. It is firms, free from government curbs, deciding that they can do that. In free markets, companies are meant to compete and undercut each other, driving prices and profits down. Yet this has been failing to happen. Instead, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/12/global-greedflation-big-firms-drive-shopping-bills-to-record-highs" title="">new report</a> from the trade union Unite reveals, company profits last year rose while real wages fell steeply. Workers are warned that they risk sparking a wage-price spiral if they demand pay rises to match living costs. In fact, Britain seems to be facing a profit-price spiral.</p><p>Unite’s argument is that UK plc has been able to charge more, with much of the higher prices juicing profits. From the trade union’s perspective, corporate greed has been the primary driver of high inflation. Its 165-page report makes a compelling case that firms, and their investors, are “profiteering” on the back of a crisis hitting workers hard. Even within key industries, there is talk of “price gouging”. When Sainsbury’s reported a doubling of profits last year to £730m, the supermarket insisted it wasn’t ramping up prices. But it <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/business/sainsbury-tesco-cost-of-living-price-rises-aldi-lidl-inflation-b996798.html" title="">accused</a> its competitors of doing so.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/12/the-guardian-view-on-corporate-greed-its-causing-inflation">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Wigmore Hall, London<br /></strong>A rare performance of Hans Werner Henze’s engrossing song cycle featured a tour de force of technique and stamina from baritone Will Liverman</p><p>Through the 1960s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/hans-werner-henze">Hans Werner Henze’s</a> music became ever more politically engaged. Some of those pieces have not worn well, but one of the exceptions is the “recital for four musicians”, El Cimarrón, which Henze composed in 1969-70, while living in Cuba. With a text by the poet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/15/hans-magnus-enzensberger-interview">Hans Magnus Enzensberger</a>, it’s based upon the autobiography of the Cuban Esteban Montejo, who at the age of 104 had told the story of his remarkable life as a runaway slave to the writer <a href="https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/author/miguel-barnet">Miguel Barnet</a>.</p><p>Henze and Enzensberger present this tale as an 80-minute song cycle, in which the part of El Cimarrón (a 19th-century Spanish term for a runaway slave) is taken by a baritone, accompanied by flute, guitar and a vast array of percussion. It follows Montejo from his birth through to the abolition of slavery in Cuba in 1886 – when in reality conditions on the sugar cane plantations changed very little for the workers – to the arrival of mechanisation and the corruption of church and state that eventually made revolution inevitable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/12/el-cimarron-review-hans-werner-henze-virtuoso-celebration-of-cuban-folk-hero">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Richard Tarver</strong> points out that the need for new developments sometimes means building on biodiverse sites; <strong>Steve Townsley</strong> says houses have become investments rather than places to live</p><p>John Harris’s article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/05/house-prices-freefall-property-ownership-rent-britain" title="">House prices are crumbling – and so is Britain’s faith in property ownership, 5 March</a>) provides a timely contrast with the letter from Peggy Seeger (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/02/we-must-call-out-the-ecocide-on-our-doorstep" title="">2 March</a>). John describes the pitiful number of council houses being built in England, and hence the worsening housing crisis, with millions unable to afford their own home. Peggy describes a proposal by Oxford city council to build 32 houses in Iffley village, Oxford, as “ecocide” and “a crime”. I know this housing proposal is unpopular with many locally: it is one reason I lost my Labour Oxford city seat in 2021, in the adjoining council ward to Iffley. The very same opponents would often say the housing crisis is Oxford’s biggest problem.</p><p>I appreciate the need for biodiversity, but the council proposes to “translocate protected species” in the proposed development. This is not ecocide. Surely people, particularly those who own their own homes outright, need to weigh in the balance the needs of those requiring housing? Satisfying Peggy’s argument that this development is an example of a “‘growth’ agenda to which we have become addicted” would mean stopping almost all housebuilding, and making it even more difficult to address the housing crisis.<br /><strong>Richard Tarver</strong><br /><em>Oxford</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/12/in-englands-worsening-housing-crisis-millions-are-unable-to-afford-their-own-homes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Rabid)<br />Wittily exploring desire and relationships, the identity-surfing Swedish star sounds revitalised on their first solo album in six years</p><p>There can’t be many more significant 21st-century artists than Karin Dreijer, AKA <a href="https://feverray.com/">Fever Ray</a>. In and out of <a href="https://theknife.net/">the Knife</a>, their band with sibling Olof, they’ve created powerful, original outsider art in visual media, written an opera and treated gigs like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/marina-abramovic">Marina Abramović</a> installations. In smartly choreographed performance, they play with identity and anonymity with thrilling verve, until you never know – or care – who’s singing or playing on stage. Yet their most recent album, 2017’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/29/fever-ray-plunge-observer-review?CMP=gu_com">Plunge</a></em>, was brittle and abrasive, with euphoria in short supply despite Dreijer’s enthusiastic embracing of queer love.</p><p><em><a href="https://feverray.com/radical-romantics/">Radical Romantics</a></em> is joyous by comparison. Yes, Even It Out is produced by goth potentate Trent Reznor and appears to be a series of threats to a child at Dreijer’s son’s school.

From a ball point pen to a skyscraper, everything we make needs one or more of these design wonders<p>When I was about five years old, I was living with my parents and sister in snowy upstate New York. It was the 1980s and one day I sat in front of my favourite large rectangular lunchbox, adorned with a picture of the Muppets on the front. This one held my huge collection of crayons – long, short, thick, thin, in every shade available. Like most children, I was continuously curious and I wanted to “discover” what was inside my crayons. So I peeled off the paper that enveloped them, then held them one at a time against the sharp edge of the open box and snapped them in two. My great anticipation was rather dampened to find, well, just more crayon inside. Nevertheless I persisted.</p><p>When I was a little older and started writing words on paper with pencils, I would twist them inside a sharpener to see if the grey rod that marked my sheets went all the way through its body. It did. From there, I graduated to pens – far from the disappointing crayons of my early childhood, the insides of fountain pens and ballpoints contained slender cartridges and helical springs, held together with a top that threaded, screw-like, on to the rest of the pen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/12/my-passion-for-the-seven-small-objects-at-the-heart-of-everything-we-build">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tackling gendered insults head on, A-list authors deliver a smart anthology of fun and fearless tales to celebrate Virago’s 50th birthday</p><p>“Attempting to diminish women by name-calling is nothing new,” notes Sandi Toksvig in her introduction to Virago’s 50th birthday anthology. Founded to counteract the under-representation of female writers, Virago has become a publishing powerhouse. Yet the public discourse and the online treatment of women grow ever more aggressive. I’m not sure this anthology can harness the power of a Siren or a Spitfire (to give two sample story titles) to stem the tide, but it’s certainly fun.</p><p><em>Furies</em> is a starry collection, with new stories by four-time Booker-nominated Ali Smith, Emma Donoghue – whose novel <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/01/room-emma-donoghue-review-fritzl">Room</a></em> was adapted into a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/17/room-review-lenny-abrahamson-brie-larson-jacob-tremblay">hit Hollywood film</a> – Margaret Atwood and Women’s prize for fiction-winner Kamila Shamsie, among others. Most of the titles – rather vintage-seeming gendered insults – have a degree of ambiguity baked in, perhaps even a lurking admiration for the distinctive, unpredictable woman. Who wouldn’t be somewhat flattered to be called a Warrior, a Fury, a Dragon or even a She-Devil? Other stories take on the Wench, Hussy and Tygress – the latter in a lovely piece by Claire Kohda, whose narrator’s beloved mother is a tiger who would “always give me a long kiss on the forehead … and her whiskers would tickle my eyelids.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/12/furies-stories-of-the-wicked-wild-and-untamed-review-a-slick-and-starry-collection-by-women-writers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Flag bearer of British tennis looks increasingly self-assured as he gets ready to take on a potential successor</p><p>Late on Friday night, as he prepared for his second match at Indian Wells, a slice of good fortune fell Andy Murray’s way. His second-round opponent, Pablo Carreno Busta, withdrew from the tournament because of injury and Murray instead lined up to play against Radu Albot, a lucky loser who has spent most of his career in and out of the top 100.</p><p>While Murray had a great chance against Carreno Busta, a contest against one of the top counter-punchers in slow and windy desert conditions was likely to drag on for three exhausting sets. Instead, Murray quietly handled his business and secured his first straight-sets win since September, setting up a fascinating third-round encounter with Jack Draper.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/12/andy-murray-rediscovers-his-aura-in-time-for-showdown-with-jack-draper">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve never smeared my sons in Nutella or scared them for the sake of ‘likes’. But there are things I wish I’d kept off social media </p><p>There’s a box of old photos of me next to my desk.

## Woman allegedly raped as a teenager calls for change after ‘horrendous’ trial

<p>Isobel Goatcher says she cannot bear to endure another trial after jury failed to reach verdict and defence painted her as ‘sex-crazed slut’</p><p>A woman who alleges she was raped as a teenager by an older man has called for changes to the judicial process after finding the experience of going to trial traumatic.<br /><br />Isobel Goatcher claims a man, then in his 60s, attacked her in 2016 after a party at her parents’ house when she was 16. He faced a one-week trial in November after pleading not guilty to two charges of rape and sexual assault. The jury failed to reach a verdict.<br /><br />The prosecution pushed ahead with a retrial, scheduled for July, but Goatcher has now withdrawn from the process because she says she cannot bear to endure another “horrendous” trial.<br /><br />Goatcher, who gave evidence in court, says she felt as if the defence barrister’s cross-examination painted her as a “sex-crazed slut” who pursued the man. The first question she says he asked her was: “You were a vivacious 16-year-old, weren’t you?”</p><p>“I don’t hate his barrister for what he said to me. He was just doing his job. The point is, there should be much stricter rules around what they can ask and the way they ask it,” Goatcher told the Guardian.<br /><br />The now 23-year-old, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, says part of her wanted to press ahead with the retrial. “But I did not know how I could physically do that again,” she says.<br />Goatcher says she does not want to put off others from reporting their accounts to the police, but is speaking out and waiving her anonymity because she wants to raise awareness about the legal process.<br /><br />The marketing coordinator says she is “grieving” after withdrawing from the process, which means the man has been found not guilty. She says: “I feel really sad that I had to make that choice, and that I felt like that was the only way for me to move on.<br /><br />“It’s really sad that the system is the way it is and that the trials are that traumatic that I was willing to stop the case. I was willing to withdraw support because I knew that I didn’t want to put myself through that again. I feel broken and like I’ve been torn up.<br /><br />“On some level I feel like I am weak for not going ahead with a second trial. But I know that that isn’t my fault, it’s the system’s fault. The system shouldn’t be so traumatic.”<br /><br />Goatcher says she woke up to find the man on top of her in 2016. She says she told her best friend what happened that same day, and her mother and boyfriend a year later. She began having counselling in 2019 and says she told her therapist in her first session that she had been raped.<br /><br />In July 2020, she reported the allegations to the police, who handed over the file to the CPS. The man was then charged in April 2022, but the case did not go to trial for another seven months.<br /><br />Goatcher says the delays affected her mental health. “It felt like years,” she says. “It was really tough because I felt massively out of control. I felt like I was being investigated. I had to sign waivers for them to have my medical records. They went right back to my primary school and got records from them, even though this happened when I was 16.”<br /><br />“It just felt so intrusive and so oriented towards me. He was interviewed once, and, other than that, I felt like it was all about me and how credible I was.”<br /><br />Goatcher says she felt unprepared for the trial, and claims she was only told about the possibility of a hung jury three days before it opened. Prof Cheryl Thomas from UCL published a study last month which shows that less than 1% of rape cases between 2007 and 2021 ended in a hung jury.<br /><br />Goatcher says she did not feel supported during the trial, having met the prosecution’s barrister 45 minutes before she was due to be cross-examined.<br /><br />She says: “My close family and friends were [prosecution] witnesses in the trial so I couldn’t really rely on them for much support, because I wasn’t allowed to talk to them. So it was quite isolating and terrifying. The anxiety that I had in the two weeks before the trial was awful. I had to go on beta blockers because I thought I was going to have a heart attack.”<br /><br />She feels “heartbroken” that the case ended in a hung jury but she hopes that by speaking out something “positive” can come of her experience. “I need to talk about what happened, others should know what the process is like, because it’s not fit for purpose. And it’s never going to change unless people talk about it,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/12/isobel-goatcher-allegedly-raped-teenager-change-trial">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The writer says that meganets – the huge tech networks already part of daily life – have led to groupthink and the breakdown of public discourse and that we must exert more influence on them</p><p>David Auerbach is a writer and software engineer who has worked for Google and Microsoft. He also teaches the history of computation at the New Centre for Research &amp; Practice in Seattle, US. His new book is <em>Meganets: How Digital Forms Beyond Our Control </em><em>Commandeer Our Daily Lives and Inner Realities</em>. He argues that widespread concern about artificial intelligence is legitimate, but the problem is already all around us, with huge tech networks that no one – neither governments nor their owners – is able to control.</p><p><strong>Your book is concerned with the threat to social and economic stability represented by what you call meganets. How do you define a meganet?<br /></strong>The definition I use for a meganet is a persistent, evolving and opaque data network that heavily influences how people see the world. It is always on and it consists both of a large server tech component as well as millions upon millions of users who are constantly active, using those services and influencing them. All these users play a small part in the collective authorship of how these algorithms run. The effect is contributing to a severe fracturing of society in which we are literally becoming unable to understand one another, as we split into like-minded self-policing groups that enforce unanimity and uniformity, and prevent any larger-scale societal consensus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/12/software-engineer-david-auerbach-big-tech-is-in-denial-about-not-being-in-control">Continue reading...</a>

## Mehidy shines as Bangladesh clinch second T20 and series against England

This is a curiously lopsided England side, light on batters and so overblessed with bowlers – so much so that the 19<sup>th</sup> over was also Chris Jordan’s first. Bangladesh started it needed 13 off 12 deliveries, and had the game wrapped up with seven to spare.</p><p>Even on a troublesome wicket neither England’s final total of 117, nor the manner in which they accumulated it, looked like the kind of things that lead to success.

<p><strong>Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge; Courtauld Gallery, London</strong><br />Form and function unite in quiet perfection in an unmissable gathering of the potter’s coveted work, while the Scottish artist lets the sunshine in – up to a point</p><p>I walked around <strong><a href="https://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/events/lucie-rie-the-adventure-of-pottery/">Lucie Rie: The Adventure of Pottery</a></strong> at Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge twice. The first time I was concentrating hard, making notes, absorbing dates, places and styles. The second time, I raced around, as if I was in a shop: Heal’s some time after the second world war, say, or David Mellor in its earliest incarnation. Which things would I buy if I could? So many! A pair of stoneware teapots with bamboo handles from the 1950s. A collection of prototype cups, saucers and mugs for Wedgwood, made of its famous blue and white jasperware in 1963 but never produced. A footed bowl from 1971 of porcelain with a uranium acid yellow glaze. A tall “bottle” – a vase by any other name – from 1986 with a manganese glaze, horizontal stripes and wide lip that could somehow only be Rie’s work. All these things I would wrap in tissue, before rushing for the door, my booty over my shoulder.</p><p>Rie’s pottery is art now: extremely precious, lusted after by collectors and displayed in museums in glass cases (those at Kettle’s Yard are designed by David Kohn Architects). But no matter how exquisite, nor how rarefied the places in which one encounters it, there’s still no getting away from the fact that form and function are inseparable; that you can imagine (dream) not only of owning it, but of using it, trying hard not to worry about chips.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/12/lucie-rie-the-adventure-of-pottery-kettles-yard-cambridge-review-peter-doig-courtauld-gallery-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The writer digs deep into the often deceptive history of three people who conspired with their oppressors in this fascinating if disjointed examination of moral ambiguity</p><p>When Ian Buruma was growing up in the Netherlands, a comforting mythology shrouded the traumatic German wartime occupation of the country. Though it was acknowledged that a minority of the Dutch had “collaborat[ed] actively with the enemy”, he recalls, such “symbols of depravity” only served to “highlight the glowing virtuousness of the plucky majority”. Rejecting such simplistic narratives, this intriguing but rather disjointed book<em> </em>sets out to explore<em> </em>moral ambiguity and degrees of guilt.</p><p>It does so through the stories of three striking, self-mythologising and elusive figures. All have been seen as heroes and villains, but Buruma sifts their attempts to justify themselves and offers dramatic accounts of their complex careers. He is an authority on Chinese and Japanese culture, so one of his subjects is Kawashima Yoshiko, “a cross-dressing Manchu princess who spied for the Japanese secret police in China”. Sometimes known as “the Mata Hari of the Orient”, she inspired much sensationalist and often salacious fiction and was later one of three women denounced in China as “especially egregious traitors” before being executed in 1948.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/12/the-collaborators-three-stories-of-deception-survival-world-war-ii-by-ian-buruma-review-intriguing-study-of-the-frenemy-within">Continue reading...</a>

## Memories of the Iraq war may have faded, but it shaped the diminished UK we know today | John Harris

<p>That politics is a dark art is a cliche, but the events of 2003 helped to destroy public trust in government</p><p>Politics is in the midst of a New Labour revival. Keir Starmer draws huge inspiration from his party’s landslide win back in 1997. Tony Blair <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tony-blair-warned-keir-starmer-of-left-wing-threats-during-davos-meet-up-926rgwfg8">offers him advice</a>, and regularly tours TV and radio studios. Gordon Brown has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/21/liz-truss-cost-of-living-poverty-gordon-brown">found a role</a> as British politics’ thundering conscience. That former titan of “comms” Alastair Campbell is now a super-successful podcaster and <a href="https://bylinetimes.com/2021/04/12/alastair-campbell-boris-johnson-brexit-labour-interview/">caller-out of Brexit lies</a>; over the past few days, he has been hyperactively defending Gary Lineker and decrying the management of the BBC. There is even something of New Labour in Rishi Sunak: his faux-classless speaking style, and his attempts to sell himself as a master of technocratic efficiency, determined to pull his party back into the mainstream.</p><p>But now, an uneasy anniversary arrives. Next Monday will mark 20 years since the invasion of Iraq: a reminder not just of Blair et al’s responsibility for the greatest political and humanitarian disaster the UK had been involved in since the second world war, but a moment when the supposed political centre ground suddenly lurched somewhere reckless and catastrophic. Support for the invasion, let us not forget, also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/mar/18/iraq.iraq6">enveloped the Conservative party</a>, and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/tony-blair-took-britain-to-war-in-2003-but-most-of-fleet-street-marched-with-him-62065">vast majority of the British press</a>.

Car engines, bespoke medicines, organs for transplant, food, fashion and now even a whole street of houses… Is the all-conquering promise of 3D printing finally coming true?<p>Nori bricks, which were first fired in the Lancashire town of Accrington in 1887, quickly became legendary as the hardest brick ever produced. Their strength, derived from the chemical properties of the local clay, enabled megastructures to rise up around the world, including the Blackpool Tower in 1894 and the Empire State Building in New York in 1930. Their name is said to be a cock-up from when they meant to write “iron” on the works’ chimney.</p><p>This year a different, though equally pioneering, construction material is set to bring attention to the town, which is 20 miles north of Manchester and whose most recent claim to fame is being trash-talked in a 1989 advert for milk. On Charter Street, on a patch of disused land owned by the council, there are plans to build 46 net-zero-carbon homes, ranging from single-bedroom apartments to four-bed houses, all occupied by low-income families or military veterans. The homes will be made not from Nori bricks, but from 3D-extruded concrete. When the development is complete, potentially in late 2023, it will be the largest printed building complex in Europe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/12/3d-printing-the-new-technology-comes-into-its-own">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A paella-style shellfish dish with Spanish sausage and mild, sweet peppers</p><p>We Spaniards eat a lot of rice whatever the season, not least because it’s both versatile and moreish. For today’s recipe, I’d recommend using bomba, a short-grain variety that’s ideal for this type of cooking. And while you could roast regular red peppers, I actually prefer jarred roast <a href="https://www.pepperscale.com/piquillo-peppers/">piquillos</a> in this dish – they’re a great store-cupboard standby, and much sweeter. Clams and chorizo are a match made in heaven, with the sweetness of the shellfish dancing beautifully with the spicy smokiness of the sausage. Clams are hugely popular in Spain, where they are also good value, but you could use mussels instead, seeing as they’re much more affordable in the UK.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/12/jose-pizarro-recipe-smoked-pimenton-clam-rice-chorizo-roast-peppers">Continue reading...</a>

Added to which an unseemly squabble over the best actress nominees, in which a high-powered “grassroots” campaign on behalf of Andrea Riseborough ran into the film industry’s attempts to promote diversity, has cast a sorry pall over a portion of the proceedings. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/09/oscars-volodymyr-zelenskiy-appearance-turned-down?ref=upstract.com">reports suggest that the Academy has (again) knocked back a request</a> by Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address the assembled throng.</p><p>With all that rumbling away in the background, what are the odds that an actual awards show might break out? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/08/oscars-producers-interview-2023-ceremony-glenn-weiss-ricky-kirschner">The producers have played it safe</a> by recalling Jimmy Kimmel as host, and are no doubt <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/oscar-ratings-second-worst-history">hoping to keep improving the TV ratings</a> away from the calamitous pandemic-era trough in 2021.

<p>The location’s changed but that’s it in this thorough rehash of all your favourite smirking horror satire themes</p><p>The latest movie in the <em>Scream</em> franchise gets a fresh location: sisters Sam (Melissa Barrera) and Tara (Jenna Ortega) are cohabiting in New York, where Tara is attending university and Sam is helicoptering anxiously, unable to move past the trauma that unfolded in the previous film. The daughter of one of the original killers, Sam is still struggling with her mental health and the guilty realisation that she rather enjoyed dispatching the last batch of aspiring ghost-face murderers. And online haters have tried her and found her guilty of being the real perpetrator in the most recent Woodsboro bloodbath. Meanwhile, Tara is desperate for a normal life, preferably one that doesn’t involve her big sister Tasering her prospective boyfriends in the testicles.</p><p>But the backdrop is the only significant thing that has changed in a film that rehashes everything – from the plot points of the previous films to the smirking meta references to horror nut Mindy’s (Jasmin Savoy Brown’s) contextualising second-act monologue. The only notable development is just how rapidly a satirical skewering of genre formulas can become thuddingly formulaic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/12/scream-vi-review-thuddingly-formulaic-sequel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Irish city’s new interactive visitor attraction celebrating all things rugby cleverly embodies the sport in Níall McLaughlin’s imposing, community-centred design</p><p>There are architects who talk in metaphor and symbol, who will tell you with varying degrees of credibility what this or that aspect of a building means; that, for example, an airport’s sweeping roof signifies flight, or that the glass wall of a parliament speaks of democracy. There are other architects who focus on the mute qualities of construction, who take pride in the ways brick or concrete or timber come together, and mostly don’t ask them to deliver messages.</p><p><a href="https://www.niallmclaughlin.com/about/niall-mclaughlin/">Níall McLaughlin</a>, trained in Dublin and based in London, does both. His past projects wax poetical – a boatlike <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/apr/28/ripon-college-chapel-niall-mclaughlin">chapel</a> in Oxfordshire, for instance, and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/05/hothouse-towers-auckland-castles-skyscraping-pineapple-friendly-revamp">modern gothic tower</a> for a historic palace in County Durham – but they are grounded in the stuff and work with which buildings are made. His designs involve a high degree of control over detail, so that missed beats and duff rhymes don’t creep in. He thrives on singular and significant commissions and on clients who back him to achieve them. So his works include that chapel and palace, the new library for Magdalene College, Cambridge, that <a href="https://www.architecture.com/awards-and-competitions-landing-page/awards/riba-stirling-prize">won last year’s Stirling prize</a>, and a <a href="https://www.niallmclaughlin.com/projects/song-school/">music pavilion</a> built to house a treasured harpsichord for another Cambridge college, Clare.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/12/limerick-international-rugby-experience-niall-mclaughlin-architects-review-jp-mcmanus-a-scrum-in-building-form">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Everyman, Liverpool; Noël Coward; Bush; Wyndham’s, London<br /></strong>A revival of<strong> </strong>Caryl Churchill’s female power play has yet to settle; Paul and Prue become song-and-dance naturals; a fab four get ready for bed; and who can say no to this Rodgers and Hammerstein reinvention</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.everymanplayhouse.com/whats-on/top-girls">Top Girls</a></strong> has relocated to Liverpool, and Caryl Churchill, who was consulted about the production and its new context, has recently said that her 1982 classic, based on Thatcher’s Britain, is more an inquiry into society than about feminism. Director Suba Das’s enthusiastic production might have the Toxteth riots as background but it reminds one that the brilliance of Churchill’s play is that it is never doctrinaire, but filled with human oddity, struggle and disappointment. Tala Gouveia power-walks her way convincingly into the role of Marlene, managing director of Top Girls Recruitment Agency, and yet – her 80s shoulder-padded dress notwithstanding – she proves as much a casualty, in her own way, as women with low-flying careers or no careers at all.</p><p>In <em>Top Girls</em>, sisterhood scarcely exists – even between sisters. Marlene’s illegitimate daughter, Angie (engaging Saffron Dey), is being raised by Marlene’s working-class sister Joyce (Alicya Eyo powerfully emphasises Joyce’s righteous resentment). Aside from Angie’s spaniel-like devotion to “Auntie”, none of the women likes one another, and that is the real shocker (especially in the Liverpudlian context). Individual ambition contributes nothing to the common good. And this turns out to be the challenge for the production itself because the spirit of “each woman for herself” is, at the moment, leading to a lack of cohesion in the cast.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/12/top-girls-everyman-liverpool-review-the-great-british-bake-off-musical-noel-coward-theatre-sleepova-bush-bukky-bakray-oklahoma-wyndhams">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool<br /></strong>Terfel graciously leads a talented young cast while Domingo Hindoyan conducts the RLPO with wit and passion in a performance where no one really puts a foot wrong  </p><p>The latest collaboration between the <a href="https://www.liverpoolphil.com/">Royal Liverpool Philharmonic</a> and the <a href="https://www.operaeurope.eu/">European Opera Centre</a>, also based in Liverpool, is a concert staging of<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/giacomo-puccini"> Puccini</a>’s Gianni Schicchi, conducted by Domingo Hindoyan and directed by Bernard Rozet. Bryn Terfel returns to the role of the titular opportunist, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/08/classicalmusicandopera1">he first sang at Covent Garden in 2007</a>, while the avaricious Donati family, whom he eventually defrauds, are played by the EOC’s young singers.</p><p>Rozet is hampered by the need to cramp the action into a narrow strip of space in front of the orchestra, though his direction can be astute, the comedy sometimes very dark indeed. He updates the opera to the 1960s, and his Donatis are a grotesque crew that might have strayed from Fellini or Buñuel, barely attempting even a semblance of grief at Buoso Donati’s death and casually stepping over or kicking his corpse, which is dumped at the foot of Hindoyan’s podium. Terfel’s knowing Schicchi observes them with both irony and contempt before turning on them, eventually driving them from the platform to seek refuge among the audience. He is in fine voice, his performance at once very funny and wonderfully subtle, always leading the young cast around him yet never upstaging them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/12/gianni-schicchi-review-bryn-terfel-puccini-liverpool-">Continue reading...</a>

## Elon Musk is the Basil Fawlty of social media | David Mitchell

<p>The Twitter owner’s latest public debacle over a sacked worker can only do more damage to the company’s future prosperity</p><p>As someone who wishes Twitter didn’t exist, I am obviously an enormous fan of Elon Musk. He seems to be running it like one of those central London pubs that get bought by property developers who then have to prove the business is unviable in order to win planning permission to turn it into flats. I apologise for the length of that simile, but it’s an interesting comparison. Those stealth-saboteur landlords have to keep it plausible. The business must fail by doing the sort of thing an idiot might sincerely believe would succeed. Live music, an open mic night, potato wedges instead of chips, that sort of thing.</p><p>Musk’s Twitter approach is <em>very</em> plausible. He tried to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/08/elon-musk-buy-twitter-withdraw">back out</a> of taking over the firm, but then there was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/19/elon-musk-delay-trial-denied-twitter-takeover">court case</a> and he was forced to buy it and it was both intergalactically expensive and losing money at a dazzling rate. Hence he seems desperate to cut costs and ramp up revenue. On the face of it, that’s a solid business strategy. Well, almost – it would be, but for the word “seems”. All businesses, whether they’re losing money or making it, want to cut costs and increase revenue, but they have to be wary of <em>seeming</em> too much that they do – especially if they’re in the leisure sector. Even the property developer’s pub must stop short of advertising that they’re now selling worse beer at a higher cost or that they’ve got rid of most of the kitchen staff so you should expect long waits if you order food.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/12/elon-musk-is-the-basil-fawlty-of-social-media">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is the trend for epic movies and hefty novels getting too much? Our critics redress the balance with a classic compilation of shorter works – plus 10 long ones that are worth your time</p><p>A growing trend for longer films and heftier novels has recently been attracting indignant comment. Martin Scorsese’s latest film, <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/26/guys-length-isnt-everything-film-making">in the news</a> not for its content but because it is three hours 20 minutes long (and he has form on this – <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/10/the-irishman-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-al-pacino-joe-pesci-netflix">The Irishman</a></em> was three hours 29 minutes). This year’s Oscar contenders have also been taking their – and our – time: <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/15/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-review-extraordinarily-potent-german-first-world-war-drama">All Quiet on the Western Front</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/26/elvis-review-blistering-turbocharged-chronicle-of-the-king">Elvis</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/14/tar-review-todd-field-cate-blanchett-dazzles-as-monstrous-maestro">Tár</a></em> are two-and-a-half hours long each. And <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/18/avatar-the-way-of-water-james-cameron-3d-sequel-review-damp-squib-return-to-pandora">Avatar: The Way of Water</a></em>, the third highest-grossing film of all time, spills on for three hours 12 minutes. Is the idea that sitting in a cinema interminably makes it more of an event, earns you epic stripes as a cinema-goer – makes you a co-hero along with Batman (whose most recent outing was three hours long)? Or are you more likely to be furtively checking the time in the dark?</p><p>Length seems to be becoming dangerously confused with artistic prestige – as though short equals superficial or critically lightweight. According to publisher Flipsnack, novels have been getting longer for a couple of decades. The average length of those on the Booker prize shortlist, in 2019, was 530 pages. Fantasy fiction is especially incontinent: the last Game of Thrones book, <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>, was 413,202 words, trumping the dimensions of the Victorian novel and in defiance of our distractible modern attention spans. Are we, in the age of the soundbite, tweet and TikTok, becoming rebelliously nostalgic for an era when there seemed to be more time?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/12/eighty-nine-perfect-minutes-30-of-the-best-short-films-and-novels">Continue reading...</a>

The co-director of the Lesbian Project, launched last week, tells why the ‘L’ of LGBTQ+ must not be allowed to disappear into the rainbow soup<p>LGBTQ+ activism is everywhere in modern Britain. Alongside lesbians, gay men and bisexual people, each year new orientations and identities arrive to shelter under the rainbow umbrella – from trans and nonbinary to intersex, asexual, polyamorous, queer and beyond. At a distance, it all looks admirably progressive. But when considered a bit more closely, it seems that lesbians – the “L” ostensibly at the front of the LGBTQ+ movement – are badly missing out. In policymaking, the charity sector, academic research, data collection, media representation and political attention – to name but a few areas – lesbians have fallen to the back of the queue.</p><p>Pride is the emotion usually associated with the rainbow coalition and there are certainly many historic achievements for LGBTQ+ activists to feel proud of. Still, not much attention has been paid to the question of how well the interests of distinct member groups are identified and prioritised, once they are under the rainbow umbrella. A lot of money, resources and public attention flow into this sector – but how exactly are the spoils divided?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/12/i-came-out-late-only-to-findlesbians-slipped-back-of-queue">Continue reading...</a>

In attacking the new asylum policy, Gary Lineker has left a stricken BBC floundering and shown the Tory right how it is misjudging Britain<p>The Conservative party and its media outriders have overreached themselves in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/10/gary-lineker-step-back-match-of-the-day-bbc" title="">Lineker affair</a>. The “stop the boats” policy, which flouts democratic, legal and humanitarian standards to reach new heights of cruelty in our proposed treatment of asylum seekers, is not just another political controversy. It goes to the heart of what kind of country we are and how policy should be conducted in a democracy. Authoritarian regimes everywhere progress by breaching one convention as a launchpad for breaching the next until, finally, they land their prize of subordinating human rights to their partisan and untrammelled will. But human rights are indivisible; one breach leaves the rest diminished and weakened.</p><p>No less fundamental in a democracy are the rules of engagement in the public square. Debate, however passionate, must respect facts. While our broadcast media are regulated to serve that end, upheld by a system of public service broadcasting of which the BBC is the anchor, our newspapers are not. Newspapers, particularly of the right, have increasingly been edited not as journals but as propagandists of rightwing ideology in which facts are subordinate, serving profoundly political ends. The callous extremes of the “stop the boats” scheme could not have been conceived, nor the extravagant language used to defend it, without the poisonous climate they created. They are necessarily ardent critics of the BBC, even stricken and enfeebled as it is, because it stands in the way of how they want to frame political and cultural argument – part of the march towards the unconstrained exercise of executive privilege, the attacks on human rights and the diminution of our democracy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/12/its-taken-brave-football-star-to-inject-morality-into-our-shaming-debate-on-migrants">Continue reading...</a>

## Starmer and Sunak are both haunted by the spectres of election defeats past | Andrew Rawnsley

Labour is spooked by its defeat in 1992, while the Tories fear a repeat of what happened to them in 1997<p>Tories are having a debate among themselves about whether they can somehow contrive to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat or are doomed to be chewed up and spat out by angry voters whenever the next election comes. Confronted with persistently terrible poll ratings, the gloomsters think they’re trapped in a repeat of an old horror movie about an age-raddled, scandal-riddled and bitterly divided Conservative government that has forfeited public respect for its competence with the economy or anything else. They know how that plotline went under John Major. The denouement in 1997 was a landslide defeat. On this reading, the public have made up their minds and are just drumming their fingers until they get the chance to chuck them out. Rishi Sunak will have the occasional positive episode, as he did with brokering improvements to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/27/rishi-sunak-deal-eu-brexit-northern-ireland-protocol" title="">Northern Ireland protocol</a>. He will exploit the opportunities of his position to perform on international stages, as he did at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/mar/10/uk-france-summit-sunak-macron-meet-in-paris-video" title="">Franco-British summit</a> with Emmanuel Macron on Friday. The chancellor will attempt to claw back some confidence in the Tories’ financial management, which will be Jeremy Hunt’s central goal when he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/06/jeremy-hunt-2023-budget-energy-bills" title="">presents the budget</a> this week. To Tory fatalists, despairing into the bottom of their wine glasses, none of this will really matter a damn. Mr Major had some good moments before the 1997 election, and the economy was doing quite well by the time it was called, but his government couldn’t be saved from oblivion. In the wake of his eviction from Number 10, he lugubriously lamented: “If I had stood unopposed, I would still have come second.”</p><p>Senior Labour people are not arguing about whether we are reliving the run-up to ’97. That’s because none of them think they have a chance of replicating the 179-seat majority won by Tony Blair. Sir Keir Starmer’s party had a 10-point advantage in the polls as the curtain crashed down on Boris Johnson’s shabby premiership, Labour moved 30 points ahead during the lunacies of Liz Truss and has settled into a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/" title="">20-point lead</a> since Mr Sunak moved into Number 10. That’s big and gives Labour people lots of hope that they can win, but the sensible ones are acutely conscious that opposition poll leads almost always shrink in the approach to an election. “The risk for us is that we get used to being 20 points ahead,” says one member of the shadow cabinet. “We have to be ready for things to narrow, as they inevitably will. We have to be prepared for that happening and not wobble when it does.” As Sir John Curtice, the psephological savant, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/newe.12316" title="">says</a>: “For all the government’s recent difficulties, Labour’s route back to power is markedly more rugged and steep than the one Tony Blair had to negotiate in 1997.” Then, Labour needed a swing of just 4% to get to a parliamentary majority. Thanks to the dismal legacy of the last election, its worst result since 1935, Labour has a vast mountain to scale. It probably requires a swing of 12% to get over the line – a bigger shift than the 10% achieved by Mr Blair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/12/starmer-and-sunak-are-both-haunted-by-the-spectres-of-election-defeats-past">Continue reading...</a>

Gold eyeshadow is usually reserved for big nights out, but you can use it during the day to great effect<p>Most people relegate gold eyeshadow to after hours. But I’m not big on rules, so I consider gold a modern neutral that works just as well during the day. There are variations of gold, and how you apply it makes all the difference. Deep, bronzy or rose golds are easier than their yellowy counterpart. But if you still consider gold with trepidation, here’s my advice: use it as a liner or apply a soft sheer veil across the eyelid using a slightly damp brush and a hint of eyeshadow. It will take everything down a notch – except your skin, which will immediately look brighter.</p><p><strong>1.

His celebration of the mundane reflected the beginnings of a modern sensibility<p>There is a scene in Marilynne Robinson’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/16/fiction.alismith" title="">novel</a> <em>Gilead</em> in which the main character, John Ames, a pastor, walking to his church, comes across a young couple in the street. “The sun had come up brilliantly after a heavy rain, and the trees were glistening and very wet,” he recalls. The young man ahead of him “jumped up and caught hold of a branch, and a storm of luminous water came pouring down on the two of them, and they laughed and took off running, the girl sweeping water off her hair and her dress”. It was “a beautiful thing to see, like something from a myth”. In such moments, “it is easy to believe… that water was made primarily for blessing, and only secondarily for growing vegetables or doing the wash”.</p><p>It is a wonderful, luminous passage, typical of Robinson’s ability to discover the lyrical even within the mundane. Deeply Christian, and Calvinist, there is in her writing a spiritual force that springs from her faith. She would probably describe that scene as the discovery of a divine presence in the world. And yet, flowing out of that scene, is also an awareness that transcends the religious. It is the uncovering of something very human, a celebration of our ability to find the poetic in our simplest activities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/12/vermeer-luminous-interiors-gave-new-way-into-inner-worlds-others">Continue reading...</a>

Subletting, is what you or I might call it, but here it has been rebranded as a cheeky life hack, much like deodorising your microwave with lemon juice. “Rent to rent” means renting a flat, then letting it on Airbnb for twice what you’re paying, your tenant now crushed under a double-weight of landlords, a rare experience in that it is absolutely nobody’s kink.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/12/worried-about-rent-spare-a-thought-for-your-poor-landlord">Continue reading...</a>

She talks about postboxes, puzzling and why she couldn’t be happier<p>​Within the space of just 10 minutes, Jennifer Saunders has shared three anecdotes, and rather than the stuff of the anecdotes themselves, it’s their balance – of glamour, glee and Britishness – that paints a distinct portrait of someone quite happy to dip into stardom and showbiz just so long as they’re home in time for tea. The first is about the night <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/roseanne-barr" title="">Roseanne Barr</a> took Saunders and Joanna Lumley to meet an ageing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/richard-pryor" title="">Richard Pryor</a> in a Los Angeles comedy club. The second is about the time <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/13/goldie-hawn-i-was-born-with-a-high-set-point-for-happiness" title="">Goldie Hawn</a> flew her to New York to read a script Saunders was meant to have written, when Saunders had fully intended (but failed) to write the whole thing on the plane. And the third is about her current hobby, riding an electric bike through the Cornish lanes near her home, in search of interesting postboxes. “Yes, interesting postboxes.”</p><p>We’re sitting at right angles to each other, Saunders, at 64, elegant in cashmere and clompy boots, stroking a dignified whippet called Olive. The placing of the sofas is such that she is able to avoid looking directly at me, and I think this is how she likes it. Previous interviewers have sometimes described her as cold, but I get the impression instead that she is reserved, maybe a little shy, which I respect in a multi-award-winning movie star.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/12/the-funniest-stuff-is-just-chatting-jennifer-saunders-allelujah">Continue reading...</a>

On the first they are watching their teammates duel with Australia, on the other they are tuned to Sri Lanka v New Zealand where the visitors have set the Black Caps 285 to win the first Test. Of course Sri Lanka must win that series 2-0 to have a hope of qualifying for the World Test Championship whereas India need to draw or win this Test to usurp them for a spot in the WTC final against Australia in June.</p><p><strong>103rd over: India 302-3 (Kohli 65, Jadeja 23)</strong> Quick single! It looked risky but the batters ran like rabbits to make it safely. A shout on the third ball from Murphy as it rushes onto Jadeja and raps the pad roll but Australia are down to one review now so with seven wickets to get, Smith will have to use it wisely. Murphy has bowled well for his 1-51 from 24 overs but he will need to find another level (or unveil a mystery ball?) to extract these two batters. Two from the over and India now trail by 179.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/mar/12/india-vs-australia-live-updates-cricket-score-fourth-test-day-4-four-ind-v-aus-scorecard-international-match-latest-scores-ahmedabad-narendra-modi-stadium">Continue reading...</a>

Whoever takes the reins in Scotland, statehood is surely an irresistible force<p>‘Ane lecherous and bluidy Tyrant, slain be his nobillis in the viij yeare of his reign.” So the old chronicles record about quite a few Scottish kings. Succession to power has not often been a smooth business in Scotland and the competition to succeed Nicola Sturgeon, though bloodless, is happening in a landscape pitted with uncertainties.</p><p>Kate Forbes resembles Sturgeon in her bold self-certainty, but not in her distinctly conservative politics – well to the right of Sturgeonite social democracy. Humza Yousaf, the experienced “continuity candidate”, is a likable man rather unfairly mocked as a serial incompetent (though <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64798627" title="">operation waiting times</a>, on his watch as health secretary, are awful – far worse than England’s). Ash Regan, lagging behind the other two, enjoys her freedom to criticise the SNP and the wider independence movement for lack of energy. If she or Forbes were to win and become first minister, the governing coalition with the Greens would almost certainly collapse. That would leave the SNP as far the largest party in the Scottish parliament, but just short of an absolute majority.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/12/snp-may-face-disaster-after-sturgeon-but-the-flame-of-independence-still-burns">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Photographer George Steinmetz captures Indian chilli fields in his series exploring the patterns – and problems – of intensive food production</p><p>Since chillies were introduced to India by Vasco da Gama in 1498, one variety has come to be most prized around the world: the deep red Guntur chilli grown in Andhra Pradesh on the south-east coast of the subcontinent. Last year, the state produced 800,000 tonnes of the product. The photographer <a href="https://www.georgesteinmetz.com/">George Steinmetz</a> took this picture of the chilli fields in Andhra Pradesh using a drone camera. It shows the female labourers on a small family farm near Guntur sorting sun-dried rows of chillies. The women are paid about £3 a day.</p><p>Steinmetz has spent the last few years working on a project entitled <a href="https://www.feedtheplanet.earth/">Feed the Planet</a>, which gives a visual language to the scale of food production required for a global human population that is projected to grow to nearly 10 billion by 2050. Many of his photographs, like this one, present patterns of agricultural practice that appear to knit patterns from the landscape. The satisfying bird’s eye geometry of those images – of platoons of combine harvesters bringing in the soya bean crop in Brazil or the abstract expressionist collages of seaweed production in Bali – lies in contrast with the vast and intensive surface-level industry they imply.</p><p>George Steinmetz’s Foodscapes series is shortlisted in the <a href="http://worldphoto.org/">Sony world photography awards 2023</a>.

<p>Adolescence is a time of great change, with everything from sleep to social media impacting on growth. Psychologist Sarah-Jayne Blakemore explains how to support positive habits</p><p>When I was studying as an undergraduate, almost 30 years ago, I was taught that the human brain stops developing in childhood. But that is wrong. Now that we have the technology to look inside the living human brain and track changes in its structure and function across a lifespan, we know that the brain continues to develop substantially throughout adolescence and into early adulthood.</p><p>We define adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 24. This is a relatively new definition, which is partly based on this new knowledge about brain development. The brain changes, both in terms of its function – how it is activated when you do things like make decisions, plan actions, think about other people, or process emotions – and also in its structure. Although the brain is almost adult size by about the age of eight or nine, its internal composition changes radically during adolescence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/12/dont-blame-the-young-for-being-moody-and-seven-other-ways-to-nurture-healthy-teenage-minds">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A lively, affectionate but far from adulatory new biography of the playwright marks the 50th anniversary of his death and draws on unpublished letters and diaries to expose a painful private life obscured by success</p><p>As a 12-year-old child actor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/noelcoward">Noël Coward</a> featured in a dance number at the Savoy theatre in London playing the part of a mushroom. A photograph of him in his fungal finery – “grey silk skin tights, a large grey silk hat like a gargantuan muffin, and a diaphanous frill round my middle” – was put on display by his proud mother at whichever house the family were billeted in. It was perhaps the only picture in the son’s long career that he told his mother <em>not</em> to show when distinguished visitors called.</p><p>The tension between display and concealment is a central motif of this lively, affectionate but by no means adoring biography of the man who would eventually insist on “Master” as his preferred form of address, “as if he had an unhealthy belief in the reality of his own myth”. Oliver Soden has timed its publication to mark the 50th anniversary of Coward’s death in March 1973 and, granted access to his subject’s previously unpublished diaries and letters, he makes a sound case for reappraising a writer who, rather than a “talent to amuse”, was in fact a radical teller of truths about love, art and class. Those truths came at the cost of a painful and necessarily private life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/12/masquerade-the-lives-of-noel-coward-by-oliver-soden-review-the-man-in-the-ironic-mask">Continue reading...</a>

Axing musicians and its chamber choir won’t make the broadcaster richer, but will make the nation poorer<p>When the BBC unveiled <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64875989" title="">its new classical music strategy</a> last week, it did so using what can only be described as a thick and unappetising soup of <em>W1A</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/19/w1a-review-bbc-send-up" title="">management speak</a>. Its latest masterplan would, it said, “prioritise quality, agility and impact”. So far, it has not explained what this might mean in reality; there is vague talk of “investing” in unspecified education projects. What we do know, however, is that the money to do this will come from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/07/bbc-singers-choir-to-close-as-part-of-corporations-major-review-of-classical-music" title="">the paltry savings</a> made by the axing of the BBC Singers, the UK’s only full-time professional chamber choir, and 20% of the salaried musicians in its several orchestras.</p><p>Coming after Arts Council England’s decision last November to cut funding to (among others) English National Opera and the Britten Sinfonia, the music world has reacted to this with understandable fury. Sakari Oramo, the Finnish conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, called it “blatant vandalism”. Neil Tennant, of the Pet Shop Boys, professed himself “shocked and disappointed”. Dame Sarah Connelly, the celebrated mezzo-soprano, described it as “crass, ill-informed and appallingly handled”. John Rutter, the composer and conductor, pointed out that Latvia, a country with a population of fewer than two million, manages to support a 24-strong full-time chamber choir. In response, the BBC wheeled out Simon Webb, recently appointed head of orchestras and choirs, to defend the move. His excruciating prevarication spoke for itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/12/the-observer-view-on-the-bbc-silencing-its-singers">Continue reading...</a>

## Luxurious condrieu and other viogniers

<p>Condrieu is always a rare and wondrous treat, but there are other viogniers that also hit the spot at a fraction of the price</p><p><strong>Domaine François Merlin Condrieu Terroirs, Condrieu, Rhône, France 2020 (£48, <a href="https://www.robersonwine.com/">robersonwine.com</a>) </strong>I think of condrieu as a luxury wine, and I’d be lying if I said price didn’t come into that characterisation: it’s very hard to find examples of this Rhône Valley white for less than £30, and many far exceed that, which means it’s strictly special-occasion stuff. Still, it isn’t just the price tag that makes a good bottle of condrieu feel particularly pampering. For a dry wine, it is lavishly full-bodied: plump and silky-textured, creamy and extravagantly aromatic, a full-on sensory experience. At its worst, all those features combine into something de trop: too much ripe apricot, too much honeysuckle, too overbearing. It becomes decadent and foppish rather than merely indulgent. At its best, however, those qualities are slightly, if not entirely restrained. There is detail and freshness and a kind of buoyancy, as there is in Domaine François Merlin’s captivating example which has a rippling, flowing feel, a spring-fresh current driving all the perfectly ripe apricot and fragrant peach blossom.</p><p><strong>Muret Viognier, IGP Pays d’Oc, France 2021 (from £11.96, <a href="https://collectivino.com/">collectivino.com</a>; <a href="https://winefreedom.co.uk/">winefreedom.co.uk</a>) </strong>Condrieu’s price and specialness is also explained by its relative rarity: it’s a small appellation of 200 hectares of vineyards in the Northern Rhône Valley, a part of the world much better known for its earthy, savoury, peppery red wines from syrah. That the vines are tended for the most part by small producers, and are grown on hillsides, neither of which lend themselves to cost-cutting, is another factor that prevents it ever becoming everyday drinking. One of the Rhône’s biggest names, Guigal, makes a consistently good version at a reasonable-for-the-area £34.99 (2019 vintage, Waitrose). Another way of accessing the voluptuous pleasures of Condrieu at a more affordable price is to try something made from the same grape, viognier, from a less prestigious appellation. That might be in the Rhône Valley itself (the succulent Les Vins de Viennes Viognier IGP Collines Rhodaniennes 2021; £19.50, the <a href="https://www.thegoodwineshop.co.uk/">goodwineshop.co.uk</a>), or it might one of the many good versions made in the Languedoc-Roussillon (the succulent, frangipane-infused Muret Viognier).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/12/luxurious-condrieu-and-other-viogniers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Vermont senator and former presidential candidate offers a clarion call against the American oligarchs</p><p>The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has a predictably unsparing view of the effects of “unfettered capitalism”: it “destroys anything that gets in its way in the pursuit of profits. It destroys the environment. It destroys our democracy. It discards human beings without a second thought. It will never provide workers with the fulfillment that Americans have a right to expect from their careers. [And it is] propelled by uncontrollable greed and contempt for human decency.”</p><p>The two-time presidential candidate makes his case with the usual horrifying numbers about the acceleration of inequality in America: 90% of our wealth is owned by one-tenth of 1% of the population; the wealth of 725 US billionaires increased 70% during the pandemic to more than $5tn; BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street now control assets of $20tn and are major shareholders in 96% of S&amp;P 500 companies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/12/bernie-sanders-new-book-review">Continue reading...</a>

If Rishi Sunak is serious about tackling migration, he needs to ignore the hate-mongers and look at the bigger picture<p>It’s not just Britain. Europe, too, has a refugee problem with which it is failing to cope, as do the US and other wealthy countries. Rishi Sunak’s new, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/10/uk-fund-immigration-detention-centre-france-rishi-sunak" title="">£500m payment</a> to French police to curb Channel crossings ignores this bigger picture. How does confining desperate, blameless people in yet another detention centre help anyone? Like the Tories’ Rwanda deportation scheme, it’s a crude, inhumane way to dodge moral and legal responsibility. It’s high time this government realised Channel crossings are but one tiny part of a global refugee crisis. Its focus should be on urgent, collaborative pan-European and international action.</p><p>About <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/01/total-of-45756-people-crossed-channel-to-uk-in-small-boats-in-2022" title="">46,000 people</a> used small boats to seek asylum in Britain in 2022, up from 9,000 in 2020, according to the latest official data.
