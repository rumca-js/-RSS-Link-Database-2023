We're springing our clocks forward today, so the show will start an hour earlier than usual for our non-U.S. viewers. Also, this means spring is coming soon, and I'll be finally able to rattlecan prime a bunch of terrain projects I'm working on. I'll talk about that, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
