<p>The PM’s determination to stay faithful to the ‘Indo-Pacific tilt’ is vague, while Russia is still the greatest threat</p><p>The refresh of the integrated review of defence and foreign policy comes only two years after the original, and if Labour were to win the election it may only last a similar amount of time. Nor would it have happened if it hadn’t been for Conservative chaos, as reopening the review was the brainchild of the short-lived Liz Truss.</p><p>To be fair, the war in Ukraine has upended previous assumptions, but this is not really the path taken by Rishi Sunak. A large part of what is announced focuses on China and the emerging Australia, UK and US “Aukus” partnership to provide Canberra with nuclear powered submarines to give naval technological parity with Beijing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/12/sunaks-focus-may-be-on-china-but-its-europes-security-that-is-vital-for-the-uk">Continue reading...</a>
