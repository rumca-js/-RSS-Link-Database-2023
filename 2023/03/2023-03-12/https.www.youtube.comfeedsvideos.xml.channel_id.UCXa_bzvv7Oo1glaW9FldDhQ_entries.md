Half-Life 2 is obviously one of the most legendary games of all time, and given its unshakeable legacy, there isn’t much about it or its development that isn’t already known to anyone with a passing interest in the franchise.

Despite an abundance of delays and pushbacks left, right, and center, the year 2022 ultimately managed to turn out great for the games industry as a whole. We got to experience smash hits with the likes of Horizon Forbidden West and Stray among others. Of course, last year also proved to be a crucial one for dark horses that completely took us by surprise, and we have plenty of reasons for thinking that this trend is sure to continue with this year as well. 

One of the strongest candidates in this category is definitely WWE 2K23. Those familiar with the game’s long history would know that the franchise’s reputation had been down in the slumps with underwhelming buggy releases in the last couple of years, but all that has changed with the recent release of WWE 2K22. Following the cancellation of WWE 2K21, it was absolutely essential for WWE 2K22 to deliver a great wrestling game next year. And suffice to say, 2K Games managed to hit its mark with great gameplay and a buffet of content options for fans to dive into.

Arguably the truest sequel to Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil – Code: Veronica bares all the hallmarks of classic, quintessential Resident Evil, and whilst its notoriety has risen in recent years it’s a shame it’s been largely forgotten.
