We got to experience smash hits with the likes of Horizon Forbidden West and Stray among others. Of course, last year also proved to be a crucial one for dark horses that completely took us by surprise, and we have plenty of reasons for thinking that this trend is sure to continue with this year as well. \n\nOne of the strongest candidates in this category is definitely WWE 2K23.
