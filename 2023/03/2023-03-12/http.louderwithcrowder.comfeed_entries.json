Allard identifies as a member of the LGBTQ community and wears women's clothes to school. Guglielmo believes this facilitates gender confusion and also criticized some of Allard's social media posts as inappropriate for children. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/dad-dresses-julius-caesar-school-board-meeting-protest-teachers-gender-fluid-attire\" target=\"_blank\">According to a letter </a>written by the school district and sent to Guglielmo, he asked Allard to take a photograph, and Allard agreed. He then asked Allard to pose, and Allard declined. The school deemed this harassment, resulting in Guglielmo's prohibition from the school. </p><p>Guglielmo's criticisms of Allard led to Allard being placed on leave, but ultimately, the school allowed them to return. Which prompted Guglielmo to speak at the school board meeting. As Julius Caesar. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">None</div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CITClassroom/status/1633546151315099649\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>\"I am Caesar.

She wasn't ready for that one. And it was evident in her response:<em> \"Feminism is just doing whatever you want to do, and not being bashed by society for that\" </em>.
