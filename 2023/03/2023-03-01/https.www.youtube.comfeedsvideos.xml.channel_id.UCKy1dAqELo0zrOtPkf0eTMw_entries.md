The Mandalorian Season 3 Premiere reviewed by Samantha Nelson on Disney+.

Entertaining fight scenes and adorable Grogu antics anchor The Mandalorian Season 3 pilot, which is mostly devoted to getting viewers back up to speed with the state of the world and its characters and setting Din on a new quest. The show goes back to the beginning to demonstrate how much has changed even if its core dynamic remains the same, laying solid groundwork for a host of new conflicts for the Mandalorian and his foundling to face together.

## Gran Turismo 7 VR Review

Gran Turismo 7 VR reviewed by Gabriel Moss on PlayStation VR 2.

Gran Turismo 7 is the same amazing simulation-focused racer it always has been, but playing in a PS VR2 headset has elevated it in unexpected ways. Driving its intense and entrancing races in VR adds such a high level of tactility that you can physically feel the tweaks you make to your car, demystifying a lot of the otherwise intimidating optional customization for the average player. It also looks stunning, making up for flat menus and the lack of interactivity in its cabins with impressive lighting and audio alike.

## Elden Ring's First DLC Expansion Finally Confirmed - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
FromSoftware has finally announced the first major expansion to Elden Ring, titled Shadow of the Erdtree. Not much is known about what will be included in the upcoming DLC, not even a release date. This technically isn't the first DLC Elden Ring has received—it got a multiplayer-centric Colloseum update a few months ago that allowed for proper PvP. But if this follows the Dark Souls standard of expansions, it will be substantial story-related content. Time to call upon your ghost horse and travel back to the Lands Between, ye Tarnished. And speaking of games getting DLC, the Forspoken devs have announced they're rejoining Square Enix. The team behind Forspoken are mostly made up of folks who worked on Final Fantasy XV, but spun off to try their hand at an original IP. Reviews were tepid, but there's still DLC coming later this year before they're officially absorbed back into the Square Enix fold. And finally, we take a closer look at the dangers you'll face in the upcoming Destiny 2: Lightfall expansion.
