<p>Matthias Schoenaerts steps out of the shadows, tilts his cowboy hat – then tries to fight a tank of a man for cash. From there, this preposterous western only ramps up the bloody chaos</p><p>The old saying has it that there are only two types of stories: someone goes on a journey, or a stranger comes to town. Django has a stranger come to town in classic fashion. This cinematic, sprawling 10-part series is “loosely inspired” by Sergio Corbucci’s 1966 cult spaghetti western of the same name, and it offers a steady take on the genre, which is once again enjoying an on-screen revival.</p><p>Django is set in Texas in 1872, seven years after the end of the civil war, though we are reminded, with curious understatement, by a note at the beginning of the first episode that Black people in the south “continued to suffer harsh discrimination and violence”. Django himself (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/10/matthias-schoenaerts-the-drop">Matthias Schoenaerts</a>, looking like a pre-court appearance <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/30/james-norton-interview-greatest-fear-rats">Tommy Lee Royce</a>) makes quite the entrance. He emerges from the shadows, looks up from beneath the brow of his tilted cowboy hat and offers to fight a tank of an Austrian man, bare-knuckled, for a substantial cash prize.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/01/django-review-the-new-defiantly-gruesome-western-rides-into-town">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Labour ought to realise that growth is important, but it may not be what really matters to voters</p><p>When the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 by the six nations that founded the European Economic Community, Italy was by far the poorest member. This was a boon not a burden. With a low-cost, high-quality manufacturing base and falling tariffs within the bloc, Italy became a European industrial player. Cash from Brussels helped to <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/1987/0508/oital.html" title="">power</a> the economy but so did farm workers moving to find work in factories. By 1987 Italy had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_sorpasso_(economics)" title=""><em>il sorpasso</em></a>, the moment when it celebrated overtaking Britain in terms of per capita income. Yet in 2021, Italian GDP per head was <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?end=2021&amp;amp;locations=US-GB-FR-DE-PT-PL-XC-IT&amp;amp;start=2021&amp;amp;view=bar" title="">roughly</a> 10% below the UK.</p><p>Economic catch-up is easier than staying ahead of the pack. This ought to deter politicians from reading too much into growth rates. Yet that is what Sir Keir Starmer attempted with his <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/britains-economic-trajectory-will-soon-see-it-overtaken-by-poland-labour-to-warn-12821152" title="">warning</a> that Britain could soon be “overtaken by Poland”. Sir Keir imagined British voters would be humiliated by finding themselves being notionally poorer than those in a former Communist state. But the Labour leader exposed a neurosis that grips him perhaps more tightly than the public.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/01/the-guardian-view-on-economic-comparisons-polands-rise-is-not-about-our-faults">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rish! drags himself to dispatch box but no sign of that other man of the moment, Matt Hancock</p><p>It’s been a busy few days for a prime minister who prefers to stay hidden indoors. On Monday, he had had his Windsor tryst with Ursula von der Leyen. <em>Quelle tendresse! </em>The brush of elbows under the portrait of the queen. The lingering glances across the lectern. The sweet <em>riens</em>. You’re the best. No, no. You’re the best. Yes. It really had been quite the day. He still hadn’t quite come back to earth. And why hadn’t she phoned like she had promised? Why did he care so much?</p><p>On Tuesday, he had been over in Northern Ireland to sell his deal. Doing everything that he liked least. Meeting the little people. Hello, guys. Yes, you guys. Hello, miss. Practising his glottal stop to make it sound as if he had the common touch. Standing around on a cold factory floor. Checking the phone anxiously to see if U had messaged at last.

<p>The director’s 1994 film about a spy posing as a mild-mannered married man is cheapened with a junky small-screen transfer</p><p>As James Cameron continues his victory lap as re-throned king of the world with both Avatar: The Way of Water and Titanic making more and more millions at the box office, here comes a striking reminder that not everything he touches turns to gold. Granted, it might only be the lightest of grazes with just a token executive producer credit but the finished product is so thoroughly junky that even the mildest of associations is the kind of embarrassment one would want scrubbed from both IMDb page and televisual history at large.</p><p>It didn’t have to be this way. Conceptually, converting his boisterously entertaining 1994 action comedy True Lies into a TV series isn’t entirely ill-advised; the loose set-up of mixing marital strife with high-octane action was already enough to inspire 2005’s equally enjoyable Mr and Mrs Smith, itself receiving <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/culture/mr-and-mrs-smith-donald-glover-cast-release-date">a more prestige-y small screen transfer</a> later this year courtesy of Donald Glover. (One could argue the film also led to Date Night, Knight and Day and a flurry of other genre-mixing crowd-pleasers.) At one point Cameron was set to take a larger role before retreating into the blue and handing over the baton to a team that promptly drops it, falls over and lands flat on their faces. What once felt zippy and slick (if a little dated with its gender politics) now feels leaden and cheap, a cruel reminder of the fun we once had almost 30 years ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/01/true-lies-review-james-cameron-action-comedy-cbs">Continue reading...</a>

His film is compassionate, intelligent and shrewdly observed; it is about a Paris landmark which has only been in existence for 13 years but which tourists and anyone with an interest in mental health should really come and marvel at. The Adamant is a floating day-care centre for people with mental disorders, permanently moored on the Seine just by the Charles de Gaulle bridge. The design is half Mississippi gamblers’ riverboat, half art studio, with an elegant system of automatically opening louvred windows which make the most of daylight. The staff offer counselling and art therapy through music, painting, craft, literature and cinema. The Adamant hosts its own annual film festival for which the patients choose the films. There is also a cafe and bar.</p><p>The vessel’s name, the Adamant, is interestingly old-fashioned, like calling it the Fighting Temeraire. But it’s appropriate. Everyone involved is determined that the French state should protect this kind of respectful, collegiate approach which treats patients as human beings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/01/on-the-adamant-review-berlin-winner-offers-art-and-soul-aboard-a-floating-parisian-day-care-centre">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Barbican, London</strong><br />This recreation of the composer’s benefit concert for the Foundling Hospital was beautifully delivered</p><p><a href="https://englishconcert.co.uk/artist/harry-bicket/">Harry Bicket</a> and the English Concert have recently embarked on an extraordinary and ambitious project entitled <a href="https://englishconcert.co.uk/handel-for-all/">Handel for All</a>, the aim of which is to eventually make their own filmed performances of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/04/handel-where-to-start-with-his-music">the composer</a>’s entire output available free online. This Barbican concert essentially recreated an afternoon in May 1749, when Handel gave a benefit performance of his own works in aid of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundling_Hospital">Foundling Hospital</a> in London. The programme, then as now, consisted of the Music for the Royal Fireworks, extracts from Solomon, and the Foundling Hospital Anthem, newly composed for the occasion, though much of it actually recycled existing material, including the Hallelujah Chorus from Messiah.</p><p>Bicket is a wonderful Handelian and the performances were exemplary in their grace, enthusiasm and elan. Beautifully played, the Fireworks Music swung exuberantly between ceremonial grandeur and elegant refinement. Despite evidence of hasty composition, the Foundling Hospital Anthem contains fine things. Relocated to the context of the sober advocacy of social and religious responsibility in the face of poverty, the Hallelujah Chorus comes over as measured rather than exultant, and the emotional climax falls earlier with the deeply felt chorus Comfort Them O Lord When They Are Sick, and a glorious duet for two sopranos The People Will Tell of Their Wisdom: Miah Persson and Elena Villalón sounded ravishing together here. The New York-based <a href="https://clarionsociety.org/">Clarion Choir</a> sang with exacting precision and admirable fervour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/01/the-english-concertbicket-review-handel-of-grace-and-elan-as-bicket-takes-us-back-to-1749-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘These Ethiopian camel-traders are wearing their hair in a way that shows they are traditional “deep countryside” men. It’s a beautiful style, hand-groomed with clarified butter, but it’s disappearing’</p><p>Everyone in Ethiopia knows this hairstyle because it’s very specific to the Karrayyu people. They style their hair to invoke the shape of the sycamore tree, which is a sacred meeting place for the community. On market day, when they’re trading camels and get the opportunity to interact with women, all the guys pay very special attention to the hairstyle, spending a lot of time styling it.</p><p>The Karrayyu are a clan within the Oromo tribe, which is the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia. They live in the Awash Valley area of central Ethiopia. Almost every single person in Ethiopia recognises the Karrayyu. But the reality is that this hairstyle is disappearing in the countryside. It’s something the older generations do; it’s especially hard to find younger men with it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/01/robert-de-niros-of-metehara-joey-ls-best-photographs-ethiopian-camel-trader">Continue reading...</a>

No other player in the last half a century has come close. Then there’s Michel Platini, whose nine at Euro 84 remains an all-time record in that particular competition.

<p>Did decisions made by the former health secretary lead to more care home deaths? The point is, we should already know </p><p>The delay to the inquiry into Britain’s handling of Covid merits an inquiry of its own. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/01/matt-hancock-what-do-leaked-whatsapp-messages-reveal-covid">allegations in the Daily Telegraph</a> about the then health secretary, Matt Hancock – including that he dismissed expert advice to test anyone entering a care home for coronavirus at the start of the pandemic – may not be sensational. (Hancock has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/01/matt-hancock-rejected-covid-testing-advice-leaked-messages-suggest">strongly rejected the claim</a>.) Hindsight is a poor guide to judgments made in conditions of chaotic uncertainty. Whether the infection risk to care homes was higher from hospitals than from community contacts was surely debatable. Yes, around <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsinvolvingcovid19inthecaresectorenglandandwales/deathsregisteredbetweenweekending20march2020andweekending21january2022">20,000 care home deaths</a> were recorded in just four months, but only an official inquiry can tell us why.</p><p>While Britain’s public administration appears in a state of shambles, its obsession with public inquiries is booming.

<p>I underestimated the prime minister: his Northern Ireland deal does the job. But don’t expect any sunlit uplands just yet</p><p>Every now and again, something strange happens between the UK and EU: erstwhile adversaries become allies. It happened when Theresa May returned from Brussels with a deal in 2018. And it happened again on Monday as Ursula von der Leyen and “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/28/sunak-charmed-his-way-through-a-northern-ireland-deal-ursula-von-der-leyen-brexit">dear Rishi</a>” appeared together in Windsor. The prime minister has taken a huge political and electoral gamble. And only time will tell whether it will pay off.</p><p>First things first. This is a clever deal that addresses many of the UK’s concerns about the operation of the existing Northern Ireland protocol in a manner that is acceptable to the EU. That is no mean feat. Clever solutions have been found to apparently intractable problems, whether these pertain to medicines or sausages. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean much. May’s deal was a masterpiece of circle squaring, for all the good it did her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/01/rishi-sunak-problem-brexit-coalition-together-northern-ireland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Authors from James M Cain to Patricia Highsmith show how partners in crime can really bring out the worst in each other</p><p>There is a long and robust literary tradition of the crime-solving duo. Holmes and Watson. Nick and Nora Charles. Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. As a writer it’s nice to have two protagonists, if for no other reason than to have them discuss the plot together. It works particularly well if one is smarter than their sidekick and gets to explain how all the pieces fit together.</p><p>But what about the criminal duo? Where’s Moriarty is partner? The truth is, villainous pairs, although not unheard of, are comparatively rare. I was fairly young and very impressionable when I saw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/27/my-favourite-hitchcock-rope">Alfred Hitchcock’s Rope</a> on television, a film that opens with two young men murdering an acquaintance together, then hiding the body in a chest while hosting a cocktail party.

## Having a baby after pregnancy loss is a joy. But it may never wipe the slate clean | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett

<p>A revealing new book challenges the notion of miscarriage as a blip in the past, rather than an experience that can reverberate in the present</p><p>“It’s the idea that everything is healed.” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/04/miscarriages-talk-care-baby-loss-women-taboo">Jennie Agg</a> is talking to me about miscarriage. Or, specifically, how it feels to have a baby after miscarriage – or miscarriages, plural; Agg had four before she gave birth to her boy. Life, Almost – her book detailing her experiences and investigating why miscarriage still remains such an under-researched and under-acknowledged experience – has just come out, and it’s a vital new examination of the subject, with each chapter given the title of some of the false, trite or dismissive things people say: “It’s just nature’s way”, “it’s not a real baby yet”, “everything happens for a reason”.</p><p>In a book full of insights, perhaps one of the most affecting is the dawning understanding of the legacy that pregnancy loss can have. There is still an absurdly prevalent notion that finally getting a healthy baby – as most couples who experience miscarriage will – somehow wipes the slate clean, and makes everything that has happened in the past melt away. “Any residual grief, trauma or yearning is supposed to be washed away by the arrival of a longed-for child,” she writes. “After all – you got what you wanted, didn’t you?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/01/baby-pregnancy-loss-miscarriage">Continue reading...</a>

<p> A welcome celebration of four brilliant and colourful contributors to the 20th-century classical scene</p><p>In 1977, 90-year-old Rebecca Clarke was at Alice Tully Hall in Manhattan to hear a performance of her Viola Sonata, written more than half a century earlier. Clarke had been a successful composer, the Sonata her breakthrough work – and yet for most of the audience her music was still an unexpected discovery. “Had she not been a woman composer,” conceded the New York Times, “Miss Clarke might be heard more today.” Soon afterwards, Clarke reflected that there had always been people who could not believe that her muscular, modern, “unfeminine” music was written by a woman: “I take this opportunity,” she wrote wryly, “to emphasise that I do indeed exist.”</p><p>Emphasising that female composers did (and do) exist, even though they have often been left out of musical history, is what drives this biography of extraordinary women by Leah Broad. Clarke is one of four composers whose lives she weaves into a chronological account that to some extent doubles as a social history of Britain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/01/quartet-by-leah-broad-review-britains-great-female-composers">Continue reading...</a>

## Why are eggs so expensive? Because an avian flu killed 43 million hens | Gene Baur

<p>A global pandemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza is driving deaths in the egg industry. And factory farming is largely to blame</p><p>The increased cost of eggs has been in the news, but the cause has largely been absent in mainstream media. A global pandemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), a form of bird flu (H5N1), has resulted in the deaths of over <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=105576#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%20December,December%20(12.6%20million%20hens).">43 million hens</a> in the egg industry, causing a drop in the supply of eggs and higher prices for consumers. While industry and government officials are feverishly working on getting this outbreak under control, the more significant issue is that confining animals by the billions in cruel and stressful conditions exacerbates the spread of disease. The problem is getting worse, and agribusiness needs to stop distracting consumers with messages about high egg prices and be held accountable for its irresponsible conduct.</p><p>On factory farms across the US, animals used to produce meat, milk and eggs for human consumption are crowded by the thousands in unsanitary conditions, and they’re fed a steady diet of pharmaceuticals to ward off the resulting illness. This helps keep animals productive and alive long enough to reach market, benefiting agribusiness in the short term, but it is contributing to the development of more virulent forms of resistant pathogens that jeopardize the wellbeing of both human and nonhuman animals. As a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/32656/chapter-abstract/270598623?redirectedFrom=fulltext">study</a> published in 2018 warned: “The golden age of antibiotics (the 1950s through 1970s) marked the beginning of the arms race between humans and bacteria.

But with some simple substitutions you can still enjoy many favourite meals</p><p>A combination of high electricity prices and bad weather has led to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/23/uk-salad-shortages-vegetables-supermarket-government-policy">salad items being rationed</a> in supermarkets around Britain.

<p>As players spend more and more time and money in the digital hangout spaces provided by video games, it makes sense for fashion brands to join them there – opening up exciting worlds of rule-breaking design</p><p></p><p></p><p>In December 2015, the revered French fashion house Louis Vuitton made a surprise announcement about the advertising campaign for its forthcoming spring-summer collection. The new range of clothes and accessories would be modelled on screen and in the pages of glossy magazines not by a famous actor or popstar but by a video game character: the pink-haired warrior Lightning from Final Fantasy XIII. Nicolas Ghesquière, the brand’s creative director told the press he considered Lightning to be the “perfect avatar for a global heroic woman”. The fictional character even carried out interviews to promote the partnership.</p><p>It was not the first time a fashion brand had collaborated with a major video game. Previously, H&amp;M, Moschino and Diesel had made digital clothes for The Sims. Diesel had its own island in PlayStation 3’s ambitious metaverse forerunner, Home. But in the last two years we’ve seen an explosion: Balenciaga and Ralph Lauren in Fortnite, Balmain in Need for Speed, Tommy Hilfiger and Gucci in Roblox, Marc Jacobs and Valentino in Animal Crossing, Lacoste and Burberry in Minecraft. Most of the collaborations now involve both digital and physical collections: when Lacoste partnered with Minecraft, the company produced a full wardrobe of clothing and accessories; when Balmain partnered with Need for Speed Unbound last November, it produced a themed limited edition run of its B-IT slider shoes, while in-game racer Eleonore wears a dress from the house’s Autumn 2022 collection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/01/why-fashion-houses-are-getting-into-video-games">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sidney Poitier’s terrifically enjoyable directorial debut from 1972, in which he stars opposite Harry Belafonte, is rereleased in all its galloping glory</p><p>The rediscovery of black American cinema continues with the rerelease of Sidney Poitier’s directorial debut from 1972: a terrifically enjoyable western adventure bromance, packed with brio and breezy, unreflective energy and tilted to the lighter end of the tonal spectrum. This (along with cultural ghettoisation) has perhaps meant that it hasn’t previously been considered a serious classic. But the time may well come when Buck and the Preacher are spoken of in the same breath as Butch and Sundance.</p><p>Buck is Sidney Poitier: a frontiersman who after the civil war makes a living as a wagonmaster for black people from Louisana who want to head out west and farm the unclaimed territories, dreaming of the promised lands of Kansas and Colorado, with their great soil and climate. Buck’s job is to conduct the wagon train and parley with the Native American tribes to allow them peaceful passage. Buck’s tough, capable girlfriend Ruth is played by the formidable Ruby Dee. But the settlers are harassed by a sinister white posse led by Deshay, in tatty Confederate garb, played by exploitation veteran Cameron Mitchell. Deshay’s men are theoretically “labour recruiters” from Louisiana, here to persuade the pioneers to abandon their plans and return home to pick cotton. In fact, he is running a psychopathic hate campaign, intending merely to murder and rob the settlers, confident of never being caught and (perhaps) intending to publicise his victims’ unpunished fate as a deterrent to those black people back in Louisiana also thinking of leaving.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/01/buck-and-the-preacher-review-sidney-poitier-harry-belafonte-western-rerelease">Continue reading...</a>

## Transitional by Munroe Bergdorf review – trauma and resilience

<p>The model and trans activist writes movingly on prejudice, navigating controversy and personal growth</p><p>In August 2017, Munroe Bergdorf was riding high. Aged 29, she had been hired as L’Oréal’s first transgender model. A few days before, violent white supremacists had marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, and she posted, to a smallish audience on Facebook, her furious condemnation of white racism. After the L’Oréal campaign was announced, someone she went to university with sent a screenshot to the Daily Mail and what happened next made her notorious. “The conservative press was having a field day, labelling me a racist for daring to point out that racism exists and it benefits white people,” she writes. L’Oréal sacked her (though they rehired her in 2020), other brands dropped her and she received horrific abuse on social media. Her reaction was not to shrink away, but to accept the mountain of requests to speak on news and panel shows. “I took every single opportunity to tell my side of the story.”</p><p>In writing a memoir, Bergdorf is taking that opportunity again, and in much greater depth. On the page, she becomes a human being, rather than a headline. She writes about growing up middle class in a satellite commuter town, near to London but very much in the countryside. She was Black, of mixed heritage, in a town where the only other Black people she saw were two girls who had been adopted by white parents; she was an effeminate boy, repeatedly ostracised and bullied for being different, not only by her peers, but by her peers’ parents, too. The ghoulish section 28 still loomed over her education; teachers would not step in when she received homophobic abuse. Her depiction of the isolation she felt is precise. She could not tell her parents why she was being bullied because she felt unable to come out to them. When she did, it was painful, and she writes frankly about how long it took that relationship to heal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/01/transitional-by-munroe-bergdorf-review-trauma-and-resilience">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Informative documentary follows luxury brand’s painstaking effort to produce clothes that do no harm</p><p>Thoughtfully made, highly informative and accessible, director Becky Hutner’s documentary charts how luxury UK fashion company Mother of Pearl tackles the challenge they set themselves of developing a sub-label, No Frills, that makes only sustainable, ethically made clothing from Global Organic Textile Standard fabric. And lo and behold, the whole process is not as easy as sticking a leaf on the label and calling a product “green”.</p><p>In fact, it involves examining every step of long and winding supply chains. Mother of Pearl’s creative director Amy Powney, the daughter of old-school hippies, and her right-hand woman Chloe Marks are seen mulling over whether, for instance, if they are to use wool (a versatile, biodegradable fibre that’s nevertheless a by-product of the meat industry), where can they source wool that’s soft enough for skin-contact but doesn’t involve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulesing">mulesing</a> and other treatments that are cruel to animals? Synthetic fibres, on the other hand, wouldn’t directly harm furry friends, but most of them are highly polluting if made from petrochemicals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/01/fashion-reimagined-review-quest-for-ethical-chic-has-lots-of-interest-to-reveal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>People may sniff, but this was a superbly realised grand spectacle, which has done far more to literally save cinema than any of the other nominees</p><p>To many out there, arguing that Avatar: The Way of Water should win best picture is akin to defending Charles Manson in court. But someone has to do it. And my argument hinges on that word “best”. How do we measure what the “best” picture is? Best at what? Quality is subjective, and as we have seen time and time again, the subjective opinion of the sum total of academy voters when it comes to this category is very often terrible: Argo? Crash? Driving Miss Daisy? Shakespeare in Love? Please.</p><p>This is not to say we should just stick to <em>objective</em> measurements, otherwise it would just be the highest-grossing movie that wins every year and there’d be no point to awards season. Although by such measures, The Way of Water would win hands down: $2.2bn and counting. As usual, the doubters were lined up waiting for James Cameron’s latest giant leap to fail, and as usual, it didn’t. You can sucker a lot of people into seeing a movie in its first week (see the recent Ant-Man 3, or rather don’t – its US box office plummeted 69% in its second week), but you can’t fool half the world into going to see a three-hour movie, some of them multiple times. Critics enjoyed panning The Way of Water for its hokeyness, its length, its garishness, its heavy-handedness, etc, etc. But they clearly missed something that regular moviegoers connected with.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/01/why-avatar-the-way-of-water-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Everyday objects are the real key to our past. Now a change to the wonderfully named Treasure Act could fill our museums with them</p><p>In Britain’s back gardens and alleyways, amid ancient woodlands and on coastal bluffs, in sunken lanes and deep in the velvety brown earth of our fields, lies hidden treasure. Coins, pottery, bone; a remarkable array of fragments each telling us something about the past. These may not be made from gold or silver, but they are precious beyond belief.</p><p>Until now, the 1996 Treasure Act has protected many of these priceless pieces of our past – but not all<strong> </strong>of them. According to the act, only those artefacts that are more than 300 years old and made of precious metals or are part of a collection of valuable objects need to be disclosed and offered for sale to a museum. Under this current definition of treasure, it’s possible that untold numbers of fascinating finds slip back into the shadows as soon as they come to light.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/01/toothpicks-hair-locks-treasure-act-museums">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The FA Cup may not seem as special as it used to but for lower division clubs it is huge, both emotionally and financially</p><p>My earliest memory of the FA Cup is from the 1980 final when West Ham played Arsenal. The excitement of the day was largely because it was a rare live game on TV. Today we have ubiquitous live games beamed from every corner of the globe, so few things mark my age more starkly to my kids than the idea that one game a year was live on TV, apart perhaps from the concept of writing actual letters, which makes me sound like a character from a Brontë novel.</p><p>Those technicoloured Saturdays are so vividly remembered because the normal TV schedule was replaced by a full-day football extravaganza, roving reporters outside team hotels, a celebrity edition of a Question of Sport, the growled rendition of each team’s FA Cup song, all before the whistle to start the game had been blown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/01/grimsby-fa-cup-run-epic-trip-southampton">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dedicated to her late partner, these reflections on marriage, mortality and many-tentacled aliens show Atwood’s mastery of the short form</p><p>Most of the characters in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/margaret-atwood">Margaret Atwood</a>’s latest book are old, or heading that way, and their stories unwrap what TS Eliot called the gifts reserved for age. There are chips and fragments of lives, full of sass and sadness. The book is in three parts: a miscellaneous collection of stories is sandwiched between sections called Tig and Nell and Nell and Tig. The Nell and Tig stories tell the tale of a long and loving marriage, and what comes after. (The book is dedicated to Atwood’s partner, Graeme Gibson, who died in 2019.)</p><p>When we meet Nell and Tig they are on a first aid course: they need a certificate to give talks on a cruise ship. The guests on the cruise ship, they reflect, will be “older than Nell and Tig. Truly ancient. Such people can be expected to topple over at any minute, and then it will be certificates to the rescue.” Not that Nell and Tig expect to be of any use in such a crisis. The story – told, as we discover, in long retrospect – is really about their companionable, conspiratorial laughter at the foibles of their instructor; and their reflections on the danger that we live with and, when we’re young, ignore.</p><p>One day a rich person of high status, who was a Sir and a thing called a Duke, came riding by on a – came riding by, on a – If you have enough legs you don’t have to do this riding by, but Sir had only two legs, like the rest of you […] the Duke scooped her up onto his ... I’m sorry, we don’t have a word for that so the translation device is no help. Onto his snack. Why are you all laughing?

<p>A new documentary acts as a cautionary tale urging us to be more aware of how we store and preserve what we film and watch</p><p>There’s a widely taken-for-granted consensus that in film lies immortality; in Damien Chazelle’s recent drama Babylon, a Tinseltown gossip columnist waxes rhapsodic about how actors captured on celluloid effectively live forever in posterity, her general sentiment reiterated in higher-minded terms by reams of film theory scholarship. Advertising lingo rebranded cherished memories as “Kodak moments” in response to our species’ innate desire to freeze a fleeting unit of time as a physical quantity we can revisit over and over at our leisure. This line of thinking is understandable, seeing as anyone can click over to the internet and watch 100-year-old footage of working-class daily life. But Inés Toharia needs everyone to know that it’s also fundamentally mistaken.</p><p>“We’re going so fast as a society that we don’t always realize what we’re leaving behind,” she tells the Guardian from her home in Spain. “We should pause to think about saving our digital materials, because they don’t last forever. And a lot of video today isn’t even meant to last, things like security camera footage, a lot of what’s on YouTube. We’re producing more than ever, but we’re not taking care of it. A friend shows me a video of their kid taking their first steps, I think, ‘Oh, that’s not going to last.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/01/were-not-taking-care-of-it-why-film-preservation-should-be-prioritized">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Last week Elon Musk continued to drastically reduce the Twitter workforce, laying off another swath of loyal employees. Think other tech bosses won’t follow suit? Think again ...</p><p>‘Doing hard things requires sacrifice,” Esther Crawford <a href="https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1587819812301918209">tweeted</a> in November when a <a href="https://twitter.com/esthercrawford/status/1587709705488830464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">picture of her</a> sleeping on the floor at her office went viral. Elon Musk had just taken the helm at Twitter and told his new employees that they had to be prepared to either go “<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/02/twitter-layoffs-elon-musk-esther-crawford-sleeping-bags.html">extremely hardcore</a>” or go home. Crawford, the head of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/11/twitter-relaunches-blue-tick-service-with-higher-price-for-iphone-users">Twitter Blue</a> at the time, was clearly out to prove herself as hardcore as it comes.</p><p>Alas, she risked back pain for nothing. Over the weekend Twitter laid off around 200 people, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/27/tech/twitter-layoffs/index.html">about 10% of its current workforce</a>, including Crawford. Her firing made waves: if someone as devoted to Twitter as Crawford wasn’t safe, then who was? And it’s not as if Crawford and the others were sympathetically laid off; they were abruptly fired on a Saturday night. Martijn de Kuijper, a senior product manager who was also a victim of Musk’s latest cull, <a href="https://twitter.com/mdekuijper/status/1629731350612791296?s=20">tweeted</a> that he found out he’d been let go when he woke up on Sunday to discover he had been locked out of his email. “People receive email at 2am on Saturday and access cut immediately,” said one poster on Blind, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/26/more-layoffs-at-twitter-and-loyalist-esther-crawford-isnt-spared/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABs4e-CZ9Hsfoj_pKDfvphLEnqc2jcNXG946t4OYuUfaaJAVkYTORTWLXjtFBhRVOn1OR784VKtXeneWGMscg5XJnWtk4gUQN4g0Edh3BBXTdKjCPQyFitxIhi8C9FcMS0ZQEUa6-seChdId1V-5XT7xjDsPqyNTT8YJpLoFwYra">a platform for verified employees</a> to communicate anonymously. “This will go down as one of the most extreme layoffs in entire corporate history.” Live by the hardcore sword, die by the hardcore sword. And that sword, by the way, has felled a lot of people. Pre-Musk, Twitter had 7,500 employees; now it has less than 2,000.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/01/quiet-quitting-over-loud-firing-begun-elon-musk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As this cold British winter recedes, every day brings change, and with it a reminder of the beauty and resilience of the natural world</p><p>This weekend, I sowed the first of my seeds of the season. Five varieties of tomato and two different kinds of aubergine. I’m not one for sowing seeds early, but tomatoes and aubergines need every day of the growing season in this country to offer up the best possible harvest.

They more than made up for the year before when blight obliterated every plant before even one tomato had dared to ripen.

And what a sleeve: the dangling straitjacket-style arms of his white shirt render handshakes comically complicated.

An abbreviated tie, reaching only as far as his sternum, runs from burnt crimson at one end to canary yellow at the other, as though it has been dunked in magma. “My mum taught fashion,” he explains. “Somehow I’ve always been close to the idea of storytelling through clothes.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/01/queer-titanic-oscar-contender-director-lukas-dhont-close">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A North Sea trial aims to develop methods for growing and harvesting the seaweed as a means of carbon sequestration</p><p>Before the Met Office was set up, and long afterwards in seaside towns, sugar kelp (<em>Saccharina latissima</em>) was used to forecast the weather. Plucked from rock pools, it often hung on a hook by the seaside landlady’s door. If the seaweed was limp and damp because of moist air, it was sure to rain soon. If it was dry, then the day would be fine.</p><p>This species has also long been gathered for food and as a cosmetics ingredient in Asia and in the UK. More recently, seaweed has been suggested as a means of carbon sequestration comparable to rainforests. Last month, Amazon gave a huge boost to efforts to test that idea by giving a €1.5m (£1.3m) grant to set up a farm-scale trial in the North Sea. The idea is to develop methods for growing and harvesting seaweed on a large scale between the thousands of turbines being built in shallow water on the continental shelf that now cannot be commercially fished.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/01/specieswatch-sugar-kelp-north-sea-carbon-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Shoppers have been left staring at empty shelves and advised by their government to eat turnips over tomatoes. But the food shortage might be more serious than it sounds, reports Joanna Partridge</p><p>Signs have been appearing in Britain’s supermarkets in recent weeks apologising to customers for their lack of vegetables or warning them that they are being rationed. It’s been blamed on bad winter weather in Spain and Morrocco, which has hit supplies and led one government minister to encourage people to embrace seasonal British veg like turnips instead.</p><p>Guardian business reporter <strong>Joanna Partridge </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi </strong>that while bad weather may be partly to blame for the empty shelves, the issue is more complex – and serious – than meets the eye. The UK has become accustomed to a world of year-round produce available at the click of a button and all based on what now look like increasingly vulnerable supply chains put further at risk by Brexit and the energy crisis. With further shortages on the horizon there is no immediate sense that the government has a long-term vision for how Britons continue to feed themselves at scale in the UK.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/mar/01/what-the-salad-crisis-says-about-britain-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
