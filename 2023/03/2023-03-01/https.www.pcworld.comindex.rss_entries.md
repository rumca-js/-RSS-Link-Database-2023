<p>When you&rsquo;re typing in Google Docs, you may notice that the first letter of the first word of a sentence gets automatically capitalized. This feature, enabled by default, can be a nuisance if it&rsquo;s capitalizing words that you don&rsquo;t want to be capitalized. You can turn this feature off, but it doesn&rsquo;t sync between the desktop and mobile versions of Google Docs, so you&rsquo;ll need to manually disable the feature on both. Here&rsquo;s how to do it.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-turn-off-auto-capitalization-in-google-docs-for-desktop">How to turn off auto capitalization in Google Docs for desktop</h2>



<p>On your desktop PC, launch your browser of choice and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.google.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1525086-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">open Google Docs</a>. Next, open a document and then click <strong>Tools</strong> in the toolbar at the top of the screen.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Click Tools in menu bar" class="wp-image-1525089" height="638" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Click-Tools-in-the-menu-bar..jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<p>Click <strong>Preferences</strong> near the bottom of the drop-down menu that appears.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Click preferences." class="wp-image-1525099" height="638" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Click-Preferences..jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;ll now be in the General tab of the Preferences window. Uncheck the box next to <strong>Automatically capitalize words</strong>, found at the top of the menu, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Disable auto on desktop." class="wp-image-1525102" height="638" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Disable-auto-capitalize-on-desktop..jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<p>Google Docs will no longer automatically capitalize your text as you type. If you want to enable the feature again, head back to the Preferences menu, check the box next to Automatically capitalize words, and then click OK.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-turn-off-auto-capitalization-in-google-docs-for-mobile">How to turn off auto capitalization in Google Docs for mobile</h2>



<p>Even if you disable the auto-capitalization feature on desktop, the setting doesn&rsquo;t sync with the Google Docs app on mobile devices. In fact, there isn&rsquo;t even a setting that disables this feature. To prevent the program from automatically capitalizing text on your mobile device, you&rsquo;ll need to adjust your system settings.</p>



<p>The setting you&rsquo;re looking for is called Auto-Capitalization. The way to get to this setting is dependent on which OS you&rsquo;re using.</p>



<p>On Android, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Languages &amp; Input</strong> &gt; <strong>On-screen Keyboard</strong>. You&rsquo;ll now need to select the keyboard you use. In this case, it&rsquo;s likely <strong>Gboard</strong>. Finally, tap <strong>Text Correction</strong> and then toggle the slider next to <strong>Auto-capitalization </strong>to the off position.</p>



<p>On iPhone, go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Keyboard</strong>. On this screen, toggle the slider next to <strong>Auto-Capitalization</strong> to the off position.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Disable auto on mobile" class="wp-image-1525113" height="1199" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Disable-auto-capitalize-on-mobile.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=554" width="554" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<p>Text written on Google Docs will no longer be automatically capitalized, but keep in mind that this is also true for other applications on your mobile device that use that keyboard. You&rsquo;ll need to re-enable the auto-capitalization feature if you want to bring the feature back to another app.</p>

## 5 just-released Windows 11 features you need to try pronto

<p>Windows 11 may have switched to once-yearly major updates, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean new features can&rsquo;t show up more often. Case in point: This week, Microsoft suddenly and surprisingly dropped a massive update for Windows 11 that&rsquo;s absolutely brimming with fresh goodies to play with.</p>



<p>My colleague Mark Hachman covered <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1522426/windows-11-february-update-adds-bing-ai-chat-tabbed-notepad-iphone.html">everything new in the February 2023 Windows 11 update</a>. There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that simply isn&rsquo;t relevant to me, such as better AI tools on Qualcomm-powered PCs, tweaks to the native Teams chat experience, Facebook widgets, and so on. But there are several nifty new features with a broader appeal that I can&rsquo;t wait to try out&mdash;and you probably will too. Let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>



<h2 id="ai-powered-bing-chat-search-box">AI-powered Bing Chat search box</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Bing Chat in Windows 11" class="wp-image-1525522" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bing-in-Windows.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Microsoft certainly isn&rsquo;t wasting its time bringing the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html">new AI-powered Bing Chat</a> to the masses. The company revealed the ChatGPT-powered tool mere weeks ago, rolled it out to mobile Bing and Edge users in short order, and now it&rsquo;s coming right to the Windows 11 taskbar, integrated into the newly returned search box. You&rsquo;ll need to be enrolled in the Bing AI preview to use the chat, though. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html">how to get started with Bing Chat in Windows 11</a>.</p>



<p>Honestly, while asking Microsoft&rsquo;s AI to plan vacations and whip up meals from a list of ingredients is cool and all, I&rsquo;m most excited about the simple revival of the search box. I use it all the time in Windows 10, but Windows 11 dumped it in favor of a search <em>button</em> that summons a separate window where you conduct system searches, adding significantly more clicks and headaches to the process. Even if you don&rsquo;t care about Bing Chat, the return of the search box is a major win for everyday Windows 11 users.</p>



<h2 id="notepad-tabs">Notepad tabs</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 tabbed notepad" class="wp-image-1528326" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/windows-11-tabbed-notepad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Tab all the things! I&rsquo;m a massive fan of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407624/stardock-groupy-manage-windows.html">Stardock&rsquo;s $5 Groupy software</a> to turn every window into a tab, but it won&rsquo;t be needed for much longer if Microsoft keeps this up. At the end of 2023, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430331/use-the-new-tabbed-file-explorer-to-simplify-your-life.html">Windows 11 <em>finally </em>added File Explorer tabs</a> after years of begging by enthusiasts, and the February 2023 update brings tabs to the venerable Notepad app.</p>



<p>Oh, and in case you missed it, Notepad was also updated last year to support Windows 11&rsquo;s Dark Mode. <em>Chef&rsquo;s kiss</em>.</p>



<h2 id="iphone-support-in-phone-link">iPhone support in Phone Link</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Windows 11 Phone Link for iOS better shot" class="wp-image-1525348" height="789" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Phone-Link-for-iOS-better.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Android users have been able to control their phones via the Windows Phone Link app for years now, but Apple&rsquo;s tighter rules have prevented iPhone support. No longer. You&rsquo;ll need to be a Windows Insider to use it right now, but Windows 11&rsquo;s February Update finally adds the ability to manage iPhones from your PC.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to send and receive calls, texts, and more right on your desktop, but Apple&rsquo;s rules mean there are several catches involved in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525289/windows-11-phone-link-manage-iphone-texts-and-calls.html">Windows 11&rsquo;s new iPhone support</a>. Because of that, you may be better off <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1486715/how-to-get-apple-imessages-on-windows-11.html">using Intel&rsquo;s Unison app to get iMessage on Windows</a> instead. It ostensibly only supports Intel-based PCs though, so AMD Ryzen users (like myself) still have a lot to look forward to in Windows 11&rsquo;s new native iPhone capabilities.</p>



<h2 id="snipping-tool-screen-recording">Snipping Tool screen recording</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 February 2023 Update Snipping Tool screen recorder" class="wp-image-1523992" height="801" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-Snipping-tool-screen-recorder.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Windows has offered a rocking Snipping Tool for a <em>long</em> time now, but it could only be used to quickly grab screenshots. With the Windows 11 February 2023 Update, the Snipping Tool can now record videos as well. <em>Finally</em>!</p>



<p>All you have to do is click the new record button in Snipping Tool to start capturing a video, then click it again to stop.&nbsp;Boom! You now have a quick clip to share with friends, helpfully saved to a default folder. This could be insanely handy while troubleshooting or explaining a process to other people.</p>



<h2 id="energy-recommendations">Energy recommendations</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 February 2023 Update energy recommendations" class="wp-image-1523990" height="809" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-energy-efficiency.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Electric bills are skyrocketing, yo. Mine has almost doubled in the past year, and Europeans have it even worse. Enter the new energy recommendations in Windows 11, designed to help ease the burden on both the environment <em>and </em>your wallet.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll a list of settings suggestions in Settings<em> &gt; Power &amp; battery &gt; Energy recommendations</em>, where you can apply them piecemeal or whole-hog at the press of a single button. Even if you decide not to take every action Microsoft recommends&mdash;I <em>loathe </em>auto-adjusting brightness&mdash;every little bit helps.</p>



<h2 id="but-wait-theres-more">But wait, there&rsquo;s more!</h2>



<p>That&rsquo;s it for this look into five new Windows 11 features power users won&rsquo;t want to miss.

<p>AMD&rsquo;s next-generation AM5 Ryzen 7000 CPUs carry some breakneck speeds for your PC. While some of the initial rollout was slowed down by the higher platform costs, the introduction of the B650 chipset is bringing zippy performance to more affordable motherboards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One &ldquo;TUF&rdquo; option that looks to break the ice is the Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi. Slotted right below the company&rsquo;s popular ROG lineup, this series of motherboards is streamlined to give you good value-to-performance. It&rsquo;s targeted squarely at gamers, as the name implies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The motherboard packs some cool looks, and an even cooler $239 MSRP. Let&rsquo;s take a look at its specs, features, design, and performance. Does this motherboard provide the right stuff for the dollar&mdash;or are you better off looking elsewhere? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>



<h2 id="asus-tuf-gaming-b650-plus-wifi-specs-and-features">Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi: Specs and features</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi" class="wp-image-1515506" height="628" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2022-12-29-at-2.14.06-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<ul><li>ATX form factor&nbsp;</li><li>Support AMD AM5 Ryzen 7000 CPUs&nbsp;</li><li>12+2 Power Stages rated at 60A</li><li>DDR5 RAM, dual channel up to 4 DIMMs (up to 128GB)</li><li>3x onboard M.2 slots (1x PCIe Gen 5)</li><li>1x PCIe 16x slot (CPU)</li><li>1x PCIe16x slot (chipset)</li><li>2x PCIe 4.0 1x slots&nbsp;</li><li>DisplayPort and HDMI</li><li>8x USB ports on back&nbsp;</li><li>Realtek 2.5GbE LAN</li><li>Wi-Fi 6E&nbsp;</li><li>RGB headers for Aura Sync</li><li>4 SATA 6Gb/s ports&nbsp;</li><li>7 fan headers (CPU, AIO, chassis)&nbsp;</li><li>BIOS Flashback button</li><li>Preinstalled I/O shield&nbsp;</li><li>Realtek 7.1 audio codec</li><li>MSRP $239.99</li></ul>



<p>The Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi packs an MSRP of $239, bringing a more affordable motherboard to gamers looking at Ryzen 7000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s built on the foundation of the B650 chipset&mdash;which is a slimmed down version of X670E. You&rsquo;re also getting big price savings, as many features found on the X670E are overkill for most users (extra USB and SATA ports, more PCIe Gen 5 lanes, etc.). B650 gives you more than enough for most users, however.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi" class="wp-image-1515507" height="820" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2022-12-29-at-2.12.07-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Included accessories with the Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi motherboard.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;ll get the typical accessories such as Wi-Fi antenna, driver CD, and SATA cables within the box. We&rsquo;d love to see USB driver drives on every motherboard in the future instead!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s go over the features and why they matter for those who will use it day to day.</p>



<h3 id="cpu-choice">CPU choice&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Want to slap in the mighty Ryzen 9 7950X? You&rsquo;ll be able to do that here, as all new Ryzen 7000 CPUs are supported. The non-X variants work, and so will the upcoming &ldquo;X3D&rdquo; models, such as the Ryzen 7800X3D. For a gaming motherboard at this pricing tier, it&rsquo;s most sensible to pair it with CPUs such as the Ryzen 5 7600X or Ryzen 7 7700X for best &ldquo;bang for the buck.&rdquo; AM5 should also have longevity going for it, with other supported CPUs in the future.<br /></p>



<h3 id="ddr5-ram-and-pcie-gen-5">DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5</h3>



<p>You&rsquo;re getting DDR5 RAM here with great speeds compared to DDR4. Prices for DDR5 have been going down, so they&rsquo;re more and more accessible. AMD does not offer DDR4 on AM5 unlike what Intel has done with Z790 chipset, however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While you also get PCIe Gen 5, it&rsquo;s only on a single M.2 slot. Theoretically it&rsquo;s faster than PCIe Gen 4, but there isn&rsquo;t yet hardware right now to fully take advantage of this. Your PCIe slots will be Gen 4, which is more than capable of tackling even the latest GPUs such as the Nvidia RTX 4090.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>



<p>NVMe drives are all the rage&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll have three available slots on this motherboard. This is the perfect number for gamers wanting fast performance now and future expandability later. Content creators may find they require a couple more, but they&rsquo;ll also have access to the four SATA ports for their plain-ol&rsquo; hard drives, too. Power users likely will find this insufficient, so they&rsquo;ll need to up their budget.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Even with the cheaper price point, Asus includes some great features found on higher-end motherboards: Q-Latch for M.2 drives, Q-LED debug codes, and the integrated I/O shield.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h3 id="usb-ports">USB ports&nbsp;</h3>



<p>With eight rear USB ports, including USB-C, you&rsquo;ll have plenty for the average gaming build. At this price point, you&rsquo;re not getting USB4&rsquo;s speedy prowess, or any Thunderbolt 4. Creators needing those specs will have to shell out more cash for pricier options unfortunately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You do get USB4 support via the Thunderbolt 4 header on the motherboard itself, but not on the rear natively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One great feature of Ryzen 7000 CPUs is the built-in &ldquo;iGPU,&rdquo; allowing you to diagnose your system without a discreet GPU attached. You&rsquo;ll have both DisplayPort and HDMI out here, which can come in handy.</p>



<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>



<p>Connectivity options are good, with Realtek 2.5Gb ethernet. As expected, 10Gb LAN is only available on top motherboards, but you&rsquo;ll also get Wi-Fi 6E. The network suite here is typically exactly what most gamers will need to get connected in a speedy manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>



<p>Audio is Realtek&rsquo;s 7.1 surround sound, with plenty of audio jacks available on the back. This will be more than enough for most users&mdash;and those picky about audio can always use an external solution.</p>



<h3 id="other-interesting-features">Other interesting features</h3>



<p>Even with the cheaper price point, Asus includes some great features found on higher-end motherboards: Q-Latch for M.2 drives, Q-LED debug codes, and the integrated I/O shield. This makes for a much more trouble-free building experience! It&rsquo;d be great to see the PCIe Q-Release button for GPUs in the future, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With both BIOS Flashback and Q-LED, it&rsquo;s much easier to find and recover from problems&mdash;adding features that used to only be on higher-end boards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a focused feature set that is targeted at the important basics that gamers will utilize, without much unnecessary additions to up the price.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="asus-tuf-gaming-b650-plus-wifi-design">Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi: Design</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi" class="wp-image-1515508" height="1189" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2022-12-29-at-2.13.36-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi has a plain, but not unattractive design.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi is minimalist and simple. It has a very attention-grabbing aesthetic, without feeling cheap. It achieves this using simple, darker colors, accented only by the occasional yellow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This simplicity continues with the I/O and VRM areas, highly angular designs that almost look stealthy. It gives this motherboard <em>Call of Duty</em> vibes. DDR5 RAM slots are nicely visible with alternating black and grey.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi" class="wp-image-1515509" height="669" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2022-12-29-at-2.13.04-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Design elements are kept to a minimum with yellow highlights on the Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>As we take a gander at the bottom half of the motherboard, it&rsquo;s considerably sparser. While on some motherboards this could make it look unfinished or cheap, here it works nicely with the overall aesthetic.</p>



<p>Instead of leaving the M.2 slots uncovered, Asus has added some nicely designed thermal covers to them. This serves both aesthetics and function&mdash;it keeps those drives cool!</p>



<p>The rear and I/O shield area continue with similar straightforwardness. A TUF logo is mostly all that adorns the area, which has a key feature: integrated I/O shield! No more &ldquo;forgetting&rdquo; that one last piece while building&mdash;a truly welcomed design choice here.</p>



<p>Overall, you&rsquo;ll be happy with the build quality and choice of materials here. For the price, you&rsquo;re still getting a purpose driven motherboard that does not look cheap&mdash;but feels highly focused.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="asus-tuf-gaming-b650-plus-wifi-performance-software-and-bios">Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi: Performance, software, and BIOS</h2>



<p>The Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi presents itself as your &ldquo;mission&rdquo; companion.&nbsp; In the heat of a game, it will serve any of Ryzen 7000 CPUs well. While something like the content-creator focused Ryzen 9 7950X will do fine, it&rsquo;s really priced for the gamer-friendly mid-level Ryzen CPUs such as the Ryzen 5 7600X.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 12+2 power stages can handle gaming workloads like a seasoned pro&mdash;and even some overclocking. Similarly, DDR5 support gives you some of the fastest speeds on the market currently&mdash;reducing any potential bottlenecks in your performance pipeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While you don&rsquo;t have an abundance of PCIe Gen 5 lanes here&mdash;only a single one for the M.2&mdash;Gen 4 is more than sufficient for performance across the board. This means your GPU will still hit its max potential, and the only performance you&rsquo;re theoretically missing is when PCIe Gen 5 M.2 drives finally land. (And some limitations you may have by having &ldquo;less&rdquo; PCIe lane bandwidth compared to X670E.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are there motherboards that will allow you to clock your CPU or RAM a few insignificant points higher? Sure, but you&rsquo;ll also have to pay much more&mdash;cementing the B650-Plus Gaming WiFi as a great value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The BIOS is where you&rsquo;d do this mad scientist work and it&rsquo;s built Asus &ldquo;TUF.&rdquo; It has plenty of robust adjustment options for tinkerers. Easily change parameters for RAM, CPU, hard drives, and plenty of other options. For those seeking a more streamlined approach, you can simply pop on the &ldquo;Expo&rdquo; profile for your DDR5 RAM and call it a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It can also do various automatic and &ldquo;Ai&rdquo; overclocking if you&rsquo;d want it to, even reflecting off your cooling solution capability. AMD&rsquo;s PBO, or Performance Boost Overdrive, auto overclocking is also here to give you an extra boost (remember, it may also up power draw and heat).</p>



<p>If you prefer to leave the BIOS alone after setting your Expo DDR5 profile, Asus &ldquo;Armoury Crate&rdquo; software has in-Windows tunability. This expansive motherboard software suite can do it all. Update your drivers automatically? Check. Set fan profiles with Fan Xpert? Check. Configure your RGB Aura Sync settings? Double check.</p>



<p>Overall, the TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi packs most of the essential performance&mdash;all for a &ldquo;TUF&rdquo; price (as in: cheaper!).</p>

<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-asus-tuf-gaming-b650-plus-wifi">Should you buy the Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi?</h2>



<p>The Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WiFi&rsquo;s  $239 MSRP finally brings down the average motherboard price in this generation. It does so by providing just the right features a gamer needs, sensibly and with stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the serious, almost military design means you&rsquo;re not getting huge OLED screens or massive PCB heatsinks, it also means a cheaper cost. It does this stealthily without appearing to cut corners&mdash;by presenting a no-frills design language that works.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the gamer who doesn&rsquo;t want to break the bank, but still wants features and charm, this board is a good value. Enthusiast users who need the larger feature set such as USB4 or more NVMe slots will need to look at higher-priced options. </p>

<p>Pasting plain text in Windows isn&rsquo;t as easy as in browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Hitting <em>Ctrl + Shift + V</em> to dump out a clean copy of your clipboard isn&rsquo;t universally supported, so you&rsquo;ll often wind up with HTML links and formatting gunking up your pasted text, which you need to manually remove. But that&rsquo;ll eventually change if you&rsquo;ve got <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563788/seven-ways-in-which-microsofts-powertoys-improves-my-life.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s awesome PowerToys tool</a> installed: As reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.neowin.net/news/windows-10-and-11-will-soon-finally-let-you-paste-as-plain-text-thanks-to-powertoys/&amp;xcust=2-3-1527942-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Neowin</a> last week, a new feature called &ldquo;PastePlain&rdquo; has shown up on Github as part of the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on PowerToy&rsquo;s existing Text Extractor utility, it should work just as described. Any formatting&mdash;bold, font size, highlights, etc.&mdash;will get stripped when you paste text using a keyboard shortcut. The default will be <em>Ctrl + Win + V</em>, but you&rsquo;ll be able to customize the shortcut, too. A specific release date hasn&rsquo;t yet been specified yet.</p>



<p>As we all wait, you can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563788/seven-ways-in-which-microsofts-powertoys-improves-my-life.html">play with other PowerToys</a> if you aren&rsquo;t already familiar with the tool.

<p>Let&rsquo;s be real: Even cheap gaming laptops aren&rsquo;t all that cheap. There&rsquo;s a reason that our guide to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630093/best-gaming-laptops-under-1000.html">best gaming laptops under $1,000</a> has <em>far</em> fewer options than our other laptop roundups&mdash;even rock-bottom options usually go for $900 or so, with rare discounts to the $800 range or so. But today we&rsquo;ve found an absolute doozy: Dell is clearing out the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8200811-12839518?url=https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/g6dv&amp;sid=2-3-1528128-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">RTX 3050-powered G15 gaming laptop</a> for just $650 after a huge $200 discount.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll need to be judicial with your graphics settings&mdash;aim for Medium to High presets in most games, and don&rsquo;t even think about ray tracing&mdash;but the G16 should handle everything you throw at it, especially in games that support Nvidia&rsquo;s performance-boosting DLSS technology. In addition to the aforementioned GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, the Dell G15 comes with a 12-core Intel Core i5-12500H processor, a 15.6-inch 120Hz 1080p screen, 8GB of memory, and a 256GB SSD. You may want to consider <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">picking up an external SSD</a> to boost your overall storage capacity, but even with that factored in this is still significantly cheaper than the vast majority of gaming laptops.</p>



<p>This is a clearance sale, so there&rsquo;s no telling how long the deal will last. Don&rsquo;t miss out. You don&rsquo;t see RTX-powered gaming laptops going for <em>this</em> cheap very often.</p>

<p>Every product reflects the era it&rsquo;s born into, and Windows 8 was no exception. Launched a year and a half after Apple&rsquo;s iPad, the successor to Windows 7 was designed to combat the so-called end of the PC.</p>



<p>Part of the fight involved getting Windows 8 on tablets, not just larger laptop-like slates such as the Microsoft Surface. For a handful of years, lightweight eight-inch Windows tablets were a thing. Maybe not ubiquitous, but common enough, and with more powerful hardware than much of their competition (and a higher price tag to match). The initiative stretched into the first part of the Windows 10 era&mdash;then abruptly burned out.</p>



<p>It was these ashes I found myself poking through during the first months of 2020. Most people hadn&rsquo;t wanted an eight-inch Windows tablet (thus their death), but I sure did. It was the perfect companion for minimalist travel. Watching Netflix shows or listening to Spotify offline? Check. Reading any and all books? Double check. Editing documents via a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse? Triple check.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="apple_ipad_2021_review_5.jpg" class="wp-image-1492709" src="https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/features/3818402/apple_ipad_2021_review_5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /><figcaption>Mobile tablets and phones lack one key feature that&rsquo;d let me rely solely on them when traveling.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Tech Advisor</p></div>



<p>But the killer feature (and the reason why an Android tablet or an iPad wouldn&rsquo;t suit): Browser tabs recognized as actual desktop tabs? CHECK. I&rsquo;d experienced one too many trips where I&rsquo;d left my laptop at home, assuming that I would actually unplug for a change, only to waste chunks of time trying to resolve an issue that a mobile app didn&rsquo;t cover&mdash;and a mobile browser covered poorly in desktop mode. Conversely, I&rsquo;d also experienced many trips of lugging around my laptop and only using it once.</p>



<p>So I bought a used Dell Venue 8 Pro 5855 from an eBay seller. With 64GB storage and 4GB memory, it would hold up during the light use I had planned. And by my calculations, the tablet plus a folding Bluetooth keyboard and a freebie stylus added just a pound to my bag&mdash;and took far less space.</p>



<p>I was stoked for my coming travel plans. But you know where the story goes next: The pandemic steamrolled right over all of us.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Surface Go 3" class="wp-image-1523311" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/surfacego3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>I would be <em>so pumped</em> if there were an eight-inch version of the Surface Go. Pleaaaassee, Microsoft.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Now it&rsquo;s 2023. My Venue 8 Pro&rsquo;s Cherry Trail chip is long in the tooth. But there&rsquo;s nothing to replace it. The smallest screens for Windows slates start at 10 inches. The same applies to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html">Chromebooks</a>, which would work as a fine alternative for my purposes. I even bought a Chromebook tablet out of curiosity&mdash;a Lenovo 10e that dropped to $90 during Black Friday 2021. But at two pounds with its folio, I&rsquo;d just pack my Windows laptop of equivalent weight, given the latter&rsquo;s built-in keyboard. It&rsquo;s also not currently possible to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393375/how-to-turn-a-laptop-into-a-chromebook.html">flash ChromeOS Flex</a> on Android tablets.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m stuck. And eventually, I&rsquo;ll have to move the Venue 8 Pro off of Windows, either to ChromeOS Flex without official support or to Linux. (The touchscreen support will likely be wonky, though.) It&rsquo;s a sad thought that I won&rsquo;t be able to instead find a replacement with more modern hardware. But outside of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowscentral.com/what-ever-happened-all-small-windows-10-tablets&amp;xcust=2-1-1523287-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Zac Bowden over at Windows Central</a>, I&rsquo;m the only person I know still pining for a modern 8-inch tablet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Actually, no. I&rsquo;m pretty sure Zac&rsquo;s since moved on. I am #foreveralone.</p>

## Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 vs. AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX: Which should you buy?

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>With the release of AMD&rsquo;s RDNA 3 RX 7900 XTX, Nvidia has some serious competition!</p>



<p>The GPU landscape has been a tough one to navigate the last few years, with perpetual &ldquo;out of stock&rdquo; issues and increasingly high prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking to put the last generation behind them, Nvidia launched first, with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">RTX 4090</a>. Almost universally praised for its performance, its high starting price still left many gamers out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The $1,199 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">RTX 4080</a> came next, and hit some sour notes with its pricing. AMD finally responded with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">$899 RX 7900 XT and $999 RX 7900 XTX</a>, the latter of which is geared to go head-to-head with the RTX 4080.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll discuss pricing, availability, performance, and important things to be aware of. Which of these two graphical powerhouses deserve your attention? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4080 vs 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1522465" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2022-12-13-at-3.58.20-PM.png?w=926" width="926" /><figcaption><p>The Nvidia RTX 4080 is much larger than the latest Radeon models.</p>

<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4080-vs-amd-7900-xtx-price-and-availability">Nvidia RTX 4080 vs. AMD 7900 XTX: Price and availability&nbsp;</h2>



<p>$1,199 is what it takes to get the cheapest RTX 4080, a price our very own Brad Chacos was not very fond of in his <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">review</a>&mdash;and he&rsquo;s right!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The market has spoken, and the availability of the RTX 4080 is the highest we&rsquo;ve seen of any recently released GPU. RTX 4090? Sold out quickly and remains elusive. The RTX 4080 has been more consistently available, but it can often be sold-out, too, depending on the retailer that you&rsquo;re visiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s where AMD hopes to steal some of Nvidia&rsquo;s thunder, with the $999 7900 XTX. A savings of $200 is nothing to scoff at, especially if performance is also close. The one problem is availability, however. The 7900 XTX has been much more difficult to find than the RTX 4080, since it&rsquo;s likely more appealing at its price point and perhaps less were shipped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The $899 7900 XT is more readily found, however &ndash; but $100 more for the XTX is a no-brainer with the increased performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who wins this round? So far, the nod goes to the 7900 XTX &ndash; while the RTX 4080 is not a good buy at $1199, it&rsquo;s easier to find &ndash; even if it is sometimes slightly more than that MSRP for some AIB models. The $999 7900 XTX is a much better value but remains difficult to find within the first few weeks of its release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the situation changes and both are available at their MSRP prices, however, the clear winner will be the 7900 XTX if you can snag one.</p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4080-vs-amd-7900-xtx-performance">Nvidia RTX 4080 vs. AMD 7900 XTX: Performance&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4080 vs 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1522466" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3K8A1213.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Please ignore the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">RTX 4090&rsquo;s</a> lead in (almost) every graph where it isn&rsquo;t CPU bottlenecked. The RTX 4080 and 7900 XTX have quite the battle going on underneath. Looking at a popular title such as <em>Call of Duty: MW2</em>, the 7900 XTX gets a whopping 121fps at 4K, demolishing the RTX 4080&rsquo;s 98fps. It even beats that RTX 4090 we told you to ignore earlier! The story continues regardless of resolution, and it&rsquo;s clear this game has an obvious liking for the AMD GPUs.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that AMD gives us 24GB of GDDR6 VRAM versus 16GB of GDDR6X (faster) VRAM in the RTX 4080.&nbsp; Not a huge deal currently, but eventually it may start to matter more as resolutions increase.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4080 vs 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1522467" height="911" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/codmw2.jpg.webp" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>With ray tracing off, in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the 7900 XTX once again does well: 70.4fps versus the RTX 4080&rsquo;s 59.7fps. Even the RTX 4090 isn&rsquo;t completely safe here, either. AMD seems to often do better at 1440p, and Nvidia at 4K&mdash;but It can go back and forth. It&rsquo;s clear that the 7900 XTX has the chops to both meet, and beat, the RTX 4080 when it comes to rasterized gaming prowess.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4080 vs 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1522468" height="923" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cyberpunk.jpg.webp" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>With a term that AMD probably doesn&rsquo;t like to hear at the dinner table&mdash;<em>ray tracing</em>&mdash;how do these GPUs stack up? Here is where the table turns, and Nvidia pulls ahead confidently.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4080 vs 7900 XTX" class="wp-image-1522469" height="930" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rt-cyberpunk.jpg.webp" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>Once again looking at <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&mdash;but now with ray tracing on&mdash;the RTX 4080 now gets 29.1fps at 4K, and the 7900 XTX an unplayable 20.7fps. Even the RTX 4090 can barely push beyond 42fps. Only when turning on DLSS or FSR do we see playable frame rates from both GPUs&mdash;and the performance between both tightens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When DLSS 3 and frame generation enter the chat, the Nvidia RTX 4080 pulls ahead further in games that support this. For example, in testing <em>Flight Simulator 2020 </em>at Ultrawide 5120x1440p, the RTX 4080 jumped from 69fps to 151fps with DLSS 3. By comparison, the 7900 XTX only had minimal gains and stayed under 100fps even with FSR balanced, showing the benefit of Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS 3. We&rsquo;ll need FSR 3 before making a better comparison.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who wins the performance round? It must go to the AMD 7900 XTX, which on average was able to best the RTX 4080 across a wide variety of games, even at 4K. The RTX 4080 is still ahead in ray-tracing performance, especially with its superior DLSS 3&mdash;so if your games make heavy use of ray tracing or take advantage of DLSS 3, the winner here may be the RTX 4080 for you. Overall, especially at $999, the 7900 XTX puts up a winning effort.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4080-vs-amd-7900-xtx-power-and-other-things-to-know">Nvidia RTX 4080 vs. AMD 7900 XTX: Power and other things to know</h2>



<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4080 has a TDP of 320W, which overall lands it as the more efficient GPU versus the 7900 XTX at 355W. This has some clear benefits&mdash;such as in quieter performance and lower thermals. Those huge RTX 4080 coolers have it easy compared to the RTX 4090!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The RTX 4080 does have the 12VHPWR adapter, and no, we are not aware of any issues such as were experienced on a small number of RTX 4090s. AMD&rsquo;s 7900 XTX still has either dual 8-pin or triple 8-pin standard power, which can be a plus if you want to avoid the adapter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, the RTX 4080 should be larger in terms of its cooler than most 7900 XTX cards, especially when comparing AMD Reference vs. Nvidia Founders edition. The PowerColor 7900 XTX Red Devil pictured is thicker than the RTX 4080 here, so keep in mind some models can be just as large!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s drivers are typically very stable and bugs get squashed quickly&mdash;while AMD&rsquo;s new RDNA 3 may have a few more growing pains. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">Brad Chacos</a> points out he encountered a number of (minimal) bugs, which seemed slightly higher than normal. It&rsquo;s a new GPU architecture, so it&rsquo;s expected&mdash;but AMD must remember that Nvidia is praised by gamers for its drivers, so it better act quickly!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="nvidia-rtx-4080-vs-amd-7900-xtx-the-verdict">Nvidia RTX 4080 vs. AMD 7900 XTX: The Verdict</h2>



<p>Who takes home the cake? The AMD 7900 XTX. First, the pricing is a huge plus&mdash;$999 makes it at least a much better value than the RTX 4080&rsquo;s $1,199. To sweeten the deal, the 7900 XTX is faster on average too&mdash;in everything but ray tracing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMD also has some competing technologies such as FSR that look to bring even more performance parity with Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS, alongside various perks found in AMD&rsquo;s software. Nvidia still maintains the lead on the software side and with ray tracing, however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current GPU market isn&rsquo;t great right now, and availability is still an issue. Not to mention that it&rsquo;s hard to classify a $999 GPU as a &ldquo;good value,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s where we are currently. At least comparatively, it feels like a much better purchase than the RTX 4080 at this point. Don&rsquo;t be seduced by the $899 7900 XT, either&mdash;that $100 more for the XTX gives you significantly better performance. That&rsquo;s our winner: AMD 7900 XTX!</p>
