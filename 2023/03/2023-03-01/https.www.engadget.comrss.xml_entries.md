<p>Tesla's production capacities are in store for a significant growth spurt, CEO Elon Musk told the crowd assembled at the company's Austin, Texas Gigafactory for Investor Day 2023 — and AI will apparently be the magic bullet that gets them there. It's all part of what Musk is calling Master Plan part 3.</p><p>This is indeed Musk's third such Master Plan, the first two coming in 2006 and 2016, respectively. These have served as a roadmap for the company's growth and development over the past 17 years as Tesla has grown from neophyte startup to the world's leading EV automaker. &quot;There is a clear path to a sustainable energy Earth and it does not require destroying natural habitats,&quot; Musk said during the keynote address.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;You could support a civilization much bigger than Earth [currently does]. Much more than the 8 billion humans could actually be supported sustainably on Earth and I'm just often shocked and surprised by how few people realize this,&quot; he continued.</p><div id="3d1b24fc7dc14ba7b012b084cb615c48"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Main Tesla subjects will be scaling to extreme size, which is needed to shift humanity away from fossil fuels, and AI.<br /><br />But I will also Include sections about SpaceX, Tesla and The Boring Company.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1505791520024186882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>The Master Plan aims to establish a sustainable energy economy by developing 240 terraWatt hours (TWH) of energy storage and 30 TWH of renewable power generation, which would require an estimated $10 trillion investment, roughly 10 percent of the global GDP. Musk notes, however, that figure is less than half of what we spend currently on internal combustion economy. In all, he anticipates we'd need less than 0.2 percent of the world's land area to create the necessary solar and wind generation capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;All cars will go to fully electric and autonomous,&quot; Musk declared, arguing once again that ICE vehicles will soon be viewed in the same disdain as the horse and buggy. He also teased potential plans to electrify aircraft and ships. &quot;As we improve the energy density of batteries, you’ll see all transportation go fully electric, with the exception of rockets,” he said.</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-lays-out-his-vision-for-teslas-future-at-the-companys-investor-day-2023-215737642.html?src=rss

## The USPS is buying 9,250 Ford electric vans

<p>The United States Postal Service isn't pinning all its electrification hopes on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/usps-next-generation-delivery-vehicle-230128191.html">next-gen mail delivery vehicles</a>. The service has <a href="https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2023/0228-usps-moves-forward-with-awards-to-modernize-and-electrify-nations-largest-federal-fleet.htm">signed</a> a contract to buy 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vans, with the first units arriving in December. The handover should be complete by the end of 2024, Ford <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/03/01/usps-selects-ford-to-electrify-nations-largest-federal-fleet--pu.html">adds</a>. The USPS is also placing its early orders for over 14,000 charging stations for its facilities across the country.</p><p>The USPS already plans to buy at least 60,000 of its Next Generation Delivery Vehicles (NGDV) by 2028, with 75 percent of them being electric. The Ford vans are part of an additional plan to buy 21,000 &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; EVs. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy says this helps the USPS quickly act on a strategy that improves mail service and working conditions while keeping costs down for the self-sufficient agency. The total vehicle investment is expected to cost $9.6 billion, including $3 billion in funding thanks to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-joe-biden-signs-inflation-reduction-act-200724230.html">Inflation Reduction Act</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The charging network may not grow as quickly. The USPS expects to provide chargers to at least 75 locations within the next year, but doesn't estimate how it will expand in following years.</p><p>The overall EV push represents a sharp break from the initial plans. The USPS originally expected that most of its NGDV orders would be for gas-based trucks. The Biden administration <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epa-urges-usps-halt-to-gas-delivery-truck-purchase-153248945.html">fought that approach</a>, claiming that the USPS under DeJoy ignored Environmental Protection Agency advice, rejected public hearings and relied on &quot;biased&quot; estimates. The service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/usps-electric-next-gen-mail-truck-gas-194803588.html">challenged the administration</a> before relenting and shifting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-usps-is-doubling-its-order-of-next-gen-electric-mail-trucks-173029231.html">most of its purchases</a> to electric models.</p><p>The transition will play an important part in the government's plan to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-cut-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-half-124537297.html">cut greenhouse gas emissions</a> for itself and the country at large. The USPS represents the largest federal vehicle fleet — its EV purchases will have a significant impact relative to other agencies.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-usps-is-buying-9250-ford-electric-vans-213034903.html?src=rss

<p>OpenAI, the company behind <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0931b986-736e-47bb-80b9-5f6f8f4ef5ae&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Google&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwOTMxYjk4Ni03MzZlLTQ3YmItODBiOS01ZjZmOGY0ZWY1YWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zZWFyY2g_Y2xpZW50PXNhZmFyaSZybHM9ZW4mcT1zaXRlJTNBZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tK2NoYXRncHQmaWU9VVRGLTgmb2U9VVRGLTgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA0NDQ2MGE2LWE5OGQtNGNiNC1hMWU3LTdmM2QwNDg2Y2IxYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWTmHHdMxcHVmLwP1fkbOovtpCP2XmqSGnhlnppU77kM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fclient%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den%26q%3Dsite%253Aengadget.com%2Bchatgpt%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/open-a-is-dall-e-2-produces-fantastical-images-of-most-anything-you-can-imagine-170056814.html">DALL-E 2</a>, announced several <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis">significant changes</a> today. First, it’s launching developer APIs for ChatGPT and the Whisper speech-transcription model. It also changed its terms of service to let developers opt out of using their data for improvements while adding a 30-day data retention policy.</p><p>The new ChatGPT API will use the same AI model (“gpt-3.5-turbo”) as the popular chatbot, allowing developers to add either unchanged or flavored versions of ChatGPT to their apps. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-adds-openai-powered-chatbot-and-proactively-apologizes-for-what-it-might-say-180507261.html">Snap’s My AI</a> is an early example, along with a new virtual tutor feature for the online study tool Quizlet and an upcoming Ask Instacart tool in the popular local-shopping app. However, the API won’t be limited to brand-specific bots mimicking ChatGPT; it can also power “non-chat” software experiences that could benefit from AI brains.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ChatGPT API is priced at $0.002 per 1,000 tokens (about 750 words). Additionally, it’s offering a dedicated-capacity option for deep-pocketed developers who expect to use more tokens than the standard API allows. The new developer options join the consumer-facing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-chatgpt-plus-subscription-205027758.html">ChatGPT Plus</a>, a $20-per-month service launched in February.</p><p>Meanwhile, OpenAI’s Whisper API is a hosted version of the open-source Whisper speech-to-text model it launched in September. “We released a model, but that actually was not enough to cause the whole developer ecosystem to build around it,” OpenAI president and co-founder Greg Brockman <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/01/openai-debuts-whisper-api-for-text-to-speech-transcription-and-translation/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">told</a><em>TechCrunch</em> on Tuesday. “The Whisper API is the same large model that you can get open source, but we’ve optimized to the extreme. It’s much, much faster and extremely convenient.” The transcription API will cost developers $0.006 per minute, enabling “robust” transcription in multiple languages and providing translation to English.</p><p>Finally, OpenAI revealed changes to its developer terms based on customer feedback about privacy and security concerns. Unless a developer opts in, the company will no longer use data submitted through the API for “service improvements” to train its AI models. Additionally, it’s adding a 30-day data retention policy while providing stricter retention options “depending on user needs” (likely meaning high-usage companies with budgets to match). Finally, it’s simplifying its terms surrounding data ownership, clarifying that users own the models’ input and output.</p><p>The company will also replace its pre-launch review process for developers with a mostly automated system. OpenAI justified the change by pointing out that “the overwhelming majority of apps were approved during the vetting process,” claiming its monitoring has “significantly improved.” “One of our biggest focuses has been figuring out, how do we become super friendly to developers?” Brockman <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/01/addressing-criticism-openai-will-no-longer-use-customer-data-to-train-its-models-by-default/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">said</a> to TechCrunch. “Our mission is to really build a platform that others are able to build businesses on top of.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/openai-will-let-developers-build-chatgpt-into-their-apps-204737530.html?src=rss

## Netflix's Pornhub documentary trailer touches on sex trafficking allegations

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> has released a trailer for <em>Money Shot, </em>a documentary about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/pornhub/">Pornhub</a> (arguably one of its biggest competitors for people's attention). The film features interviews with performers, activists and former employees. It promises to delve into many of the scandals and successes the porn colossus has experienced over the almost 16 years it has been around.</p><p>The trailer suggests the film will explore issues such as alleged sexual exploitation and accusations that Pornhub has hosted non-consensual pornography. Pornhub owner MindGeek has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/judge-refuses-to-dismiss-visa-from-pornhub-case-on-child-porn-192801478.html">faced a lawsuit</a> over its alleged monetization of child porn. In 2020, the site <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pornhub-removes-unverified-videos-144330291.html">removed all uploads</a> from unverified users.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The documentary seems to go beyond Pornhub to examine other facets of the sex industry. The trailer, for instance, touches on the fact many sex workers and porn performers have lost their accounts on social media platforms. Meanwhile, one interviewee suggests that critics aren't just attacking porn, but the very idea of self-expression.&nbsp;</p><p>The clip suggests that <em>Money Shot</em> takes a far-reaching look at Pornhub and the broader industry. You'll be able to find out for yourself just how tactful and measured the documentary's approach is when it hits Netflix on March 15th.</p><div id="34b520fbff9941dc8519a8f64b8a8c98"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netflixs-pornhub-documentary-trailer-touches-on-sex-trafficking-allegations-203441864.html?src=rss

## Rivian recalls more than 12,700 EVs over airbag deployment flaw

<p>Rivian's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivians-electric-r1s-suv-will-get-an-extended-range-max-battery-this-fall-175420107.html">new battery option</a> is coming alongside some less-than-pleasant news. The EV brand is <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V109-5283.PDF">recalling</a> 12,716 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-review-150019762.html">R1T pickups</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1s-suv-ev-review-video-160029394.html">R1S SUVs</a> from the 2022 model year over an airbag deployment problem. A supplier's flawed seatbelt sensors can prevent the front passenger airbag from deploying properly. The car won't necessarily notify occupants, ether.</p><p>The firm tells Engadget safety is its &quot;top priority,&quot; and that the free repair shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. In its report with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Rivian says it isn't aware of any injuries stemming from the issue. The company estimates that one percent of vehicles covered in the recall may be affected, and that it stopped building R1T and R1S models with the &quot;suspect&quot; sensor on September 15th of last year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The recall is tiny compared to those at rivals like Tesla, which (among other issues) had to update more than 1 million cars due to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-to-recall-more-than-a-million-vehicles-over-pinchy-windows-185041420.html">pinching windows</a>. However, Rivian only produced 24,337 cars in all of 2022. Roughly half of its yearly output is subject to this notice, in other words. As <em>Electrek</em><a href="https://electrek.co/2023/03/01/rivian-to-recall-over-12700-evs-due-to-airbag-deployment-issue/">observes</a>, this also comes months after a 13,000-unit recall over a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-recall-13000-ev-steering-control-problem-095548602.html">potential steering control fault</a>, and nearly a year after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-recall-airbag-sensor-173041813.html">another airbag sensor glitch</a> prompted a 502-car recall.</p><p>This isn't likely to significantly hurt Rivian's finances. However, the timing isn't ideal. Rivian just announced its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-layoffs-184047174.html">second round of layoffs</a>, and has already taken other steps to shave costs as it deals with a tough economy. The fledgling automaker still needs to ramp up demand as it seeks profitability, and recalls like this don't help its cause.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/rivian-recalls-more-than-12700-evs-over-airbag-deployment-flaw-201518265.html?src=rss

## US intelligence report says Havana Syndrome probably wasn't caused by 'energy weapons'

<p>Energy weapons are real. Military and weapons researchers have developed microwave guns and lasers that can be used to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-09-china-poly-wb-1-microwave-gun.html">disable soldiers </a>or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-23-us-air-force-anti-drone-laser-raytheon.html">shoot down drones</a> — but a new report from the CIA and other intelligence agencies say that these kinds of weapons <em>probably</em> aren't responsible for the condition known as Havana Syndrome.</p><p>When US personnel overseas began suffering from unexplained headaches, nausea and hearing problems in 2016, many were quick to suspect foul play by a foreign adversary. A panel of experts concluded that the anomalous health incidents that came to be known as Havana Syndrome could plausibly have been caused by &quot;pulsed electromagnetic energy,&quot; prompting some of those afflicted with the condition to blame their symptoms on a mysterious new energy weapon, possibly wielded by Russian operatives. Now, seven intelligence agencies say that panel got it wrong.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/01/havana-syndrome-intelligence-report-weapon/">The <em>Washington Post</em> reports</a> that even after reviewing about 1,000 cases across the world, the CIA and half a dozen agencies concluded that it was unlikely that the symptoms were caused by a foreign adversary. Not by energy weapons, not from electronic surveillance, and not from unintentional exposure to radio waves or ultrasonic beams. Analysts simply couldn't find any common pattern that linked the anomalous health incidents together that could suggest an intentional attack, noting that in some cases there wasn't even a direct line of sight from which an energy weapon could have been used.</p><p>So, what does cause Havana Syndrome? Officials say that the majority of the cases they reviewed could be linked to pre-existing medical conditions. Environmental factors, like poor building ventilation, could also contribute to some of the symptoms — but the report simply couldn't find a link to an intentional, external factor.</p><p>The report seems pretty confident that Russia isn't using an experimental energy weapon to cause nausea, hearing loss and headaches, but officials say that new information could change that assessment: If intelligence reports reveal that a foreign government has developed technology capable of causing these symptoms, they'll take another look and reassess.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/us-intelligence-report-says-havana-syndrome-probably-wasnt-caused-by-energy-weapons-194301622.html?src=rss

Otherwise, it has familiar features like searching for and following users and viewing their posts on a Home timeline.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bluesky <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-twitter-open-social-media-standard.html">began in 2019</a> as a Twitter-funded side project. Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter and was still CEO when the initiative started, saw it as a more open alternative to an increasingly centralized Twitter. Then, Bluesky spun off as its own company in 2021. Dorsey has said he believes social media should be free of corporate or government control and that only authors should have the power to remove their social-media content. Additionally, although he said Twitter’s decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-banned-from-twitter-232502274.html">ban Donald Trump</a> after his role in inciting the January 6th insurrection was “the right decision,” he also worried about its precedent in endangering a “free and open global internet.”</p><p>Whether Twitter users will flee to Bluesky (or other platforms) in large enough numbers to make a significant difference is an open question. However, considering many people seeking an alternative are doing so because of current CEO / owner Elon Musk’s headline-grabbing embrace of far-right figures and ideology, it may be illogical to expect them to flock to a brainchild of someone who holds reservations about banning anyone for any reason.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorseys-twitter-alternative-bluesky-is-now-available-in-closed-beta-190600041.html?src=rss

## House committee approves bill that could lead to a TikTok ban in the US

<p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee has voted to advance legislation that would give President Joe Biden the power to ban <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tiktok/">TikTok</a> in the US along with other apps owned by Chinese companies. The panel approved the the Deterring America’s Technological Adversaries (DATA) Act in a 24-16 vote. All Republicans on the panel were in favor while every Democrat voted against the bill.</p><p>There are several more steps that the bill needs to go through before it becomes law. The full House and the Senate would have to pass it, and Biden would have to sign the bill. Still, it's a notable step forward for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-house-tiktok-ban-bill-anti-social-ccp-act-205120387.html">latest attempt</a> to ban TikTok in the US entirely.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Republican committee chair Michael McCaul introduced the DATA Act (<a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA00/20230228/115363/BILLS-118HR1153ih.pdf">PDF</a>) only last week. McCaul expects the bill to go to a full house vote later this month, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-house-panel-approves-bill-give-biden-power-ban-tiktok-2023-03-01/">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>.</p><p>The legislation would grant the president the power to enact sanctions, including bans, on any company that the Treasury Secretary deems &quot;knowingly provides or may transfer sensitive personal data of persons subject to United States jurisdiction to any foreign person that is subject to the jurisdiction or direction&quot; of China. The same applies to a foreign person or company that &quot;is owned by, directly or indirectly controlled by, or is otherwise subject to the influence of China.&quot;</p><p>Democratic members of the Foreign Affairs Committee claimed that the legislation was too broad. It would &quot;damage our allegiances across the globe, bring more companies into China's sphere, destroy jobs here in the United States and undercut core American values of free speech and free enterprise,&quot; Rep. Gregory Meeks, the ranking Democrat member, said. He suggested that the legislation as is could lead to sanctions against businesses in Korea and Taiwan that supply semiconductors and other parts to Chinese companies.</p><div id="173a3173084b46c8b07d27125ddaf6e6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/zCHrWw1BH6">pic.twitter.com/zCHrWw1BH6</a></p>— TikTokComms (@TikTokComms) <a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokComms/status/1630976639948423178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>&quot;A US ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide,&quot; TikTok <a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokComms/status/1630976639948423178">wrote on Twitter</a>. &quot;We're disappointed to see this rushed piece of legislation move forward, despite its considerable negative impact on the free speech rights of millions of Americans who use and love TikTok.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Congress must not censor entire platforms and strip Americans of their constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression,&quot; American Civil Liberties Union senior policy counsel Jenna Leventoff <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-strongly-opposes-house-bill-that-would-ban-tiktok-and-threaten-first-amendment-rights">said in a statement</a>. &quot;Whether we’re discussing the news of the day, live streaming protests, or ​​even watching cat videos, we have a right to use TikTok and other platforms to exchange our thoughts, ideas, and opinions with people around the country and around the world.&quot; Leventoff called the bill &quot;vague, overbroad and unconstitutional.&quot;</p><p>TikTok has faced a growing backlash in recent months over concerns that the Chinese government may obtain user data from the app. Owner ByteDance is headquartered in Beijing, but TikTok claims it doesn't share data with the Chinese government. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-user-data-us-200500287.html">By last summer</a>, TikTok was routing all US data to Oracle servers based in the country.

As <em>Autoblog</em><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2023/03/01/rivian-r1s-max-battery-pack/">notes</a>, the option adds $16,000 to the price of the R1T but extends the range to 400 miles.

## Airbnb is banning people ‘likely to travel’ with prohibited users

<p>Airbnb is reportedly banning users who, despite having a clear background, were associated with people the company deems a safety risk. Although the short-term rental company faces an impossible balancing act of making owners feel secure without discriminating unfairly against renters, its appeals process — a critical step in catching overreaches — sounds lackluster and confusing while erring on the side of perceived homeowner security.</p><p>Airbnb <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3pajy/airbnb-is-banning-people-who-are-closely-associated-with-already-banned-users">confirmed</a> to <em>Motherboard</em> that it sometimes refuses to rent to users associated with banned individuals “likely to travel” with them. For example, in January, Airbnb informed a user named Amanda that she was prohibited from the platform due to being “closely associated with a person who isn’t allowed to use Airbnb.” Amanda used the credit card of her boyfriend — who has a criminal record — to book the rental. (Amanda doesn’t have a criminal record.) She told <em>Motherboard</em> that her partner’s flagged history was from “a white collar charge” while adding that the two don’t share an address or bank account.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Two days after appealing the ban, Airbnb informed her it was upholding it “after careful consideration” to help “safeguard our community.” Then, it slammed the door shut on the case, adding that it wouldn’t “offer additional support on this case at this time.” Although the company is less than transparent about how long it’s enacted this process or how often it uses it, its procedures require one of two things to appeal successfully: the banned acquaintance causing their prohibition successfully appeals their ban, or the person attempting to rent proves they aren’t “closely associated” with the problematic person.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, the company’s subliminal message has concerning undertones: Associate with someone with a checkered past — regardless of who they are today — and neither of you can use our platform.</p><p>Airbnb is a private business, and Amanda could try booking through a competitor — or simply get a hotel room. Further, we don’t know the precise details about why her boyfriend was banned in the first place. But the company’s approach highlights a more significant issue we may see again as Big Tech’s ability to profile users grows more advanced. (The company already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-anti-party-tech-test-us-canada-145030677.html">uses</a> “anti-party tech,” and competitor Vrbo used what’s essentially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vrbo-super-bowl-house-party-risk-score-193020734.html">pre-crime for house parties</a> during the Super Bowl.)&nbsp;</p><p>So where do you draw the line? Airbnb’s answer appears to be a cynical calculation that risking negative press about banning acquaintances — perhaps unfairly — is preferable to anything that could make homeowners feel less secure about using the service.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-is-banning-people-likely-to-travel-with-prohibited-users-173553947.html?src=rss

## The Olympic Esports Series will feature 'Just Dance,' 'Gran Turismo' and chess

<p>The International Olympics Committee has <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-series-2023"><ins>laid out more details</ins></a> for the upcoming Olympic Esports Series, which will take place in Singapore in June. The lineup features facsimiles of real-world competitive events rather than what many people may think of as traditional <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/esports/"><ins>esports</ins></a>, such as real-time strategy titles, fighting games and first-person shooters.</p><p>The initial batch of nine games connect to disciplines overseen by international sports federations. They include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/just%20dance/"><em><ins>Just Dance</ins></em></a> and online chess from Chess.com. Some titles that have appeared at previous IOC-sanctioned events are returning, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gran%20turismo/"><ins>Gran Turismo</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/zwift/"><ins>Zwift</ins></a>, which requires participants to physically pedal on a stationary bike. Archery, baseball, sailing, taekwondo and tennis games round out the list. Qualifiers for the various titles, which include mobile games like <em>Tennis Clash</em>, start today.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;The Olympic Movement brings people together in peaceful competition,&quot; David Lappartient, chair of the IOC Esports Liaison Group, said. &quot;The Olympic Esports Series 2023 is a continuation of that, with the ambition of creating more spaces to play for both players and fans of elite competition.&quot;</p><div id="d843fc8eb301471eb8649496dd27fb2e"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The Esports Series follows on from the Olympic Virtual Series, which took place in 2021 in the lead up to the Olympic Games in Tokyo. That esports event featured baseball, cycling (on Zwift), rowing, sailing and motorsport. The IOC says the series drew in more than 250,000 participants from 100 countries.</p><p>Although the organization is still just warming up to the idea <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-ioc-esports-event.html"><ins>of bringing esports into the Olympic Games</ins></a> proper, the series is part of the IOC's efforts to engage with younger people and perhaps provide a gateway for them into sport. A strategic plan (<a href="https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/IOC/What-We-Do/Olympic-agenda/Olympic-Agenda-2020-5-15-recommendations.pdf"><ins>PDF</ins></a>) approved by the IOC <a href="https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1105339/ioc-approves-olympic-agenda-20205"><ins>in 2021</ins></a> includes a recommendation to &quot;encourage the development of virtual sports and further engage with video gaming communities.&quot; Part of this involves an effort to &quot;strengthen the roles and responsibilities of [international federations] in establishing virtual and simulated forms of sports as a discipline within their regulations and strategies.&quot;</p><p>“The idea first is really to make the bridge between the sports and the gaming space,&quot; Vincent Perieira, the IOC's head of virtual sport and gaming, told the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/gaming/olympic-esports-series-future-gaming-b1063566.html"><em><ins>Evening Standard</ins></em></a><em>. </em>“We’re not making [an] opposition between sports and gaming. The point is really... how we can encourage people to do both to keep a good balance.”</p><p>On one hand, it makes some sense to ground the Esports Series in virtual versions of traditional sporting disciplines. The basic rules of virtual cycling, chess and tennis should be generally easy for participants and viewers to understand.</p><p>However, the IOC may be missing a trick by opting not to feature the likes of <em>League of Legends, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-08-top-female-player-wins-olympics-backed-starcraft-2-tournament.html"><em><ins>StarCraft II</ins></em></a><em>, Minecraft, Fortnite </em>or <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>. Those games (and many others) have significant built-in audiences that may not especially care about the Olympics otherwise. Perhaps one day we'll see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stardew-valley-cup-esports-tournament-concerned-ape-181150873.html"><em><ins>Stardew Valley</ins></em></a><em>,</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/classic-tetris-monthly-ctwc-nes-esport-180036668.html"><em><ins>Tetris</ins></em></a> and <em>GeoGuessr</em> as medaled events at the Olympic Games, but not anytime soon.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-olympic-esports-series-will-feature-just-dance-gran-turismo-and-chess-172704742.html?src=rss

## Activision accused of illegally firing game testers who opposed a return to office

<p>Activision Blizzard's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-wants-blizzard-employees-to-return-to-the-office-in-july-175849412.html">return-to-office plans</a> are prompting another labor dispute. The Communications Workers of America (CWA) union has filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Activision for the allegedly illegal firings of two quality assurance testers who objected to a hybrid plan that required them to be in the office three days a week by April 10th. Management ostensibly fired the pair for using &quot;strong language&quot; in their opposition, the CWA says, but union Secretary-Treasurer Sara Steffens characterized the move as &quot;retaliation&quot; against staff who joined co-workers in protected labor activity.</p><p>Many employees are balking at the office strategy, the CWA claims. They're reportedly concerned the end to purely remote work will raise the cost of living and force some employees out of their jobs. The NLRB expressly protected the use of harsh language until 2020, when the government loosened standards for firing people over their statements.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a statement to Engadget, an Activision spokesperson doesn't address the return-to-office effort and maintains that it fired the testers for violating company policy with their language. The game publisher insists that the CWA is &quot;advocating for this type of behavior.&quot; We've asked the NLRB for comment.</p><p>There's no certainty the charge will succeed. However, it comes after successes for the CWA's fight against Activision. Last May, the NLRB determined there was merit to claims the company illegally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-nlrb-union-allegations-190456751.html">threatened staff</a> and stifled social media posts. In October, the board found that Activision <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-raven-software-raises-nlrb-labor-complaint-160729342.html">withheld raises from testers</a> at Raven Software over their unionization efforts. An in-progress charge asserts the firm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-walkout-cwa-charge-204543422.html">surveilled protesters</a> and cut off chat channels used to discuss labor issues. Activision has routinely denied these allegations, arguing that it's honoring the law and internal policy.</p><p>Regardless of the claims' validity, the pressure has led to changes for some employees. Activision converted all its contract and part-time testers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-qa-testers-hiring-pay-increase-165142140.html">full-time status</a> last July, granting them improved pay and benefits. Some teams have also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-second-qa-tester-union-vote-results-205949946.html">managed to unionize</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/activision-accused-of-illegally-firing-game-testers-who-opposed-a-return-to-office-171526812.html?src=rss

Around back, you've got plenty of ports to handle your accessories, including two Thunderbolt 4 UCB-C ports, an HDMI port with 4K output at 240Hz and 8K at 60Hz, two USB-A ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack and a gigabit Ethernet port, which you can upgrade to a 10 gigabit port, but it'll cost you an extra $150.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Inside, there's the namesake M2 chip, which Apple first first offered in 2022. The chip combines computing operations, like CPU, GPU, input/output interfaces and certain memory processes into one "system on a chip," allowing for faster processing speeds. Apple has put the chip into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tablets-150026056.html">new iPad Pros</a>, their latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-review-2023-m2-pro-max-140048268.html">MacBook Pros</a> and now the Mac mini. The chips in the discounted models have eight CPU cores, 10 graphics cores, 8GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage. That 8GB of RAM may strain under heavy browser tab loads, but should be suitable for most people's everyday work flows. The minis also make a good home theater computer, if you want even more customization than you'd get with an Apple TV.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-m2-mac-mini-falls-to-a-new-low-of-549-163447890.html?src=rss

## VW unveils second-gen ID.3 EV and an app store for its cars

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-id3-september-release-date-180611233.html">The ID.3</a> isn't even three years old, but that isn't stopping Volkswagen from giving its well-known EV a makeover. After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-id3-second-generation-redesign-teaser-182700069.html">months of teasers</a>, the company has <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/enhanced-quality-likeable-digital-world-premiere-of-the-new-id3-15524">introduced</a> a second-generation ID.3 that addresses criticisms of the first model. The new compact car offers a &quot;sharper&quot; design with improved aerodynamics and a higher-quality (and heavily recycled) interior. More importantly, VW has upgraded the technology — including its<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-29-vw-id-3-software-trouble-rumor.html"> software</a>, which garnered a long list of complaints from drivers.</p><p>The second-gen ID.3 includes the &quot;latest software,&quot; with a simpler layout, better performance and over-the-air updates. The 12-inch infotainment display is now standard. You also have access to a Travel Assist feature that uses &quot;swarm&quot; data to aid driving — the crowdsourced info can keep you in your lane on a backroad even if there's just one known lane marking. Charging should be easier, too, between an automatic charge start (at compatible stations) and a route planner that factors in the availability and capacity of stations along the way. Your car won't direct you to a busy station with slow chargers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="f3dc2080694b442199b09611c58792b8"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Don't expect huge changes in performance. The new ID.3 uses the same 201HP motor system and battery options as before. That nets up to 265 miles of range (using the WLTP testing method) with the base 58kWh battery and 339 miles with the 77kWh pack. Those are still very healthy figures for an EV this size, however, and VW has teased a smaller battery for those who only need a commuter car.</p><p>Production is slated to start in fall 2023. VW hasn't outlined pricing or country-by-country availability, but we wouldn't count on this reaching the US. Like the original ID.3, the revamp is aimed primarily at European customers where North America gets larger vehicles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">ID.4 crossover</a> and upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-idbuzz-electric-van-first-drive-video-160010375.html">ID.Buzz</a>.</p><figure><img alt="Volkswagen Group app store in Audi car" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/ada6fe10-b845-11ed-a736-9d2baf845a97" style="height: 1280; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volkswagen</div></figure><p>Even larger software improvements are in store, regardless of where you live. VW's Cariad unit has <a href="https://cariad.technology/de/en/news/stories/launch-application-store-for-volkswagen-group.html">unveiled</a> an app store (pictured at middle) for the automaker's brands, including Audi and Porsche. The platform will help third parties bring apps to a wide range of cars with relatively little fuss, including over-the-air-updates. Major early partners tend to be driving-oriented services like Spotify, TuneIn, The Weather Channel and Plugshare. However, you'll also find TikTok, Cisco's Webex meeting app and even Vivaldi's web browser.</p><p>The app store debuts in several Audi models (including EVs like the E-Tron GT and Q8 E-Tron) this summer for European and North American customers. More models and VW brands are coming later. Don't expect to upgrade your existing ride, though, as VW cautions that the shop will only be available in cars produced from summer onward.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/vw-unveils-second-gen-id3-ev-and-an-app-store-for-its-cars-154817061.html?src=rss

Netflix says <em>The First Shadow</em> "will take you right back to the beginning of the <em>Stranger Things </em>story — and to the beginning of the end."

## Sony 2023 Bravia XR TV hands-on: Bigger, brighter and even better looking

<p>Back at CES, most of the big TV makers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-2023-oled-tv-lineup-specs-010035157.html">LG</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-bets-on-micro-led-and-8-k-for-its-premium-2023-t-vs-030033433.html">Samsung</a> announced their upcoming high end TVs. But one major company was missing: <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/televisions/c/all-tvs">Sony</a>. Now it’s finally ready to show off its latest flagship sets, and after getting a chance to see them in person, I can say it was worth the wait.</p><p>Sony’s 2023 line of Bravia XR TVs, are all powered by the company’s Cognitive Processor XR. That means they share the same underlying tech and processing including support for stuff like Sony’s XR Clear Image tech, which allows for adaptive noise reduction, auto HDR tone mapping and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="59114dd2ccb84bc0adfe3aaaa83a2826"></div><p>For 2023, Sony is trying to take as much of the guesswork out of setup as possible by making its TVs look great right out of the box in the standard video or cinematic modes. That means you shouldn’t have to fuss around with various settings or need to get your TV professionally calibrated. Granted calibration is still the way to go if you want to get the very best image quality, but for people who don’t have a colorimeter at home or don’t want to pay someone else to do it – which I think is pretty much everyone – this is a welcome upgrade.</p><p>Sony has also made a few design tweaks including new tweeters that are built into the frame of select models. While you can’t really see them, they help deliver richer and more expansive audio, particularly when paired with one of the company’s high-end soundbars with center sync audio. Sony is also introducing an updated stand for most of its new sets, which allows for a bit more flexibility when trying to accommodate external speakers and soundbars.</p><figure><img alt="The new Eco dashboard in Sony's 2023 Bravia XR TVs makes it easy to turn on and adjust power-saving settings like brightness, idle power off times and more. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/3ebd7e40-b7d0-11ed-9ffd-086b584b284b" /><figcaption>The new Eco dashboard in Sony's 2023 Bravia XR TVs makes it easy to turn on and adjust power-saving settings like brightness, idle power-off times and more.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Finally, Sony also added new Gaming and Eco dashboards, so it’s easier to find and adjust various settings. For gaming, you have options like VRR, motion blur reduction and more. And for FPS fanatics, there’s even a setting for adding a permanent crosshair to the middle of the screen, complete with various reticle choices. Alternatively, the Eco Dashboard includes a simple walkthrough to help you choose power-saving settings, including a happy little tree that grows when you do things like reduce the brightness or enable shorter idle power-off times.</p><p>While Sony hasn’t released exact pricing just yet, the X90L will likely be the most affordable of the bunch, as it’s positioned as the entry-level option in the Bravia XR family. It’s the replacement to last year’s <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=15919d69-aefa-41ae-a977-fdcae58a803c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sony&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxNTkxOWQ2OS1hZWZhLTQxYWUtYTk3Ny1mZGNhZTU4YTgwM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ueS5jb20vbHIvZWxlY3Ryb25pY3MvdGVsZXZpc2lvbnMveDkway14OTNrLXg5NGstc2VyaWVzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1ZmJjYjljYS03MWUxLTQxYzAtYjNkMC1iODgxODJjMDNiZWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQGxvy4rlTWYVmkKL5v0_iooZ-VczakSU0yKedT8Hc9s&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.com%2Flr%2Felectronics%2Ftelevisions%2Fx90k-x93k-x94k-series">X90K</a>, and sports a full-array LED panel with improved Clear Image upscaling and significantly reduced blooming. And while Sony doesn’t publicly disclose the exact number of dimming zones, the company says the X90L has up to 60 percent more dimming zones while also being up to 30 percent brighter than before.</p><figure><img alt="While it's a mid-range TV overall, the new X90L is poised to be the entry model in Sony's high-end Bravia XR TV family. And with the largest model going up to 98 inches, it's also the largest.

Not only do both models boast improved contrast, when viewed side-by-side with rivals like the LG C2, I noticed Sony’s OLEDs definitely did a better job at preserving details in shadows. The A95L was particularly impressive thanks to its QD-OLED panel and Cognitive Processor, with Sony claiming brightness that's now two times higher than last year's model. This is big because for a long time, the brightness of OLED TVs has generally lagged behind that of more traditional LED sets. But now, Sony says the A95L is brighter than basically all but the most high-end LED rivals. And as someone who loves the super vibrant colors you get from OLED displays, the A95L might be my favorite of the entire line.</p><figure><img alt="Thanks to a new QD-OLED panel, Sony claims the A95L is two times brighter than last year's model. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/21c0ba40-b7d1-11ed-a575-f929a86ee55d" /><figcaption>Thanks to a new QD-OLED panel, Sony claims the A95L is two times brighter than last year's model. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Speaking of high-end, Sony’s X93L and X95L are the company’s two super premium flagship options. Both sets feature Mini LED displays with the main difference being that the X93L doesn’t come with Sony’s XR Clear Image tech. Meanwhile, the X95L offers similar peak brightness with 30 percent more local dimming zones. The downside is that the X95L is only available as an 85-inch model, so if you need something smaller, you’ll have to go with the X93L.</p><p>That said, when I compared the X93L and X95L to one of Sony’s super expensive reference monitors in a room with typical lighting, both did a great job of preserving details while also delivering extremely accurate colors. In certain scenes, Sony’s TV’s almost made rivals like Samsung’s QN90B look washed out. Admittedly, things like film grain were a bit more noticeable on the X93L because it doesn’t have Clear Image tech, but for film aficionados who really care about watching movies that look as close as possible to what the director intended, these are the sets to get.</p><figure><img alt="The X95L is the new flagship set for Sony's entire Bravia XR TV family.

You get way more local dimming zones on the X90L line, while the two times higher brightness on the A95L is absolutely stunning. And with Sony adding larger screen options to basically all of its models, it should be even easier to find the right-size display for your room.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sony-2023-bravia-xr-tv-hands-on-bigger-brighter-and-even-better-looking-150030819.html?src=rss

## 14 relaxing video games to help you destress

<p>In recent years, we’ve seen an influx of self-proclaimed “<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-makes-a-cozy-game-cozy">cozy games</a>,” video games explicitly designed to invoke good vibes. Being cozy, however, isn’t the same as being good. To help those who could use some help winding down, we’ve rounded up a selection of games that purposefully deemphasize fail states, violence, overwhelming grinds, intense competition and other aggressive urges, but aren’t overly cute for the sake of it or so stripped-down that they’re boring.</p><h2><em>Stardew Valley</em></h2><p></p><p>Apart from being one of our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-co-op-games-for-pc-nintendo-switch-ps-4-and-more-141542259.html">favorite couch co-op games</a>, the farming life sim <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TdGFyZGV3LVZhbGxleS1OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gtRGlnaXRhbC9kcC9CMDc2VEs0TTk2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLW02LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQjlsnkjgoATdLxKuNfWoLYmmLdcsR8PmgRu7Lo0MDW8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FStardew-Valley-Nintendo-Switch-Digital%2Fdp%2FB076TK4M96"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a> is also notable for its relaxing qualities. It’s a game that’s willing to meet you at your pace: If you want to putter around your farm, casually chat up townsfolk, brew beer or fish for a few hours, you can. (On the flipside, if you want to turn your land into a model of ruthless efficiency as soon as possible, the experience will be more overwhelming, and the story will have a darker undercurrent.) It all starts a bit slow, but there’s no external force rushing you, and the game’s trajectory of progress always points upward. It’s an alternate little life, one that gives you the choice to take it easy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TdGFyZGV3LVZhbGxleS1OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gtRGlnaXRhbC9kcC9CMDc2VEs0TTk2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLW02LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQjlsnkjgoATdLxKuNfWoLYmmLdcsR8PmgRu7Lo0MDW8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FStardew-Valley-Nintendo-Switch-Digital%2Fdp%2FB076TK4M96">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2456-CUSA06840_00-STARDEW00000SIEA">PS4</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZjQxOTUwZS04Y2EzLTQ0ODEtODQ2Ni1hMjJiMjhiODBlMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvc3RhcmRldy12YWxsZXkvYzNkODkxejZ0bnFtIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe8Xfrrgnks-rX1cQQrfUSUO0FOldgtPkpaVBp77ggqr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fstardew-valley%2Fc3d891z6tnqm">Xbox</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL3N0YXJkZXdfdmFsbGV5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ3pqEQjVklhcO0yX4jepvEmI5NaMs9OlkbeC_X84znz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fstardew_valley">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/34716">90 hours</a></p><h2><em>Tetris Effect</em></h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UZXRyaXMtRWZmZWN0LUNvbm5lY3RlZC1OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gvZHAvQjBCN1FWMzNCNz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1tNi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAcipBM_eShXD02VhVDSfE1NNRXCpF0Q5MV-_MTVPOzeN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTetris-Effect-Connected-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB0B7QV33B7"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a> is, in essence, a prettier version of the falling-block puzzle game that has compelled the globe since the mid-’80s. Its spacey pop soundtrack and themed boards have an ethereal, almost spiritual quality, one that fits neatly with the trance-like condition <em>Tetris</em> can induce. (This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect">helps explain</a> where the title comes from.)</p><p>To be clear, <em>Tetris</em> is not the most relaxing game in the abstract. The way it makes you scramble to fix your past decisions is part of its magic, and several modes in <em>Tetris Effect</em> specifically thrive on stress. Others, however, are explicitly designed to tap into the game’s zen aspects. “Chill Marathon,” for one, simply resets your score upon failure instead of giving you a game over. And since <em>Tetris</em> itself comes as second-nature to an unusually large amount of people, we’ll make an exception for it here. It can be difficult, but even in failure, <em>Tetris Effect</em> induces a mind-freeing <em>state</em> like few games can.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UZXRyaXMtRWZmZWN0LUNvbm5lY3RlZC1OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gvZHAvQjBCN1FWMzNCNz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1tNi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAcipBM_eShXD02VhVDSfE1NNRXCpF0Q5MV-_MTVPOzeN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTetris-Effect-Connected-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB0B7QV33B7">Switch</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEI3UU0xTEZXLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLW02LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdJUCH7_F4fgPbj1hAc-gBDMG4RCKPCgvHXIBncxy8e8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B7QM1LFW%2F%3Fth%3D1">PS4</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0751-CUSA13594_00-TETRISEFFECT0000">PS5</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZjQxOTUwZS04Y2EzLTQ0ODEtODQ2Ni1hMjJiMjhiODBlMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvdGV0cmlzLWVmZmVjdC1jb25uZWN0ZWQvOXBwYnZrM3RrODNtIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX2e4-AAgm5j9Y1UOA7K3awg4WA-FdnaBucqzT2tkeD6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Ftetris-effect-connected%2F9ppbvk3tk83m">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003590/Tetris_Effect_Connected/">PC</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6f7ae225-b81d-43cd-a3c7-b24c85091f6f&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Oculus&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2ZjdhZTIyNS1iODFkLTQzY2QtYTNjNy1iMjRjODUwOTFmNmYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2N1bHVzLmNvbS9leHBlcmllbmNlcy9xdWVzdC8zMzg2NjE4ODk0NzQzNTY3LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAATuiPgQxg69u298TYaMR-EKXYZzPgdkCtnrHuZzctFXl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F3386618894743567%2F">Meta Quest</a></p><h2><em>Dorfromantik</em></h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2RvcmZyb21hbnRpayIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAXCI4wIde9lRRWYp1e0kr-wKatfdEzV6wuqQKdptoJHE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdorfromantik"><em>Dorfromantik</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a puzzle game in which you lay down tiles to create an idyllic countryside. The tiles come in distinct types: forests, fields, rivers, railroads, little houses and so on. The idea is to chain similar pieces together, and the game will give you little “quests” to connect a certain number of matching tiles to grow your overall stack. Since you can only see a few tiles at once, exactly what your landscape looks like differs from game to game.</p><p>The need to keep gaining tiles creates a contingent sort of pressure, but even still, <em>Dorfromantik </em>is a game that encourages slowness. There’s no time limit, and no way to even really “win.” You’re led to consider each piece, look at the land and see how it all fits. When the tiles run out, you’ve usually created a beautiful little scene. And if you just want to build a landscape without any restrictions, there’s a separate mode for that.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2RvcmZyb21hbnRpay1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXNWdj-vCW6lozA7iDPhUYR_YP39jKq9DcjbNZ2N3ohM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fdorfromantik-switch%2F">Switch</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2RvcmZyb21hbnRpayIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAXCI4wIde9lRRWYp1e0kr-wKatfdEzV6wuqQKdptoJHE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdorfromantik">PC</a></p><h2><em>A Short Hike</em></h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2Ffc2hvcnRfaGlrZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAV1rWZsmZNEEkcI36Pg9s1eXaTpKo8eiPPSgvSAyqd1s&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fa_short_hike"><em>A Short Hike</em></a> is a lovely little adventure game that is completely in tune with itself. You play as Claire, a young bird in a world of anthropomorphic animals, who is staying in a small yet bustling provincial park. Something is weighing on her, and she needs to make a phone call, but the only place with cellular reception is the top of the mountain at the park’s center. Your only real objective in the two-hour game is to get her there.</p><p>There is a conventional core to <em>A Short Hike</em> that involves doing light fetch quests for other park-goers and collecting golden feathers to climb higher and double-jump more. But most of these tasks are straightforward, and it quickly becomes apparent that you can (literally) soar around most of the park as you please, taking in the sights and interacting with the other park visitors as they go about their lives. Apart from simply feeling nice, this freedom ties beautifully into the game’s themes: That mountain is calling, but you don’t have to climb it right away. When you do, the world will still be there for you to explore.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2Etc2hvcnQtaGlrZS1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXnbvPTNCCA9VfXzAmo_Ei8gdUGXc0Xo3bjAZPKWSU1Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fa-short-hike-switch%2F">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP7124-CUSA29611_00-5721900664542776">PS4</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZjQxOTUwZS04Y2EzLTQ0ODEtODQ2Ni1hMjJiMjhiODBlMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvYS1zaG9ydC1oaWtlLzluazc4ZGYyMDdzZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZHAusFATjJOEY_GFU7B-rHu0VX-lskzCVfJ6GFjkkCy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fa-short-hike%2F9nk78df207sd">Xbox</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL2Ffc2hvcnRfaGlrZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAV1rWZsmZNEEkcI36Pg9s1eXaTpKo8eiPPSgvSAyqd1s&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fa_short_hike">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/66152">2 hours</a></p><h2><em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em></h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYXB0YWluLVRvYWQtVHJlYXN1cmUtVHJhY2tlci9kcC9CMDdDRFFEUERXP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLW02LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYCGDSA76FAjgY23_Yrc026O9sKiUN17RpS5ZX5mZVeZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCaptain-Toad-Treasure-Tracker%2Fdp%2FB07CDQDPDW"><em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em></a> is an adorable puzzle-platformer from Nintendo that has you navigate a series of contained, diorama-like levels, each with a gold star at its end. It’s technically a spin-off of the <em>Super Mario </em>games, but here, you can’t jump. Instead, you need to explore the game’s densely-packed spaces from new angles, shifting the camera to find hidden pathways and bonus treasures.</p><p>The whole thing is neither overlong nor super difficult, but it is determined, in that delightful Nintendo way, to constantly hit you with new ideas, each as playful and meticulous as the last. While it doesn’t reach the creative heights of the best <em>Mario </em>games — some of which were developed by the same team — it is similarly amiable and more easygoing.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYXB0YWluLVRvYWQtVHJlYXN1cmUtVHJhY2tlci9kcC9CMDdDRFFEUERXP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLW02LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYCGDSA76FAjgY23_Yrc026O9sKiUN17RpS5ZX5mZVeZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCaptain-Toad-Treasure-Tracker%2Fdp%2FB07CDQDPDW">Switch</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/19217">11 hours</a></p><h2><em>Desert Golfing</em></h2><p></p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/757040/Desert_Golfing/"><em>Desert Golfing</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is exactly what its title says and nothing more. There is a ball, a hole, and some procedurally generated desert land in between. That’s it. No par, no club selection, no music, no items, no pause menu, no restarts, not even a physical avatar. Only dragging a cursor back to determine the next shot’s angle and power, and an attempt to get A to B. Once you do, a new hole appears, and you go on, infinitely. (The game <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3nnv4/one-players-21000-hole-quest-to-beat-the-seemingly-endless-desert-golf">technically has</a> an “ending,” but may God have mercy on anyone who plays long enough to see it.)</p><p><em>Desert Golfing</em> reads as overly simple on paper, and sure, it makes sense as a sneaky critique of time-sucking, player-debasing mobile games. Actually playing it, though, borders on meditative. The game’s radical minimalism makes everything and nothing matter all at once. There’s a shot counter at the top, but it’s functionally meaningless, merely signifying how long you’ve played. You may spend 60 shots on one hole, but there’s no invisible eye judging you. Instead, you’re allowed to focus entirely on the simple pleasure of arcing a ball through the air, seeing it kick up sand and eventually making it <em>plonk</em> in the hole. It’s about the act of play more than the rules of a game: golf<em>ing</em>, not golf. And when something new does pop up — a well of water, a setting sun, a cactus — it feels momentous.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/757040/Desert_Golfing/">PC</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/desert-golfing/id902062673?ign-mpt=uo%3D8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.captaingames.golf">Android</a></p><h2><em>The Ramp</em></h2><p></p><p>Much like <em>Desert Golfing</em>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3RoZS1yYW1wLXN3aXRjaC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQyYzhiMWNiLTM4NGUtNDc2NS04NDdkLTgyN2ZkNTQ3ZWUyNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXj50fS0koKpkoVqRd5EmxMxu5j66IIo0-zebjY6k5vw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fthe-ramp-switch%2F"><em>The Ramp</em></a> is a successful experiment in minimalism. It’s a skateboarding game, but its approach is a far cry from the <em>Tony Hawk </em>series. It doesn’t burden you with high scores, skill points, objectives, camera adjustments or a HUD, and it respects you enough to unlock all of its courses and characters after a brief tutorial.</p><p>While it takes a moment to get the hang of its controls, <em>The Ramp</em> excels at conveying the joy of motion and momentum in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vert_skateboarding">vert skating</a>, from launching at speed, to that brief moment of weightlessness in the sky, to the rush of gravity pulling you back down. There’s a handful of tricks to pull off, some chill music to help set the tone, and no real penalty for biffing it.</p><p><em>The Ramp </em>doesn’t have much “depth” by conventional gaming standards; its developer describes it as a “digital toy,” which sounds about right.

It’s crudely animated and maybe an hour long, but it develops more identifiable and <em>human</em> characters in that time than most big-budget games do in 30 hours.</p><p>The story follows the camping trip of a young couple, Brad and Cloanne, their 13-year-old niece Mord and her friend Ben, and the subsequent lessons they learn about love and each other. It has the air of an indie comedy: a little quirky, funny but not mean-spirited, honest but not long-winded, and moving when it’s time to bring the story home. Its world isn’t ending, and there’s no combat. It’s a game about <em>these </em>characters in <em>this </em>specific moment, and it’s presented like a series of memories, something its bold colors amplify.</p><p>The game’s approach to interactivity plays a big role in selling all of this. Instead of merely controlling a specific character, you’re often in charge of the camera, a sort of director role that brings you closer to each scene but distances you, the player, from the action (or what qualifies as action in this case).</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3dpZGUtb2NlYW4tYmlnLWphY2tldC1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVD5zevdP8ciReCydP3Rj7IIV8GwSPRQss3tp-2YXHwP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fwide-ocean-big-jacket-switch%2F">Switch</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS93aWRlLW9jZWFuLWJpZy1qYWNrZXQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQyYzhiMWNiLTM4NGUtNDc2NS04NDdkLTgyN2ZkNTQ3ZWUyNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcwETJEl471KX1MGHffNZn2FrubK86O3rpZlbnVO_qoA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwide-ocean-big-jacket">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/75015">1 hour</a></p><h2><em>Hidden Folks</em></h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2hpZGRlbi1mb2xrcy1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARz6BVhYwZm-CUQpdHRnqDonQKJqrsxYo534yYWBSf4i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fhidden-folks-switch%2F"><em>Hidden Folks</em></a> is like a digital take on those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where's_Wally%3F"><em>Where’s Waldo?</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>puzzle books you might’ve had as a kid.

You methodically work your way through each collection of knick-knacks, placing them around different rooms in a sequence of homes. The game is nearly wordless, but it manages to tell a story almost entirely through its isometric environments: The boxes you unpack all belong to the same character, and each move takes place in a different year of their life. This, combined with the pixelated visuals, gives the game a vaguely wistful tone.</p><p><em>Unpacking </em>is still a puzzle game, so it’ll make items glow red until you put them in a “correct” location. This feels like a misstep: If I want to leave my bookbag off to the side of my bed and just be done with things, why can’t I? Isn’t moving messy? Still, even if <em>Unpacking </em>is a bit too gamified, there’s a quiet catharsis to its fantasy of putting everything in its right place. If nothing else, it’s far less stressful than moving in real life.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9VbnBhY2tpbmctU3RhbmRhcmQtTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoLURpZ2l0YWwvZHAvQjA5TTZIOVJXVy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbTYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQyYzhiMWNiLTM4NGUtNDc2NS04NDdkLTgyN2ZkNTQ3ZWUyNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATtebjb9oUlH3aRSywRvsB17Fu286I3ZvsHWz_77jLl5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUnpacking-Standard-Nintendo-Switch-Digital%2Fdp%2FB09M6H9RWW%2F">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3864-PPSA07117_00-UNPACKINGPS5000A">PS4</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3864-PPSA07117_00-UNPACKINGPS5000A">PS5</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZjQxOTUwZS04Y2EzLTQ0ODEtODQ2Ni1hMjJiMjhiODBlMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tdXMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvdW5wYWNraW5nLzluaDVobjExZmc0bSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAATMf9kjr0O327ywEOImrWf-kLrkRkD6uw3FADKfidUfw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Funpacking%2F9nh5hn11fg4m">Xbox</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a3926e63-4324-467b-872c-52d2bfe9bd34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GOG.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhMzkyNmU2My00MzI0LTQ2N2ItODcyYy01MmQyYmZlOWJkMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29nLmNvbS9lbi9nYW1lL3VucGFja2luZyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYCYww_WhY-Ft5in91aR0zbyBOnB8_TP_tdVUBhQ7Q4f&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Funpacking">PC</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/69666">4 hours</a></p><h2><em>Please, Touch the Artwork</em></h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3BsZWFzZS10b3VjaC10aGUtYXJ0d29yay1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWU6Q39vKaV6N9CuaCHp7MXrmwm2ZwyB9WMxnysk_qS0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fplease-touch-the-artwork-switch%2F"><em>Please, Touch the Artwork</em></a> is a set of three earnest puzzle games, each inspired by abstract art. The specifics of the games differ: One has you mechanically recreate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian">Mondrian-style</a> paintings, another turns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_Boogie_Woogie"><em>Broadway Boogie Woogie</em></a> into a little love story, and the third reframes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_(painting)"><em>New York City</em></a> as a metaphor for adjusting to life in, well, a big new city. Only the first can get particularly difficult, but the game tells you right upfront that it’s made to be a low-stress experience, with no timers, and hints and redo buttons there if you need them.</p><p>What intrigues about <em>Please, Touch the Artwork </em>isn’t what it says about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl"><em>De Stijl</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and abstract art (as if such works could ever be “solved”). Rather, it’s what it conveys about the experience of taking in art itself, and how close it brings you to the lone developer (Thomas Waterzooi) behind the game. The whole project has an intensely personal feel, like peering into someone’s brain and seeing how this kind of art speaks to them. Some may see that as unbearably pretentious, but even on a mechanical level, <em>Please, Touch the Artwork</em> is welcoming, bold and sincere.</p><p><strong>Buy for</strong>: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3BsZWFzZS10b3VjaC10aGUtYXJ0d29yay1zd2l0Y2gvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkMmM4YjFjYi0zODRlLTQ3NjUtODQ3ZC04MjdmZDU0N2VlMjYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWU6Q39vKaV6N9CuaCHp7MXrmwm2ZwyB9WMxnysk_qS0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fplease-touch-the-artwork-switch%2F">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097100/Please_Touch_The_Artwork/">PC</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/please-touch-the-artwork/id1447671288">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioWaterzooi.PleaseTouchTheArtwork">Android</a><br /><strong>Length</strong>: <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/103055">4 hours</a></p><h2><em>Zen Bound 2</em></h2><p></p><p>Like most games on this list, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8cce7f0e-1975-4189-ad0c-2981dc30d13c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Humble+Bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4Y2NlN2YwZS0xOTc1LTQxODktYWQwYy0yOTgxZGMzMGQxM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVtYmxlYnVuZGxlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS96ZW4tYm91bmQtMiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDJjOGIxY2ItMzg0ZS00NzY1LTg0N2QtODI3ZmQ1NDdlZTI2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdpO6MbfElGNlZpyj0E5WUYaIaluRvh6-02EET6OL3VH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fzen-bound-2"><em>Zen Bound 2</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>has a simple premise: You get a rope and a series of 3D sculptures, and your goal is to wrap the rope around each sculpture until it’s covered completely, coating it with paint in the process.

<p>The <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/twitter/">DownDetector pages</a> for Twitter are exploding in activity — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-went-down-for-thousands-of-users-045046684.html">again</a> — and users are sharing that the social network seems to be broken for them. Over the past couple of hours, thousands of users reported issues accessing Twitter.com and seeing just a &quot;Welcome to Twitter&quot; message in their timeline with zero tweets. Other have said their Android and iOS timelines remained stuck in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter's Support account has yet to issue a statement, but some parts of the website are working just fine. Users can still tweet if they want to, or read and respond to their notifications. Weirdly, Tweetdeck appears to be unaffected.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The outage comes shortly after the company reportedly laid off more employees.

## The Morning After: Hackers broke into a LastPass employee's PC to steal the company's password vault

<p>LastPass posted an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lastpass-hackers-broke-into-employee-pc-steal-company-password-vault-074948764.html">update</a> on its investigation regarding a couple of security incidents last year, and they sound worse than we thought. The hackers infiltrated a company DevOps engineer's home computer by exploiting a third-party media software package. They implanted a keylogger into the software and captured the engineer's master password for an account with access to the LastPass corporate vault. After they got in, they exported the vault's entries and shared folders with decryption keys. The company insisted all sensitive customer vault data, aside from some exceptions, "can only be decrypted with a unique encryption key derived from each user's master password." The company added it doesn't store users' master passwords.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Space organizations want the moon to have its own time zone

<p>There's been a resurgence of interest in the moon, now that we're getting closer to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-picks-spacex-artemis-4-102537076.html">re-establishing a foothold</a> on the celestial body. Space agencies and private companies around the world have been scheduling their own lunar missions to take place over the coming years, and it will be quite complicated having to coordinate with each other when they use different time zones. During a meeting at the European Space Agency's ESTEC technology center in the Netherlands last year, space organizations talked about the &quot;importance and urgency of defining a common lunar reference time.&quot; In a new <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Navigation/Telling_time_on_the_Moon">announcement</a>, ESA navigation system engineer Pietro Giordano said a &quot;joint international effort is now being launched towards achieving this.&quot;</p><p>At the moment, different space organizations still use their own time zones for their onboard chronometers and their two-way communications systems. The ESA said doing so &quot;will not be sustainable&quot; in the new era of lunar exploration. Missions from different countries will be doing joint observations, and they may have to communicate with each other even if they're not directly working together if they're on the moon at the same time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Deciding on and keeping lunar time won't be easy, though, and they will come with a unique set of challenges. As the ESA notes, &quot;accurate navigation demands rigorous timekeeping,&quot; which is why one of the topics the international group of space organizations will have to discuss is if there should be a single organization responsible for maintaining the moon's time zone. Further, they'll have to decide whether to keep lunar time synchronized with Earth's or not, because clocks on the moon run faster based on the satellite's position. While they have a lot of factors to consider, whatever they come up with will have to practical for astronauts orbiting or stepping on the lunar surface in the end.&nbsp;</p><p>Bernhard Hufenbach, a member of the ESA's Directorate of Human and Robotic Exploration's Moonlight Management Team, said: &quot;This will be quite a challenge on a planetary surface where in the equatorial region each day is 29.5 days long, including freezing fortnight-long lunar nights, with the whole of Earth just a small blue circle in the dark sky. But having established a working time system for the moon, we can go on to do the same for other planetary destinations.&quot;</p><div id="72a850d305e149ccbed2b010a8bc6fba"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">🕝How do we tell the time on the Moon? 🤔<br /><br />A new era of space exploration needs a shared clock.<br />We are working with <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASA</a> &amp; other international partners towards a common timing system, allowing lunar missions to synch up, interoperate &amp; self-navigate. <br /><br />👉<a href="https://t.co/0S4T2HTaBN">https://t.co/0S4T2HTaBN</a><a href="https://t.co/wubLGvLv3G">pic.twitter.com/wubLGvLv3G</a></p>— ESA (@esa) <a href="https://twitter.com/esa/status/1630208562491191297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/moon-own-time-zone-esa-113547009.html?src=rss

<p>TikTok is introducing new settings that are meant to reduce how much time teens are spending in the app. In <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-features-for-teens-and-families-on-tiktok-us"><ins>an update</ins></a>, the company says it will automatically default teens under the age of 18 to a daily screen time limit of 60 minutes.</p><p>With the change, teens will still be able to bypass the daily limit, but they’ll be required to enter a passcode, “requiring them to make an active decision to extend that time,” the company says. Additionally, if teens opt to turn off the screen time limit altogether, TikTok will further prompt them to set a limit if they spend more than 100 minutes in the app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is also adding new parental control features via the app’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-parents-restricted-content-family-pairing-131320682.html"><ins>“Family Pairing”</ins></a> feature, which allows parents to monitor their children’s activity on TikTok. Parents will be able to set their own custom screen time limits, and view a dashboard that details stats about their child’s time in the app, like how often they open it and what times of the day they use it most. Parents can also set a schedule for when their children can receive notifications, and choose to filter topics they don’t want to appear in their For You feeds.</p><p>The update comes as lawmakers in the United States have <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90aWt0b2stYmFuLXNldC10by1iZS10YWtlbi11cC1ieS1ob3VzZS1sYXdtYWtlcnMtY2E2NDNlYTIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImUxNGI2NjNmLWFhYzctNGNlMy1iMmQzLTE5OGUxNzBmMzc0MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAadR2iiCjo4D2nftxlJ2XOaZeEXKq69-NzBgQ2syVxLy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Ftiktok-ban-set-to-be-taken-up-by-house-lawmakers-ca643ea2"><ins>renewed</ins></a> their efforts to ban TikTok entirely.

## News Corp admits hackers had access to its systems for two years

<p>The threat actors who infiltrated News Corp., the company that owns <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and other news outlets, apparently had access to its network for two full years. In February last year, News Corp. admitted that it had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/news-corp-cyberattack-wsj-new-york-post-china-154139625.html">discovered a security breach</a> a month earlier and that hackers broke into a third-party cloud service that contained employees' information. Now, according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/conservative-news-corp-empire-says-hackers-were-inside-its-network-for-2-years/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>, the company has sent a <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/assigned-data-breach-number-29073-news-corporation/download">breach notification letter</a> (PDF) to at least one affected personnel. In it, the company has admitted that &quot;an unauthorized party&quot; gained access to business documents and emails in some employees' accounts between February 2020 and January 2022.</p><p>When News Corp. announced the breach, the security firm (Mandiant) that investigated the intrusion said it believes the threat actor was connected to the Chinese government. Further, it said the company was most likely attacked to gather intelligence for the country. In an email to <em>Ars</em>, a representative said News Corp. continues to believe &quot;that this was an intelligence collection,&quot; but didn't respond to a question asking if investigators still think the hackers were linked to China.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has revealed in the letter, though, that the bad actors may have gotten a hold of employees' names, birth dates, Social Security number, driver's license and passport numbers, as well as their financial, medical and heath insurance information. &quot;Not all of this information was impacted for each affected individual,&quot; it added. News Corp. said that it hasn't heard any incidents of identity theft or fraud resulting from the security breach so far, but it's offering affected employees two years of identity protection and credit monitoring.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Our investigation indicates that this activity does not appear to be focused on exploiting personal information,&quot; News Corp. wrote in its letter. However, it didn't reveal that details of the documents and emails the threat actors were able to access, and it didn't say if they were specifically looking for information connected to the company's reporting.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/news-corp-hackers-access-two-years-095301729.html?src=rss

While the company intends to release other AR glasses before then, the device it's launching in four years' time is the same one Mark Zuckerberg believes could become Meta's &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-ar-glasses-2024-release-162237114.html">iPhone moment</a>.&quot; That is, he thinks it could shake up the industry and could become as popular as the iPhone.&nbsp;</p><p>The glasses will reportedly have the capability to project avatars as high-quality holograms superimposed on top of the real world — they're also expected to be quite expensive. Employees will get the chance to take first crack at testing the device in 2024 before it makes its way to the public as Meta's &quot;Innovation&quot; line of advanced smart glasses for the earliest adopters.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company also discussed the other AR and VR devices it's launching before its full-fledged AR glasses are ready, <em>The Verge</em> says. This fall, it's apparently releasing a follow-up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">Ray-Ban Stories</a>, which it developed in partnership with Luxottica. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-2023-233025187.html">Quest 3</a> headset, which is expected to be twice as thin and as powerful as the Quest 2, will also be available later this year. In 2024, Meta also plans to launch a VR headset codenamed &quot;Ventura,&quot; which it intends to sell &quot;at the most attractive price point in the VR consumer market.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>A year after that, in 2025, Meta plans to launch the third-generation Ray-Ban Stories. It will feature a display called the &quot;viewfinder&quot; designed to view incoming texts, scan QR codes and translate messages to other languages in real time. Users will reportedly be able to control the glasses with hand movements and will eventually be able to type messages using a virtual keyboard. In addition, Meta is developing a smartwatch to go with these particular glasses.</p><p>Meta isn't the only big technology company with plans to launch AR and VR glasses and headsets over the next few years. Apple is believed to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-wwdc-2023-announcement-221042779.html">debuting</a> its long-awaited mixed reality headset at WWDC in June. It's expected to have advanced features, such as dual 4K displays and controller-free input, and to cost as much as $3,000. However, reports suggest that Apple is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-working-cheaper-mixed-reality-headset-063000889.html">working on a cheaper version</a> that more people will be able to afford.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-first-true-ar-glasses-2027-060946419.html?src=rss
