<p id="1ddNbm">Tesla stopped inviting members of the mainstream press to its event right after the Cybertruck reveal in 2019. It was around the same time that the company disbanded its media relations department, leaving Musk’s Twitter account (and a sporadically updated blog) as the sole outlet for information about Tesla. </p>

<p id="t6M7EZ">OpenAI says its ChatGPT API can be used for more than just creating an AI-powered chat interface — though it also highlights several companies that have been using it for that purpose, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23614959/snapchat-my-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-openai-plus-subscription">Snap’s My AI feature</a>, which was announced earlier this week.

  <p id="4vu86Y">SUV sales soared in 2022, a trend that makes it much harder to reach global climate goals, experts say. And while car buyers flocked to electric SUVs along with their gas-guzzling counterparts, supersize EVs pose their own environmental challenges. </p>
<p id="viMzAM">When it comes to slashing pollution from passenger vehicles, bigger is the opposite of better. SUVs burn through about 20 percent more oil on average than medium-size cars. Electric SUVs also require larger batteries than other EVs, and experts are already warning that we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421081/critical-minerals-climate-change-goals-clean-energy">won’t have enough raw materials</a> to meet <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/FCAB%20National%20Blueprint%20Lithium%20Batteries%200621_0.pdf">skyrocketing demand for lithium-ion batteries</a>.</p>

The new lineup includes a wickedly bright QD-OLED at the top of the pile, but this is otherwise mostly a year of iterative refinement and modest improvements. Several of the TV models have gained more dimming zones and slight brightness improvements compared to the sets from last year that they’ll be replacing. </p>

Today, Netflix announced <em>Stranger Things: The First Shadow</em>, a stage play that will premiere at the Phoenix Theatre in London’s West End starting in “late” 2023 and that serves as an origin story of sorts.</p>
<p id="PVJ6VP"><em>Stranger Things</em> creators the Duffer brothers will serve as creative producers, while the story was penned by Kate Trefry, a writer on the show since season 2. The story follows younger versions of characters like Hopper and Joyce as they deal with the early days of the darkness that haunts Hawkins, Indiana. Here’s the official premise:</p>
