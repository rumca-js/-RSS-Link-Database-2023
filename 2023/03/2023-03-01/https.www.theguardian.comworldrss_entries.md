The government’s scientific advisers appeared to share the view and were perhaps even a factor in its widespread belief. At the first Sage meeting in January 2020, the assembled experts said a Covid test would be ready within days and that it could be “scalable across the UK in weeks”.</p><p>That assessment was way off the mark. The UK was indeed one of the first countries to develop a Covid test, but it squandered the advantage by failing to deliver them. The inability to ramp up testing capacity had serious knock-on effects. Scientists had no clear picture of the size of the outbreak, while prioritisation of what tests existed left many vulnerable people, including those in care homes, dangerously exposed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/01/england-covid-testing-capacity-left-care-homes-exposed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Attorney general to appear before Senate judiciary committee for a regular oversight hearing</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. The attorney general, <strong>Merrick Garland</strong>, has been at the center of some of the biggest stories in American politics over the past year, including the appointment of special counsels to investigate <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s possession of classified documents (not to mention the former president’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election), the intelligence community’s inquiry into the origins of Covid-19 and the GOP’s efforts to investigate the Biden administration. This morning at 10am eastern time, <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/02/22/2023/oversight-of-the-department-of-justice">he’ll be before the Senate judiciary committee</a> for a regular oversight hearing, where lawmakers from both parties will no doubt press him for answers on all those topics and more. Garland is tight-lipped and unlikely to say anything unguarded, but don’t be surprised if he’s also asked about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/01/fbi-dispute-trump-mar-a-lago-raid/">a Washington Post report</a> from this morning that revealed top FBI officials were hesitant to search Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort last August, despite pressure from justice department lawyers.</p><p>Here’s what else we can expect today:</p><p><strong>Biden</strong> will at 93.0am introduce <strong>Julie Su</strong> during a White House event. She is his nominee to head the labor department, and would also be his first Asian American cabinet secretary.</p><p><strong>House Democrats</strong> are holding a behind-closed-doors retreat in Baltimore, which Biden will address later today.</p><p><strong>The House </strong>will consider a Republican bill to make the White House report on the inflationary impacts of every executive order. Democrats do not appear to be whipping against this, at least not yet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/mar/01/merrick-garland-senate-committee-biden-julie-su-cpac-us-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>
