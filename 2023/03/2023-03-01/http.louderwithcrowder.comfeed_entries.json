Now, doctors are explaining to TikTokers that <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/popeyes-fight\" target=\"_blank\">potato</a> juice actually <em>can't</em> cure strep throat. Contrary to popular (?) belief. </p><p>The bizarre claim seems to have originated from Allie Casazza, a blogger and author with some 12k followers on TikTok. Casazza claimed to have cured her daughter's severe case of strep throat by giving her the juice of a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brian-stelter-wef\" target=\"_blank\">potato</a>. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cIf you've seen someone mention Strep Throat & potato \"juice\" today, this is why.\\n\\nNeedless to say, but eating a raw potato does not cure Strep, if you actually have Strep your doctor will tell you by taking a sample & immediately prescribing antibiotics\\nNot through self diagnosis\\u201d</div> \u2014 ChudsOfTikTok (@ChudsOfTikTok)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChudsOfTikTok/status/1630677793834172416\">1677618857</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Casazza began the video by explaining that strep is one of the only diseases she hasn't been able to cure naturally and had to use antibiotics. Until she discovered root vegetables. Apparently. </p><p>She then explained that she juiced a regular ol' spud and had her daughter drink it. According to Casazza, her daughter's strep, which was so bad she could barely swallow, was gone within two hours. </p><p>I've tried to find any sort of scientific basis for this claim. I'm sure you're shocked to hear I have come up empty-handed. Potatoes <em>do</em> apparently reduce inflammation, which is cool. But no, they don't cure strep. And the doctors of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bernie-sanders-tiktok-dance\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok</a> were quick to make this very clear before potato juice becomes the next health fad. </p><p>Dr. Rubin responded to a claim that potato juice is a natural anti-fungal and anti-biotic. The comment also spelled potato \"potatoe,\" which is irrelevant to the story, but did make me chuckle. </p><p>Rubin debunked the research behind the comment and explained that, while potato juice could potentially help treat a sore throat, it does not kill the strep bacteria. </p><p><br /></p><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@rubin_allergy/video/7205262141593488683\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n<section>\n<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@rubin_allergy\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@rubin_allergy\">@rubin_allergy</a>\n<p>Replying to @waitingtogo nice try, but solanimycin found in potatoes may help fight Candida albicans, which is a fungus, not a bacteria.

Which is great advice. But then he, unfortunately, went on to say Long should raise the child in an \"a-gendered fashion\". Sigh. </p><p>This guy was obviously very confused and did his best given the circumstances. But unfortunately, if Long were serious and actually did take the child to the doctor, the doctor may tell him to start transitioning his newborn nephew.

For one, <em>Family Guy</em> is up there with <em>South Park</em> where they managed to be grandfathered in when it comes to culture of canceling. You rarely hear the cartoon in the mix with the usual three: <em>Blazing Saddles</em>, <em>Tropic Thunder</em>, and <em>The Office</em>. Somewhere in Springfield, Apu is getting ready to move his family to Quohog to reopen the Kwik-E-Mart. </p><p>The other is that for everything you'd assume the usual gang of bloggers and slacktivists would attack the cartoon over, a jacked-up cop in a wheelchair doesn't register. The cartoon, at least in the past (I don't even know if it's on anymore), defecates on everything leftists care about this week when it comes <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/family-guy-media-crime\" target=\"_blank\">to race</a> and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/family-guy-stewie-period\" target=\"_blank\">genderism</a>. Outside of a non-profit somewhere upset Joe isn't voiced by a paraplegic voice actor,  he wheels away with nary an angry tweet.</p><p>An actor not in a wheelchair is done apologizing for playing a cartoon cop in a wheelchair. It isn't something he should need to apologize for, but at least he's done doing so.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!
