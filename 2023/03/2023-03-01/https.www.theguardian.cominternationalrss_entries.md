<p>When the ball dropped onto Alejandro Garnacho’s toes, there were 90 minutes played, and only one thing on the youngster’s mind. What occurred next was executed expertly: first came a touch to make space, then a look up at Alphonse Areola’s goal, followed by a sublime curled finish. Cue pandemonium, Erik ten Hag punching the air, and Alan Keegan, the stadium announcer, saying: “There will be four minutes of added time.”</p><p>This is how late Manchester United left it after Saïd Benramha had been en route to being West Ham’s hero due to a second half peach of an opener before, haplessly, Nayef Aguerd turned into his own goal for the equaliser. After Garnacho’s strike there was more, as Fred hit an added-time third,the manager’s face broke into even more glee.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/01/manchester-united-west-ham-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Australia did what was required to stay in the series with a devastating display of spin bowling, but normal service could yet resume at Indore</p><p>For a day, at least, the tables turned. To this point Australia’s tour of India had been marked for the visitors by two batting collapses under the scrutiny of spin: one when the first Test was almost gone, the next when the second Test was very much in their keeping. To <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/mar/01/india-vs-australia-live-updates-cricket-score-third-test-3rd-day-one-ind-v-aus-scorecard-international-match-latest-scores-indore-holkar-stadium">begin the third match in Indore</a>, though, with one last chance to stay in the series, the Australians found themselves able to out-India India.</p><p>A couple of early wickets, a pitch as even-tempered as post-midnight Gary Busey, and suddenly there were shivers running through the home side instead of their unfortunate guests. The first nine wickets fell to spin until a mad run-out on 109. The Australian reply also met difficulty, but reached stumps with six wickets in hand and a lead of 47 that could be worth far more than it sounds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/mar/02/india-get-taste-of-their-own-medicine-as-australia-spin-into-modest-lead">Continue reading...</a>

## The brawling Grizzlies’ bad boy arc is just the antidote to NBA blandness

<p>The NBA’s era of simmering grudges appeared to be long gone. But a thrilling young Memphis team have an issue with everyone, from opponents to fans</p><p>NBA rivalries used to be about something: an exclusive claim to hoops supremacy, intra-divisional beefs, a perceived lack of respect. But it’s been hard to keep up those grudges during an era in which players come into the league as childhood pals, move teams constantly and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/03/nba-offensive-revolution-scoring-defense">barely play defense</a> against one another. Nowadays only one team keeps the others on edge, and it’s the Memphis Grizzlies. Everybody hates them.</p><p>Their bad boy arc starts with a classic betrayal. In summer 2019 the Grizzlies were part of a three-team swap that brought Andre Iguodala to Memphis. Iguodala is the gold standard for NBA glue guys, a former finals MVP who remains valuable as an unofficial player-coach and clutch contributor despite his advanced age. But when he balked at filling that same role for a rebuilding Memphis squad and didn’t even show up to their facility, team management reportedly agreed to buy out his $17m contract or trade him to a playoff contender. Naturally, his new teammates swiftly took offense at Iguodala’s stance, beating their chests when Memphis defied expectations and passed Golden State, his former team, in the Western Conference standings. “We all had the vision,” said Memphis’ Dillon Brooks. “He didn’t, which is perfect. Send him back to the Warriors and let him do his thing over there.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/01/the-brawling-grizzlies-bad-boy-arc-is-just-the-antidote-to-nba-blandness">Continue reading...</a>
