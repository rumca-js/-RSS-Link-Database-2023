## Genshin Impact - Dehya Best Talents And Team Comps Guide

<p>Dehya is a 5-star Pyro character added as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact</a>'s version 3.5 update. While she's been part of your journey for quite some time due to her appearances in various quests, you'll now have a shot at getting her to join your roster. Of course, you might want to consider just what she brings to the table. Here's our guide to help you with the best talents and team comps for Dehya in Genshin Impact.</p><h2>Genshin Impact - Dehya's talent priorities</h2><p><strong>Elemental Burst: Leonine Bite (top priority)</strong> - Becomes resistant to interruption and unable to use all other abilities; you may only do a flurry of punches, followed by a diving attack. All of these hits deal Pyro damage, and scale off her ATK and max HP stats. Lastly, Dehya will create another Molten Inferno (elemental skill aura) at the end of this sequence. This is considered the best talent priority for Dehya in Genshin Impact, as this is where most of her DPS will come from.</p><p><strong>Elemental Skill: Molten Inferno (next priority)</strong> - Creates an area-of-effect aura, with a second charge that can be used afterward, causing a diving attack. Enemies that take damage within this field will trigger a coordinated Pyro AoE attack based on Dehya's ATK and max HP (can occur once every 2.5 seconds). Additionally, other characters within the field become resistant to interruption, and a portion of the damage they take will instead be funneled onto Dehya, who'll lose a bit of HP in their stead.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genshin-impact-dehya-best-talents-team-comps-guide/1100-6511921/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Genshin Impact - Dehya Best Artifacts Guide

<p>Dehya can become part of your team thanks to the version 3.5 update in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact</a>. If you successfully acquire her from her wish banner, you'll be able to make use of her abilities. Still, you're probably thinking of the ideal accessories for her. Here's our guide to help you with the best artifacts for Dehya in Genshin Impact.</p><h2>Genshin Impact - Best artifact set combinations for Dehya</h2><p>When talking about the best artifacts for Dehya in Genshin Impact, we have to consider the type of role you want her to have. This is primarily due to her rather unimpressive damage output. As such, you might prefer that she plays a support role instead, as opposed to pure DPS.</p><h3>Support Dehya best artifact: Tenacity of the Millelith (4-piece)</h3><ul><li>2-piece bonus: +20% HP.</li><li>4-piece bonus: When an elemental skill hits an opponent, all party members gain +20% ATK and +30% shield strength for three seconds; can be triggered even when the character isn't on the field.</li><li>Preferred stats: HP%/HP%/HP%.</li></ul><p>If you start Dehya's trial, you'll notice that she's wearing Tenacity of the Millelith. That's because of three factors. The first is that the damage of her skill and burst scale off her maximum HP. The second is that her elemental skill can proc multiple times due to a large Pyro area-of-effect (AoE) aura. And, lastly, her skill will let her soak the damage taken by another active character within that aura (i.e., she'll take damage instead).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genshin-impact-dehya-best-artifacts-guide/1100-6511923/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the first and only (so far) Nintendo Switch exclusive to cost $70. If you didn't snag a preorder prior to the price jump that kicked in after the latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-february-2023-the-biggest-games-and-announcements/1100-6511344/">Nintendo Direct</a>, you're now stuck paying $70 for a physical copy at major retailers.

If you've never purchased anything from Super Shop, you might see a popup offering 10% off your first order. These deals don't stack, so you're better off opting for promo code.</p><p>Super Shop offers free shipping and a 30-day money back guarantee. There is one notable caveat here, though. Super Shop doesn't offer release-date delivery, so you won't have your copy on May 12.

<p>Bethesda and Tango Gameworks have pushed out an update for Hi-Fi Rush that includes a brand-new photo mode for the game. It is available now.</p><p>Players are able to use filters and presets to spruce up their own photos, as well as adjust Chai's posing and facial features. Other allies can be brought into the pictures and positioned too in order to get group shots. However, only characters that have been unlocked in the story at that point can be chosen for the pictures.</p><p>It's also worth noting that if Chai is in the middle of a jump when photo mode is activated, players won't be able to adjust his pose or bring in other characters. His facial expressions can still be changed, though. Overlay frames are available too, such as classic comic book panels and dynamic action lines.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hi-fi-rushs-new-update-brings-a-photo-mode/1100-6511959/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Simpsons Hit & Run Remake: "I Would Love To See It," Designer Says

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-and-run/">The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</a> is one of the most beloved Simpsons video games of all time, and among the most highly rated based on review scores. Given the rise in remakes and re-releases of video games in recent times, some are wondering if the 2003 game might be next in line. It's too soon to say, but lead designer Joe McGinn is a fan of the idea of bringing it back.</p><p>"I would love to see it," McGinn told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/20-years-on-the-simpsons-hit-and-run-designer-reflects-on-the-enduring-legacy-of-the-beloved-gta-for-kids/">GamesRadar</a> about a potential Hit &amp; Run remake.</p><p>The game's original developer, Radical Entertainment, and publisher, Vivendi Universal Games, have both closed up shop. So any remake would seemingly have to come from a different developer and publisher. It's not immediately clear who owns the video game rights to The Simpsons franchise.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-hit-run-remake-i-would-love-to-see-it-designer-says/1100-6511958/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Early Access game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sons-of-the-forest/">Sons of the Forest</a> certainly makes no attempts to hold your hand through its open-world survival horror experience--it just drops you on this hellish isle and tells you to have fun, with only a GPS device, an objective, instructions for building a few basic structures, and your own wits (and those of your friends if you're playing co-op) to get you through.</p><p dir="ltr">But if you want to not just survive, but <em>thrive</em>, then you're gonna need a few more supplies than what you start with. And there's one cave near the beach starting location that will give you a leg up early with two very important pieces of equipment: the stun gun, and the rebreather.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to get the rebreather in Sons of the Forest</h2><p dir="ltr">There are three possible starting spots, and if you're lucky you'll be on the beach right next to the cave that contains both the rebreather and the stun gun. But even if you do start the game next to this cave, you probably aren't ready to go right in--you'll want to at least get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-early-game-weapons-in-sons-of-the-forest-and-how-to-get-them/1100-6511957/">a decent weapon</a> before heading in, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-flashlight-guide-and-location/1100-6511860/">a light source stronger than your lighter</a> would also help, because this cave is very dark.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-how-to-get-the-rebreather-and-stun-gun/1100-6511920/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Sons Of The Forest - How To Get The Shovel

<p dir="ltr">As you explore the immense cannibal-filled island in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sons-of-the-forest/">Sons of the Forest</a>, you'll probably become increasingly annoyed that you don't have a shovel. Your GPS has several dig spots marked that you've trekked out to only to discover you don't have the tool you need to get whatever you came all the way out there to get.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately for you, the shovel is not easy to get, and you'll need to get several other tools before you can even try for it, because it's hidden deep in a cave that has some prerequisites. So getting the shovel is kind of a whole thing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What you need to get before you can go after the shovel</h2><p dir="ltr">There are two accessories that you absolutely, positively must have before you can get too far in the cave with the shovel in it: the rebreather, which will let you breathe underwater, and the rope gun, which will allow you to use existing zip lines and/or make new ones. Without the rope gun, you'll barely be able to make it past the entrance, and there are multiple spots where you'll need to navigate dark underwater passageways. You'll also need an air tank for the rebreather and explosives for a situation that will occur when you're on your way back out of the cave, but those can be found inside the cave if you don't have any when you get there.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-how-to-get-the-shovel/1100-6511950/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actor Taron Egerton has taken himself out of the running as the next actor to play James Bond.

But what <em>is </em>known is that Egerton will not play the character in the inevitable next James Bond film.</p><p>"It's not me," Egerton said. He went on to say that he was "never part of the conversations," adding that he never met with the series producers, the Broccolis. He's a fan of the series, though, and plans to watch the future James Bond films with whoever takes the role next after Daniel Craig ended his run with No Time To Die.</p><p>"They've never enquired about me. I've just never been one of the guys that they're looking at. I just don't think I'm the right person for that. I think there's much, much, much better candidates for that role than me. But, you know, I'd be a very willing audience member. They're brilliant films."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/taron-egerton-says-he-will-not-play-james-bond/1100-6511954/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>One of the most vital parts of your character build in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sons-of-the-forest/">Sons of the Forest</a> are the weapons you choose to wield. These can be the difference between surviving and dying on the mysterious island that you now call home. While you will be able to unlock different weapons by simply playing through the main story and exploring the island's many secrets, this is not the most efficient way of doing things.</p><p>Instead, you want to seek out strong, early-game weapons that can get you through the grind of the first several hours in Sons of the Forest. With a powerful weapon or two, you will be able to cut through mutants like butter and also improve your resource gathering as well. However, with a variety of weapons to choose from and different locations involved with all of them, you might not know which weapons to pick early on.</p><p>Luckily, that's where we can come in. This guide will offer players several early game weapons they can easily retrieve and where to find them in Sons of the Forest. We are mainly basing this list on weapons that don't require any additional tools, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-how-to-get-the-shovel/1100-6511950/">shovel</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-how-to-get-the-rebreather-and-stun-gun/1100-6511920/">rebreather</a>, to find.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-best-early-weapons-and-how-to-get-them/1100-6511957/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Atlas Fallen, an action-RPG from Focus Entertainment (formerly known as Focus Home) and Deck13, is coming out on May 16. Based on marketing materials, Atlas Fallen seems to take cues from hack-and-slash games like Devil May Cry and God of War, and features some impressive beasts to hunt.</p><p dir="ltr">While we don't know a ton about Atlas Fallen right now, we do know it takes place in a desert environment where humans have to struggle against machines from the past, who were buried in sand as the result of some sort of storm event. It also seems that fallen gods are the main antagonists of the game. Shape-shifting weapons (perhaps similar to Bloodborne's trick weapons) and co-op play are also part of the package.</p><p dir="ltr">If you preorder Atlas Fallen, you'll receive the Ruin Rising Pack, which will give you new armor and gauntlet skins, unique essence stones and an idol. If you're interested in learning more about this upcoming action RPG, check out the above trailer from Gamescom 2022. The game's developer, Deck13, is best-known for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-surge-2-review-out-on-a-limb/1900-6417315/">The Surge</a> series, as well as the early "soulslike" Lords of the Fallen. However, Dek13 has confirmed that Atlas Fallen is not a soulslike. Atlas Fallen will release on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on May 16.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-surge-devs-action-rpg-atlas-fallen-gets-may-release-date/1100-6511949/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The actor was asked if Season 2 would begin filming this year, and after Pascal gave it some thought, he said there is definitely a chance.</p><p>"In the year 2023? What season are we in now? We're getting into spring, yes there is a chance. Yes," he quickly replied. Production of Season 1 began in 2021, with the first episode wrapping up in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-show-wraps-up-production-on-first-episode/1100-6495756/">August of that year</a>.

<p>Chris Pratt voices Mario in the upcoming The Super Mario Bros.

Casting Pratt as Mario "made total sense," Horvath said, because Pratt is known for playing the role of a regular guy who becomes a hero.</p><div>          </div><p>"He's really good at playing a blue-collar hero with a ton of heart.

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-and-season-of-defiance-guides-season-pass-gear-exotics/1100-6511885/"> Season of Defiance</a> has kicked off alongside the launch of the game's latest expansion, Lightfall, and as usual, there are plenty of new secrets to find and activities to take part in. On the seasonal front, players will be taking part in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-defiant-battlegrounds-guide/1100-6511926/">Defiant Battlegrounds</a>, a spin on the familiar activity that Destiny 2 players have experienced in past seasons, including the recent Season of the Seraph's Heist Battlegrounds. As well as some different objectives and maps, Defiant Battlegrounds have introduced a new but familiar gameplay feature called <strong>Awoken Favors</strong>, which grant buffs similar to ones you'd find in Dares of Eternity.</p><p dir="ltr">Awoken Favors come in three distinct types, which are unlockable via the War Table in the HELM. Under Favor Attunements, you can find them as the upgrades Exemplar of Justice, Exemplar of Grace, and Exemplar of Zeal. The <strong>Exemplar of Justice</strong> grants a Favor that improves your and your allies' melee recharge when you get final blows with abilities (e.g. your charged melee, grenade, or Super). The <strong>Exemplar of Grace</strong> improves your team's mobility for a short bit of time when you get final blows with weapons that use special ammo. The <strong>Exemplar of Zeal</strong> grants your team a better recharge rate on grenades when you get final blows with Heavy ammo weapons. These buffs are only available in seasonal activities, and they aren't guaranteed to drop even if you have unlocked them.</p><p dir="ltr">To get Awoken Favors to drop more consistently in seasonal activities, players will have to equip up to four pieces of the new seasonal armor, the Unyielding Favor set. <strong>Unyielding Favor armor</strong> comes with a perk called <strong>Queen's Favor</strong>, which basically makes it so that Awoken Favors drop with fewer final blows, increasing the likelihood of them dropping in activities. Additionally, the bonus stacks up to four times, so players won't need the whole set, leaving you room to still equip a piece of Exotic armor without sacrificing the maximum bonus. This is especially handy early on in the Season of Defiance quest We Stand Unbroken," where one of the steps is to collect three Awoken Favors, and it might even be helpful to make an Unyielding Favor loadout for the rest of the season.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-awoken-favors-how-to-unlock-and-use-them-in-defiant-battlegrounds/1100-6511945/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Movie-goers will soon have the chance to eat their favorite theater snack at home, as AMC is preparing to launch its own microwavable popcorn brand. The initial launch will have three flavors: lightly salted, movie theater butter, and extra butter. The popcorn will be on Walmart endcaps starting March 11 and on Walmart shelves at 2,600 locations and on Walmart's website next month.</p><p>"Real movie theatre popcorn popped and ready to enjoy for any party, tailgate, or snack occasion," AMC Theatres' website claims. "Follow our Heat &amp; Eat instructions for that authentic deliciously warm movie popcorn experience!" It should be noted that the extra butter version also comes with a pourable butter topping, allowing people to add more butter flavor to the popcorn.</p><p>AMC CEO Adam Aron wants people to know he's really excited about the launch. In fact, he went on about it and focused a large chunk of time during the theater chain's earnings call Tuesday to hype it up.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amcs-ceo-is-very-excited-about-new-popcorn/1100-6511944/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2: Lightfall - How To Deal With Tormentors

<p>A new enemy is lurking about the streets of Neomuna in Destiny 2: Lightfall, and if you're unprepared for them, you're in for a world of hurt. Tormentors are shaping up to be the deadliest soldier in the Shadow Legion, as these hulking brutes hit hard, fast, and are effective from any distance. While they aren't invincible, they can easily halt your momentum and are absolute nightmares to deal with on Legendary difficulty.</p><p>If you're having trouble with these scythe-wielding enemies, here's how you can deal with them effectively whenever you encounter them.</p><h3>How to kill Tormentors</h3><p>Like some of the more challenging bosses and enemies in Destiny 2, Tormentors are multi-phase fights. When you first run into one of them, you'll want to focus your attacks on the weak points located on their upper body. Don't bust out your abilities, explosive weapons, or Supers just yet, as for now, you'll want to focus your attacks on the Tormentor's exposed weak points with your precision weapons. Linear fusion rifles, scout rifles, and bows work well here, as you'll be able to do serious damage and stay mobile.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-how-to-deal-with-tormentors/1100-6511937/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## 7 Games To Play If You Loved Sonic Frontiers

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104248-4059489-sonic-frontiers-2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Sonic the Hedgehog is a gaming icon, known and beloved by millions of fans. The franchise has spawned legions of toys, several comic book runs, animated TV shows, and now two successful Hollywood movies. However, in his home court of video games, Sonic has had his ups and downs, to put it mildly.</p><p dir="ltr">It seems that no era of Sonic titles is fully free of controversy, as newer fans often admit that they just don't get the appeal of the older 2D games, while aging Sega kids insist that the newer entries in the series just don't have the same vigor as the Genesis classics. Regardless of where you fall on that spectrum, there are definitely a few Sonic games that are universally considered Sonic's better outings, from the dual-cartridge classic Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles to the 3D side-scroller mashup Sonic Colors. The officially licensed fan-made project Sonic Mania is also often included in these discussions, and it's my personal favorite game in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">At this early juncture, it's unclear if the recent Sonic Frontiers has broken into this rarefied air, and only time will tell if it will continue to grow in esteem. However, despite its technical issues, fans have heralded it as a bold new direction for the series, and a sign that Sonic Team is looking to innovate once again. If you've already played all the best Sonic games, the good news is that there's plenty of Sonic-like platformers to enjoy on the market these days. Here are some of our favorite games like Sonic the Hedgehog--that aren't Sonic the Hedgehog.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Spark The Electric Jester 3</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104249-spark.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Spark The Electric Jester might sound like the sort of name that a Sonic name generator would spit out, but no, he's a real character with his own fairly successful series of indie games. Though the Spark games have enjoyed limited name recognition outside of Sonic fan circles, 3 might be the best take on 3D Sonic-style gameplay ever, with plenty of rail-grinding, wall-running, and loop-de-loops for you to sink your teeth into. If you're looking for a game in the style of Sonic and Shadow's levels from Sonic Adventure 2--or the several "Boost Sonic" games that followed--Spark is definitely worth a look. It also has a vibrant speedrunning community, for what that's worth.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pizza Tower</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104250-pizzatower.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The newest game on this list, Pizza Tower came out in early 2023 after a lengthy development cycle, and it's already made quite an impression on the indie scene. Inspired by the cult Wario Land series, Pizza Tower features an art-style that looks right out of '90s Nickelodeon, with exaggerated figures and many wacky animations. Its gameplay is a unique hybrid formula that combines elements of score attack games, the exploration and puzzle-solving of the Wario games, and movement techniques designed to introduce players to speedrunning. It's one of the highest-rated games on this list by Steam user score, so if you're at all interested, it's definitely worth a shot.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ori and the Blind Forest / Ori and the Will of the Wisps</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104251-ori.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>If you play video games, you've probably heard of the two Ori games by now--and for good reason. By any standard, they're two of the most visually stunning games ever made, and they're well-known for their well-balanced gameplay, too. Though the Ori games are technically metroidvanias that revolve more around careful exploration and pinpoint platforming than the best Sonic games, they strike a similar chord in terms of art style, control, and overall quality. Just don't forget the tissues--these games can be pretty moving, too.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Panic Porcupine</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104252-panicporcupine.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Arguably the most obscure game on this list, Panic Porcupine is a challenging platformer in the vein of Super Meat Boy and Celeste. Described as a "hedge-like" by developer Spicy Gyro Games, the game combines the physics of the original Sonic games with the trial-and-error approach of "masocore" platformers like the Meat Boy series. These sorts of games are a love-it-or-hate-it proposition, but Panic Porcupine is such a silly parody of Sonic that it might be worth a look for even those who aren't fans of the genre. It's also only $8 and often on sale for less, so what's the worst that could happen?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ristar</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104253-ristar.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Yet another name that hardcore Sonic fans are familiar with, Ristar is a classic platformer that came out late in the lifespan of the Sega Genesis. Originally envisioned as a possible mascot for the system, Ristar has appeared in many Sonic-themed compilations over the years, and several members of Sonic Team worked on the game. Ristar lacks the Blue Blur's speed and style, but his stretchy arms can propel him all around the stage, and the levels have the same multi-layered design of classic Sonic stages. If you can handle a few retro gaming bugbears--limited lives and continues--Ristar is one of the best Sonic-like platformers out there.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kaze and the Wild Masks</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104254-kaze.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Kaze and the Wild Masks is an indie platformer that draws heavily from Rare's Donkey Kong Country series. However, though it wears its influence on its sleeve--down to player-character Kaze's hover ability, which is taken directly from Dixie Kong--the game is well-made enough to get away with it. The first two hours are a bit slow, but once you get into the tougher worlds, its level and puzzle design really shine through. If you're a Sonic fan willing to give a chance to a game inspired by a different classic platformer franchise, this is definitely one to try.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Freedom Planet 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104255-freedomplanet2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The first Freedom Planet began life as a Sonic fan-game, and it's not hard to see why. Though the first game played like an excellent take on the Sonic formula, Freedom Planet 2 takes the blast processing to new heights, with huge levels, a large number of playable characters with their own moves and gimmicks, and some of the best music you'll hear in any indie game. If you have even a tiny grain of love for the Sonic games--and even if you prefer the 3D ones--Freedom Planet 2 is an absolute must-play.</p></h3></p><br />

Defiant Battlegrounds are a mix of ideas that have been present in Destiny 2 for several seasons, combining the thrill of taking on a Cabal army with the intrigue of traversing the Ascendant Realm and encountering the Taken that inhabit it. Narratively, Defiant Battlegrounds is a three-player matchmade activity in which fireteams take the fight directly to Calus and his Shadow Legion, rescue prisoners of war, and weaken the forces of the Witness in the process.</p><p>The difference here is that this Battleground has a few extra steps to its design, as you won't just be shooting your way through corridors of Cabal troops. Extra challenges lie ahead, but once you know the rhythm for this activity, you'll be able to quickly grind through it so that you can earn the coveted rewards at the end.</p><p>Defiant Battlegrounds can be launched from two sources currently. You can start the activity by selecting it on the EDZ map, and if you're up for a more difficult fight, you can jump into the more challenging version from the playlist found in the HELM map screen. You can also check in at the HELM war table for bounties, some of which can only be completed in Defiant Battlegrounds.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-defiant-battlegrounds-guide/1100-6511926/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Gotham Knights Review - A Fun And Promising DC Universe Show With Bad Timing

<p dir="ltr">In another time, or on another network, Gotham Knights could have been a very successful new addition to DC TV. The new CW drama offers a fresh, CW-ized take on TV Batman, minus the bat himself, that combines the mythology people know with an alt-universe version of that mythology that most casual viewers probably don't. The end result, based on the six episodes made available by the CW, is a show with a lot of information that needs to be dispatched quickly--including the murder of Batman--at a time when the network it's on seems to be closing the door on DC superheroes. And that's disappointing, because once you're done trudging through all of the exposition, Gotham Knights is a fun ride.</p><p dir="ltr">In this story, Batman was murdered with the same gun used to kill his parents, and a gang of three plucky teen criminals--led by Duela (Olivia Rose Keegan), daughter of the Joker--have been framed for the crime, though they claim they were only hired to steal the gun. The money they were paid traces back to none other than Bruce Wayne's adopted son, Turner Hayes (Oscar Morgan), who didn't put out a hit on the dad he didn't even know was Batman. Wayne family friend Harvey Dent (Misha Collins) has a political career that depends on catching Batman's killer, so Turner goes underground as a fugitive with Duela and her sibling friends Harper (Fallon Smythe) and Cullen (Tyler DiChiara).</p><p dir="ltr">The gang are helped by hacker (and daughter of Cluemaster) Stephanie (Anna Lore) and Batman protege Carrie "Robin" Kelley (Navia Robinson). While the teens, lacking any of Batman's money or tech, carry out various heists to try to figure out who is actually responsible, a mysterious, evil secret society called the Court of Owls operates in the shadows.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gotham-knights-review-a-fun-and-promising-dc-universe-show-with-bad-timing/1900-6418039/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Cara Dune was essentially a main character on The Mandalorian during Seasons 1 and 2, but the actress, former MMA star Gina Carano, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gina-carano-was-fired-for-being-a-bad-employee-not-her-politics/1100-6487566/">kicked off the show</a> over her inability to stop tweeting--the final straw came when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mandalorians-gina-carano-faces-backlash-over-social-media-posts-again/1100-6487390/">she compared people disagreeing with her false conservative conspiracy theories to being persecuted by Nazi Germany</a>. The role wasn't re-cast--that character is just not around anymore. And now the Season 3 premiere of The Mandalorian has given us the details on how the writers ended up dumping her in-universe.</p><p><b>Be warned that this article contains spoilers for the Season 3 premiere of the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian.</b></p><p>The character of Cara Dune, as you may recall, was a former member of the Rebellion who became a mercenary. But her adventures with our titular Mandalorian got her name out there once more, and after Season 1, she became both the marshal of Nevarro and a ranger of the New Republic. The last time we saw her was when Luke Skywalker invaded Moff Gideon's ship to save Grogu while she, Mando, and the rest of their merry band were also in the middle of doing the exact same thing. Baby Grogu left with Luke; Mando, Cara, and company had Moff Gideon in custody; the credits ran; and that was the end of Cara Dune on The Mandalorian.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-the-mandalorian-season-3-wrote-gina-carano-off-the-show/1100-6511928/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
