I do, especially if you have kids or less experienced players around. Simply watching them play this game can be a joy, but Return to Dream Land of course, does let you join in as well. It\u2019s a well designed game that represents the series at the peak of its powers, and I think longtime series fans are going to find a lot to love here, especially if they haven\u2019t played this title before. \n\nIf you don\u2019t fall in those categories, you might play through this and wonder what all the fuss was about, since on the critical path, for an experienced player, the whole thing can be done in just a few hours - but then again, that\u2019s really not how it\u2019s meant to be played, is it?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5n6yxqdYUE", "date_published": "2023-03-01 22:30:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Sons of the Forest Early Access Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "All things considered, Sons of the Forest is an immediate success, and the game is not even complete yet. More content and gameplay improvements will no doubt be made over the course of its stint in Early Access, which means it will probably get better over time. Endnight clearly took the things they learned from their time developing The Forest and used them to make the definitive version of the game they set out to make almost a decade ago. \n\nThe crazy thing is, Sons of the Forest is priced as a budget title, at less than half of what a standard Triple-A game would cost you now. That kind of value is rare these days, and Sons of the Forest is absolutely worth your time.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPVWkb344jo", "date_published": "2023-03-01 18:30:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "10 Most DIFFICULT Third Person Shooters That Will Test Your Skills", "description": "Games that put up a fight aren't everyone's cup of tea, but there's a strange allure to these experiences that appeals massively to no few people. Sure, not every game that tries to go down that route is able to do it well \u2013 getting the balance right when it comes to difficulty is easier said than done, as more than a few games have proven over time \u2013 but even when certain hurdles feel like frustratingly impassible roadblocks, we can't help but keep banging our heads against them. \n\nHere, we're going to take a look at a few third person shooters that delivered challenging experiences of that variety- some in ways that were fair and well balanced, and others... well, not so much.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1pNfDdsDAE", "date_published": "2023-03-01 16:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Final Fantasy 16 - 10 NEW Things You Need To Know Before You PRE-ORDER", "description": "Thanks to a recent round of hands-on previews by a number of media outlets, a bevy of new details have emerged on\u00a0Square Enix's\u00a0Final Fantasy 16,\u00a0one of the most hotly anticipated games of the year. \n\nWith the hype and excitement surrounding the RPG continuing to gather momentum in the lead up to its launch in a few months' time in June, here, we'll be going over a few key new details that you should know about.\n\nAround 45 seconds of footage was used from Gematsu Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@gematsu", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-Wlcmi5vp0", "date_published": "2023-03-01 13:00:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
