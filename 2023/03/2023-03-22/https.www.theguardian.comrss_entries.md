<p>A gameshow, travel show and reality show all in one, this series is a messy celebration of human foibles, resilience, diversity and generosity. It will break your heart and cheer your soul</p><p>In a forest on the west coast of Canada, two middle-aged British women are lost. Off they trot, straining under the weight of their heavy backpacks, only to come back the same way later on, past the same magnificent trees to try another route. Unmistakably, this is the return of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0f5x5dt">Race Across the World</a>.</p><p>Partly a nod to Jules Verne but mainly inspired by the urgent need for humankind to stop flying, Race Across the World sets a simple challenge. Travelling in pairs, contestants must complete an epic trip as quickly as possible, stopping at checkpoints along the way. It was London to Singapore in season one; Mexico City to Ushuaia, Argentina, in season two; and in this new, third run, the whole race takes place in Canada, zigzagging from Vancouver to St John’s. Teams are given money that would have covered the air fare, but they can’t do any of the trip by plane and they can’t access the internet to get tips on making the journey, which means they often have no idea how to proceed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/22/race-across-the-world-series-three-review-one-of-the-greatest-reality-shows-gets-its-best-cast-ever">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Convict ignored his well-paid legal team to mount a defence blind to logic</p><p>It wasn’t quite the Old Bailey. But it wasn’t far off. A former prime minister on trial for what was left of his reputation. A guilty verdict from the privileges committee and a suspension from parliament could effectively end Boris Johnson’s political career. Even if it didn’t take the nuclear option of a 10-day sentence that would trigger a recall petition. His legs would be cut off: no need then to shoot him as well.</p><p>He would leave the stage unmourned. The prime minister who blew an 80 seat majority and an almost guaranteed three terms in office. Now sent to roam the world as a washed-up end of the pier entertainer, giving the same over-priced speech to people he doesn’t care about and will never see again. A pointless existence for a narcissist hooked on constant attention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/22/impervious-to-advice-or-rules-johnson-held-up-the-shield-of-stupidity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spain wing-back on his tumultuous start to life at Spurs, <em>that</em> Conte outburst and what would happen if he was let loose in a prison</p><p>So this is awkward. It’s a beautiful day at Las Rozas, 25km north-west of Madrid, and Pedro Porro is sitting in the sunshine, happy to be back in the Spain squad among old friends, when <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/18/this-is-unacceptable-antonio-conte-furious-after-southampton-drama" title="">that</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/18/this-is-unacceptable-antonio-conte-furious-after-southampton-drama" title=""> rant is raised</a>. “Well, that’s his thing,” the Tottenham wing-back starts saying, not sure what to say about the moment his own manager tore into the team he has just joined, when he says: “The first thing is, what you’re talking about: I hadn’t heard it until now.” Wait, really? You mean you don’t know what Antonio Conte said? “Yes.”</p><p>Oh. And so the first time Porro hears about Conte’s attack on Spurs is here, reported back to him second-hand and 1,000km away. He listens to how after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/18/southampton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report" title="">Saturday’s 3-3 draw with Southampton</a>, a game in which Porro scored and one he has just brought up as a sign that things are getting better, his coach claimed they couldn’t be much worse. He hears how Conte criticised the club’s culture, accusing his players of being 11 individuals not a team. And he is told that the manager declared failure “the story of Tottenham”. Talk about ruining the moment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/22/tottenham-pedro-porro-tim-sherwood-wont-be-the-first-to-have-had-to-shut-his-mouth">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Shelagh Young, Gideon and Margaret Ben-Tovim </strong>and<strong> Dr David Drew</strong> respond to Nesrine Malik’s article about the failure of progressives to stand up firmly to racism</p><p>Nesrine Malik rightly places the Gary Lineker affair in the context of a wider attack on human rights in the UK (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/20/gary-lineker-culture-war-government-cruelty-migrants-rights" title="">The Gary Lineker affair was a warning: the culture war will come for us all in the end, 20 March</a>). Her fears seem wholly justified to me. There has been significant undermining of the right to speak out, and the obsession with immigration is stirring up hatred and fear. However, is it possible that her diagnosis of “listlessness among progressives” should be refined? The disease appears to afflict mainly those on the left seeking political office rather than the wider group of progressive people across society.</p><p>This is frightening and depressing in itself. But I am concerned that Malik risks undermining rather than invigorating a movement against the rise of racist, toxic populism. It is my belief that we need to emphasise the difference between progressives on the street and, for example, those Labour politicians who made shameful efforts to disagree with Lineker’s words while defending his right to say them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/22/why-cant-the-left-speak-out-like-gary-lineker">Continue reading...</a>

Until this month, the date was considered a done deal, and constitutes a vital pillar of the EU’s strategy to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

<p>China’s leader knows full well his country cannot pay the price – economic or political – of openly challenging the west</p><p>The three-day visit of Xi Jinping to Russia was packed with action: a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/putin-xi-talks-moscow-japanese-pm-to-ukraine">crepe and quail meal</a>, photo ops and ceremonial signings. Pomp and circumstance aside, Xi’s visit to Russia did not live up to Putin’s hopes and expectations. As it turns out, the obvious similarities between the two leaders – their autocratic hold on power and their tenuous relationship with the west – do not directly translate into common interests and goals. Xi came and went, making <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/putins-two-day-charm-offensive-with-xi-underlines-whos-boss">no firm commitments</a> and leaving Putin and his cronies agape with disappointment.</p><p>Russian hopes for this visit could not have been any higher. Russia looks to China, the only major power that has not condemned the invasion of Ukraine, as its economic bondsman, a potential weapons supplier and a “peace” advocate. From the first days of the invasion, Russian intellectuals and <a href="https://eng.globalaffairs.ru/">opinion leaders</a> have prominently featured China as a key player that would help Russia win the war. China would jump in to substitute the lost western exports, provide Russia with much needed military <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/19/china-may-be-on-brink-of-supplying-arms-to-russia-says-blinken">equipment and supplies</a>, and help negotiate peace on Russia’s terms.

The exhibition explores the many narratives of debt, namely those generated and enforced through stolen land and themarch of capitalism.</p><p>On entering the gallery we are met with Cian Dayrit’s powerful tapestries hung on the imperial green walls. These works are made in collaboration with people from marginalised communities in the Philippines, which is also the artist’s home. In one, Tree of Life in the State of Decay and Rebirth (a collaboration with Henry Caceres), a stitched diagram of the feudal systems imposed on land workers is woven into the form of a tree. The tree stretches up from six roots, each labelled with a violent power such as imperialism and capitalism. The spiky, jagged branches break off and multiply, containing the abundant conditions of their making: cheap labour, militarisation, ethnocide. The background is dotted with crosshairs, like blossoms falling from a tree.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/22/the-accursed-share-colonial-era-debt-bomb-plant-pots">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a tall specimen that’s already starting to unleash its ravishing red blooms. “Just like human hearts!” they exclaim, adding that the friend who first showed them this tree’s flowers has just died. “It’s amazing,” says George, “that on the day we thought, ‘Let’s take a photograph to send him’, we should hear that he died.”</p><p>George Passmore is 81 and his husband Gilbert Prousch is nearly 80. The pair have been working as a piece of living art, a single artistic entity, since the 1960s and are intensely aware of how many people they’ve outlived. “They’ve all gone,” says George. “Duncan’s gone, Warhol’s gone.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/22/warhol-rauschenberg-gilbert-and-george-preserve-greatest-moments-centre">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Authors from Jane Mayer to Michael Lewis show that malfeasance from government and private enterprise is by no means just a foreign affair </p><p>Corruption offers rich pickings for writers. It’s something that fascinates us and, if we’re honest, we worry could seduce us. Often, what keeps corruption contained is a lack of opportunity and the fact the risks outweigh the rewards – although sometimes the risk-takers are those eschewing corruption.</p><p>We British have always had a slightly superior attitude to corruption, seeing it as something endemic in other countries. We had the odd instance, such as the John Poulson scandal of the early 70s, which brought down some politicians, including the then home secretary; and the “sleaze” surrounding John Major’s government in the 90s included actual “brown envelopes”. But on the whole, we consoled ourselves that these were outliers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/22/top-10-books-about-corruption-david-beckler-a-stolen-memory">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two dembow progenitors are suing superstars including Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee – in a case that also names Justin Bieber – claiming that they deserve credit for birthing the genre</p><p>With the release of their song Fish Market in 1989, the Jamaican duo Cleveland “Clevie” Browne and Wycliffe “Steely” Johnson inadvertently changed the course of pop music. The track featured the first known example of what would come to be known as a “dembow” rhythm – the percussive, slightly syncopated four-to-the-floor beat that travelled from reggae to become the signature beat of reggaeton, today the world-conquering sound of Latin American pop.</p><p>Now, more than 30 years after Fish Market was released, Steely &amp; Clevie Productions is suing three of reggaeton’s most celebrated hitmakers – El Chombo, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee – for what they characterise as unlawful interpolation of Fish Market’s rhythm (or “riddim”), and are seeking the credit – and royalties – they say they deserved from the start.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/22/can-you-copyright-a-rhythm-inside-the-reggaeton-lawsuit-that-could-shake-the-pop-world">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I photographed opera-goers in Paris over several months. The pictures were technically fine – but I wanted them to feel timeless. So I restaged them in Melbourne with models’</p><p>Many years ago I had a wonderful art dealer in Paris. At some point in the late 80s, the Garnier Opéra and Opéra Comique approached my gallery to invite me to collaborate with them. They had a tradition of commissioning visual artists – Richard Serra was also working on a production.<br /><br />I realised that what would interest me most would be to photograph the audience. It fascinates me how people are part of a tightly packed group yet at the same time alone, a single face in the crowd. And how, from soccer matches to the Nuremberg rallies, as part of a crowd people derive a sense of great power. But it is only borrowed – it belongs to the crowd and must be returned.</p><p>Within an opera audience there is a very special feeling. You are part of a large group of people all gathered in the darkness, awaiting and then experiencing the same special event, and yet each person is in an individual, meditative, self-absorbed state. I loved that inherent contradiction. It’s what you see if you watch people looking at, say, Rembrandt portraits, in an art gallery. There’s a kind of magic in seeing someone transported.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/22/anti-portrait-opera-goer-paris-melbourne-bill-hensons-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

## Britain’s art institutions face death by a thousand cuts. Why are they just putting up with it? | Charlotte Higgins

<p>Life-changing organisations are left bloodied and bowed – and all to save sums that are dwarfed by bailouts to other sectors</p><p>In the 1960s, two American psychologists coined the phrase “<a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/learned-helplessness">learned helplessness</a>”. It was a hypothesis derived from experiments that showed if you repeatedly gave an animal an electric shock from which there was no means of escape, the unfortunate creature would simply lie there and whimper – even if you later changed the parameters, and gave it a shock it could evade. The effect was also discernible in humans. “Like the dog, cat, rat, and fish, when a human being is faced with noxious events that it cannot control, its motivation to respond seems to be reduced,” they wrote.</p><p>The learned helplessness hypothesis comes to mind when I consider what is happening to the arts, particularly classical music, in England. Those who should know better at the supposedly politically independent Arts Council England (ACE) have come to consider it tolerable, even desirable, for organisations such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/09/english-national-operas-funding-to-be-cut-to-zero-unless-it-moves-from-london">English National Opera</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/nov/14/thrilled-relieved-perplexed-three-arts-council-funding-verdicts">Britten Sinfonia</a> – both leaders in their field – to have their regular funding withdrawn, their business models upended and their survival put in jeopardy because of the Conservatives’ levelling-up agenda.</p><p>Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writer</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/22/britain-arts-institutions-cuts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From recognising The Traitors as genuinely fresh television to honouring legends – and making Nadine Dorries look daft – here’s a deep dive into this year’s nominees</p><p>Many broadcasters privately express fears of format exhaustion: that everything has been tried, dooming them to revive ever more old shows.

The Traitors competes with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/09/freddie-flintoff-from-ashes-hero-to-crickets-class-warrior">Freddie Flintoff’s Field of Dreams</a>, a brilliant exercise in tackling social disadvantage through sport, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/23/we-are-black-and-british-review-the-most-intelligent-reality-tv-show-in-recent-memory">BBC Two’s We Are Black and British</a>, a dinner-party format crossed with Question Time.

Although the crowd at LoanDepot Park seemed evenly split between Japanese and American factions, with frequent music and (a sincerely exhausting amount of) jumping up and down, it was the Japanese fans’ energy which electrified the stands for much of the game.</p><p>Most tellingly, during the player introductions before the game, it was Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani, rather than any of the American players, who received (by far) the loudest cheer. Perhaps this shouldn’t be surprising – Ohtani’s ability to draw a crowd is unquestionable at this point. For example, when asked what prompted them to attended Tuesday’s game despite not often attending baseball games back home, Shoko Mitomi and Kyoji Kimura of Okinawa were to the point: “We wanted to see Ohtani.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/22/shohei-ohtani-japan-world-baseball-classic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>By infiltrating Securitas, Disneyland and Deloitte – where she spent days just riding the lifts – Pilvi Takala’s art thrives on creating toe-curlingly awkward situations</p><p>What to do if a new colleague is over touchy feely when they greet you in the office? Or if a trainee sits staring into space all day doing “brain work”? Finnish artist Pilvi Takala specialises in orchestrating such awkward situations, in a mission to test how we navigate social conventions. “I think discomfort is a very productive space,” she says when we speak on Zoom before a show of her video installations, aptly titled On Discomfort. “It’s where we reassess and negotiate norms.”</p><p>Wearing a disguise and an assumed identity, Takala has upset the workings of theme parks, corporations, shopping malls and even the European parliament, exposing the tacit rules that govern our capitalist system. The videos of her in action are often funny. In Real Snow White, she tries and fails to get into Disneyland Paris dressed as the cartoon character. A guard says: “You cannot go to the park like this because the children will think you are Snow White. There’s a real Snow White in the park.” Takala replies: “I thought the real Snow White was a drawing.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/22/these-people-dont-like-what-im-doing-now-great-finnish-artist-pilvi-takala-on-breaking-social-norms">Continue reading...</a>

It all seems completely natural to her.</p><p>For several years Brown has worked with Tom Dale, a choreographer who makes dance that is steeped in technology, digital culture and electronic music. <a href="https://vimeo.com/805928787/1a516edd31?embedded=true&amp;source=video_title&amp;owner=3001600">Surge</a>, which opens this double bill, is a solo where Brown not only dances but sings live.

<p>I should have cared less about my appearance and understood that my life, with all its messiness, was worth recording</p><p>I used to think that I shouldn’t have regrets – that if I lived life right, I’d always feel great about my choices. It was partly a sign of the times I grew up in, when the phrase “no regrets” was tattooed on countless bodies and when, in 1998, Robbie Williams sang about how “they don’t work”. But, over the years, I’ve come to understand that even a rich, fulfilled life has moments when we wish we’d done things differently.</p><p>My list of regrets includes wishing I’d let myself be photographed more during my younger years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/22/my-biggest-regret-why-did-i-avoid-the-camera-so-much-when-i-was-young">Continue reading...</a>

## Poverty, By America by Matthew Desmond review – how the rich keep the poor down

<p>A Pulitzer-winning sociologist argues that the United States’s gross inequality is no accident</p><p>It’s no wonder Americans have failed to eliminate poverty, sociologist Matthew Desmond maintains in his new book. He believes the better-off are fighting a class war, keeping the poor down by design. Even if he shies away from some of the consequences of his explosive claim, his arguments have the potential to push debate about wealth in America to a new level.</p><p>Having won a coveted MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant in 2015, Desmond is known for his absorbing previous book on <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/evicted-9780141983318" title="">eviction practices in housing</a>, which netted him a Pulitzer prize in 2017. He starts his ambitious new study by demonstrating how enduring American poverty is. The <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/" title="">current poverty line</a> is represented by an income of $13,590 a year for an individual and $27,750 for a family of four. The number of Americans below it has hovered between 10% and 15% for decades, with calls and plans for reform amounting to “50 years of nothing”. The only exception was the brief period of pandemic relief, which drove poverty down “tremendously” – for children, by more than 50%. But things are now returning to form. The Democrats ended much emergency relief last autumn and cut new entitlements for the worst-off from an Inflation Reduction Act that privileged green capitalism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/22/poverty-by-america-by-matthew-desmond-review-how-the-rich-keep-the-poor-down">Continue reading...</a>

## A Good Person review – Zach Braff’s tale of self-healing is excruciatingly ersatz

<p>Writer/director Braff takes Florence Pugh’s ‘good person who has done a bad thing’ on an contrived journey towards self-forgiveness</p><p>In his dual capacity as writer and director, Zach Braff here puts us through an ordeal of excruciating contrived nonsense: a masturbatory Calvary of ersatz empathy and emotional wellness. The film goes on a long, long indie-acoustic healing journey towards indie-acoustic self-forgiveness after Florence Pugh’s Allison accidentally kills her fiance’s sister and husband while driving them in her car, having taken her eyes off the road to look at her phone.</p><p>Allison breaks up with her fiance, spirals into OxyContin addiction and alcoholism and then finds herself at 12-step meetings with her fiance’s grieving old dad and AA veteran Daniel, played by Morgan Freeman, who with heartsinking inevitability delivers a sonorous voiceover of cute wisdom over the opening scene. Daniel spends a lot of time tinkering with his model railway and its hand-painted tiny human figures, a controllable mini-universe where there is no pain, you see.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/22/a-good-person-review-zach-braff-florence-pugh">Continue reading...</a>

## Waco: American Apocalypse review – gunfights, dying FBI agents … and zero analysis

<p>This three-part Netflix documentary tells the tale of the infamous 51-day siege pitting the FBI against a self-proclaimed messiah. Sadly, it settles for spectacle over insight</p><p>If it’s Tuesday, as the saying almost goes, it must be another Netflix true crime documentary. And if it’s a Tuesday coming up to the 30th anniversary of the most infamous massacre on US soil in modern times, it must be the three-part series Waco: American Apocalypse.</p><p>Much of it plays like an edited highlights reel. The 51-day siege between the FBI and the Branch Davidian religious sect, led by self-proclaimed messiah David Koresh at the Mount Carmel compound just outside Waco in 1993, was recorded by the local news crew from the moment law enforcement started to gather to the moment the last embers cooled after the final conflagration nearly two months later. Texas-raised director Tiller Russell had masses of contemporary footage to choose from so we get to relive all the “best” bits. The opening gunfight, dead and dying agents filmed on rooftops, the injured being loaded on to the bonnets of vehicles and driven urgently away with their comrades holding on to them, voice recordings of the wounded asking to be rescued, the self-made videos of Koresh after being wounded himself and showing the bullet holes in his side to the waiting world. Tweny-four-hour cable news was then in its infancy and this was its baptism of fire. Perhaps the irony would have appealed to Koresh.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/22/waco-american-apocalypse-review-netflix">Continue reading...</a>

## Dr No by Percival Everett review – serious comedy

<p>A maths professor meets a would-be Bond villain in a metaphysical caper through race and history from the author of The Trees</p><p>“I recall that I am extremely forgetful,” announces the narrator of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/12/percival-everett-id-love-to-write-a-novel-everyone-hated" title="">Percival Everett</a>’s Dr No<em> </em>in the novel’s opening lines. “I believe I am. I think I know that I am forgetful. Though I remember having forgotten, I cannot recall what it was that I forgot or what forgetting feels like.” No sooner has the reader crossed the threshold of the narrative than it begins to reveal itself as a labyrinth of mirrors, an elaborate and joyously rickety construction of philosophical gags and structural paradoxes. The novel, Everett’s 23rd, follows last year’s Booker shortlisting of 2021’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/31/the-trees-by-percival-everett-review-potent-satire-of-us-racism" title="">The Trees</a> and is a kind of metaphysical caper. The narrator, Wala Kitu, is a professor of mathematics at Brown University, whose area of expertise is nothing. Which is to say that his entire academic career has been devoted to the study and explication of complete absence. Even his name means nothing: Wala is Tagalog for “nothing”, while Kitu is Swahili for the same thing – or non-thing. (His real name, he reveals early on, is Ralph Townsend – an admission that will lead readers familiar with Everett’s earlier work to recognise the now thirtysomething mathematician as the ingenious polymathic toddler at the centre of the 1999 post-structuralist satire Glyph.)</p><p>It’s hard to think of any American fiction writer since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/thomaspynchon" title="">Thomas Pynchon</a> who is as committed to excavating a novel’s themes through cerebral jokes. Everett derives near-infinite eggheaded wordplay from the linguistic absurdity of nothing as a subject. “I just received a grant that I hope leads to nothing,” Kitu tells a fellow professor at one point; elsewhere, contemplating his failure, despite years of study, to capture the white whale of nothingness, he says: “I work very hard and wish I could say that I have nothing to show for it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/22/dr-no-by-percival-everett-review-serious-comedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Middle-class incomers to a remote village in Spain’s ‘wild west’ expose fear, resentment and nationalism in Rodrigo Sorogoyen’s disturbing true-crime drama</p><p>Here is a fierce, bitter tale with a flinty sharpness: partly a social-realist drama of class and xenophobia, and partly a rural noir horror, a Euro-arthouse twist on Straw Dogs or Deliverance. It’s inspired by the true story from 2010 of a middle-class hippy idealist Dutch couple who attempted to settle in the Spanish village of Santoalla in Galicia’s remote “wild west” and fell out badly with their neighbours over their gentrification plans: <a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/19/inenglish/1529398583_385246.html">a row that escalated into a nightmare</a>. It has in fact already been the subject of a documentary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santoalla">Andrew Becker and Daniel Mehrer’s Santoalla</a>, and has now been fictionalised by film-maker Rodrigo Sorogoyen.</p><p>Denis Ménochet and Marina Foïs play Antoine and Olga, an educated French couple who have moved into the area with big plans to revitalise and modernise its farming techniques. But this film doesn’t give us the gradual deterioration of their relations with the neighbours. As the story begins, they have already infuriated these people irretrievably by vetoing a communal plan to sell out to a wind-turbine company (an issue interestingly also aired in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/03/alcarras-review-heartbreak-and-ruin-in-the-catalan-heat">Carla Simon’s film Alcarràs</a>). It was a one-off chance for easy money that local people wanted to grab, tiring of a lifetime of farming toil and angered by these high-handed foreigners airily telling them they’ve been doing it wrong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/22/the-beasts-review-unsettling-rural-noir-is-a-euro-arthouse-twist-on-straw-dogs">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Updates from the ODI series finale at Chidambaram Stadium</li><li>Any thoughts? Feel free to get in touch with an <a href="mailto:angus.fontaine.casual@theguardian.com">email</a></li></ul><p><strong>4th over: Australia 28-0 (Head 4, Marsh 23) </strong>Siraj gets Head hopping! They run a leg-bye but there’s bite in this wicket and both batters have fallen afoul of balls that have jagged in and beaten them on a stump line. The power of Marsh is on show on the next delivery as he blocks Siraj to mid on but strikes it so sweetly it flies along the carpet to the rope for another FOUR. There’s an appeal on the fifth ball and to Siraj it looked very close. His screams fall on deaf ears as captain Rohit Sharma doesn’t review. Replays show it maybe flying over. Marsh celebrates by belting a full ball on off stump down the ground for another FOUR. Marsh has 23 from 15 with four fours and a six. Clearly not in a running mood.</p><p><strong>3rd over: Australia 19-0 (Head 4, Marsh 15) </strong>Hot start from Australia! Now it will be Shami to Marsh for the first time. He is coming over the wicket to the right-hander and there’s some nip in this pitch as Marsh is beaten on the inside line. Pinned down for two balls, he unleashes at the third for SIX! That was sweet half volley and Marsh didn’t hesitate to cash-in. A slower ball – 124kph down from 141kph – foils another heave. And Shami repeats the dose on the last ball, bringing the ball back to beat bat and pad and send it flying through the gate. Good comeback by the veteran seamer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/mar/22/india-vs-australia-cricket-live-updates-score-third-one-day-international-50-over-odi-latest-scores-ind-v-aus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Following an increase in interest rates, new startups, old tech companies and SVB are facing hard times</p><p>Tech companies and their bank of choice are in crisis: there have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/06/amazon-apple-tesla-elon-musk-job-cuts-tech-sector">widespread layoffs</a>, and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/21/bankers-collapse-svb-credit-suisse">recently collapsed</a>. So what went wrong?</p><p>Let’s start with tech companies. There are at least two types: “new tech” and “old tech”. The new-tech companies are usually small and dynamic, and their funding mix is predominantly made up of private capital (typically venture capital or angel investors). Conversely, old-tech companies have a more interesting mix of equity and debt to fund their activity – and therefore a more complex relationship with financial markets and institutions. This is partially down to the different levels of risk of the two asset classes, which also drives their different accessibility to retail investors.</p><p>Maurizio Fiaschetti is a lecturer in banking and finance</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/22/money-technology-sector-interest-rates-startups-svb">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dr Leah Torres has endured the ire of the anti-abortion movement without backing down – but now she faces her most daunting challenge</p><p>Dr Leah Torres doesn’t tell people what she does when she meets them, which makes it hard to make friends. She removes her name from every piece of trash before she puts it out for recycling, in case people walking past see her name and find out where she lives. If a package addressed to her arrives on her porch, she calls everyone she knows to identify who sent it before she opens it – it could be a bomb.</p><p>Once, coming back from work in the piercing August Alabama sun, she noticed a gray sedan parked in her driveway. Instinctively, she fled to a neighbor’s house – she barely knew him – but asked if he could walk her home anyway. The car turned out to be a stranger’s; the driver had just pulled over to send a text message. “Still, you never know,” says Torres,<strong> </strong>her big, almond-shaped eyes conveying concern.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/22/alabama-last-abortion-doctor-leah-torres">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She is far more matter-of-fact and open about sex than I am. I know this is my problem, not hers, but I am now troubled by intrusive thoughts</p><p><strong>I’m in my mid-40</strong><strong>s and have been married for </strong><strong>more than a decade. My wife is not an affectionate person, whereas I am</strong><strong>. We </strong><strong>have good sex, but she doesn’t do cuddles</strong><strong>. Once we’re done, she’ll be up and gone, or off to sleep. There’s definitely a difference in the level of affection each of us is </strong><strong>comfortable with</strong><strong>. It’s the same with romantic gestures and compassion</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Her mother was quite cold </strong><strong>and she was left to fend for herself growing up. Not long after getting together, we spoke about former partners. She</strong><strong> is far more open and matter-of-fact about sex than I am</strong><strong> and she went into a lot of detail. She</strong><strong> has had quite a few one-night stands</strong><strong>. Ever since that conversation, they</strong><strong> have played out in my head regularly</strong><strong>; each one is like a mini panic attack. One particular encounter involved her having an orgasm without penetration, which we</strong><strong> have never managed. I love her dearly, and I know this is my problem</strong><strong>, not hers, but my life has been a misery with these intrusive thoughts</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>This is far from just your problem. Her cruelty and insensitivity is making you miserable and it’s time you both took a look at how being together affects you. Hearing about your partner’s former lovers is often painful, and the intent of the partner and the manner in which they describe them often needs to be seen for what it is – meanness, an attempt to create jealousy, or a controlling mechanism. For some, it can be viewed as titillation, but more often it is an intentional act of belittling someone and inflicting pain. Frequently, though, stories about past sexual experiences are exaggerated, so try not to take them seriously. In terms of the non-penetrative orgasm, this is an easy thing for you to achieve if only she would show you how she likes her clitoris to be manipulated. Do not allow her to withhold this information any longer.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

Anecdotal evidence suggests it was first used to describe the Portugal players who won the under-20 World Cup in either 1989 and 1991 (or both, in the case of the precocious João Pinto). When they graduated to the senior team, that group reached the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final in successive European Championships between 1996 and 2004. The most celebrated of them all, Luis Figo, was still around when Portugal made it to the World Cup semi-final in 2006.</p><p><em>For a decade Portugal have been classic underachievers. Figo belongs to a golden generation, an exceptional group crowned the best in Europe at under-17 level and world champions at under-20. With the inventive Rui Costa and the twinkle-toed João Pinto, when they joined up with Vítor Baía, Fernando Couto and Paulo Sousa (who were only a year or so older than the wonderkids) in the senior squad, Portugal expected greatness. Instead people have been scratching their heads to work out why they haven’t matured as an international force.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/22/when-did-the-term-golden-generation-originate-in-football-knowledge">Continue reading...</a>

## Travellers to Unimaginable Lands by Dasha Kiper review – how dementia changes lives

<p>A clinical psychologist turns the spotlight on caregivers in this profoundly compassionate study</p><p>An elegant woman enjoys a gin and tonic and dinner with her husband in a cosy Italian restaurant near their Greenwich Village apartment; their relaxed, lighthearted conversation, long familiar to them, doesn’t miss a beat. But as the time to leave this regular date draws near, he bids her farewell and she, in practised response, surreptitiously changes her dressy shoes to trainers so that she can rush home to arrive before he does. Once there, their dinner will be entirely forgotten to him and, in a painful reversal of their previous intimacy, he will ask her to leave – in the past he has evicted her to spend the night in the hallway or even called the police. He will not believe that they are married, and will react to evidence to the contrary – their shared belongings, anecdotes of their life together – as though it were planted or invented, a rotten fraud being perpetrated on him.</p><p>In Travellers to Unimaginable Lands, Dasha Kiper, a clinical psychologist who works with caregivers to people suffering from dementia, is primarily focused on Elizabeth, the wife; what this form of apparent rejection means to her, and how she is able – or not – to negotiate it. There is no story in this book that is not equally heartbreaking: whether it is quotidian, as in the mother who repeatedly removes items from the freezer despite her daughter’s dogged attempts to stop her with entreaties or taped-up instructions; or whether it is comparatively elaborate, as in the elderly woman who befriends the dead authors in photographs on the books she loves, going so far as to invite Stefan Zweig for dinner and ignoring her husband as she attempts, with no outward sign of success, to make conversation with him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/22/travellers-to-unimaginable-lands-by-dasha-kiper-review-how-dementia-changes-lives">Continue reading...</a>

Will any of us survive battle Roy-al?</p><p>We open at a sumptuous gathering, full of disaffected people reeking of money. A white-haired man is moving through the crowd – a nod here, a smile facsimile there – the purest essence of them all, distilled into one be-cardiganed frame. It can only be Logan Roy’s birthday party and it can only be Succession. It’s back for the fourth and final season to a mix of lamentation and relief among even – possibly especially – the most devoted fans, who hardly have the strength to survive one more round of the densest, cleverest, most emotionally pulverising drama on TV.</p><p>Logan (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/10/brian-cox-interview-kermode-succession-putting-rabbit-hat">Brian Cox</a>) is 48 hours away from signing the sale contract, possibly in his children’s blood, that will hand over his media empire to Gojo.

## Vibe check: what does the most overused word of our era actually mean?

<p>‘Vibes’ are everywhere, from pop culture to politics. Is it a symbol of human connection – or has it become meaningless?</p><p>The most important people in the history of the word “vibes” are the Beach Boys. Before the release of Good Vibrations, in 1966, if you heard someone say “a vibe”, they were probably talking about a vibraphone – the xylophone-like percussion instrument with ringing metal bars, invented in 1916. The thought that a person could give off “vibes” was a niche, mostly hippy concept that Brian Wilson heard about from his mother.</p><p>At first, it was frightening. “[She] used to tell me about vibrations,” Wilson told a biographer, years later. “She told me about dogs that would bark at people … that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can’t see, but you can feel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/22/vibes-definition-slang-language-meaning">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A wealthy woman is drawn into Chile’s anti-Pinochet resistance in this thrilling feature debut from actor turned director Manuela Martelli</p><p>An outstanding performance from Aline Küppenheim is the driving force in this engrossing suspense drama-thriller about an elegant and prosperous woman being drawn into Chile’s anti-Pinochet resistance in 1976. It is a terrific feature debut from performer turned director Manuela Martelli, who herself acted opposite Küppenheim in the film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/may/06/10">Machuca</a>, which was set in Chile in 1973, the time of the Allende overthrow. But this film has more bite.</p><p>Küppenheim plays Carmen, the stylish wife of a Santiago hospital doctor, currently working on the redecoration of the family’s holiday home by the sea, where she and her family mingle with reactionary friends of her husband’s from the local yacht club. Slightly imperiously, she lectures the contractor in his workshop on the exact shade of red paint she needs and as she does so, there is a terrified shout outside in the street and a squeal of tyres as someone is taken away by the secret police; everyone (including Carmen) looks away and goes into the woozy state of shock and denial that was commonplace among so many middle-class Chileans. (The enigmatic resemblance of the red paint to blood is echoed later when Carmen is using red food colouring in her kitchen.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/22/1976-review-pinochet-manuela-martelli">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A physician’s book details the success of a Houston hospital that treats uninsured Americans stranded by the system</p><p>With his first book, The People’s Hospital, author Ricardo Nuila offers a compelling mixture of healthcare policy and gripping stories from the frontlines of medicine. Exploring the question of how Houston’s safety-net hospital, Ben Taub, can have better outcomes by many measures than America’s best private health centers, he deconstructs basic assumptions about healthcare in the US, pulling these ideas from vivid, journalistic accounts of the patients he serves.</p><p>Nuila took a twisty path to his literary vocation. Born into a family of doctors, he always felt the expectation that one day he’d become a doctor too. “I grew up visiting hospitals with my dad.

<p>My life was a mess and I was grieving my late mother. But even so, I should have done something</p><p>I met F because she and her husband M were the kind of people who would invite a stranger wrestling a poo-smeared infant over a bin to use their changing mat. That incident happened in the park that separated our flats and, as we chatted, we realised our sons were similar ages. We all ended up in that park often: to start with, we’d meet by accident, but it soon became deliberate and we hung out more regularly, spending anarchic evenings wrangling our four small boys over wine, snacks and neighbourhood gossip.</p><p>It was a friendship of shared circumstances, but a real friendship nonetheless. They were good company: F was calmer than the ebullient M; warm, funny and relaxed. I wasn’t in great shape: my mum had died while I was pregnant with our younger son 18 months previously, we’d moved to Paris (a disaster), I’d got pregnant again, had an abortion, then we’d moved back to London. I threw myself into a job that made unreasonable demands on my time, stopped eating and overspent; my partner and I were struggling. I was signed off work and started antidepressants and therapy. We never talked about any of that with F and M, though; I just enjoyed our time together. They were a small, sunnily uncomplicated part of my life when everything else felt hard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/22/my-biggest-regret-i-knew-my-friend-was-dying-and-i-didnt-contact-her">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kremlin propaganda on Putin’s meeting with Xi touts them as powerful equals. But it is China and the US that are on a par</p><p>Once again the world is divided into competing spheres of eastern and western power, but is it a new cold war or reheated leftovers from the last one? The answer is a bit of both. For Vladimir Putin, the superpower rivalry of the 20th century never ended, although in economic and military terms there was a clear winner and it wasn’t the Soviet Union. Russia’s president is determined to reverse that humiliation, in the national imagination, at least. In other realms, the trajectory is further decline.</p><p>Russia can still make a global nuisance of itself. A nuclear-armed rogue state with an appetite for territorial expansion can’t be ignored. But parity with the US is a distant memory for the Kremlin.

## After Impressionism review – radical ideas and ecstatic sex from the edge of a new universe

<p><strong>National Gallery, London<br /></strong>Cézanne outshines Van Gogh, with Picasso his revolutionary pupil, in this absorbing hurtle toward modern art – smashing 500 years of tradition into cubist shards</p><p>‘Make it strange” is one of the slogans of modernism. The National Gallery’s show After Impressionism makes modernist art itself strange, by seeing it from the past – the Victorian salons where this revolution in the arts actually started. It is a flawed show but one I found hard to leave. European art in the 1880s and 1890s hurtles towards the “modern” before your eyes, yet also burrows away into recesses of nostalgia and pastoral – and you lose yourself, as modernism wants you to.</p><p>You can cut a line through the exhibition and follow the high road of the new, ignoring all those odd byways. Simply rush from Paul Cézanne’s Mont Sainte-Victoire with its hypnotic field of broken, tentative, obsessive dapplings held together by an iron intellect, straight to Pablo Picasso’s 1910 portrait of Wilhelm Uhde. This writer and collector is the last man, the last bourgeois individual, in Picasso’s revolutionary portrait. His cartoonish features, pinched and prissy over a stiff wing collar, are disintegrating into a crystal cavern of invisible structures made suddenly visible. This is the maze of “cubism”, that takes its start from Cézanne’s analysis of vision. This is where, by 1910, the most radical art stood – on the edge of a quantum universe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/22/after-impressionism-inventing-modern-art-national-gallery-london">Continue reading...</a>
