Which I personally am quite entertained by - but Stern finds it extremely irritating. </p><p>Stern ripped into MSNBC on his radio show today, explaining,<em> "I was watching MSNBC … they were going f*cking berserk with, you know, Trump potentially being arrested. It’s the same discussion over and over again."</em></p><p><em>"They go, ‘It’s very possible that President Trump will be indicted according to—’ … and then they all come on the air and they’re all discussing whether or not Trump’s gonna be indicted.

<p><em>"The thing I love is that everyone is talking about Trump, Trump, Trump. And … yesterday was the day he was gonna be arrested, but Trump is the one who said he was gonna be arrested, and they all believe him that he was gonna be arrested.”</em></p><p>This is so true. And it's glorious. Trump hasn't been President for over two years. He isn't on any social media besides Truth Social. He makes very few media appearances aside from rallies. And yet, he can literally captivate the entire country just by putting out a single all-caps press release on his own social media platform. CNN and MSNBC can't get enough. Part of me thinks they probably miss when Trump was President and on Twitter. At least then they didn't have to wait so long for him to give them their breaking news story. </p><p>Whatever "it" is, Trump has it. This doesn't mean Trump is a god who should be worshipped. I've seen far too much of that over the past few days amidst the growing <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-trump-arrest" target="_blank">Trump/DeSantis feud.</a> (Seriously, please stop with the Trump/Jesus comparisons. They're blasphemous and weird. I say this with love.) </p><p>However, it <em>does</em> mean he has an undeniable star power that allows him to lead with more ease than most politicians. Whether that's for the better or worse is up to you. </p>

## Pentagon docs declare 7-year-olds can consent to sexual reassignment, because it's a human right or something

That's a right-wing conspiracy theory. So it should be no concern at all that doctors at the Pentagon <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/pentagon-doctors-claim-7-year-olds-can-make-decisions-injected-hormones-puberty-suppressants" target="_blank">now say 7-year-olds</a> can consent to sex changes. </p><p>The group of doctors behind the claim - David A. Klein, Thomas Baxter, Noelle S. Larson, and Natasha A. Schvey - published their findings in the March edition of the American Journal of Public Health. They claimed that, on the basis of "human rights," <em>"youths…in an informed consent model of care, have an inherent ability and right to consent to gender-affirming therapy," </em>arguing that the <em>only</em> treatment for gender-confused children of military personnel is puberty suppression and affirming hormones. Psychiatric care is seen as "conversion therapy". </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p><em>"Some well-intentioned military-affiliated clinicians may not be aware that a ‘watchful waiting’ approach has a different risk profile than a gender-affirmative approach (which allows for gender identity exploration), and that ‘conversion therapy’ is unethical, harmful, and generally illegal. Patients may face ‘gatekeeping’ and major delays in care, including protracted and pathologizing psychiatric evaluations that question patient motives."</em></p><p>The doctors also want the Pentagon to help gender-confused children circumvent any state laws that might prevent them from receiving "gender-affirming care," and suggested the children get puberty blocker implants if they have to move to a state with bans on these procedures. If that weren't enough, they also want the Department of Defense to provide legal services to healthcare providers who break state laws by administering the banned "medical" care to children. </p><p>So this is terrifying. But the biggest issue here may not be the appalling proposed age of consent (though that is obviously one of the major concerns). It's that no person can <em>truly</em> consent to these procedures. They are entirely experimental. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/prisha-mosley-texas" target="_blank">Stories of de-transitioners</a> tell us that patients are often not informed of the side effects they will experience as a result of the hormones and surgeries, some of which are life-long and completely debilitating. </p><p>There is no such thing as informed consent when it comes to these procedures. It's horrific to do it to <em>any</em> human being, and <em>especially</em> children, who don't yet have the knowledge and years of experience to make such a life-altering decision. </p>

<p>Cleves said,<em> "I felt like that contemporary language would have made it impossible really for us to reckon with this prior historical system. So I do talk about <strong>intergenerational sex</strong>, to get to this terminology question, this is a contentious term because by the standards of our time, <strong>we don’t see any possibility for sex between adults and children, we see it as rape,</strong> and not following within the framework of sex and sexuality. I don’t use the discourse of survivors or necessarily abuse to make sense of sources.”</em></p><p>The book she's referring to is her biography of British author Norman Douglas. Douglas was charged with rape and sexual assault of underage boys and girls. Two of them were cousins aged 10 and 12. In <a href="https://twitter.com/cosminDZS/status/1638217311697117184?s=20" target="_blank">another clip</a>, she admitted Douglas's accounts of having sex with children were "gross". But she went on to explain that he didn't mean to titillate the reader - he just meant to mock the children he raped. Oh. </p><p>This is not her first, er, "controversial" opinion on minors and adults having sex.

## "F***ing arrest me": Maren Morris brags about introducing her toddler to drag queens in their dressing rooms

Specifically that she voluntarily introduced her 2-year-old son to drag queens. In their dressing rooms. Which is frowned upon by most sane people. </p><p>Morris was performing at the "Love Rising" concert to raise money to fight legislation to ban medically transitioning minors and drag shows for kids. Which some people would refer to as genital mutilation and child grooming. Some people. </p><p><em>"And yes, I introduced my son to some drag queens today, so Tennessee, f*ckin arrest me." </em></p><p>She also claimed her son was "delighted" to watch the drag queens do their makeup and get ready to perform.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">None</div> —  (@)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/MarensGIRLs/status/1638036165436620802"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn't suuuper surprising, given Maren Morris's history with wokeism and the LGBTQ+ agenda. Like when she <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/maren-morris-sobs-ru-paul" target="_blank">cried</a> to RuPaul about country music's "relationship with LGBTQ+ members". Or when she <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/maren-morris-cma-awards" target="_blank">threatened to boycott the CMA Awards</a> over Brittany Aldean's "tRaNsPhObIa". In case you forgot, Aldean literally just said she was grateful her parents didn't transition her when she was a child. Which I think most of us could agree with. <br /></p><p>Earlier this month, the Tennessee Governor signed two bills that protect children from medical transition procedures and drag shows. The bill about medical transitions specifically targets mastectomies and completely bans the use of cross-sex hormones and puberty-blockers in kids.  The second bill bans adults from impersonating the opposite sex in a sexually explicit manner where children are present. </p><p>So by the standard of the law, it seems like Morris and the drag queens she introduced her kid to could actually face some type of legal consequences for their actions. And some people would find it hilarious if Tennessee authorities took her up on the offer to arrest her. Some people.<br /></p>

## Football coach fired for praying on the field gets his job back and is $1.7 million richer

As it turns out, in America, it's still legal for you to pray on the 50-yard line with players and is NOT grounds for termination. Now the coach has his job back and one hell of a retirement cushion to fall back on.</p><p>It started when Coach Kennedy would pray on the 50-yard line after games. Eventually, players would join him. Some (I'm speculating) godless progressive twat complained (there are many of them near the Seattle area) and in 2015, Coach Kennedy was suspended from the school district.</p><p>Here he is telling his side of the story in 2018.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p>
<p>Now that the Supreme Court has ruled the First Amendment is still a thing and praying is covered under it -- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/prayer-army-vet-fined" target="_blank">as opposed to England</a>, where <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/buffer-zones-prayer-uk" target="_blank">praying in the wrong place</a> will get you arrested -- Coach Kennedy is back where he belongs.</p><p>The school board <a href="https://www.outkick.com/praying-football-coach-gets-1-7-million-settlement-and-his-job-back/" target="_blank">has voted unanimously to reinstate Kennedy</a> as an assistant coach. Also, they approved a $1.7 million settlement on top of that.</p><p>What's fascinating is looking at 2023 when, at least for a short while,<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/espn-prayer-damar-hamlin" target="_blank"> prayer and football</a> became <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/josh-allen-bills-god-real" target="_blank">synonymous with each other</a>. My guess is that because it was adults, it was acceptable.</p><p>Praying with students, when they are more impressionable and -- Heaven forbid -- could use prayer, upsets a certain group of people in America. The godless progressive twat group that sues over it.</p><p><p>

## Alarming new research shows how fast TikTok's algorithm will send your 13-year-old to videos encouraging suicide

President Donald Trump called to have it banned in 2020, calling it spyware for the Communist Chinese, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/david-hogg-tries-to-own-donald-trump-on-tiktok-fails-miserably" target="_blank">and was mocked for doing so</a>. Three years later now that there is bipartisan agreement, President Joe Biden is dragging his feet because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/david-hogg-jonas-brothers-biden" target="_blank">his base loves the app</a> and he <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-tiktok-dilemma-a-ban-could-hurt-democrats-more-than-republicans-a74bcf2a" target="_blank">might not win reelection without it</a>. </p><p>Now let's talk about TikTok showing your teen suicide videos.</p><p>Corporate accountability group Ekō <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2023/03/21/chinas-greatest-weapon-tiktok-pushes-suicide-videos-on-13-year-olds/amp/" target="_blank">released research on Tuesday</a> to show how quick the TikTok algorithm chooses SUICIDE videos to show your thirteen-year-old.  Thirteen is the youngest you can be to sign up for the app on your own.</p><p>First, they created accounts that mimicked "incels" or "involuntary celebrates." VICE, who Ekō shared the research with, defines incels as a “online community of young men who formed a bond around their lack of sexual success with women."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a43f3" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33333874&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>All it took was for researchers to view TEN VIDEOS before the algorithm started showing them videos on suicide.</p><p>One video with the caption “get shot or see her with someone else?” featured actor Jake Gyllenhaal -- the research shows his movies are popular with incels -- with a gun in his mouth screaming  “Shoot me. Shoot me in the fucking face.”</p><p>Comments on the post ranged from people encouraging him to shoot to others talking about how dead they felt inside. Research Maen Hammad calls it extremely alarming to see how easy it is for children to fall into this spiral.</p><blockquote>Ten minutes and a few clicks on TikTok is all that is needed to fall into the rabbit hole of some of the darkest and most harmful content online. [...] The algorithm forces you into a spiral of depression, hopelessness, and self harm, and it’s terribly difficult to get out of that spiral once the algorithm thinks it knows what you want to see.</blockquote><p>Comedian Andrew Schulz <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-andrew-schulz-app" target="_blank">called this out last year</a>, comparing what the algorithm shows youth in China vs. youth in America.</p><blockquote><em>Apparently in China, the way that the algorithm works, it doesn't reward people doing stupid dances and playing with their dog. The algorithm is rewarding that they want to see their youth do. So, people doing cool engineering sh*t. People doing cool science sh*t. But if you're China and you wanted to disrupt another country, wouldn't you reward the dumbest possible sh*t on that app. Twerkin. People doing stupid dances. You want the next level of youth to go "I can be famous doing something that is worthless to society."</em></blockquote><p>And that's without getting into Communist China <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-joe-rogan" target="_blank">owning ALL your personal information if you read the terms of service</a>.</p><blockquote>We collect certain information about the device you use to access the platform, such as your IP address, user region [...] user agent, mobile carrier, time zone settings, identifiers for advertising purpose, model of your device, the device system, network type, device IDs, your screen resolution and operating system, app and file names and types.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="bd239" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33333896&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>TikTok through its algorithm targets your children when they are at their most vulnerable and shows them content encouraging the darkest thoughts they might have. It's disgusting to think that other social media apps most likely do the same (::cough:::Instagram::cough::). TikTok is just the one research was done on.</p><p><p>

## Watch: Groom exposes bride for cheating on him, airs video of the dirty deed during their wedding ceremony

Every flower, every hor d'oevre, every detail is painstakingly crafted to make the perfect day. For one bride, her wedding day was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/donald-trump-wedding" target="_blank">everything she dreamed of</a>. Until the couple was announced and a video played of her banging some dude who wasn't her husband. Turns out, her new husband added some details of his own to the wedding.</p><p>Britney Spears not understanding why she <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/britney-spears-catholic-church" target="_blank">can't get married at a Catholic church when she isn't Catholic</a> is no longer the most cringeworthy wedding content we've seen.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Weddings are fun when they aren’t yours. <a href="https://t.co/LQFpETKsBz">pic.twitter.com/LQFpETKsBz</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1638495011699408897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The video is from 2019, but it's blowing up on TikTok now. It's from China, so the fact it's blowing up on the communist Chinese-owned platform is kinda funny. Also, because it's from China, they are speaking a funny language. But the <em>New York Post</em> translated the groom's reaction, upon finding out his virgin bride was defloured by his brother-in-law (I'm assuming he has another sister and this isn't an incestuous thing) as “Did you think I didn’t know about this?”<br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="ead9f" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=30821607&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Unfortunately, since the video is from 2019, it does not follow 2022's best practices for content. KEEP. THE. VIDEO. RECORDING. I'm sure what happened is that the wedding guest thought they were capturing a beautiful moment as it was the debut of Mr. and Mrs. Whoever. Then when the video showed Mrs. Whoever loving some other dude long time, they shut their phone off. We're left wondering what happened after the big reveal that, to quote Panic! at the Disco, the poor groom's bride is a whore.</p><p>I'm sure some are wondering why the groom would go through with the wedding knowing that his fiance was cheating on him. But be honest: If it was you, and you found out, you'd be this petty. It would be totally worth the quicky divorce and/or annulment. </p><p><p>
