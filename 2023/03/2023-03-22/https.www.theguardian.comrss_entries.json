The new-tech companies are usually small and dynamic, and their funding mix is predominantly made up of private capital (typically venture capital or angel investors). Conversely, old-tech companies have a more interesting mix of equity and debt to fund their activity \u2013 and therefore a more complex relationship with financial markets and institutions. This is partially down to the different levels of risk of the two asset classes, which also drives their different accessibility to retail investors.</p><p>Maurizio Fiaschetti is a lecturer in banking and finance</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/22/money-technology-sector-interest-rates-startups-svb\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/22/money-technology-sector-interest-rates-startups-svb", "date_published": "2023-03-22 08:30:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Bafta TV awards 2023: full list of nominations", "description": "<p>From Sherwood to Derry Girls, Top Boy to Big Boys and beyond, here is every single nominee up for the year\u2019s biggest British TV awards</p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/22/this-is-going-to-hurt-and-the-responder-lead-in-2023-bafta-tv-nominations\">This is Going to Hurt and The Responder lead the nominations at the 2023 TV Baftas</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/bad-sisters-review-sharon-horgan-pitch-black-comedy-is-murderously-good\">Bad Sisters</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/07/martin-freeman-explosively-dodgy-cop-responder\">The Responder</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jun/13/sherwood-review-the-cleverest-most-compelling-show-ive-seen-in-years\">Sherwood</a> <br /><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/oct/16/somewhere-boy-review-channel-4-danny-lewis-gribben\">Somewhere Boy</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/22/bafta-tv-awards-2023-full-list-of-nominations\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/22/bafta-tv-awards-2023-full-list-of-nominations", "date_published": "2023-03-22 08:19:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "She was one of Alabama\u2019s last abortion doctors.
