[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Books: Lend, Don't Give", "description": "<p><span>\n\nEA books give a much more thorough description of what EA is about\nthan a short conversation, and I think it's great that EA events (ex:\nthe dinners we host </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.eaboston.org/\">here in\nBoston</a>) often have ones like \n\n<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better\">Doing Good\nBetter</a>, \n\n<a href=\"https://theprecipice.com/\">The Precipice</a>, or\n\n\n<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/book/\">80,000 Hours</a> available.\nSince few people read quickly enough that they'll sit down and make it\nthrough a book during the event, or want to spend their time at the\nevent reading in a corner, the books make sense if people leave with\nthem.  This gives organizers ~3 options: sell, lend, or give.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nVery few people will be up for buying a book in a situation like this,\nso most EA groups end up with either lending or giving.  I have the\nimpression that giving is <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xomFCNXwNBeXtLq53/bad-omens-in-current-community-building?commentId=7ujozMgvCnXD4aZhw\">more</a>\n<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZSFWLn6ZKfy3rj8Kf/our-clubs-day-tabling-went-well-and-wasn-t-that-effective\">common</a>,\nbut I <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xomFCNXwNBeXtLq53/bad-omens-in-current-community-building?commentId=EjoeKJ6xSDWAr74LN#EjoeKJ6xSDWAr74LN\">think</a>\nlending is generally a lot better:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>A loan suggests that when you're done reading the book you've\nconsidered the ideas and don't need the book anymore.  Giving suggests\nit's more like doctrine you keep and reference.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>You don't get back all the books you lend, and that's ok, but\nin my experience we do get most of them back.  Lending out the same\nbook over and over is a lot cheaper than buying a new book each time.\nGiving books is (and looks) unnecessarily lavish.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Returning the book offers a chance to talk about reactions.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nLending out books doesn't mean you need to run it like a library, with\nrecords and late fees.  We've put the books out with stickies saying\n\"borrow this book\", they go out, and they mostly come back again.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ea-borrow-this-book-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"301\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/ea-borrow-this-book.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0i3FGY1bDhJZoNKenZ5bWXZbAnwWeVcrqj3QSJDGgdnesb3YGgztk7Avdg1YDVBzJl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110068386634455806\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/books-lend-dont-give", "date_published": "2023-03-22 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
