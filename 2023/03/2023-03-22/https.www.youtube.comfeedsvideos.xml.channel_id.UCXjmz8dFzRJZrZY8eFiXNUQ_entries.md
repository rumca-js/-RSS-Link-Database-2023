Ever since James Cameron's first installment The Terminator, John Connor has been set up as this almost mythical being that is destined to save the human race.  After meeting him as a child in Terminator 2 Judgement Day, it seemed logical that the next time we'd see John Connor would be fighting the machines in a post-apocalyptic future.   Though with each installment after Judgement Day, it seems the idea of John Connor has gotten lost completely.
