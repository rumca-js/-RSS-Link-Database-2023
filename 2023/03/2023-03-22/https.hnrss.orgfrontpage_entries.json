When building a world map, you can use \"Dynamic Brushes\" to draw organic looking terrain. This is achieved entirely with svg filters and javascript canvas, no fancy libraries or anything. This came with a pretty large rewrite of some of the underlying code, so I'm sure there's a number of bugs I haven't come across, but I'd love to hear your opinions on it!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments

Why use Moonshine?<p>1. Pretrained on multispectral data: Existing popular CV packages are nice to use but are trained on ImageNet or similar, meaning that not only is the domain of the pretraining different, but you may be restricted to only 3 channels. For remote sensing platforms with multispectral data, this might be a non-starter. Moonshine includes models specifically trained for your remote sensing problems.<p>2. Focus on usability: There are academic releases of specialized models that do support remote sensing data, but often they are difficult to use. They might be hard to install, and often are supported by a grad student who is more focused on publication than software. A core tenant of Moonshine is that it should be easy to use.<p>I've been working on this project for nearly a year now and I'm really excited to show it off and most importantly get feedback! I have big plans for what to build in the future, but this set of features was the smallest one I could think of that would provide some value.<p>Docs: <a href=\"https://moonshineai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://moonshineai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a>\nGithub: <a href=\"https://github.com/moonshinelabs-ai/moonshine\">https://github.com/moonshinelabs-ai/moonshine</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35261386\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35261386</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "link": "https://moonshineai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html", "date_published": "2023-03-22 14:18:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "A Mirror That Reverses How Light Travels in Time", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/time-reversal-interface\">https://spectrum.ieee.org/time-reversal-interface</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35261363\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35261363</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/time-reversal-interface", "date_published": "2023-03-22 14:17:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Year from Quitting My Full-Time PM Job.

We move the model to the data instead of moving the data to the model. This enables regulatory compliance (e.g. HIPAA) and ML use cases that are otherwise impossible. Our GitHub is at <a href=\"https://github.com/adap/flower\">https://github.com/adap/flower</a>, and we have a tutorial here: <a href=\"https://flower.dev/docs/tutorial/Flower-0-What-is-FL.html\">https://flower.dev/docs/tutorial/Flower-0-What-is-FL.html</a>.<p>Flower lets you train ML models on data that is distributed across many user devices or \u201csilos\u201d (separate data sources) without having to move the data. This approach is called federated learning.<p>A silo can be anything from a single user device to the data of an entire organization. For example, your smartphone keyboard suggestions and auto-corrections can be driven by a personalized ML model learned from your own private keyboard data, as well as data from other smartphone users, without the data being transferred from anyone\u2019s device.<p>Most of the famous AI breakthroughs \u2014 from ChatGPT and Google Translate to DALL\u00b7E and Stable Diffusion \u2014 were trained with public data from the web. When the data is all public, you can collect it in a central place for training. This \u201cmove the data to the computation\u201d approach fails when the data is sensitive or distributed across organizational silos and user devices.<p>Many important use cases are affected by this limitation:<p>* Generative AI: Many scenarios require sensitive data that users or organizations are reluctant to upload to the cloud. For example, users might want to put themselves and friends into AI-generated images, but they don't want to upload and share all their photos.<p>* Healthcare: We could potentially train cancer detection models better than any doctor, but no single organization has enough data.<p>* Finance: Preventing financial fraud is hard because individual banks are subject to data regulations, and in isolation, they don't have enough fraud cases to train good models.<p>* Automotive: Autonomous driving would be awesome, but individual car makers struggle to gather the data to cover the long tail of possible edge cases.<p>* Personal computing: Users don't want certain kinds of data to be stored in the cloud, hence the recent success of privacy-enhancing alternatives like the Signal messenger or the Brave browser. Federated methods open the door to using sensitive data from personal devices while maintaining user privacy.<p>* Foundation models: These get better with more data, and more diverse data, to train them on. But again, most data is sensitive and thus can't be incorporated, even though these models continue to grow bigger and need more information.<p>Each of us has worked on ML projects in various settings, (e.g., corporate environments, open-source projects, research labs). We\u2019ve worked on AI use cases for companies like Samsung, Microsoft, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz. One of our biggest challenges was getting the data to train AI while being compliant with regulations or company policies. Sometimes this was due to legal or organizational restrictions; other times, it was difficulties in physically moving large quantities of data or natural concerns over user privacy. Any of these problems can halt a ML project in its tracks.<p>We realized issues of this kind were making it too difficult for many ML projects to get off the ground, and would especially impact certain domains like healthcare and finance.<p>Federated learning offers an alternative \u2014 it doesn't require moving data in order to train models on it, and so has the potential to overcome many barriers for ML projects.<p>In early 2020, we began developing the open-source Flower framework to simplify federated learning and make it user-friendly. Last year, we experienced a surge in Flower's adoption among industry users, which led us to apply to YC. In the past, we funded our work through consulting projects, but looking ahead, we\u2019re going to offer a managed version for enterprises and charge per deployment or federation. At the same time, we\u2019ll continue to run Flower as an open-source project that everyone can continue to use and contribute to.<p>Federated learning can train AI models on distributed and sensitive data by moving the training to the data instead of moving the data to the training. It collects whatever it can from the learning process, and the data stays where it is. Because the data never moves, we can train AI on sensitive data spread across organizational silos or user devices to improve models with data that could never be leveraged until now.<p>Here\u2019s how it works: (0) Initialize the global model parameters on the server; (1) Send the model parameters to a number of organizations/devices (client nodes); (2) Train model locally on the data of each organization/device (client node); (3)  Return the updated model parameters back to the server; (4) On the server, aggregate the model updates (e.g., by averaging them) into a new global model; (5): Repeat steps 1 to 4 until the model converges.<p>This, of course, is more challenging than centralized learning: we must move AI models to data silos or user devices, train locally, send updated models back, aggregate them, and repeat. Flower provides the open-source infrastructure to easily do this, as well as supporting other privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). It is compatible with PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Hugging Face, Fastai, Weights & Biases and all the other tools used in ML projects regularly. The only dependency on the server side is NumPy, but even that can be dropped if necessary. Flower uses gRPC under the hood, so a basic client can easily be auto-generated, even for most languages that are not supported today.<p>Flower is open-source (Apache 2.0 license) and can be run in all kinds of environments: on a personal workstation for development and simulation, on Google Colab, on a compute cluster for large-scale simulations or on a cluster of Raspberry Pi\u2019s (or similar devices) to build research systems, or deployed on public cloud instances (AWS, Azure, GCP, others) or private on-prem hardware. We are happy to help users when deploying Flower systems and will soon make this even easier through our managed cloud service.<p>You can find PyTorch example code here: <a href=\"https://flower.dev#examples\">https://flower.dev#examples</a>, and more at <a href=\"https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples\">https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples</a>.<p>We believe that AI technology must evolve to be more collaborative, open and distributed than it is today (<a href=\"https://flower.dev/blog/2023-03-08-flower-labs/\">https://flower.dev/blog/2023-03-08-flower-labs/</a>).
