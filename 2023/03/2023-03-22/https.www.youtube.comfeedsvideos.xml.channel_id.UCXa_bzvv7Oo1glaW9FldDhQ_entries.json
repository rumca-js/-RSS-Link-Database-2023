In the remakes that followed \u2013 2019\u2019s critically acclaimed Resident Evil 2 Remake, Resident Evil 3, \u2013 Capcom crafts distinctly reimagined experiences, noticeable immediately in a perspective shift from fixed camera angles to over-the-shoulder in RE2 and 3, but also in wholesale recontextualization of the games\u2019 environments and settings. \n\nThe Raccoon City Police Department we tread through as Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield in Resident Evil 2 Remake is identical in essence to the vision of its 1998 original, but grandiose in scope and scale.
