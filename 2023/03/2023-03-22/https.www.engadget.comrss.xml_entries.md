<p>Positive Grid has a new ultra-portable version of its high-tech Spark guitar amplifier. Designed for musicians seeking a versatile and powerful practice amp, the 3.5-inch-tall Spark Go works with a companion app loaded with virtual amps, pedals and other effects — and it can even flesh out your sound with AI-powered drums and other backing instruments.</p><p>Like its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-positive-grid-spark-amp.html">predecessors</a>, the Spark Go pairs with an iOS / Android app to go far beyond amplifying your strumming and picking; it enhances it digitally. It includes 50,000 tones (ranging from boutique to modern), 33 amps and 43 effects and pedals, giving you plenty of novel ways to shape your sound. The app can even “jam along with you” by listening to and learning from your playing, generating an appropriate backing track. And if you want to learn new tunes, the app can sync with Spotify or Apple Music to display AI-generated chords for the song you’re hearing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Engadget’s 2021 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/positive-grid-spark-special-edition-pearl-practice-guitar-amp-review-123041879.html">review of the Spark Pearl</a> (a larger model in the same line) found the app to have some rough edges  — including a less-than-convincing AI drummer. However, the company has had plenty of time to smooth it out, so we’ll reserve judgment on the current iteration until we test it again. After all, you may have heard generative AI has made some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">impressive leaps</a> since then.</p><div id="2aa77ded350c4715bb9f02023845fc3b"></div><p>The amp has a rugged construction and “extra hardshell grille” to (at least in theory) live up to its on-the-go branding; Positive Grid says it even fits on a pedal board. The company suggests laying it flat for omnidirectional sound or standing it on its edge for “in-your-face sound.” In addition, it uses computational audio that delivers “surprisingly big, full sound” from its tiny package. (And you can plug in headphones to practice in private.) The amp’s battery allegedly lasts up to eight hours and recharges with USB-C. Finally, it supports four presets for when you find a mix you want to keep handy.</p><p>Positive Grid is accepting <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=516a5377-eb48-46e1-8af5-038a5a78fee3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Positive+Grid&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1MTZhNTM3Ny1lYjQ4LTQ2ZTEtOGFmNS0wMzhhNWE3OGZlZTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9zaXRpdmVncmlkLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9zcGFyay1nbyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQyYzc0MzQtNDRlYS00M2JlLTlkMzUtMWJlNGExNDE5MTcwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeEzqhdnmqkB9_0MX_BY4UfD7smZSZF0b_Ir2SBqEAym&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.positivegrid.com%2Fproducts%2Fspark-go">early signups</a> to be notified when Spark Go pre-orders go live. Whenever they open (the company hasn’t yet announced a date), the company will offer the amp for an aggressively priced $109 — although it will eventually increase to a suggested $149.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/positive-grid-unveils-ultra-portable-spark-go-enhanced-guitar-amp-212007445.html?src=rss

## Microsoft's collaborative work app, Loop, is finally available in public preview

<p>It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-loop-office-365-fluid-framework-150029033.html">took two years</a>, but Microsoft is at last ready to let everyday users try its latest take on collaborative work.

It's more of an attempt to unify and sync collaborative efforts in an era where emoji are commonplace and people thrive on apps like Asana (for task tracking) and Slack (for chat). Microsoft's challenge is simply getting people to use its approach. This won't help those loyal to Google's productivity suite, of course, but Microsoft will also have to persuade users that Loop can replace the gaggle of collaborative apps they might already use.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-collaborative-work-app-loop-is-finally-available-in-public-preview-203058893.html?src=rss

## Ethernet co-inventor Bob Metcalfe wins the Turing Award, the 'Nobel Prize of computing'

<p>Even if you're not plugging an Ethernet cable into the wall, somewhere along the chain you're still relying on that technology to get online. You've got Bob Metcalfe and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ethernet-co-inventor-david-boggs-dies-at-71-110524422.html">late David Boggs</a> to thank for that. Together at Xerox's renowned Palo Alto Research Institute (better known as Xerox PARC), the pair developed Ethernet and set the stage for a networking revolution. Yesterday, <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2023/03/22/bob-metcalfe-receives-computer-industrys-highest-honor-for-ethernet-creation/">Metcalfe received</a> the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) A.M. Turing Award, which is often pegged the "Nobel Prize of computing."</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-13-google-turing-award.html">funding from Google</a>, that prize is now worth $1 million, and it's yet another highlight for Metcalfe's storied career. After leaving Xerox PARC, he founded 3com, a networking equipment company that brought Ethernet to the mainstream. “It is dangerous to accept an award for developing Ethernet, which turns 50 on May 22, 2023,” Metcalfe told the University of Texas, where he now serves as a professor emeritus. “Over Ethernet’s 50 years, hundreds of people have earned some claim of inventorship. Join me in saying to these folks, ‘Thank you.’”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite its notoriety as a cable technology, Metcalfe <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy8yMi90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3R1cmluZy1hd2FyZC1ib2ItbWV0Y2FsZmUtZXRoZXJuZXQuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTU3NzZmZjYtMTZjMS00NmFmLWFkMzMtNzE2ZjYxZTE5YTU3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWvcmNYLASFy84Ls7YlaDvoR9prJw1OU-0wkqoW31ioM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F03%2F22%2Ftechnology%2Fturing-award-bob-metcalfe-ethernet.html">told the </a><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy8yMi90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3R1cmluZy1hd2FyZC1ib2ItbWV0Y2FsZmUtZXRoZXJuZXQuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTU3NzZmZjYtMTZjMS00NmFmLWFkMzMtNzE2ZjYxZTE5YTU3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWvcmNYLASFy84Ls7YlaDvoR9prJw1OU-0wkqoW31ioM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F03%2F22%2Ftechnology%2Fturing-award-bob-metcalfe-ethernet.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> that he originally envisioned it to be more like the Wi-Fi we know today. “We wanted to make it wireless,” he said. “But we couldn’t have zero wires.

## Epic will share 40 percent of 'Fortnite' purchase revenue with creators

<p>Epic Games will has a new way to encourage more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-campaign-fortnite-island-200604744.html">custom <em>Fortnite</em> islands</a>: promise a steadier stream of cash. The company has <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/introducing-the-creator-economy-2-0?isWelcome=true&amp;team=personal">launched</a> a Creator Economy 2.0 system that will proportionately hand out 40 percent of net revenue from most real-money purchases to creators, including Epic. If your island is especially popular or keeps people coming back, you'll get a larger cut of Item Shop spending and related transactions.</p><p>Until now, <em>Fortnite</em> creators received special codes they had to share with fans if they wanted a five percent slice of purchases. However, that approach only worked if players knew to use the code. That left some creators using heavy-handed tactics to promote the code, such as frequent promotion during livestreams or even designing islands around the concept.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Creators can sign up for Economy 2.0 through a <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/welcome?team=personal">portal</a>. People with existing islands who joins on or before April 21st will be paid for engagement dating back to March 1st. To qualify, individuals only need to be 18 years old and have a <em>Fortnite</em> account at least 90 days old. Companies are also eligible.</p><div id="b315f911021e44edbda37395fb852157"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The news comes as Epic is <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-is-now-available-in-beta">introducing</a> a free public beta of Unreal Engine for <em>Fortnite</em>. As the name implies, it will eventually bring most of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unreal-engine-5-available-release-date-151023130.html">Unreal Engine 5's</a> tools to creators making islands, games and other experiences inside the shooter. You can edit maps, the environment and game mechanics. Effectively, this should lead to more distinctive (and more polished) third-party projects.</p><p>The change to payouts isn't a shock. <a href="https://activeplayer.io/fortnite/">According</a> to Activeplayer.io, <em>Fortnite</em>'s average monthly player counts have gradually declined since peaks in 2020 and 2021. Economy 2.0 could help Epic by rewarding creators of in-demand islands. To some degree, this is also about fending off competition from Roblox. Many companies are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-island-roblox-metaverse-110035809.html">building islands in the rival platform</a> to attract younger users — Epic's move could keep those brands and gamers onboard.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/epic-will-share-40-percent-of-fortnite-purchase-revenue-with-creators-192924916.html?src=rss

<p>We saw both of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-sc9-se6-soundbars-first-look-ces-2023-164512242.html">LG's new soundbars in action at CES</a> earlier this year — and while the company was happy to show off the speakers' wireless connectivity and other features, it wasn't ready to share pricing or availability. Turns out, both the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-sc9-se6-soundbar-dolby-atmos-ces-2023-010041269.html">premium-focused LG Sound Bar C (SC9)</a> and the more compact SE6 are available starting today, March 22nd. Which unit is right for you depends not only on what kind of soundscape you're hoping to build, but also on if you already have an compatible LG TV.</p><p>The higher-end Sound Bar C sells for $999, and comes with an included subwoofer as well as the LG Synergy Bracket — a soundbar mount designed specifically for LG OLED C Series TVs that bolts the audio directly to the screen, rather than the wall or your TV stand. LG's Wow Interface is exclusive to the SC9, which lets you control the soundbar's settings from a compatible LG TV itself.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fa9e85ad36274d279a7f2418ea433e38"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>At $450, the LG SE6 is less expensive and lacks a dedicated subwoofer, but it still packs Dolby Atmos and many of the higher-end soundbar's key features. Wow Orchestra can sync the sound bar's audio to the TV's internal speakers for a larger soundscape, and LG's Wowcast feature allows both units to wirelessly connect to a TV to avoid visible <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reviews/best-bag-organizers/">cable clutter</a>.</p><p>Both the SC9 and SE6 are available from LG.com and select retailers starting on March 22nd, 2023.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lgs-2023-wireless-soundbars-available-now-starting-at-450-183250200.html?src=rss

## ‘Counter-Strike 2’ arrives this summer as a free upgrade for 'CS:GO'

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-new-counter-strike-game-is-reportedly-in-development-and-could-arrive-later-this-month-202010791.html">rumors were true</a>: Valve has just taken the wraps off of <a href="https://counter-strike.net/cs2"><em>Counter-Strike 2</em></a>, announcing a limited beta that is available to select members of the game’s community. The studio says the sequel will overhaul every system, piece of content and part of the Counter-Strike experience. As expected, Valve is moving the game to the latest version of its in-house Source 2 engine, leading to a noticeable leap in graphical fidelity.</p><div id="484b90117d3a4e64a2b6d399b62e0b7f"></div><p>The game will feature sharper textures, more life-like lighting and additional geometry. Valve says the <em>Counter-Strike 2 </em>team is taking a three-tier approach to level design. “Touchstone” maps like Dust 2 will, for the most part, be left untouched outside of tweaks to their lighting and readability. “Upgrade” maps, meanwhile, will take advantage of Source 2’s enhanced lighting pipeline for more realistic-looking materials and reflections. Lastly, Valve plans to fully overhaul a handful of levels, taking advantage of everything its engine has to offer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The move to Source 2 will also bring with it gameplay enhancements. Starting, most notably, with how smoke grenades function. As Valve explains in a behind-the-scenes video, smoke grenades will now live as volumetric 3D objects within the game world, making them responsive to other gameplay elements and allowing players to momentarily shape sightlines with bullets and explosions.</p><div id="340533b69c8e4ef4827562b650e3afe1"></div><p>Valve is also overhauling the game’s server architecture. It says <em>Counter-Strike 2 </em>will support sub-tick updates, a feature the studio claims will allow the game’s servers to know the instant a player move, fires their weapon or throws a grenade. In theory, that should make the new entry feel like the most responsive Counter-Strike to date.</p><p>When the full version of the game arrives this summer, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> will be a free upgrade to <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>. Any cosmetics you’ve collected in <em>CS:GO</em> will carry over to the new game (and look better than ever). Valve is inviting players to the limited beta based on a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/faqs/steam-help/view/5ED2-ED8E-81F4-0C18">handful of factors</a>, including recent playtime and Steam account standing. The studio promised to share more information about <em>Counter-Strike 2 </em>closer to release.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/counter-strike-2-arrives-this-summer-as-a-free-upgrade-for-csgo-181013726.html?src=rss

And members of both parties have supported bills that would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-committee-approves-bill-that-could-lead-to-a-tiktok-ban-in-the-us-185632229.html">empowe</a>r President Joe Biden and others in his administration <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-bill-would-give-commerce-secretary-the-power-to-ban-tiktok-as-a-security-threat-202139609.html">to ban</a> the app.</p><p>Much of Chew’s written testimony is similar to arguments TikTok has been making for years.

Additionally, it’s worth noting that while Apple bills its Friday-night lineups as “doubleheaders,” the two games often air simultaneously. The first game on April 7th is an exception, fearing the Texas Rangers vs. Chicago Cubs at 2 PM ET and the San Diego Padres vs. Atlanta Braves at 7 PM ET.

## Cable and satellite providers may have to advertise the true price of TV service

<p>Are you tired of TV providers advertising one price, but charging another thanks to hidden fees? You might not have to put up with that practice for much longer. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-pricing-transparency-requirement-cable-and-satellite">proposed</a> a requirement that cable and satellite TV services &quot;clearly and prominently&quot; display the true cost of service both in their marketing and on subscriber bills. Companies couldn't mask programming costs as fees that only show up on your bill, hiding them behind vague or potentially misleading terms.</p><p>The measure is intended to help would-be customers make truly informed choices about TV subscriptions, including comparisons with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html">streaming services</a>. The move could also help boost competition between providers and help cash-strapped families avoid unpleasant surprises, FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel claims.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The proposal comes months after President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2022/10/26/the-presidents-initiative-on-junk-fees-and-related-pricing-practices/">called</a> on government agencies to fight &quot;junk fees&quot; and otherwise demand more transparent pricing for services and events.

In that light, the TV price transparency effort is mainly an extension that could outline exactly how much you'll pay for a multi-service bill.</p><p>The proposal doesn't come at a great time for conventional TV giants. Streaming TV viewership in the US (including live and on-demand) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nielsen-streaming-popularity-vs-cable-164457813.html">overtook cable for the first time</a> last summer.

## The best DACs for Apple Music Lossless in 2023

<p>The “Apple effect” can be as helpful as it is infuriating. A good technology can exist for years, and many won’t care until it gets the Cupertino seal of approval. To that end, a lot of people are about to start caring about “high resolution” audio as the company launched its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-now-available-on-supported-devices-094540982.html">upgraded music service</a> to the masses.</p><p>But as many were quick to point out, some of Apple’s own products <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-explained-153046070.html">don’t necessarily support</a> the higher sample rate and bit-depths on offer. No worries, there’s a dongle for that. (And there are options for Android and the desktop, too.)&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As hinted, it's not just Apple in on the hi-resolution game: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-11-qobuz-drops-lossy-music-streaming.html">Qobuz</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-12-tidal-hifi-dolby-atmos-music.html">Tidal</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-18-deezer-hifi-on-mobile-and-web.html">Deezer</a> have been doing it for a while, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-hifi-select-markets-premium-cd-quality-audio-2021-165438547.html">Spotify</a> is planning on introducing its own version soon. The products in this guide will play nice with any of these services, aside from Tidal's MQA, which is a little more specific (and we have options for that as well).</p><h2>Why do I need new hardware to listen to music?</h2><figure><img alt="The best DACs for Apple Music Lossless 2021" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/2cc73eb0-c9de-11eb-afdf-c4eb8bff6f7b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The short answer is, you don’t. You can play “hi-res” audio files on most phones and PCs, you just might not be getting the full experience. If your device’s audio interface tops out at 44.1 or 48kHz (which is fairly common and covers the vast majority of music online) then that’s the experience you’ll get. If you want to enjoy music at a higher sample rate and bit-depth (aka resolution), you’ll need an interface that supports it and wired headphones.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out that “lossless” and “hi-res” are related terms, but not the same thing and will vary from service to service. Apple uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless">ALAC encoding</a> which <em>is </em>compressed, but without “loss” to the quality (unlike the ubiquitous .aac or .mp3 file formats). CDs were generally mastered to at least 16-bit / 44.1kHz which is the benchmark that Apple is using for its definition of lossless. In audio circles, a general consensus is that hi-res is anything with a sample rate <em>above</em> 44.1kHz. Increasingly, though, the term is being used for anything 96kHz and above.</p><p>This, of course, isn’t only about Apple’s new streaming formats. External DACs and audio interfaces are a great way to upgrade your listening experience generally. Especially if you want to get into the world of more exotic (read: pricey) headphones, as they often even require a DAC to provide enough clean signal to drive them. For audiophile headphones, a phone or laptop’s built-in sound chip often doesn’t have the oomph needed.</p><h3>Okay, but can’t I just use the headphone adapter for my phone?</h3><p>No. Well, yes, but see above. A Lightning or USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter often <em>is</em> an audio interface and most of the ones you’re buying for $7 (or that come free in the box) do not support hi-res audio beyond 48kHz / 24-bit. Android is a little more complicated, as some adapters are “passive” and really just connect you to the phone’s internal DAC like old school headphones. Others (active ones) have a DAC built-in and good luck finding out what your specific phone and the in-box adapter delivers. (Hint: connect it to a PC and see if it comes up as an audio interface. You might find some details there if it does).</p><h2>What is a “DAC,” though?</h2><figure><img alt="Best DACs for Apple Music Lossless in 2021." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/0d3d0720-c9e1-11eb-bff3-69fe89e400be" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele / Engadget</div></figure><p>A DAC takes the digital (D) music from your phone or computer and converts (C) it into analog (A) sound you can hear. All phones and PCs have them, but since handsets moved to USB-C, Lightning or Bluetooth for music, the task of converting that signal was generally outsourced to either your adapter or your wireless headphones.</p><p>DACs can be used with phones, laptops and desktops but tend to be much simpler than a regular external audio interface. One basic distinction is that DACs are usually for listening only whereas an audio interface might have ports to plug in microphones and instruments (but an external audio interface is also technically a DAC).</p><p>The benefit of DACs is that they tend to be lightweight, making them more suitable for mobile use, although it still gets a little tricky with the iPhone as you still might need to add another dongle to make it play nice with Lightning. Also, not all DACs support all the higher audio resolutions. Most require external power or an onboard battery, though some can use the power from whatever you plug them into — in which case expect a hit to your battery life. Below are some of our picks for a variety of scenarios.</p><h2>Best for Android users looking for a simple, affordable option: Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter</h2><p></p><p>Okay, you were expecting serious outboard gear and we start by showing you a basic adapter? Yes, because <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDgyV0c1VlRLP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlvLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MmE4OWIwYS0wM2Q0LTRkMjctOTdhNi03ZmI4YTg1YjI1NDMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcHj8mwWLcaFRqO1pWFQ54fJF7kdWsAm9fcLf7ptNwtb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB082WG5VTK">this one</a> supports 96kHz audio (24-bit) and is about as straightforward as you can get. Simply plug into your USB-C device (or USB-A with an… adapter), connect your headphones and away you go. There are no buttons, no controls, nothing to charge.</p><p>While this dongle doesn’t support 192kHz, the move up to 96kHz is still firmly in the “hi-res” audio category, and its super low profile and ease of use make it a great option for those that want an audio quality bump without going full-bore external DAC.</p><p>Of course, this dongle is best suited to devices with a USB-C port such as the iPad Pro, MacBook or most Android phones. As noted earlier, it’s possible your Android already supports hi-res audio and a simple passive dongle is all you need, but given the price and quality of this one, at least you know what you’re getting, as the specific details of audio support for every Android phone out there are often hard to find.</p><p>The downside is that this adapter won’t do much to help drive higher impedance headphones, so it’s less suited to audiophiles who really need more power to drive their favorite cans. I used this on both an Android phone and an iMac and it worked just fine, although with Apple computers you need to head to the Audio/MIDI settings first to make sure you’re getting the highest quality available.</p><h2>Best for streamlined desktop use with high-end headphones: Apogee Groove</h2><p></p><p>Apogee gear is usually found in the studio.

We’re stepping up the sound quality here with support for 192 kHz (24-bit), which will cover everything from Apple’s new lossless service.</p><p>Connecting your iPhone to the Groove is a little more complicated.

In short, it gets a bit “dongly” but it works if you want something for your desktop first, that can do double duty on iPhone. Android support is a little hit and miss, though you would still need a way to feed it power while in use.</p><p>Once you’re set up, just plug in your headphones and you’re away. The rubberized base of the Groove stops it from shifting around on your desk, and the large buttons make controlling volume a breeze, with LED feedback to show you volume levels.</p><p>Audio sounds dynamic, with a generous bump in gain over whatever you’re plugging it into likely offers.

You’ll still need an adapter for phones (USB-A to Lightning or USB-A to USB-C for Android) but otherwise, it’s plug and play. There’s no volume control, just one 3.5mm headphone jack and a color-changing LED (to tell you what sample rate the track you’re listening to is using).</p><p>At $300, it’s a pricey proposition, but the cable spaghetti of some devices or the sheer heft of others, means the Dragonfly’s small footprint and rugged simplicity make it refreshingly discreet and simple. AudioQuest also offers two cheaper models, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BdWRpb1F1ZXN0LURyYWdvbkZseS1CbGFjay1QcmVhbXAtSGVhZHBob25lL2RwL0IwMURQNUpISEk_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taW8tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjcyYTg5YjBhLTAzZDQtNGQyNy05N2E2LTdmYjhhODViMjU0MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATb1meda6ExmxPGOZBcMTOdJK1eFxlCjgidyPHq6H5bo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAudioQuest-DragonFly-Black-Preamp-Headphone%2Fdp%2FB01DP5JHHI">starting at $100</a> that are likely more than good enough for most people.</p><p>Don’t let the Dragonfly’s size and lack of controls fool you, the Cobalt throws out some serious, high quality sound. According to AudioQuest, the maximum resolution has been intentionally limited to 96kHz for the “optimal” experience, and that’s plenty enough to cover what you’ll get from most music services.</p><p>The output from the in-built headphone amp will make your phone’s audio feel positively wimpy by comparison, and the powerful internal sound processing chip delivers great quality audio with a wide soundstage across a range of genres and formats.</p><p>One extra trick up the Dragonfly’s sleeve is native support for Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) files. This is the preferred format of Tidal, so if that’s your service of choice, the Dragonfly is ideal.</p><h2>Best for super high resolution: Fiio Q3</h2><p></p><p>Fiio has been a popular name in the portable DAC scene for a while now, and for good reason. The products deliver solid audio quality, support all manner of resolutions and are compatible with a wide range of devices. The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9GaWlPLVEzLUFLNDQ2MkRBQy1UZWNobm9sb2d5LU1vYmlsZVBob25lL2RwL0IwOEs4R1hDSko_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taW8tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjcyYTg5YjBhLTAzZDQtNGQyNy05N2E2LTdmYjhhODViMjU0MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaovRcXZxP_3kx2spSSN8UF6YMp7OvzdlgV3zOVvNCdJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFiiO-Q3-AK4462DAC-Technology-MobilePhone%2Fdp%2FB08K8GXCJJ">Q3</a> is bigger than the previous options on this list (it’s about 1cm shorter than an iPhone 4), but remains fully portable. There are even some goofy silicone bands so you can strap it to your phone, rather than have a flappy, heavy appendage.</p><p>For users on the go, the Q3’s built-in battery (good for about eight hours) means you won’t need to drain the power on whatever you’re plugging it into. It also means mobile users won’t need a dreaded second cable. Throw in support for <em>three</em> different size headphone jacks (sadly, ¼-inch isn’t one of them) and you have a DAC that will serve you souped-up sounds wherever you are and whatever you’re listening to.</p><p>There isn’t a display, which you might expect for something this size, but there is an LED that changes color when you’re listening to something higher than 48kHz, so you can tell which tracks in your streaming service’s library really are higher-res. The dedicated volume control doubles as a power knob and there’s also a “bass boost” switch just like the good old days. On top of the USB-C input, there’s also the option for analog audio sources via the 3.5mm port.</p><p>Even if you’re not listening to high sample rate music, the Q3 sounds fantastic. The difference in volume, punch and dynamic range that comes through in songs that sounded flat and dense when listening directly through a phone or laptop was remarkable. Throw in support for all the hertz and bit-depths that you’ll likely ever need and what’s not to like? Especially as the Q3 comes in cheaper than some of the less capable options in this guide (the slight extra heft will be a key factor here).</p><h2>Best for high resolution / fans of Tidal: iFi Hip Dac</h2><p></p><p>If this were a spec race, it’d be a photo finish between Fiio’s Q3 and <a href="https://amzn.to/3pDjhsI">iFi’s Hip Dac</a>. Like the Q3, the Hip Dac blows right past support for 192kHz right up to 384kHz. It also offers balanced output via 4.4mm headphones which is rare to find on consumer headphones, but some higher-end cans offer it for those who want to eliminate any potential interference. There’s also an internal battery, bass boost and a very similar form-factor to the Q3.</p><p>For anyone interested in either of these two it might come down to a single feature. Be that the highest sample rate it can support (Q3 wins) or its ability to decode Tidal’s MQA files (in which case, you want the Hip Dac).</p><p>The sound out of this thing takes on the Q3 blow for blow and even the same knurled volume control is here. But let’s be honest, the fact it looks like (and was named after) a hip flask is clearly also a major selling point. Though it's worth mentioning the Hip Dac takes a female USB cable, supplied in the box. But this does mean you'll need to use the Camera Kit to get into the iPhone, whereas the Q3 works with one single provided cable.</p><p>Regardless, it’s another robust option that will more than cover most bases for most people. As with the Q3, the internal battery means you won’t need to feed it power while in use (estimated eight hours) and connecting it to your phone or computer is the same; as long as you can pipe a USB cable into it, you’re good to go.</p><h2>Best for desktop warriors: Focusrite Scarlett 2i2</h2><p></p><p>Only looking for a desktop option? Then a good old fashioned audio interface might be the best choice for you. <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Gb2N1c3JpdGUtU2NhcmxldHQtQXVkaW8tSW50ZXJmYWNlLVRvb2xzL2RwL0IwN1FSNzNUNjY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taW8tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjcyYTg5YjBhLTAzZDQtNGQyNy05N2E2LTdmYjhhODViMjU0MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcKAc__ifo0JpOUhioAN7N8pPf-tOnA5SqurGvoHkHhV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFocusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools%2Fdp%2FB07QR73T66">Focusrite’s Scarlett</a> series has near-legendary status at this point and an eye-wateringly high review ratio on Amazon for a good reason: It does what it does very very well.</p><p>Most current laptops and desktops can probably handle at least 96kHz audio, but with the Scarlett you can be sure you are getting the full 192kHz when available and the dedicated audio processors and headphone amps will do a much better job of it.</p><p>The main benefit here is the general upgrade you will be giving to your PC. Not only will your listening experience be enhanced, but you’ll be able to plug in microphones and instruments if streaming or recording are your thing, all in one device and all for about the same price as some of the more mobile-oriented devices on this list.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html?src=rss

## The best passive bookshelf speakers for most people

<p>Vinyl has been on a resurgence for some time, and the pandemic somehow only accelerated that. It’s got many out there looking to upgrade from a cheap Crosley turntable and build out their first HiFi system. Of course, there are multiple pieces that go into building a decent stereo, but perhaps the most important is the speakers. If your speakers don’t sound good, it basically doesn’t matter what you connect them to.</p><h2>Active vs. Passive Speakers</h2><p>This is understandably the part of their setup that people likely spend the most time researching. And you have to make a number of choices. One of the biggest is: active or passive? Both have their advantages, but for the sake of this guide we’re going to focus on passive speakers, which require a separate amplifier.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Active speakers have a built-in amplifier. Usually, the two things are specifically designed to work together, which means you're getting a more faithful version of the manufacturer’s aural vision. And since you don’t need an external amplifier, active speakers also take up less room. While active speakers are more expensive than passive, the fact that you need to buy an amp to power passive speakers means the savings aren’t as great as they might initially seem. The primary benefit of passive is greater flexibility. You can’t go out and buy a new high-end amplifier and connect your active speakers to it; you’re stuck with what’s built in. Also, since active speakers require power, you’ll have to make sure they’re near an outlet.</p><figure><img alt="Passive Bookshelf Speaker Guide" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3049351-d9bf-11eb-ae7f-fe41bc844706" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>We’re also putting a cap on our spending for this guide: a somewhat arbitrary $600. Anything over that and you’re starting to get into budget audiophile territory. It also basically limits us to bookshelf speakers between five and six inches. While you can certainly get floorstanding speakers for that much, the quality of the drivers will likely be better on bookshelf speakers at the same price point.</p><h2>A note about testing</h2><p>Obviously, I could not test <em>every </em>set of five to six inch bookshelf speakers under $600, but I’ve tried enough and done enough research to feel confident in my recommendations. I’m sure there are other good speakers out there, but I don’t think anyone is going to regret buying the sets here.</p><p>Additionally, speaker preference is largely subjective. But I did my best to be as objective as possible. All of the speakers were connected to a Pyle PSS6 switcher with the same wire for quick side-by-side comparisons. After I’d tested them all myself I enlisted multiple people to listen blindly and then rank them based on their preference to see if their opinions lined up with my own. Testing included playing new and vintage vinyl, as well as streaming songs from Spotify.</p><p>Also worth noting: I am not an audiophile. This is not a guide for audiophiles. I want my music to sound good, but I’m not about to drop the price of a used sedan on my stereo. My setup includes an Audio Technica Audio-Technica AT-LP120 and a Chromecast Audio running through a Technics SA-EX110. This is not fancy stuff, but it is certainly an upgrade from a Crosley Suitcase turntable or even a higher-end Sonos sound system.</p><h2>The best for most people: Audioengine HDP6</h2><p></p><p>Honestly, a lot of the speakers I tested sounded eerily similar to each other. But not the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BdWRpb2VuZ2luZS1QYXNzaXZlLUJvb2tzaGVsZi1TdGFuZC1tb3VudC1TcGVha2Vycy9kcC9CMDFMTUoyTlk4P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWluLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmYmM3NWJmMC05Y2RlLTQ5ZjEtYTA2Ni0wNzQzYjJiYzRhNzIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfHTEMbMttPF_8JHtUsc6hLZdtO_SGfnsYG4E5RAh8tW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAudioengine-Passive-Bookshelf-Stand-mount-Speakers%2Fdp%2FB01LMJ2NY8">$399 Audioengines</a>. They had a much brighter sound and a lot more clarity than all the others, with the exception of a significantly more expensive KEF pair. The particular pair I tried also came in a gorgeous “walnut” enclosure that helped them stand out in a sea of utilitarian black.</p><p>The HDP6s deliver especially strong mids that shine when it comes to vocals and guitars. But they sound quite balanced across the entire spectrum. Towering compositions like Nine Inch Nails “The Day the Whole World Went Away” sprung to life and revealed nuances that, frankly, I’ve never noticed before even on headphones. And <em>Promises</em>, the recent album from Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra, was so enveloping it made me want to throw my current floorstanding speakers in the trash.</p><p>While no bookshelf speakers on their own are going to be able to deliver the sort of room-shaking thump that floorstanding speakers or a subwoofer can deliver, the HDP6 performed admirably with bass-heavy songs. They didn’t have the most low end of my test units, but drums and bass were still punchy and clear.</p><h2>For those who want the best sound: KEF Q150</h2><p></p><p>If your number one concern is sound quality, regardless of anything else, check out the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3c3db68e-8b44-47ba-9267-2a00d1409126&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Crutchfield&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzYzNkYjY4ZS04YjQ0LTQ3YmEtOTI2Ny0yYTAwZDE0MDkxMjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3J1dGNoZmllbGQuY29tL1MtaHZkSVNyZnBkaHMvcF85OTFRMTUwQi9LRUYtUTE1MC1CbGFjay5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmYmM3NWJmMC05Y2RlLTQ5ZjEtYTA2Ni0wNzQzYjJiYzRhNzIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcwyxFR43_HrsJeRlKUM1Z5EJ4M6wBSvFFfSoXLsMpLv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crutchfield.com%2FS-hvdISrfpdhs%2Fp_991Q150B%2FKEF-Q150-Black.html">Q150s</a>. These are the entry-level option from noted audiophile brand KEF and the only speakers that beat out the Audioengines in any of my blind taste tests. They didn’t come out on top every time, and some people had trouble deciding between the two, but ultimately I think the KEF’s have the slight edge in pure sound quality. They had a bit more volume at the extreme lower and higher ends of the spectrum. It added a certain sparkle to tracks like the Beach Boys’ “Wouldn’t it Be Nice,” while Run the Jewels’ “JU$T” hit a little bit harder than on the HDP6s. The difference can be subtle depending on what you’re listening to, but it’s undeniable in side-by-side testing.</p><p>The audio profile of the KEF is similar to that of the Audioengines. They’re both much brighter and with a lot more treble and midrange than all the other speakers in this roundup. If you’re into listening to classical or jazz on high quality vinyl, these are going to deliver exactly the sort of frequency response you’re looking for.</p><p>What stops the Q150 from topping this list is the list price. At $600 they're essentially tied for the most expensive speakers I tested.

While the Q150s sounded slightly better than the HDP6s to my ears, they weren’t necessarily $200 better. At the time of this writing, however, the Q150s were on sale for $400, making them a compelling option to the Audioengines.</p><h2>For the bargain hunter: JBL A130</h2><p></p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3c3db68e-8b44-47ba-9267-2a00d1409126&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Crutchfield&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzYzNkYjY4ZS04YjQ0LTQ3YmEtOTI2Ny0yYTAwZDE0MDkxMjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3J1dGNoZmllbGQuY29tL1MtakJzRnh5YVExa1EvcF8xMDlTQTEzMEFNL0pCTC1TdGFnZS1BMTMwLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZiYzc1YmYwLTljZGUtNDlmMS1hMDY2LTA3NDNiMmJjNGE3MiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZgP0261Rv0ewK2AdedpAL0wZmVHlu_iEiTGRwR_0EAn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crutchfield.com%2FS-jBsFxyaQ1kQ%2Fp_109SA130AM%2FJBL-Stage-A130.html">JBLs</a> were pretty consistently in the middle of the pack when it came to listener preference. They’re not as bright as the KEFs and the Audioengines, but not quite as muddy at the lowend as the Polk S15s. If you’re just looking for a decent set of speakers and don’t sweat over spec sheets, or if you’re primarily listening to streaming music and only putting on vinyl occasionally, these are a great option if you can find them on sale.</p><h2>For those that need more bass: ELAC Debut 2.0 DB6.2</h2><p></p><p>Ok, so these speakers break our rules a bit but, if you opt for the slightly larger 6.5-inch DB6.2s, instead of the DB5.2s, you get a lot more thump at the bottom end.

## Nothing’s $149 Ear 2 wireless buds have improved connectivity and more customization

<p>Nothing’s revealed its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-will-show-off-the-ear-2-earbuds-on-march-22nd-152839424.html">second-generation</a> Ear wireless buds. The eye-catching design sticks around and the company has tried to address some of the issues that bedeviled the original, with some much-needed improvements to connectivity and setup. Fortunately, the price of the <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/ear-2">Nothing Ear 2</a> is the same as the Ear 1: $149, which undercut a lot of the established true wireless competition.</p><p>Nothing hasn’t redesigned its buds and case – they look very similar side-by-side – but it’s made a handful of incremental changes. Most of them focus on the case, which is smaller and slimmer. The outer part of the case is still transparent, but part of the white structure is now exposed. There’s no textured surface, just a soft-touch panel. Nothing claims the see-through plastic is harder to scratch and damage than the original Ear 1. In my pockets and bag, getting shuffled around with keys or other objects has already left a noticeable scratch on the case. I also worry that this exposed panel could get muckier easier – the curse of all white gadgets.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Nothing Ear 2 wireless buds impressions" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/c02e9ff2-c8aa-11ed-bd2e-ff01ded44c01" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Tackling one the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-1-impressions-release-date-price-130026767.html">bigger complaints I had with the Ear 1</a>, Nothing moved the microphones and antenna inside the buds to improve connectivity and stability – something it also did with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-stick-hands-on-impressions-090050085.html">cheaper Ear Stick</a>. The company’s first wireless buds were often finickity when pairing. The company has also changed the antenna structure for better reliability, and the initial pairing process seems to be less fussy and smoother than its predecessor. It’s also, finally, added dual connectivity, making it easier to switch between your phone and laptop.</p><p>Microphone placements have also been repositioned to reduce wind noise on calls, but I didn’t notice major improvements over the Ear 1. Nothing said its Clear Voice tech was tuned to just shy of 2 million sounds on the Ear 1 in order to filter them out, while that was closer to 20 million on its newest buds. However, I made several test calls, and I was still difficult to hear when it was windy.</p><p>Nothing says it improved sound detail with polyurethane components for clearer low frequencies (it’s been a while since a company has sold polyurethane <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-04-03-nokia-lumia-900-review.html">as a feature</a>), and graphene for brighter highs. There’s also a dual chamber design for a wider soundstage.</p><p>The Ear 2 will also be compatible with Hi-res audio at launch, although they weren’t at time of writing, and are compatible with the LHDC 5.0 codec, which all means they should work with premium audio standards where you can find them.</p><p>But does it sound all that different? Swapping between the Ear 1 and Ear 2, the newest version does offer clearer sound in the trebles and the bass has more oomph than before. But,  compared to wireless buds that are often hundred dollars more expensive, like the AirPods Pro or Sony’s latest flagship buds, they don’t quite stand up, coming off a little flat.</p><section><img alt="Nothing Ear 2 wireless buds impressions" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/c02e9ff1-c8aa-11ed-b7df-54b2020500dd" /></section><p>Nothing’s latest buds offer three levels of active noise cancellation (ANC): low, mid and high. The Ear 2 also offer a personalized ANC profile calibrated to your own hearing. The test is a lengthy five minutes, roughly, with a test dedicated to each bud. Your mileage and ears will different, but I didn’t note any marked improvements after calibration.  The ANC isn’t perfect: At the highest levels of active noise cancellation still seemed to struggle with the reverberations on trains and the subway, leading to a jarring noise echo in my left bud while using ANC, despite recalibrating the buds several times in a bid to fix it. It’s, fortunately, happening much less often following a firmware update over the weekend. There’s also an adaptive ANC mode that will flit between levels depending on the noise around you, hopefully reducing the toll on battery life.</p><p>Nothing says there are battery improvements across both the buds (roughly an hour more, to over six hours) and the case, which can juice the buds for up to 36 hours of listening (with ANC off), two hours longer than the Ear 1. You should get 8 hours of audio from a 10-minute charge, too. There’s still wireless charging too, if you want it.</p><p>Setting up and switching between ANC modes is done through the updated Nothing X app, but the Ear 2, predictably, work best with Nothing’s Phone 1, with drop-down shortcuts and easier access to the fine-grain controls.</p><p>There’s also a custom sound profile calibration to hone in on frequencies you might not hear – thanks, aging. The equalizer, again inside the companion app, offers more options. You switch between treble- or bass-centric modes, a balanced mode and one dedicated to voice. My custom sound profile also came with the ability to augment my weaker audio frequencies I had trouble hearing with a richer profile, alongside the standard recommended mode. You can also tweak the intensity with a slider.</p><figure><img alt="Nothing Ear 2 wireless buds impressions" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/c02e9ff0-c8aa-11ed-bfda-21bfdd367d82" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Nothing may have added many minor features and improvements but the Ear 2 isn’t shaking up the status quo like its predecessor. Given the eye-catching hardware of the Ear 1, I wasn’t expecting a major redesign (they don’t need it) and the company has addressed my biggest problems with the first headphones. It’s hard to complain about the range of improvements, including upgraded water and sweat resistance rating: the buds are IP54 rated while the charging case is IP55.</p><p>The <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/ear-2">Ear 2</a> will launch in white on March 28th on Nothing’s own retail site, as well as on Amazon and Kith. Unfortunately, if you were looking to match your black Phone 1, there’s no plan for a black option.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-2-wireless-buds-price-release-date-impressions-153040749.html?src=rss

## Spotify has reportedly spent less than 10 percent of its Joe Rogan apology fund

<p>Spotify's financial apology for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-joe-rogan-deal-value-podcast-205637664.html">Joe Rogan's comments</a> may not amount to much so far. <em>Bloomberg</em> sources <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-22/spotify-has-spent-less-than-10-of-its-100-million-diversity-fund?sref=10lNAhZ9">claim</a> the streaming service has spent less than 10 percent of its $100 million Creator Equity Fund, a pool meant to foster diversity in podcasts and music, in its first year of operation. The company reportedly planned to spend the whole fund over three years, but hasn't had a solid structure for approving spending and has been slow to hire staff. Changing priorities have also hurt the project, the insiders say.</p><p>Unionized workers at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-26-spotify-original-podcasts-parcast.html">Parcast</a>, a Spotify podcast network, have previously criticized the company over a lack of spending. In February, they complained to management that the company had greenlit just $5,000 out of the $100,000 earmarked for diversity plans.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spotify didn't address the funding claims in a statement to Engadget. It instead pointed to projects the fund has supported so far. This includes the LGBTQ music promotion program Glow, marketing campaigns for Black artists like Kaytranada and the recent expansion of the NextGen podcast funding initiative to support development at historically Black colleges and universities. The Creator Equity Fund has also been used to support Latina/Latino creators.</p><p>The firm established the fund after the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-to-remove-neil-young-music-in-joe-rogan-dispute-213539276.html">artist-led backlash</a> to Joe Rogan allegedly enabling the spread of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation through his Spotify-exclusive podcast. While that was the catalyst, critics also pointed to Rogan using racist language and making transphobic statements. Spotify has repeatedly defended signing Rogan in 2020, but has pulled some of the episodes containing racist words. Its deal with the podcaster is rumored to be worth at least $200 million and to last 3.5 years.</p><p>It won't be surprising if Spotify spends more of the diversity fund. However, the apparent lack of spending doesn't help Spotify's case. If the report is accurate, the company has had trouble fulfilling its promise to listeners worried the service is amplifying hate and other dangerous falsehoods.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-has-reportedly-spent-less-than-10-percent-of-its-joe-rogan-apology-fund-151548112.html?src=rss

## The Tripod Desk Pro is a portable standing desk that upgraded my WFH setup

<p>At Engadget, we’ve covered plenty of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/standing%20desk/">standing desks</a> and peripherals that have changed up our work-from-home setups, but everyone’s use case (and living arrangements) differ. Until now, I’ve struggled to find a standing desk that balances versatility and compactness.</p><p>I live in a small, one-bedroom apartment in London, usually working on a dining table instead of a work desk. I don’t use a second screen (I know I should) as I prefer to take my work computer to a coffee shop or across London without losing utility. I do have a wireless keyboard and trackpad, which I usually break out during hectic writing deadlines. But, beyond an IKEA laptop shelf, I’ve never found a standing desk to which I’d be willing to dedicate a corner of my home. I also didn’t want to be reminded of work while relaxing on a Saturday morning.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But Intension's <a href="https://www.intension-design.com/tripod-desk-pro">tripod standing desk</a>, with a collapsible design and adjustable height, might be the solution. There are several ‘portable’ standing desks, but Intension’s ‘pro’ model, with particularly industrial legs and an optional wheel add-on, ticked many boxes. The desk surface can be fixed between 28 and 53 inches, making it a suitable work surface for most people.</p><p>The tripod setup offers more versatility than typical standing desks, as you can set it up at knee height and use it for board games or puzzles. (People still do puzzles, okay?) The desk can also be angled and fixed if you prefer to type or write at an incline, too. Along one edge, there are two ‘laptop stops’ to keep your laptop on the desk surface, even when tilted.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.intension-design.com/tripod-wheels">wheels</a> (an optional add-on) add even more freedom: I can roll the desk into my bedroom if I’m taking conference calls and want to be out of earshot of the running washing machine in the background. Wouldn’t taking your standing desk outside be nice if you have a garden? That’s possible with a tripod desk. As you can see in the pictures, the tripod part of the desk is pretty substantial, so it'll stay there once it’s tightened in place. That said, because of the way the surface is affixed in a uniform line, the desk part can wobble a little.</p><figure><img alt="This portable standing desk upgraded my WFH setup
" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/5ec816e1-c717-11ed-abe6-108cf1635caf" style="height: 1333; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>Talking of the surface, some tripod desks offer work space barely larger than an inflight tray table in economy-comfort class. Fortunately, this one has a 16- by 28-inch surface, leaving enough space for a (light!) secondary screen, your phone and more. I attached my Blue podcasting mic to an articulating arm and clamped it to the far edge of the desk.</p><p>Beyond using a standing desk for everyday PC work, it’s come into its own when I need to film videos for this job, with the perfect space for my autocue (my laptop) and my mic.</p><p>It’s a lot more substantial than a typical camera tripod, but also so much sturdier. Oddly enough, the wheelbase is a solid, adjustable triangular base that makes it feel even more rigid. Each wheel can also be locked in place and there are also rubberized feet on the tripod, too. Once it's set up, the feet are unlikely to move independently, whether on hard floors, carpet or rugs.</p><p>Its maneuverability is the best part of this tripod desk – even when it’s not in use. While testing, I didn’t deconstruct it and pack it away often, but the ability to do so when I have visitors over or need extra floor space is a boon. Most of the time, I can wheel it into a corner, behind a shelf, out of sight.</p><figure><img alt="Intension Tripod Standing Desk Pro" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/39c6cb40-c71a-11ed-bfff-f85ad7d20483" style="height: 1333; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>The pro model tripod is so incredibly hardy it would probably outlast several items of static furniture. It’s a shame the surface is a little shaky – if they’re looking to refresh this model, a cross strut to stabilize the surface would be a smart place to begin.. It’s not enough of an angle for cups to slide off, but it does feel oddly precarious when the tripod itself is so substantial – and when the desk costs $400.</p><p>I tested out the Intension Tripod Standing Desk Pro as a simple standing desk, but its versatility meant I used it for more than just laptop work – it even turned into my podcasting surface of choice. If you’re looking for an even lighter, petite tripod desk – or just a cheaper option –  Intension’s basic option is currently on sale for under $200.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-tripod-desk-pro-is-a-portable-standing-desk-that-upgraded-my-wfh-setup-150037026.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon is once again refreshing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-omni-qled-announced-specs-availability-174942741.html">Fire TV sets</a>, but the focus now is less on whiz-bang features and more on where those sets will fit. The 4K-capable Fire TV Omni QLED line now comes in smaller 43-, 50- and 55-inch models. These TVs start at a lower $450 but still offer up to 96-zone local dimming as well as HDR using Dolby Vision IQ and HDR10+ Adaptive. To no one's surprise, you can expect far-field microphones for Alexa control as well as promises of an upgraded Ambient Experience (always-on art similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-frame-tv-irl-153546368.html">Samsung's The Frame</a>) with "dynamic" pieces that respond to conditions like the time and weather.

The 32-inch 720p and 40-inch 1080p variants aren't based on QLED, require using a remote for Alexa and are limited to HDR based on HDR10 and HLG.

In both cases, the strategy is similar: this is as much about getting a platform and services into your living room as it is selling hardware.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazons-refreshed-fire-tv-omni-qled-lineup-includes-cheaper-smaller-models-140052321.html?src=rss

<p>It seems like every major developer is working on an open-world shooter with co-op and RPG elements. But with <em>Redfall, </em>by drawing inspiration from a number of its previous titles, alongside other standouts in the genre, Arkane Studios has added fun new twists to the typical fps survival game. After getting a chance to go hands-on with a preview build of the game, I’m really excited to see more of how Arkane is adding its own flavor to that formula.</p><p>Set in the fictional island town of Redfall, Massachusetts, your goal is to cleanse the land of the growing vampire invasion. However, these aren’t your standard bloodsucking ghouls. Instead of ancient monsters, these vampires are the result of a science experiment gone wrong. This gives high-ranking vampires powerful psionic abilities that elevate them to near god-like status, which they’ve used to convert some of the surviving townsfolk into a cult. But more importantly, the mashup of sci-fi and supernatural in a contemporary setting has some really neat impacts on gameplay as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="420fb0a36f4a47e6be705a2bdce912d7"></div><p>That’s because, in addition to your standard range of pistols, shotguns and sniper rifles, you’ll have to rely on updated interpretations of iconic vampire killing weapons too, especially since bullets only weaken vampires before you properly finish them off. So alongside your trusty stake, you’ll also have access to things like stake launchers, flare guns and even a high-powered UV beam rifle which adds a new dimension to typical gunplay. On top of that, as a looter shooter, there’s a variety of weapon rarities (from standard to unrivaled) with bonus traits like being able to reload faster or having increased accuracy while moving. And if you’re a fan of a particular combo, you can also craft and customize weapons to suit your playstyle.</p><p>Sadly, while I didn’t have a chance to play them all, <em>Redfall’s</em> cast offers a lot more personality than your typical roster of vampire slayers. There’s robotics engineer Remi, who uses her mechanical companion Bribon to distract enemies while she blasts away. Alternatively, there’s mercenary Jacob who slays foes from afar using his sniper rifle, cloaking device and mystical “Undead Eye,” or Layla, who has special telekinetic abilities that she can use to create shields or launch herself (or party members) into the air for elevated attacks. However, I spent most of my time playing as Devinder, who holds the curious role of being an occult influencer in “cryptozoology”, while also having an interesting mix of both melee and AOE attacks thanks to his electric spear and UV staff that stuns any vampires in its range.</p><figure><img alt="In Redfall, Arkane Studios paints an enchanting but also eerie depiction of a northeastern seaside town that's now overrun with vampires. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/24b4a5f0-c824-11ed-aebe-86abc879720b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p>Then there’s the world itself, which feels alive and fleshed out in a way that many open-world games fail to. Not only does the town of Redfall look like a realistic seaside town (you know aside from the crimson skies and vampires flying around), it's also spooky and atmospheric, and actually gave me chills and goosebumps. In one mission, I even had to resort to smashing all the TVs in a house because the vampires use them to broadcast creepy propaganda to convert more cultists to their side. I mean really, who likes hearing nosferatu whisper in your ear about drinking your fluids?</p><p>Then there are other things like vampire nests, which you can clear out to get loot and experience. That said, if you choose to ignore a nest, you could be in for a tough time later as its influence spreads to cover more ground, while also making enemies harder to kill. And while <em>Redfall’s</em> map isn’t the biggest, it’s really dense, with tons of sidequests ranging from finding a popcorn machine to boost the morale of other survivors, to unlocking bunkers and strongholds hidden throughout the town.</p><figure><img alt="In Redfall, each of the four main characters comes with a unique set of abilities they can use to combat the vampire horde. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/7429d5b0-c824-11ed-8fbf-d341b1e374c0" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p>In a lot of ways, <em>Redfall</em> has clear ties to the stealthy combat in <em>Dishonored</em>, though it actually reminds me most of another franchise: <em>Borderlands</em>. The main difference is that its pacing is a  bit less frenetic, opting instead for a slightly slower, more tactical style of combat, similar to what we got in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-15-prey-2017-hands-on-preview.html"><em>Prey</em></a>. There’s a nifty skill tree that lets you enhance a character's abilities, so you can choose if you want to play more offensively by adding extra damage and range to your attacks, or you can play a support role by focusing on healing and recovery skills. And though my preview was restricted to single-player, I feel like the most fun way to play will be with friends, where you can combo multiple characters' skills in a four-person squad to create some surprising team attacks. I’m not going to lie, having a buddy watching my back would have made the game way less scary, which is a testament to Arkane’s success at creating an eerie atmosphere.</p><div id="60cd0e4ccf1a488c9a720e2558fbae1c"></div><p>My one small complaint is that I wish characters had a dash or roll ability. I often found myself simply circle-strafing while I waited to reload for my abilities to come off cooldown. While Devinder is able to teleport by throwing out a beacon in front of him, it takes a while to do, which makes it feel like it’s better suited to traversing terrain like bridges or cliffs than dodging attacks in the heat of battle.</p><p><em>Redfall </em>isn’t reinventing the genre, but it feels like Arkane has taken the best elements from previous games in the category and mashed them together, while adding its signature blend of polish and creativity. And I  am really looking forward to playing more when it comes out on Xbox and PC later this spring on May 2nd.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/redfall-hands-on-a-creepy-and-creative-twist-on-the-modern-looter-shooter-140010541.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon One's palm-reading technology that can substitute for credit cards and tickets is now available for Panera customers. With this new partnership, the fast casual chain becomes the first national restaurant to let diners use their palm for payments and loyalty points.&nbsp;</p><p>To purchase food, customers will first need to link their MyPanera membership with an Amazon One account. This removes the need to hand over a phone number at the checkout, which traditionally provided the server with available rewards. Palm scans can be used to access loyalty rewards, for payment, or for both.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230322005275/en/Panera-Continues-Loyalty-Innovation-as-the-First-National-Restaurant-to-Use-Amazon-One-for-Loyalty-Identification-and-Payment/">reasons Panera is excited</a> about the prospect of introducing Amazon One in stores is the ability to get to know its customers better. The company claims that being able to identify customers at the checkout will allow servers to recognize names and also their favorite orders, turning &quot;the guest experience into a true and meaningful relationship.&quot; Yes, next time you want a &quot;You pick two&quot; you're going to have to make a friend first. Good luck.</p><p>Amazon One launched in 2020 and has since expanded into a slew of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-one-palm-payment-whole-foods-california-195712253.html">Whole Foods stores</a> (owned by Amazon) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-one-sports-stadiums-music-venues-083245937.html">concert venues</a>. Artists and activists pushed back about the planned move into sports and music events, claiming the technology could provide personal data to government agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>As well as announcing the new partnership, Amazon also confirmed it's now allowing customers to pre-enroll in Amazon One. Panera says Amazon One is already available in two St Louis locations, but has plans to roll it out more widely in the coming months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazons-palm-reading-tech-tested-panera-cafes-133037398.html?src=rss

## Windows 11 security flaw exposes cropped-out screenshot data

<p>It's not just Android phones that are vulnerable to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-vulnerability-allows-bad-actors-to-undo-markup-screenshot-edits-and-redactions-195322267.html">screenshot security flaw</a>. Developer Chris Blume has <a href="https://twitter.com/ProgramMax/status/1638217206180741121">discovered</a> that Windows 11's Snipping Tool falls prey to a similar exploit. The utility doesn't completely erase unused PNG image data, making it possible to recover some of the cropped-out picture and potentially obtain sensitive data. As <em>BleepingComputer</em><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-snipping-tool-privacy-bug-exposes-cropped-image-content/">verified</a> with researcher David Buchanan, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/David3141593/status/1638222624084951040">extract</a> the supposedly hidden info using a slightly modified version of the script used to demonstrate the Android vulnerability.</p><p>The issue doesn't affect some PNG files, including optimized images. You can also wipe the unused data by saving the cropped picture as another file in an image editing tool. JPEG files also leave data from the original screenshot, but the exploit isn't known to work with the format at this stage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="25b8a44e00024778a2a1a4b3df8d79f4"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">holy FUCK.<br /><br />Windows Snipping Tool is vulnerable to Acropalypse too.<br /><br />An entirely unrelated codebase.<br /><br />The same exploit script works with minor changes (the pixel format is RGBA not RGB)<br /><br />Tested myself on Windows 11 <a href="https://t.co/5q2vb6jWOn">https://t.co/5q2vb6jWOn</a><a href="https://t.co/ovJKPr0x5Y">pic.twitter.com/ovJKPr0x5Y</a></p>— David Buchanan (@David3141593) <a href="https://twitter.com/David3141593/status/1638222624084951040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>We've asked Microsoft for comment and will let you know if we hear back. In a statement to <em>BleepingComputer</em>, Microsoft says it's &quot;investigating&quot; the security reports and will &quot;take action as needed&quot; to protect users.</p><p>Buchanan and programmer Simon Aarons recently found a severe &quot;aCropalypse&quot; flaw in the Markup screenshot feature on Google Pixel phones. While Google has since patched the security hole with its March update (now expanded to Pixel 6 phones), the fix only addresses images created after installing the patch. Provided Microsoft releases a corresponding Windows 11 update, existing images may have the same problem.</p><p>The concern, as you might guess, is that an intruder with access to your images might use a script to recover information you intend to hide, such as contacts and business secrets. The culprit could use the info for harassment, blackmail or espionage. While this may not be as much of a headache for locally stored screenshots (you have larger problems if an attacker already has access to your device), it could be very troublesome for unmodified images you save in the cloud.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-security-flaw-exposes-cropped-out-screenshot-data-131519887.html?src=rss

## How to find and cancel your unused subscriptions

<p>Paying a monthly fee for something you never use makes zero financial sense. But subscription overload is real, with dozens of streaming, gaming, dating and even <a href="https://www.fuegobox.com/">hot-sauce delivery services</a> lining up to take a monthly cut of your paycheck. While it’s tough to keep track of everything you signed up for – especially the ones you don’t use – we’ve come up with a few tricks to help thin the ranks of your recurring charges. We included a list of common subscriptions you may have forgotten about, as well as instructions on how to cancel a few of the most unwanted. And for those who could use a little cancellation help, we tested a couple of finance apps that track and nix stuff on your behalf.</p><h2>First things first: Find out what subscriptions you have</h2><p>Before putting this post together, I had no idea how many subscriptions I was paying for. Surprises included a coding game for my kid (that he no longer plays) and a British streaming app I’d gotten for one show (that I finished nearly a year ago). You, too, may not know what subscriptions are quietly subtracting dollars from your accounts. One of the most comprehensive ways to see what you’re paying for is to look at your bank and credit card transactions, performing a search for every transaction in the previous full month. It may be a lot to scroll through, but each monthly subscription will appear at least once in that time frame.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another approach is to search for welcome and thank you emails, since most services send out an initial message confirming your new subscription. Using the advanced search function in your email, enter the words “welcome” or “thank you” in the subject field, and variations on the words “annual” “subscribing” and “membership” in the general or keyword search fields. You should get a decent idea of the things you’ve signed up for, but may have to wade through lots of promotional emails before you find the services you actually subscribed to. This method isn’t as comprehensive as going through your banking statements, but it could help you find annual subscriptions that won’t show up in a month’s worth of transactions.</p><p>Sometimes it’s helpful to simply see a list of common subscriptions people pay for (and often forget about). Here are a few:</p><p><strong>Entertainment</strong><br />•  <a class="rapid-with-clickid"

through the same app. Some app developers will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-netflix-spotify-reader-apps-link-sites-payment-044147213.html">instead direct you</a> to their website to pay for a subscription.

If you want to go back to the free version of Spotify, you’ll need to do so on a web browser, as you can’t cancel through the app. Luckily, you can use either a mobile browser or a desktop version.</p><p>1. Head to <a href="https://accounts.spotify.com/en/login">Spotify</a> on a web browser and log in.<br />2.  If you haven’t logged in via the web before, you’ll see a button for Web Player or Account Overview; select Account Overview.<br />3.

Non-Android users can cancel through a web browser. If you’re not watching enough live TV to justify the $65 per month, here’s what to do.</p><p><strong>On an Android device:</strong><br />1.  Open the YouTube TV app.<br />2.  Tap your profile circle at the top right.<br />3.  Tap on Settings, then tap on Membership.<br />4.  Under your membership details, tap Manage.<br />5.  Click on Cancel Membership and follow the prompts.</p><p><strong>Via a web browser:</strong><br />1.  Head to <a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/">YouTubeTV</a>.<br />2.

Click on Cancel Membership and follow the prompts.</p><h2>Apps that can help</h2><p>Some finance apps will track and manage your subscriptions for you. We researched a bunch and tried out a couple of the best to see how they can help. Note that some of these cost money, and adding another subscription to your life can feel counterproductive when you’re trying to do the opposite.</p><h3><strong>Rocket Money</strong></h3><p>Owned by the same company as Rocket Mortgages, <a href="https://www.rocketmoney.com/">Rocket Money</a> is a finance app that connects with your bank account and offers to help you budget and track your overall spending, in addition to managing your subscriptions. You’ll pay for the app using a sliding scale from $3 to $12 per month for the premium version, which includes automated cancellation and other features. To access the free version at sign-up, move the slider to the left until you reach $0.</p><p>Once you’ve linked your account, navigating to the Recurring tab gives you an overview of your subscriptions. I liked that you can access this using either the mobile or desktop app. After linking my accounts, it reminded me of an upcoming renewal for a magazine I don’t read and hosting fees for a website I no longer need. Canceling both of those would save me nearly $200 in a year. Unfortunately, my monthly Apple One payment and the HBO Max access that I pay for through my Samsung TV didn’t show up as recurring subscriptions. That could be due to how my bank lists the transaction, but I’d like to have seen those on the list, too.</p><p>Next to each transaction is a three dot menu, which includes an option to “cancel this for me” for Premium subscribers. Click and you’ll see contact methods to handle it yourself or a button to have Rocket Money do it. After you provide your username and password for the service, you’ll get an email confirmation that tells you the process could take up to ten days to complete. When I had Rocket Money cancel Paramount Plus for me, I got an email later that night saying the cancellation was complete.</p><p>While it’s not a magic program that zaps your subscriptions away, Rocket Money could save you a few steps. Seeing (most of) your recurring charges together is also helpful for staying on top of things. It’s up to you whether the Premium charge (and taking on another subscription) is worth the cancellation service.</p><h3><strong>Mint</strong></h3><p>Brought to you by Intuit, whose products include TurboTax and QuickBooks, <a href="https://mint.intuit.com/how-mint-works/subscription-management">Mint</a> works a lot like Rocket Money, syncing with your bank accounts and offering to cancel subscriptions on your behalf. Here, though, subscription management is only available on the iOS and Android apps. That’s fine for mobile bankers, but disappointing for those who prefer using a desktop.</p><p>When I tried to get a picture of what I’m paying for each month, the app told me no subscriptions were found in my transaction history, despite the fact that I pay for many. We reached out to Mint to find out if this is just a glitch on my end, or if there's something else going on.

## Tesla’s Wireless Charging Platform is well-made and exorbitant

<p>It kind of makes sense that Tesla would make wireless chargers. After all, when you think of the company, you think electric vehicles and their Superchargers (at least, after you force the image of Elon Musk out of your mind). But wireless charging is a slightly different beast that requires understanding of magnetic fields and expertise in power transfer technologies. That’s where Freepower, formerly known as Aira, comes in. Founder Jake Slatnick started the company in 2017 and told Engadget that it has spent the last five and a half years developing a “much more advanced form of Qi,” the industry-wide standard for wireless charging.</p><p>As a “technology supplier” according to Slatnick, Freepower doesn’t typically make products for consumers, besides the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/11/nomads-new-base-station-pro-offers-a-taste-of-what-apples-airpower-had-promised/"><ins>Base Station chargers it made in collaboration with</ins></a> Nomad Goods. When the Pro model launched in 2019, it was considered an enticing alternative to Apple’s canceled AirPower charging mat. Both promised to deliver power to up to three devices without you having to carefully align them to the charging coils. But the Base Station series is no longer supported and had compatibility issues that affected its charging speeds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In December last year, Tesla and Freepower announced <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/wireless-charging-platform">the Wireless Charging Platform</a>, and it might be a spiritual successor to the Base Station Pro. Like many of the car maker’s other products, though, it’s almost ludicrously expensive. At $300, Tesla’s offering is twice the cost of the priciest item on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-multi-device-wireless-chargers-130020900.html"><ins>our roundup of the best multi-device wireless chargers</ins></a>. Still, diehard fans might not mind the premium, and there are some unique characteristics here that could explain the delta (although I maintain that it’s still too much to justify).</p><p>For that money, you’re at least getting what feels like a sturdy, premium product. The charging platform is a dense, solid block about 220mm (8.66inches) wide that weighs 747 grams (1.64 pounds). Together with the magnetic stand that props it up at an angle, the whole thing comes in at 1.02kg (2.26 pounds), which is pretty hefty. It’s not like you’re going to be carrying this around in your backpack so it’s not a huge deal, but it’s worth noting in case you were hoping to take it on your next trip.</p><figure><img alt="The Tesla Wireless Charging Platform with three devices on it. From left to right, they are a Pixel 6 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro and AirPods Pro 2." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/68305310-c85b-11ed-9e7f-272f163c5f3f" style="height: 1000; width: 1500;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Aside from that minor note, there isn’t much to complain about. The alcantara fabric on the surface provides a grippy texture for my slippery phones, and the power cable is an ample 60 inches long, so it easily extends to my side table from the nearest outlet. The wire also tucks away neatly into the understated slot so cable management fans can rejoice. The platform and the included 65-watt charger all feature an angular style that’s reminiscent of the Cybertruck, in a sleek all-matte-black finish. It’s not much to look at, until you take a closer look and start noticing the little aesthetic touches.</p><p>While Tesla was responsible for the charging platform’s appearance, Freepower handled the tech. Thanks to the 30 coils embedded beneath the surface, with the loops overlapping each other in layers, you should not only be able to charge up to 3 devices at once, but it also doesn’t matter where you place them. This is the idea of “spatial freedom” that Slatnick mentioned, where, unlike Magsafe or other Qi products, you won’t have to align your handset with the rings on the charger to establish a connection.</p><p>I enjoyed being able to throw my iPhone 14 Pro down haphazardly  and not worry about lining up circles or waiting for magnets to click into place. It was also nice that when I shifted the iPhone slightly to make room for my Pixel 6 Pro, the charging wasn’t interrupted.</p><p>One tiny thing I noticed was a slight delay of a few seconds from the time I placed my phone on the surface till the charging indicator appeared onscreen. This is a tad slower than other Qi chargers I’ve experienced, but not a major concern. The actual charging speed is comparable to Magsafe and other Qi devices that support 15W rates. My iPhone 14 Pro got from 57 percent to 65 percent in 22 minutes, which is in line with my experience with an older Belkin wireless charger.</p><figure><img alt="The Tesla Wireless Charging Platform with an iPhone and AirPods on it, sitting on an even stone surface." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/e671f300-c85b-11ed-9a37-826e93123570" style="height: 1080; width: 1920;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Freepower</div></figure><p>One thing that was different was how warm my phone felt after sitting on the platform for about half an hour. Charging in general, and wireless charging in particular, can cause a device to get hot, but this felt warmer than usual. It wasn’t enough to alarm or burn me, but I also haven’t left my gadgets on this longer than an hour, so I’m not sure how it would pan out if left overnight. This greater heat output than usual suggests there might be some energy wasted in the process, and we've asked Freepower to elaborate on the efficiency of its tech and will update when we get an answer.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out that the issue often cited as the reason behind <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-29-apple-cancels-airpower-charing-mat.html"><ins>Apple’s cancellation of the AirPower charging mat</ins></a> was that it was reportedly running “way too hot” due to its multi-coil design. Slatnick told Engadget that while its technology is “functionally equivalent to AirPower,” it has a team of expert engineers that have managed to work out many of the challenges in multi-coil design. These include determining how to deliver power to multiple devices at once, locating where each one’s receiver coils are, the varying levels of charge they might be at, as well as how to do all that without using too much energy.</p><p>I’m not about to drop $300 for a Tesla-branded wireless charging station, even if it is very sleek and technologically impressive. Setting aside my concern about how hot it makes my phones, I’m just not the sort of person who would pay $300 for something I don’t actually need. But I <em>am</em> interested in what <a href="https://www.freepower.io/vision"><ins>Freepower is working on</ins></a>. Slatnick wants to continue working with other vehicle manufacturers or furniture companies to see how to embed its multi-device wireless charging technology into all the surfaces that surround us. Maybe one day we’ll see kitchen counters or backseat pockets in cars that can charge the devices that we’ve become so reliant on. Let’s hope that we get there without too many exploding phones or electrical fires in the process.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tesla-wireless-charging-platform-hands-on-well-made-and-exorbitant-123056735.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/getting-more-out-of-groups-on-whatsapp">WhatsApp has announced two new features</a> for group chats and communities. The first is a privacy update, allowing admins to decide whether a person can get access to the group or not. Previously, anyone could join using an invite link provided by any member. Typically, banners within the chat indicating a new person has entered the group are small and can easily disappear from view after a few messages. This shift can ensure conversations and information is shared with those who it's intended to be.&nbsp;</p><p>The other update focuses on connecting with other people in your Communities. Last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-communities-rollout-group-chats-070030069.html">WhatsApp created Communities</a> to allow multiple groups to exist under one umbrella. Now, the messaging platform is making it easier to find out which groups you have in common. The group names will appear when you search under a specific contact's name.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This announcement comes on the heels of a few new WhatsApp updates. The most recent one allows users to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-will-soon-let-users-choose-when-group-chats-expire-085500703.html">schedule when they will leave a WhatsApp group chat</a>. This feature is still in beta testing, but would mean a big clear out of your conversation history.

<p>In February, Opera <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opera-is-adding-chatgpt-integration-for-webpage-summaries-175613285.html">shared plans</a> to integrate generative AI capabilities into its web browser using ChatGPT. Now, the independent browser maker has <a href="https://press.opera.com/2023/03/22/opera-ai-features-stage1/">launched</a> sidebar integration for both ChatGPT and ChatSonic and has introduced another feature called smart AI Prompts. To get these features, you'll need to update your browser and then go to Easy Setup to toggle on the &quot;AI Prompts&quot; option at the bottom. For the Opera GX browser for games, you also need to have the Early Bird option enabled in your browser settings.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the option is switched on, you'll see buttons for the chatbots on your sidebar, which you can click if you want to launch them within the browser. Take note that you'll still need to log in to be able to use either. You can also launch the chatbots by using the browser's new contextual AI Prompts that show up when you highlight text on a website.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The prompts suggest different ways you can use the chatbots with the text on page, such as turning a chunk of text into a soap opera or a football commentary and using information to create quiz questions. (I turned our post about the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quests-give-you-more-to-do-in-its-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-073029493.html">new quests feature for Horizon Worlds VR</a> into a soap opera, and let's just say it wouldn't feel out of place in <em>Dynasty</em>. Or <em>Riverdale</em>.) Green prompts use ChatGPT, while purple prompts use ChatSonic's service.</p><p>Opera says these are merely parts of the first stage of its Browser AI plan and that the features launching with the second stage will be based on its own GPT-based browser AI engine. A lot of tech companies are rushing to get their own AI products out after ChatGPT shot up in popularity and Microsoft, a long-time OpenAI backer, launched its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-begins-making-bing-chat-ai-searches-available-to-everyone-102506412.html">Bing Chat AI</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-ai-copilot-184033427.html">Edge Copilot</a> tools.

<p>Google Bard is the company’s answer to ChatGPT: an AI chatbot using LaMDA, the company’s in-development language model. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html">We’ve been testing it</a>, and what’s immediately clear are all the company’s warnings, whether it’s the experiment label or the regular reminders that Bard “will not always get it right.” Even the example entries, when you boot up Bard, include what the chatbot can’t do.</p><p>The big difference between Google and Bing’s integration is the alternative responses that Bard throws up alongside the conversation. You can click the dropdown arrow next to &quot;View other drafts&quot; at the top left of each chat bubble to see some other suggestions. Unlike Bing, Google's chatbot doesn't always cite its sources, which I think could be a major point as these chatbots creep into our daily internet lives. They’re still prone to mistakes, and I want to know where these bots get their answers from. Also, be careful what you’re searching for. Google notes these early rounds of testing will inform Bard's direction, so we’d advise not using private information. Another reason to be cautious? <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-briefly-went-offline-after-a-bug-revealed-user-chat-histories-115632504.html">A bug in ChatGPT</a> accidentally revealed user chat histories yesterday.</p><p>The r<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-opening-up-access-to-its-bard-ai-chatbot-today-140047434.html">ollout of Bard seems to be happening pretty quickly</a>, so if you’re in the US or the UK, you should get access a few hours after applying.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Ubisoft's new 'Ghostwriter' AI tool can automatically generate video game dialogue

<p>A good open world game is filled with little details that add to a player's sense of immersion. One of the key elements is the presence of background chatter. Each piece of dialog you hear is known as a &quot;bark&quot; and must be individually written by the game's creators —&nbsp;a time consuming, detailed task. Ubisoft, maker of popular open world gaming series like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassin-creed-mirage-2023-release-date-200751800.html"><em>Assassin's Creed</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-dogs-legion-preview-hands-on-195011564.html"><em>Watch Dogs</em></a><em>, </em>hopes to shorten this process with <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7Cm07zbBGy4Xml6WgYi25d/the-convergence-of-ai-and-creativity-introducing-ghostwriter">Ghostwriter</a>, a machine learning tool that generates first drafts of barks.&nbsp;</p><p>To use Ghostwriter, narrative writers input the character and type of interaction they are looking to create. The tool then produces variations, each with two slightly different options, for writers to review. As the writers make edits to the drafts, Ghostwriter updates, ideally producing more tailored options moving forward.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The idea here is to save game writers time to focus on the big stuff. &quot;Ghostwriter was created hand-in-hand with narrative teams to help them complete a repetitive task more quickly and effectively, giving them more time and freedom to work on games' narrative, characters, and cutscenes,&quot; Ubisoft states in a video release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="c9b0ea67d5b94102b6f47fe181616bd3"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Ubisoft touts Ghostwriter as an &quot;AI&quot; tool — the big thing at the moment with seemingly every company, from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html">Google</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-begins-making-bing-chat-ai-searches-available-to-everyone-102506412.html">Microsoft</a>, hopping onboard the AI train.&nbsp;</p><p>Like similar tools, though, the question is how to get people — namely staff —&nbsp;to actually use it. According to Ben Swanson, the R&amp;D scientist at Ubisoft who created Ghostwriter, the biggest challenge now is integrating the tool into production. To better facilitate this, the production team created Ernestine, a back-end tool that facilitates anyone to create new machine learning models in Ghostwriter.</p><p>If Ghostwriter proves effective, writers should be able to spend their time and energy building more detailed and engaging gaming worlds to explore.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ubisofts-ghostwriter-ai-tool--automatically-generate-video-game-dialogue-103510366.html?src=rss

<p>To have any hope of making its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-open-horizon-worlds-younger-teens-march-131930554.html">Horizon Worlds</a> VR social network catch on, Meta has to give potential users a reason to go (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/15/meta-horizon-worlds-metaverse-losing-users-falling-short-of-goals.html">and stay</a>) there. Its latest attempt to do that is something called quests that lets users complete in-game missions to earn (virtual) swag like clothing, the company announced in an <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRhLmNvbS9ibG9nL3F1ZXN0L21ldGEtaG9yaXpvbi13b3JsZHMtdjEwMi1yZWxlYXNlLW5vdGVzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzYTRmZDBhYS00MzYyLTRhZjItYTEzYy1mNjJjY2MyYzNhMGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf7XF-AntdDnPt1rxjgKnmfbRmueS9fgee1BkxqAuPu5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fblog%2Fquest%2Fmeta-horizon-worlds-v102-release-notes">update</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23391895/meta-facebook-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-too-buggy-leaked-memo"><em>The Verge</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature (which doesn't appear related to the Quest headset branding) is in beta testing via a game called <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6f7ae225-b81d-43cd-a3c7-b24c85091f6f&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Oculus&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2ZjdhZTIyNS1iODFkLTQzY2QtYTNjNy1iMjRjODUwOTFmNmYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2N1bHVzLmNvbS92ci81NTMxODI0NTI2ODY1NzI5LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2E0ZmQwYWEtNDM2Mi00YWYyLWExM2MtZjYyY2NjMmMzYTBkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAT4ZEfPWAch0P8MVNQrUbYG86kDIyj0TCSJxMmpZ4OVF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fvr%2F5531824526865729%2F"><em>Giant Mini Paddle Golf</em></a><em>. "</em>Those in the test group will see a new 'Quests' icon in their Identity Panel, which will open the new quests board to show 6 quests (e.g. Get a Hole-in-one) and the rewards to be earned (e.g. Sea Captain Costume). With one click, travel to the world to get started," according to the description. Meta plans to roll it out to more users over time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While limited to just a single experience for now, it's easy to imagine Meta offering quests in other corners of Horizon World as a way to give Quest VR headset users more to do. Last month, the company said it planned to release 20 new Horizon experiences built by third-party studios, so perhaps the quests feature will be part of these.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horizon Worlds user base was reportedly around 200,000 at the end of 2022, well short of the goal it originally set. Meta recently announced plans to open Horizon World up to children between 13-17 years old, prompting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senators-urge-meta-not-to-open-horizon-worlds-up-to-younger-teens-161159421.html">criticism</a> from two US senators concerned over Meta's track record on protecting younger users.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-quests-give-you-more-to-do-in-its-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-073029493.html?src=rss

## Instagram is putting ads in search results

<p>You may soon see ads on Instagram in places you didn't in the past. The Meta-owned app has <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/reminder-ads-and-ads-in-search-results">started testing</a> a couple of new ad placements meant to give businesses more ways to get discovered. One of those experimental placements puts ads in its search results. When you search for a particular term on the app — say &quot;makeup&quot; — posts marked &quot;sponsored&quot; will show up in the feed you can scroll through when you tap on any of the actual results. In its announcement, Instagram said it plans to roll out the placement globally in the coming months.</p><p>In addition, the app has teamed up with certain brands to test a format that would give businesses the power to remind or notify you of future events or launches. When you opt into the app's &quot;reminder ads&quot; for a particular event, you'll get notifications from Instagram one day before, 15 minutes before and when the event begins. These reminders will appear like any other Instagram notification and will show up on your lock screen.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><figure><img alt="Screenshots showing how Instagram reminder ads will look like." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/b9150140-c86f-11ed-8bfb-28fc19e7a8db" style="height: 1026; width: 1482;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Instagram</div></figure><p>Ads are Meta's lifeblood, and the introduction of new ways to earn from them comes as no surprise after a year that saw the company's quarterly revenue <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-q2-2022-earnings-203433373.html">shrink</a> for the first time. For the fourth quarter of 2022, for instance, the company <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2023/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2022-Results/default.aspx">reported</a> an advertising revenue of $31.25 billion, down from $32.64 billion for the same quarter in 2021. Its year-on-year ad revenue was down, as well, from $114.93 billion in 2021 to $113.64 billion in 2022. Meta has been severely tightening belt in recent months and let more than 11,000 workers go in November in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html">first ever mass layoffs</a>. Just a few days ago, company chief Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zuckerberg-touts-year-of-efficiency-as-meta-lays-off-an-additional-10000-workers-131957819.html">announced</a> that Meta is laying off another 10,000 workers and will restructure its divisions in April and May.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/instagram-is-putting-ads-in-search-results-055701214.html?src=rss
