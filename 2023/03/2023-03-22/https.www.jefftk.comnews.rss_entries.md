EA books give a much more thorough description of what EA is about
than a short conversation, and I think it's great that EA events (ex:
the dinners we host </span>

<a href="https://www.eaboston.org/">here in
Boston</a>) often have ones like 

<a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better">Doing Good
Better</a>, 

<a href="https://theprecipice.com/">The Precipice</a>, or


<a href="https://80000hours.org/book/">80,000 Hours</a> available.
Since few people read quickly enough that they'll sit down and make it
through a book during the event, or want to spend their time at the
event reading in a corner, the books make sense if people leave with
them.  This gives organizers ~3 options: sell, lend, or give.



<p>

Very few people will be up for buying a book in a situation like this,
so most EA groups end up with either lending or giving.  I have the
impression that giving is <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xomFCNXwNBeXtLq53/bad-omens-in-current-community-building?commentId=7ujozMgvCnXD4aZhw">more</a>
<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZSFWLn6ZKfy3rj8Kf/our-clubs-day-tabling-went-well-and-wasn-t-that-effective">common</a>,
but I <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xomFCNXwNBeXtLq53/bad-omens-in-current-community-building?commentId=EjoeKJ6xSDWAr74LN#EjoeKJ6xSDWAr74LN">think</a>
lending is generally a lot better:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>A loan suggests that when you're done reading the book you've
considered the ideas and don't need the book anymore.  Giving suggests
it's more like doctrine you keep and reference.

</p></li>
<li><p>You don't get back all the books you lend, and that's ok, but
in my experience we do get most of them back.  Lending out the same
book over and over is a lot cheaper than buying a new book each time.
Giving books is (and looks) unnecessarily lavish.

</p></li>
<li><p>Returning the book offers a chance to talk about reactions.

</p></li>
</ul>



<p>

Lending out books doesn't mean you need to run it like a library, with
records and late fees.  We've put the books out with stickies saying
"borrow this book", they go out, and they mostly come back again.
