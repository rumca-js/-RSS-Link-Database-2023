Capcom have been on something of a hot streak since 2017’s Resident Evil 7 rejuvenated the blueprint of their marquee survival horror franchise. In the remakes that followed – 2019’s critically acclaimed Resident Evil 2 Remake, Resident Evil 3, – Capcom crafts distinctly reimagined experiences, noticeable immediately in a perspective shift from fixed camera angles to over-the-shoulder in RE2 and 3, but also in wholesale recontextualization of the games’ environments and settings. 

The Raccoon City Police Department we tread through as Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield in Resident Evil 2 Remake is identical in essence to the vision of its 1998 original, but grandiose in scope and scale. The remake realises the potential of the original, breathing new life into its dimly lit corridors, exuding a deeper sense of horror in every zombie encounter beyond what the 1998 original was capable of.

We're not that deep into 2023 yet, but already, it's been a banger of a year- and it doesn't look like that momentum is going to slow down anytime soon. There's no shortage of megaton releases lined up for the next few months, and one that is obviously occupying a great deal of headspace for people right now is Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. 

Based on everything that we know about it so far, it seems like the developers are making a host of welcome improvements on all fronts with the upcoming action-adventure sequel, and with its launch right around the corner, we're going to talk about a few things we can't wait to do in the game with those improvements and changes in mind.
