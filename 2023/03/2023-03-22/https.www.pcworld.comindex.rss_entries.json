If you&rsquo;re a victim of this ploy, you won&rsquo;t necessarily notice anything amiss, either. Guardio Labs says that because the malicious Chrome extension leans on the legitimate add-on&rsquo;s code, ChatGPT integration for Google search results still works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To have been exposed to the fake extension, users would have downloaded it from the Chrome Web Store between February 14 and March 22. If you found the link via Google search, the malicious Google text advertisements began on March 14.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have ChatGPT for Google installed on your PC and want to check if it&rsquo;s legit, click on the puzzle-piece icon to the right of Chrome&rsquo;s address bar, then on <em>Manage Extensions</em>. Click on the <em>Details </em>button for the extension, then <em>View in Chrome Web Store</em>. The listing for the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-for-google/jgjaeacdkonaoafenlfkkkmbaopkbilf&amp;xcust=2-1-1668251-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">official extension</a> will show &ldquo;chatgpt4google.com&rdquo; as the verified developer, and over a million users. Anything else is a fake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this fake extension is not the first to target those curious about ChatGPT&mdash;Guardio Labs previously detected <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://labs.guard.io/fakegpt-new-variant-of-fake-chatgpt-chrome-extension-stealing-facebook-ad-accounts-with-4c9996a8f282&amp;xcust=2-1-1668251-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">an earlier version of this malicious extension</a>, which used Facebook marketing to get its hooks into Chrome users. Given how dominant ChatGPT will remain in popular discourse, and the unfortunately common occurrence of bad Google advertisements, expect more clones to pop up.

Today, that&rsquo;s overseen by what&rsquo;s known as a &ldquo;tick rate,&rdquo; where the server &ldquo;checks&rdquo; what each player&rsquo;s doing on a regular &ldquo;tick.&rdquo; Now, things are a bit different.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sub-tick updates are the heart of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>,&rdquo; the developers <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://counter-strike.net/cs2&amp;xcust=2-1-1668142-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">say</a>.  Previously, the server only evaluated the world in discrete time intervals (called ticks). Thanks to <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>&rsquo;s sub-tick update architecture, servers know the exact instant that motion starts, a shot is fired, or a &lsquo;nade is thrown. As a result, regardless of tick rate, your moving and shooting will be equally responsive and your grenades will always land the same way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how do you join the <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> beta? Well, if you&rsquo;re a frequent player you stand a better chance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Players are selected for the <em>Counter-Strike 2 </em>Limited Test based on a number of factors deemed important by the <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> development team, including (but not limited to) recent playtime on Valve official servers, trust factor, and Steam account standing,&rdquo; the team <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/CounterStrike/status/1638585850924797958&amp;xcust=2-1-1668142-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">tweeted</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk about a big day for PC gaming.

It&rsquo;s a call to action, to do <em>something</em>. In future versions of Windows 11, Microsoft is going to use it to flag new features in the Start menu that it wants you to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they&rsquo;re definitely happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, Microsoft announced Windows 11 Build 22621.1483 for its Windows Insider program. The key new feature? Notifications for Microsoft accounts in the Start menu. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This update introduces notifications for Microsoft accounts in the Start menu,&rdquo; Microsoft wrote in a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/03/21/releasing-windows-11-build-22621-1483-to-the-release-preview-channel/&amp;xcust=2-2-1668041-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a>. &ldquo;This is only available to a small audience right now. It will deploy more broadly in the coming months. Some devices might notice different visual treatments as we gather feedback.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Microsoft ads in Start menu\" class=\"wp-image-1668080\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/excla-original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"187\" /><figcaption>Microsoft added this tiny example to its blog post to illustrate it.

Last November, Windows <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1373805/the-windows-11-start-menu-is-microsofts-latest-advertising-space.html\">testers began seeing these Windows ads and notifications</a> in an earlier build. But two things stand out. First, Microsoft is actively saying that these new ads will deploy &ldquo;more broadly in the coming months.&rdquo; Secondly, this new &ldquo;feature&rdquo; was released as part of the Windows 11 Insider Release Preview channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are unfamiliar with Microsoft&rsquo;s beta program (and here&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/419826/how-to-join-the-windows-10-insider-preview-program.html\">how to join the Windows Insider program</a>, if you&rsquo;re interested), the Dev Channel is where Microsoft tests code and features that <em>may</em> arrive in the stable version of Windows 11. The Release Preview Channel is the final testing phase for trying out new features and anything that debuts there will <em>definitely</em> ship in a future of Windows 11, according to Microsoft&rsquo;s testing channels. So, yes, you&rsquo;re going to see ads in your Start menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this so infuriating is that it dilutes the power of the exclamation point. Yes, we live in a world where everything is &ldquo;epic&rdquo; and people are &ldquo;killing it&rdquo; by buying grapes at a discount rather than the full price. But an alert should be an alert, not an invitation. While Start ads may be a new feature (though <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/419870/7-ways-windows-10-pushes-ads-at-you-and-how-to-stop-them.html\">Windows ads, sadly, aren&rsquo;t</a>) we can hope that they&rsquo;re rarely, if ever, used.</p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1668041/ads-in-the-windows-11-start-menu-are-definitely-coming.html", "date_published": "2023-03-22 17:30:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "This Asus dock gives a tiny laptop RTX 4090 powers, for a high price", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a Holy Grail of laptop users, a Shangri-La of portability and power. A pure, platonic Theory of Everything, combining the go-anywhere nature of an ultraportable laptop with the raw, screaming power you can only get with a desktop that will give you a hernia if you try to move it. We can&rsquo;t get there yet &mdash; at the moment, the best we can do is plugging a pretty-good laptop into an external GPU, like the Asus ROG XG Mobile. The most recent version of this elegant little piece of hardware just got officially released, at least in Japan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://wccftech.com/asus-portable-rog-xg-mobile-graphics-dock-with-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-laptop-gpu-costs-3000-us-in-japan/&amp;xcust=2-1-1667601-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WCCFTech reports</a>, this is the 2023 update of the ROG XG external GPU, which packs an incredible GeForce RTX 4090 (the laptop card) into a portable dock that interfaces with select ROG laptops and tablets. It&rsquo;s the same basic setup that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/629083/asus-flow-z13-review-an-even-more-modular-gaming-tablet.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PCWorld reviewed one year ago</a>, now with even more pixel-pushing power. At least one Japanese retailer has the GC33Y version of the XG Mobile ready to ship&hellip;for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.yodobashi.com/product/100000001007718576/&amp;xcust=2-1-1667601-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a whopping 399,800 yen</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t checked your exchange rates yet, that&rsquo;s a hair over $3,000 USD. And that&rsquo;s just for the dock &mdash; you&rsquo;ll need to buy <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/external-graphic-docks/rog-xg-mobile-2023-model/&amp;xcust=2-1-1667601-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">a compatible Asus ROG Flow laptop</a> separately, unlike a standard, non-mobile eGPU that can work via USB-C or Thunderbolt. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"ROG mobile dock 2023 RTX 4090\" class=\"wp-image-1667958\" height=\"738\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rog-mobile-dock.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Asus</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s some serious sticker shock. The current model of the dock, packing a mobile RTX 3080, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-xg-mobile-egpu-dock-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-laptop-gpu-black%2F6510753.p%3FskuId%3D6510753&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">is $1,500 at Best Buy</a>. But it might not be as bad as all that. For one, comparing US prices to international ones is less than fair thanks to generally higher sales tax rates, to say nothing of import taxes (Asus is a Taiwanese company). A Canadian listing for the same gadget <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX00124545&amp;xcust=2-1-1667601-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">shows it as $2,500</a>, which is just $1,825 USD at the current exchange rate, so $1800 to $2,000 might be a more realistic price for the ROG XG Mobile dock when it arrives here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at $400 more than the (roughly) equivalent desktop card, for a device that adds some serious graphical <em>oomph </em>to an ultraportable laptop, it makes a lot more sense. The dock also doubles as a pretty great desktop station, giving a ROG Flow laptop instant full-sized DisplayPort and HDMI ports, three extra USB-A ports and a full Ethernet port. Granted, you&rsquo;re still looking at a total investment of at least $3200, and possibly quite a bit more&hellip;but a full gaming laptop with an RTX 4090 will <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-m16-16-240hz-gaming-laptop-qhd-intel-13th-gen-core-i9-with-32gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-2tb-ssd-off-black%2F6535581.p%3FskuId%3D6535581&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">cost around the same</a>, and you can&rsquo;t pop off its GPU to cram it into an overnight bag.

Although we haven&rsquo;t personally tested the model that&rsquo;s currently on sale, it does have the same 240Hz refresh rate as the one we reviewed, which is super exciting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Voyager features an AMD Ryzen 7 6800HS CPU, an AMD Radeon 6800M GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. This machine should be able to zip through most games on the High or Ultra graphics presets. The 16-inch display is the real star of the show, though. &nbsp;It has a resolution of 2560&times;1600, a refresh rate of 240Hz, a response time of 3ms, and an aspect ratio of 16:10.&nbsp;You can expect vibrant, buttery smooth visuals. The full-sized keyboard also has Cherry MX Ultra-Low Profile mechanical switches, which have a more tactile feel to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a fantastic deal. You better act now before it&rsquo;s gone.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Gaming-Laptops/CORSAIR-VOYAGER-Gaming-Notebook/p/CN-9000003-NA&amp;xcust=2-3-1667741-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Corsair Voyager for $1,599.99 at Corsair</a></p>\nLaptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1667741/save-a-massive-400-on-this-amd-loaded-corsair-gaming-laptop.html", "date_published": "2023-03-22 14:53:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Your Windows screenshots could be sharing info you cropped out", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The built-in screenshot tool in Windows has been given a major upgrade in the last few years. Initially the Snipping Tool was part of the PowerToys collection, before getting a major boost and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406858/how-to-take-screenshots-in-windows-10.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">becoming the default screenshot interface in Windows 10 and 11</a>. But it seems like the current version of the tool might be sharing a lot more than intended, albeit in highly specific scenarios. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days ago security researchers found that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://9to5google.com/2023/03/18/pixel-markup-screenshot-vulnerability/&amp;xcust=2-3-1667615-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">screenshots taken and cropped on Google Pixel phones</a> could be analyzed with specialized recovery tools, making at least some of the cropped portion of the images visible again. This &ldquo;Acropalypse&rdquo; caused users to take a good, hard look at other default screenshot tools. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-snipping-tool-privacy-bug-exposes-cropped-image-content/&amp;xcust=2-3-1667615-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">As Bleeping Computer reports</a>, several researchers found similar issues with the Windows 11 Snipping Tool and the older Snip &amp; Sketch interface for the same function. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Can confirm.<br />Easy test:<br />1.

As it turns out, the screenshot tools are incorrectly truncating the saved file, possibly leaving portions of the original, uncropped image behind. Recovery tools can be used to make part of the original image visible again. Full, perfect recovery of the original file doesn&rsquo;t appear to be possible at this time, but corrupted versions of the full-sized file could still show enough to recover sensitive text or images. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue gets into some pretty heavy technical jargon. But if you need a <em>Star Trek</em>-style metaphor, it&rsquo;s the difference between physically cutting out a photo from a newspaper with scissors, or merely covering it up with a sticker. In the latter example, the photo is still there and possibly damaged, and with careful work you can still see it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is some good news. While it&rsquo;s fairly easy to expand a cropped image back to its original dimensions, that doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean all the cropped data is restored. And the recovery method only works after a fairly lengthy sequence of events: The image has to be saved with the Snipping Tool (or Snip &amp; Sketch), then cropped within the tool&rsquo;s interface, <em>then saved again</em> to the same file with the same filename. It doesn&rsquo;t appear to work if you simply press Print Screen and crop a full screenshot, then save that file or paste it into another program. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft representatives have responded to stories posted on multiple technology sites, indicating that the company is aware of the problem and working on a solution. </p>\n\nSecurity, Windows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1667615/your-windows-screenshots-could-be-sharing-un-cropped-info.html", "date_published": "2023-03-22 14:45:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Viofio A139 Pro dash cam review: Three cameras, quality captures, slick design", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"review-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" /><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Discrete front, interior, and rear cameras</li><li>Type-C power and thin cabling</li><li>4K captures</li><li>Excellent video quality from all three cameras</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Quite a few wires to accommodate</li><li>Connecting app to phone required several reboots</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">On Amazon (not the vendor site), the sub-$300 Viofo A139 Pro 3CH (front, interior, rear) dash cam is a bargain.

This cuts down on cabling, but can mean compromising on where you place it&mdash;e.g., hiding it behind the rear view mirror may cut off your interior coverage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not so with the Viofo A139 Pro 3CH whose interior camera is a separate unit. There&rsquo;s also a discrete rear view camera for the ultimate in versatile coverage. The cherry on top is the very good (night) to excellent (day) capture quality of all three cameras. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One caveat. While the A139 Pro 3CH was available for $290 on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/VIOFO-Channel-Dashboard-Recorder-Parking/dp/B08QCM7FL1?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;xcust=2-3-1518169-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon</a> at the time of this posting, it was $370 on the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://viofo.com/dash-cam/293-viofo-a139-pro-3ch-first-real-4k-hdr-3-channel-frontinteriorrear-dashcam-with-sony-starvis-2-imx678-sensor.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1518169-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">vendor&rsquo;s own website</a> (discounted from an MSRP of $400). Guess which price we like better?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/428348/best-dash-cam-reviews.html\">best dash cams</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a dash cam, and buying recommendations. </em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viofo-a139-pro-design-and-features\">Viofo A139 Pro: Design and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, the three-channel A139 Pro system consists of a main body with the controls and a 2160p/140-degree field-of-view front camera, plus separate 1080p/170FoV interior and rear view cameras. The interior and rear cameras are identical in size and shape (nicely rounded and attractive), with the interior camera sporting infrared lighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of display-less dash cams such as the A139 Pro, though the design makes up for that absence somewhat with plainly labeled buttons and status lights on the camera&rsquo;s rear deck.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1656317\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/viofo-a139-pro-3ch-first-real-4k-hdr-3-channel-frontinteriorrear-dashcam-with-sony-starvis-2-imx678-sensor-b.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"800\" /><figcaption>All three Viofo A139 Pro 3CH cameras. The interior camera has the red dots (which are actually gray in real life).</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I prefer a display is that I don&rsquo;t want to be reaching for my phone (interrupting anything else I&rsquo;m doing with it) whenever I want to check a video, or to change a setting. Granted, those are relatively rare instances; but there&rsquo;s also the fact that I&rsquo;m just not as phone-centric as many other modern citizens. Use your own bias in judging this aspect of the dash cam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I must commend Viofo on the connection and wiring solutions. The power connection is Type-C, which is something I&rsquo;d like to see the world finally consolidate around in order to cut down on cable waste. Viofo also opts for much thinner cabling to the interior and exterior cameras than most systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thin cabling is easier to hide and less obtrusive in places where it can&rsquo;t be hidden. The cables are a bit stiffer than normal, but that didn&rsquo;t hinder my installation. The connectors are also smaller than normal and click into place. Sweet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Viofo A139 Pro&rsquo;s captures are great, its cabling is first-rate, and the three cameras are a fantastic way for ride-givers to achieve near 360 degree coverage.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1656314\" height=\"841\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Viofo-dash-cam-app-all.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Pictured: <em>Live View</em>, <em>Video Setting</em>, and <em>Locked Files</em>. The Viofo app works fine once connected, though you might have to reboot the app and phone a couple of times. </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Software features include a parking mode, time-lapse recording, and low bit-rate captures to save storage. The A139 Pro accepts up to 256GB SD cards and is warrantied for 18 months after registration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>GPS is integrated into the camera, as you&rsquo;ll see in the captures below. But you&rsquo;ll also note that the time is off. I wrongly assumed that Viofo, an old hand in the business, would automatically set it using the GPS info, but only the date was set. Go figure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viofo-a139-pro-performance\">Viofo A139 Pro: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting a display-less dash cam to connect with its app&mdash;the only means of changing many settings&mdash;is part of its performance. Hence, I must mention that it was like pulling teeth to get the A139 Pro 3CH to connect first to Wi-Fi, and then the app. The process required power cycling the camera several times. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it finally connected to the app, it chirped about switching to 5G and multiple power cycles were again required, as well as quitting and re-launching the app. It was all good in the end, but Viofo should work on this initial process. Note that this was on Android, not iOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve already praised the A139 Pro 3CH&rsquo;s video quality, but in finer terms: Daytime detail is sharp in both light and dark areas; color is nicely saturated and accurate; and motion is handled very well. There&rsquo;s no frame tearing, and none of the shot-through-quivering-gelatin effect that I recently experienced with the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/831118/garmin-drivecam-76-review.html\">Garmin DriveCam 76</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the day capture below seems a little dark in temperature, it&rsquo;s because I used the polarizing filter that was included with the A139 Pro 3CH Viofo sent me. Relative hue is still accurate and details are easy to distinguish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Right-click on any of the images and select &ldquo;Open image in new tab&rdquo; to see them at full resolution.</em></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1535645\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Viofo-A139-Pro-3CH-1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Yes, I was parked but detail and color are every bit as true with the car in motion. This is a superior capture in terms of color and detail.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Daytime interior captures were among the best I&rsquo;ve seen. Yes, that&rsquo;s the cable to the rear camera that I had not yet run along the convertible top. That&rsquo;s also my backpack and one of my dogs in the foreground.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1535641\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Viofo-A139-Pro-3CH-2.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The A139 Pro&rsquo;s interior captures are grayscale but supremely detailed, which is far more important.  </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1080p rear captures during the day are equally compelling&mdash;better than some front video I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1535640\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Viofo-A139-Pro-3CH-4.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Even the A139 Pro&rsquo;s rear captures are superior. We&rsquo;ve seen worse video from front cameras.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Come nighttime, and the A139 Pro&rsquo;s performance dropped off a bit. Part of that may be because I forgot to remove the polarizing filter. Perhaps I was bowing to the inevitability that most people will also forget to do so on a regular basis. Just saying&hellip;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can still make out detail in the front, which is the most important aspect, but surroundings suffer a bit in that regard. On the other hand, the A139 Pro handled headlight flare extremely well. There is none of the blowout you&rsquo;ll see from cheaper cameras. Impressive.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1535774\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Viofo-A139-Pro-3CH-5.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The A139  Pro wasn&rsquo;t as facile at night but a bit of the cloudiness is from the San Francisco weather.  </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a major drop-off in detail with night interior captures. Nothing fatal, but compared with the daytime interior capture above, the difference in acuity is obvious.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1535661\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Viofo-A139-Pro-3CH-9.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Night interior shots provide decent detail and are well-lit, though not nearly as sharp as those taken during the day.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, the rear camera seems to do just as well at night as during the day. Forgive the massive moisture drops. They&rsquo;re from the copious rain we&rsquo;ve been having here in San Francisco and I didn&rsquo;t notice them at the time. Look in between the drops, however, and you&rsquo;ll see impressive detail.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1535638\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Viofo-A139-Pro-3CH-8.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>It was a bit wet in San Francisco this night, but the rear detail is still very good.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, the A139 Pro is an excellent daytime camera, and if you forgive some details in the surroundings, an excellent nighttime recording apparatus. The stellar way it handles headlight flare could be paramount in the case of a head-on collision. Nice job, Viofo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the A139 Pro 3CH uses a super capacitor for one or two seconds runtime should the power source fail. That&rsquo;s enough time to save the last video, but not to capture events post power loss. Power loss is rare in accidents, but not unheard of.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-viofo-a139-pro\">Should you buy the Viofo A139 Pro?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Purchased from Viofo&rsquo;s website, the A139 Pro 3CH is pricey and a more hesitant recommendation.

Nvidia and AMD currently have a strong grasp on the market, with Nvidia maintaining a dominating lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here comes Intel, a behemoth company in its own right. There&rsquo;s a problem, though. The Arc GPUs such as the A750 and A770 are promising, but full of early teething issues. The hardware seems capable, but the driver software side is playing catchup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&rsquo;re going to answer whether daily driving an Intel Arc A770 is reasonable in 2023. Is it going to be too buggy to even consider? We&rsquo;ll take it through the basic driver installation, and the quality of that experience. We will then put it to work in some popular games and see if it&rsquo;s up to snuff in real-world use. Questions about performance metrics compared to the competition aside, our goal is to find a smooth, competent experience foremost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"arc-a770-limited-edition\">Arc A770 Limited Edition</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Arc A770 Limited Edition\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Intel-Arc-A770-Limited-Edition-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html\">Brad Chacos&rsquo;s initial Arc A750/A770 review</a>, he ran into several driver and game issues early on with the initial release. Intel is up against tough competition in the software world.

You&rsquo;re presented with a choice of either the newest certified release, or if you&rsquo;re feeling frisky, beta drivers. We&rsquo;ll go with the standard stable release for our test.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we&rsquo;d usually recommend the stable release for most users, Intel Arc GPUs are a rapidly evolving breed. In some cases beta drivers may likely cover more recent game releases and squish more bugs. (In theory, your mileage may vary.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial install process went smoothly, and Intel Arc Control performed well. Brad Chacos remarked how it felt &ldquo;laggy&rdquo; during his initial review, so it appears to be improved with the newest drivers. After you&rsquo;ve become familiar with the layout, it&rsquo;s easy to navigate through and functions well. Brad had also noticed that Windows would constantly ask if you &ldquo;allow&rdquo; it to run Intel Arc Control, an issue that&rsquo;s also fixed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third-party software MSI Afterburner also seemed to work fine with the Intel Arc GPU, reporting the on-screen GPU temperatures and data as one would expect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The test system:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Intel Arc A770 16GB&nbsp;</li><li>Intel Driver 31.01.101.4146 (Feburary 22, 2023)</li><li>Asus ROG Hero X670E motherboard</li><li>AMD Ryzen 9 7950X</li><li>32GB of DDR5&nbsp;</li><li>Samsung NVMe</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss some issues that may still pop up for some. The first concerns booting into BIOS. On the Asus X670E Hero motherboard, the Intel Arc seemed to not display an image through DisplayPort when attempting a BIOS boot. Using HDMI, it immediately worked. DisplayPort worked fine when in Windows and had also worked in the BIOS when an Nvidia GPU was present with the same settings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may vary and be dependent on the interaction between a specific motherboard or BIOS, so you may have a different experience. (We can confirm that the Arc GPU will boot into the BIOS with DisplayPort in a different system)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another known issue some users may experience concerns Resizable BAR showing incorrectly in Intel Arc Control as &ldquo;unsupported&rdquo;&mdash;even when correct settings are applied, which can be confirmed as active in the free software GPU-Z. Device Manager can also confirm by selecting the Intel Arc GPU in <em>Display adapters</em>, selecting <em>Resources</em>, and checking that <em>Large Memory Range</em> is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"intel-arc-a750-limited-edition\">Intel Arc A750 Limited Edition</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Intel Arc A750 Limited Edition\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"4000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Intel-Arc-A750.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"6000\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499123/intel-slashes-arc-a750-price-to-249-touts-substantial-gaming-improvements.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>(The issue was reportedly fixed in more recent Arc Control versions, but some users have still encountered this.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Resizable BAR, or &ldquo;reBAR,&rdquo; support is very important for the performance of Intel Arc GPUs, this is certainly relevant to the experience. While it will be active, it&rsquo;s nice to see confirmed that it is working, or you&rsquo;ll have doubts about the performance of the GPU itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above aren&rsquo;t complete deal breakers, but still show how buggy issues may crop up on occasion. In general, Arc is much less buggy with the newest drivers than the initial release, so it&rsquo;s certainly good progress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"intel-arc-a770-16gb-game-performance\">Intel Arc A770 16GB: Game performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at Intel Arc in some popular games. Keep in mind there may be some variation of bugs that may be hardware-specific, and some that may come down to DX9, DX11, and DX12 games. Intel Arc certainly has the best expected performance in DX12 games, but Intel has also recently made a big deal about how DX9 has been optimized in the latest drivers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"intel-arc-a770-16gb-hogwarts-legacy\">Intel Arc A770 16GB: Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Arc\" class=\"wp-image-1656426\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-55.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p><em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>on the Intel Arc A770.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is one of the latest popular releases. It&rsquo;s also a graphically intensive game, with ray tracing included. These types of games absolutely love VRAM&mdash;making a good test subject for the Intel Arc A770 with 16GB of the good stuff. It&rsquo;s also a good test to see if ray tracing and Intel XeSS are functional and bug-free.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted the first test to really push the Arc GPU and see if it would throw in the towel. Intel Arc A770 is certainly best suited to 1440p, but we&rsquo;ll start with 4K&mdash;for maximum effect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I placed the settings on Ultra, turned off ray tracing, and set Intel&rsquo;s upscaler XeSS on balanced mode.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intel Arc A770 did very well. Even in the busy Hogsmeade town area, it maintained very playable frame rates, without any serious dips. Inside Hogwarts, FPS would be even higher.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was most surprising was that it was all still very smooth&mdash;there were no aggressive FPS dips, stutters, or skipping about. The extra VRAM on this Arc A770 16GB really helps at these resolutions&mdash;it&rsquo;s also 256-bit bus width. Compare this to the 4070 Ti 12GB&rsquo;s 192-bit bus, which is quickly saturated and often results in poor performance at these resolutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning ray tracing on brings the FPS down below 30&mdash;but even then it was still consistently smooth. If you play at a more reasonable 1440p, the overall gaming experience is quite positive on Intel Arc for this game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise: Intel even had drivers at the ready for <em>Hogwarts</em> before AMD released its own recently&mdash;which is a good sign for Intel&rsquo;s software. Everything worked as you&rsquo;d expect&mdash;menus loaded quickly, and there were no errant game crashes to report.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first real-world game experience resulted in various sessions of smooth gaming, with no real bugginess to speak of in this particular game. Ray tracing worked as it should, performance penalty aside. Intel XeSS also provided some good results, making an otherwise unplayable setting much more palatable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Intel Arc A770 16GB: Cyberpunk 2077<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Arc\" class=\"wp-image-1656427\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-60.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Intel&rsquo;s Arc A770.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumping into <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 1440p, the Intel Arc continues to be fairly bug-free. At Ultra with FSR 2 on Balanced, we&rsquo;re not quite at 60 FPS, but the performance is smooth enough. Even though Intel Arc GPUs actually do ray tracing rather well, this is a heavy game that makes the RTX 4090 break a sweat. Regardless, even with a taxing workload on the GPU, it&rsquo;s still reasonably smooth and at least remains consistent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything loaded and performed as it should, and any performance or lack thereof would just come down to the power of the GPU itself. This is great news and puts it on better ground versus the competition. Ideally, as Arc drivers improve, we can compare hardware to hardware without splitting hairs over buggy drivers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD&rsquo;s FSR 2 also worked great on Balanced here, giving a much-needed FPS boost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"intel-arc-a770-16gb-dead-space\">Intel Arc A770 16GB: Dead Space</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dead Space</em> is a popular remake and can be graphically intensive. This is the first game where I faced some issues. At first, it was a less consistent frame-rate performance. Moving around would cause the frame rates to dip from playable to unplayable. Most other games seemed to at least remain consistent, but this could also be due to this game specifically&mdash;not a bug, per se, but it could be down to unoptimized drivers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another interesting note is that this game also caused some weird screen issues. First, it completely locked up the system when I tried to change the in-game resolution&mdash;resulting in a system reboot being needed. Secondly, it would sometimes have a hard time going into &ldquo;full-screen&rdquo; mode and remained in &ldquo;windowed.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be behavior particular to this title, as most other games did not exhibit this. It can illustrate how you may still run into a buggy experience here or there with Intel Arc. (This game has worked mostly without similar bugs on the Nvidia GPU previously used here.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"intel-arc-a770-16gb-returnal\">Intel Arc A770 16GB: Returnal&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Arc\" class=\"wp-image-1656431\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-68.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Returnal on the Intel Arc A770.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Returnal</em> is another popular PlayStation port that&rsquo;s come to the PC&mdash;and we&rsquo;re going to run it at 1440p on the Intel Arc A770.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epic settings, with ray tracing, give enjoyable performance. It&rsquo;s smooth with only an odd dip here or there depending on the scene. This game also supports Intel&rsquo;s XeSS, and we place it on Balanced. Performance jumps up, and the smoothness continues. The VRAM in the Arc is really helping, too&mdash;as this game likes VRAM, as well. Everything worked as it should, and it&rsquo;s good to see Intel XeSS in more titles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"intel-arc-a770-16gb-spiderman-remastered\">Intel Arc A770 16GB: Spiderman Remastered</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ste8SQ1qgAlwvSh1k5RqsNwbJLoNayuva2z7RIxfi6PMw9NIGmvokLhpn6ajQuqpKrMi3cyvCwuxgyW2FrqxNyCl-LuN8o2KkOZidmtKLyXiNEc43mgVn0P2my5U3e6aPkrY1v5umT1OOVOxz2UdyQ\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" /></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Spiderman Remastered</em> presented some issues during Brad Chacos&rsquo; review: It would crash when loading ray-traced reflections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the newest drivers, the game played very smoothly without the same crashing issue. Ray-traced reflections were turned on, and reflection resolution set to high. In both 1440p and 4K, it worked well and as intended. Combining this with AMD&rsquo;s FSR 2 upscaling provided some good results as well, without any issues to report.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Intel staying on top of its game optimizations in drivers, the results have been good. Sometimes tweaks are needed on a &ldquo;per-game&rdquo; basis with more individual attention, but it&rsquo;s great to see many of the early issues no longer present.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"intel-arc-a770-16gb-hitman-3\">Intel Arc A770 16GB: Hitman 3&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Arc\" class=\"wp-image-1656435\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-72.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p><em>Hitman 3</em> on the Intel Arc A770.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In Brad Chacos&rsquo; initial Arc review, he ran into some issues with <em>Hitman 3</em>. After months of new drivers, I had a much smoother experience. The game loaded and played without issue, with very smooth performance across the board.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also did not experience any corruption of files or other odd behavior, and overall the Intel Arc GPU performed as it should.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"intel-arc-a770-16gb-dx9-and-dx11-game-optimizations\">Intel Arc A770 16GB: DX9 and DX11 game optimizations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While DX12 has great games and is the latest, how does Intel deal with the thousands of older DX9 and DX11 titles out there? <em>Counterstrike: Global Offensive</em> is a tremendously popular title, even though it&rsquo;s been around for ages. Likewise, DX9 performance has been vastly improved in newer Intel Arc drivers. If you consider low performance a &ldquo;bug,&rdquo; Intel&rsquo;s newer optimized drivers boost performance a great deal for these older games. Same game, new driver, higher performance&mdash;if you call it a bug or not, it&rsquo;s been squashed!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same is true of other games like <em>Starcraft 2</em>, and <em>Guild Wars 2</em>. DX9 optimizations are a very good demonstration of Intel&rsquo;s ability to improve the product by significant amounts, which bodes well for future improvements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DX11 performance will certainly be a lot more varied, and it&rsquo;s an area that Intel should focus on improving further. That&rsquo;s an important component as not every game will be simply DX12. Gamers want to play a variety of titles, both old and new.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel Arc\" class=\"wp-image-1656436\" height=\"1062\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2022-10-19-at-6.36.50-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-verdict-is-the-intel-arc-still-too-buggy-to-recommend\">The verdict: Is the Intel Arc still too buggy to recommend?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After taking the Intel Arc GPU through its paces on the newest available driver, there&rsquo;s a lot of good news. We&rsquo;re happy to see new game releases such as <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>get fast driver releases accompanying them. This shows that Intel is on the ball, and really trying to improve. Intel Arc therefore can be recommended, with a few things to keep in mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coupled with recent price drops of the A750 GPU to $249, Intel may find a much more willing buyer with these driver improvements. It seems like most of the big early issues with daily use of the drivers are mostly gone, resulting in a more seamless process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"intel-arc-a750-limited-edition\">Intel Arc A750 Limited Edition</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Intel Arc A750 Limited Edition\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"4000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Intel-Arc-A750.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"6000\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499123/intel-slashes-arc-a750-price-to-249-touts-substantial-gaming-improvements.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Is Intel Arc still buggy?
