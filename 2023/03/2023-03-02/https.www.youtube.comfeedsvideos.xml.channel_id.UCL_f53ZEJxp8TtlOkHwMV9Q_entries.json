He started his first business at 16 and graduated from Harvard Business School. Jeff has started and runs many successful companies, his most recent being Sandefer Capital Partners, an oil and gas investment firm with several billion dollars in assets. He has also started multiple academic programs and schools, such as the Action School of Business, whose students were named the \u201cmost competitive MBA\u2019s in the nation\u201d by the Princeton Review. This has since extended into k-12 with the Action Academy, a cutting-edge program that blends a one-room schoolhouse, the Socratic Method, and 21st-century technology to empower each student to change the world.\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBirch Gold Group: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Jeff Sandefer:\n\nActon Academy website \u2013 \u201c21st century learning in one-room schoolhouse.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s Business Fair website \u2013 \u201cyoung entrepreneurs gather to launch neighborhood businesses.\u201d\n\nCourage to Grow: - \u201cActon Academy\u2019s origin story, for entrepreneurial parents.\u201d\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:25) Intro\n(3:05) Business, incentive, and starting early\n(6:45) Socratic teaching, the case method\n(8:23) Toward your next step\n(11:40) The judgment of Moses\n(12:30) Fascination with questions\n(13:41) Fathers, reaching the top\n(16:17) Joe Rogan, the breadth of reach\n(18:50) Ask a stupid question \n(21:00) Building the Acton program\n(25:30) The origin of education\n(28:58) Every child is a genius\n(32:30) Approaches to teaching\n(33:35) Regardless of IQ\u2026\n(35:03) Experiments in culture\n(39:20) Grading by effort, attainment, and social investment\n(43:08) No.1 in 18 months, franchising\n(46:20) Don\u2019t worry if your child isn\u2019t speaking yet\n(50:01) Auditing students, accountability\n(51:40) Gaming the system, control mechanisms\n(54:05) Markers for toxic students\n(58:09) The influence of testosterone at 13\n(59:30) Offsetting the Pareto distribution\n(1:01:20) Gratitude as a practice\n(1:03:50) Acton apprenticeships\n(1:08:35) The success of education belongs to the students\n(1:10:25) Freud, the devouring mother\n(1:12:13) Playing games to develop culture\n(1:18:09) Identifying the problem is crucial\n(1:21:26) Socratic discussion\n(1:23:20) Opposing sides\n(1:25:01) Pageau: distributed responsibility and nested games\n(1:27:12) The three meaningful questions even 8-year-olds ask\n(1:31:20) Launch-padders, prestige versus competence\n(1:33:35) Adjuncts, the internet, and the depletion of the current model\n(1:37:45) The teachers we remember\n(1:40:00) Domains of learning and ideological capture\n(1:42:20) Woke culture and the victim mentality\n(1:44:21) Age, wealth, and biological capitol\n(1:46:45) Temple Grandin\n(1:48:15) Higher education and finding your calling\n(1:52:35) The importance of Vision\n\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEUjcRWfu3c", "date_published": "2023-03-02 16:00:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
