Erin Bentlage, Anilee List, and Beane", "description": "This cover of JVKE\u2019s \"golden hour\" really does have all the qualities of real life golden Hours. The harmonies by Erin, Anilee, and Beane are so incredibly tight without feeling forced. And the instruments dropping out in the first chorus really does make time feel slowed as we anticipate the next section. Of course, Swatkin\u2019s tasty solo is such a great ending to such a smooth and joyful song!\n\nSave this song on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3Th94Ql \nFollow us on instagram: https://instagram.com/pomplamoosemusic\nBecome a patron of our music (to vote on the songs we cover and get merch and stuff like that): http://www.patreon.com/pomplamoose\n\nA cover of JVKE's \"golden hour\" by Magaziine, Erin Bentlage, Anilee List, & Beane.\n\nMUSICIAN CREDITS\nVocals/Arrangement: Erin Bentlage, Anilee List, Beane\nSynth: Jack Conte, Swatkins\nGuitar: Brian Green\nBass: Nick Campbell\nDrums: Ben Rose\n\nAUDIO CREDITS\nEngineer: Tim Sonnefeld\nMixing/Mastering: Caleb Parker\nProducer: Ben Rose\n\nVIDEO CREDITS\nDirector: Dom Fera\nDP: Austin Hughes\nCamera Operators: James Hull, Ryan Blewett\nBackline Tech: Alex Minney \nVideo Editor/Colorist: Athena Wheaton\n\nRecorded at The Village Studios in Los Angeles.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-kKjXWlB58", "date_published": "2023-03-02 16:31:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
