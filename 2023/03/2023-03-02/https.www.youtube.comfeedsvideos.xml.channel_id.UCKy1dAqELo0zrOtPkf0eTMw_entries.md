Sons of the Forest early access reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.

This sequel to The Forest takes everything its predecessor did well and does it a little bit better. Exploring a huge, beautiful, deadly island through the changing seasons is a treat on its own. The new base building mechanics could entertain me for days without ever touching the main story. And to top it all off, we have smarter and more unsettling enemy behavior paired with thoughtfully improved combat. It's already great, and it's still in Early Access. With some healthy performance optimization and shining up of an impactful but sloppy ending, it could become incredible.

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty reviewed by Mitchell Saltzman on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, and PC.

"Familiar issues with storytelling and loot aside, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is another great entry in Team Ninja's growing collection of action RPGs that features some of the best combat in the soulslike genre, even though those battles start to lose their tension due to a distinct lack of variety to fill out the 20+ hour runtime."

Microsoft and Lucasfilm have teamed up to create a cool-looking Mandalorian-themed Xbox Series X and Series S, along with a Grogu-colored controller and matching hoodie. The Xbox Series X has a Mando stencil, while the smaller Series S is appropriately Grogu-themed. Unfortunately you can't buy these—the consoles are available only via a Twitter contest, so good luck if you're entering. And speaking of Twitter, Hideo Kojima tweeted some photos of a meeting he had with an Xbox exec and his team at Kojima's studio. It's been known that Microsoft and Kojima Productions are teaming up for a game, so maybe this meeting is related to that? And judging by the food pics he tweeted, maybe it's food themed? Metal Gear Salad? Solid Steak? And finally, we take a look at some of the new powers coming to Destiny 2: Lightfall.
