<p>Microsoft announced a pair of new builds for the Windows 11 Insider Preview channels today&mdash;and yes, you may see something in File Explorer that will cause your stomach to growl.</p>



<p>Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 25309 for the Dev Channel introduces a number of interesting tweaks to Windows, among them a better volume mixer, voice access improvements, and more&mdash;including the odd decision to include a pizza icon in File Explorer. The only hitch? Insider builds for the Dev Channel are considered experimental, so they may not show up in a final build. Not all Insiders will see these new features, either&mdash;that&rsquo;s the trouble with Dev builds.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what the new build includes:</p>



<p><strong>A new volume mixer in Quick Settings: </strong>This addition looks genuinely useful, with more granular, informative details about what audio device your PC is using, and what spatial enhancement technology it&rsquo;s being backed by. Microsoft&rsquo;s mixer experience has been a little sparse, so this additional flyout detail seems useful.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Dev Channel mixer" class="wp-image-1530075" height="817" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Windows-11-dev-mixer.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A new Mixer option for Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p><strong>Touch keyboard options: </strong>If you use a Surface Pro or a Surface Go and detach the keyboard, the tablet makes a choice: It either shows the touch keyboard in anticipation of you continuing to type; or hides it, believing that you want to use the screen to watch movies. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to be able to make that decision yourself? Now you can, with a new <em>Time &amp; language &gt; Typing</em> option within the Windows Settings menu.</p>



<p><strong>Auto Color Management expansion:</strong> Last October, Microsoft tipped plans to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/auto-color-management/&amp;xcust=2-1-1530047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">expand the color management in Windows</a>, essentially allowing Windows to catch up with more advanced, color-managed displays. Now you can turn it on: go to&nbsp;<em>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Advanced display</em>, select correct display and turn on&nbsp;&ldquo;Automatically manage color for apps<strong>.</strong>&ldquo;</p>



<p><strong>Start badging options: </strong>This isn&rsquo;t great news for those of you who don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;ads&rdquo; within Windows that promote various features. What Microsoft seems to be proposing here is that Microsoft intends to show more ads within the Start menu, and is looking for (less annoying? More informative?) ways to do it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Dev Channel start badging" class="wp-image-1530073" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Windows-11-dev-start.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You may see this or something like it in Windows 11 Start.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p><strong>A second chance for <em>you</em>: </strong>Microsoft really wants you to set up your PC the way <em>it</em> wants, by linking your phone to your PC, using OneDrive, and making Edge your default browser. Not only does it do it during Windows setup, but also now in a &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; that addresses you by name.</p>



<p><strong>Different Snap options:</strong> Microsoft is considering altering the time it takes for a new Snap orientation to fire, and may show you a descriptive title as well.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Dev Channel second chance" class="wp-image-1530076" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Windows-11-dev-scoobe.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>What Microsoft calls its &ldquo;Second Chance&rdquo; menu.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p><strong>G&rsquo;day, Voice Access:</strong> Microsoft now accommodates UK, Australian, and Canadian accents in Voice Access, and has redesigned the in-app help page to make it more informative. If you want an exhaustive list of Voice Access commands and extra information about them, Microsoft recommends you visit&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-voice-access-to-control-your-pc-author-text-with-your-voice-4dcd23ee-f1b9-4fd1-bacc-862ab611f55d&amp;xcust=2-1-1530047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. Microsoft has also added better support for selecting text, which you can find more details on its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/03/02/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25309/&amp;xcust=2-1-1530047-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on the new build.</p>



<p><strong>Higher contrast Widgets and Search:</strong> New icons will make your local weather widget easier to pick up on the Taskbar. Ditto for the Search box.</p>



<p><strong>Oh, and the pizza: </strong>Windows Insiders will begin noticing a &ldquo;pizza&rdquo; icon on the command bar in File Explorer, Microsoft says. This icon denotes that an Insider is previewing the Windows App SDK version of File Explorer.&nbsp;If you have no idea what that means, don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;all we took away from it was that Microsoft may use the pizza icon to highlight a new UI that&rsquo;s in use. Nothing wrong with that!</p>

## How to add a summary to any Google Doc
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524899/how-to-add-a-summary-to-any-google-doc.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524899/how-to-add-a-summary-to-any-google-doc.html)

<p>Adding a summary to a Google Docs document is useful for both the author and the reader. For the reader, it gives them a brief overview of the document without having to read the whole thing. It also helps the author distill the main points of the document, which can help identify areas that may need improving.</p>



<p>The Google Docs summary feature is easy to access, but it&rsquo;s only available on desktop. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to access it, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. We assembled a comprehensive step-by-step guide below. Check it out.</p>



<h2 id="manually-write-a-summary">Manually write a summary</h2>



<p>On your desktop PC, launch your browser of choice and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.google.com/&amp;xcust=2-3-1524899-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">open Google Docs</a>. Next, open the Google Docs document you&rsquo;d like to add a summary to. To the left of the menu bar, click <strong>View</strong>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Click view" class="wp-image-1524949" height="558" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Click-view..jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<p>Next, click <strong>Show Outline</strong> near the middle of the drop-down menu.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Click show outline." class="wp-image-1524951" height="558" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Click-show-outline..jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;ll now see the outline appear to the left of your document. Above the outline, you&rsquo;ll see the summary section. Click the <strong>plus sign</strong> next to <strong>Summary</strong>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Click the plus sign." class="wp-image-1524953" height="558" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Click-the-plus-sign..jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<p>Enter your summary in the text box that appears and press the <strong>Enter</strong> key when you&rsquo;re finished. A pop-up message stating that the summary has been saved will appear.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="The finished summary." class="wp-image-1524957" height="558" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-finished-summary..jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Marshall Gunnell</p></div>



<h2 id="about-google-docs-auto-generated-summary">About Google Docs auto-generated summary</h2>



<p>Google Docs may also automatically generate a summary of the document, compliments of its advanced machine-learning algorithm. However, this feature is only available if your document is long enough and if you&rsquo;re a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://workspace.google.com/&amp;xcust=2-3-1524899-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google Workspace for Business</a> user.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re using Google Docs for free, you can still write and read a summary, but the summary suggestions feature isn&rsquo;t included. However, if you&rsquo;re a free user but you <em>really</em> want an AI to generate your summary for you, you can always use ChatGPT. Just write a prompt such as &ldquo;Write a concise summary of this content&rdquo; and then paste the content and watch the magic happen.</p>

## Brave and Opera are adding AI-powered summaries to their browsers

<p>While Microsoft continues to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html">polish Bing Chat</a> and Google preps its own AI chatbot, Bard, smaller alternative browsers Brave and Opera are making plans for AI, too. The two browser companies said that they will use AI to summarize articles, with Brave debuting the Summarizer today.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s latest <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504771/microsoft-unveils-ai-powered-bing-search-edge.html">beta version of Edge uses Bing&rsquo;s AI-powered chatbot</a> to summarize articles that it finds on the Web, providing a concise explanation of their contents in the sidebar if asked. The Brave Summarizer is slightly different; instead, it uses its own AI-powered tools to examine a page of results and then summarize the findings. Brave provides its own search tools, and it is using the AI summation to replace the page-generated description with its own.</p>



<p>According to Brave, the company uses its Summarizer tool as a way to counteract what it sees as a problem of the Large Language Models (LLMs) that underlie so-called AI tools. These LLMs can &ldquo;hallucinate&rdquo; data, making up facts where none exist. Brave says that the Summarizer, by contrast, simply sums up what&rsquo;s there on the page, leaving the link intact for attribution.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Brave summarizer AI" class="wp-image-1528826" height="1147" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Brave-summarizer-before-and-after.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; look at how Brave&rsquo;s Summarizer works.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brave</p></div>



<p>&ldquo;Unlike AI chat tools which can provide fabricated responses, the Summarizer generates a plain-written summary at the top of the search results page, aggregating the latest sources on the Web and providing source attribution for transparency and accountability,&rdquo; said Josep Pujol, chief of search at Brave, in a statement.  </p>



<p>Brave did not use OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT as the basis of its Summarizer engine. Instead, the company said that it had trained three of its own LLMs to read the page, rule out spam or hate speech, and then summarize the results.</p>



<p>Opera, however, said this week that it will collaborate with OpenAI to implement OpenAI&rsquo;s &ldquo;state-of-the-art AI models&rdquo; within its browser. That will include a new &ldquo;Shorten&rdquo; button in the address bar that will be able to use AI to generate short summaries of any webpage or article, Opera said. However, the company did not offer any timetable for integrating the AI technology. Additional AI-powered services will be added to Opera&rsquo;s sidebar, the company said.</p>

## The new Pokémon Sleep ‘game’ looks ridiculous – and helpful

<p>The Pok&eacute;mon Company has finally drawn back the big, silk curtains on its latest mobile app game, <em>Pok&eacute;mon Sleep</em>. Although it was first announced back in 2019, the company had been keeping mum about it&hellip; <em>until now</em>. </p>



<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s a glorified sleep tracker. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;d classify <em>Pok&eacute;mon Sleep</em> as a traditional mobile game, as you have to be sleeping in order to play it. That said, it&rsquo;s an interesting take on sleep tracker apps and, as someone who struggles to stay asleep through the night, I definitely want to give it a go. Check out the video below for a deeper look into the app.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This app rewards you as you sleep. The idea is rather simple. The longer you sleep, the higher your score will be. You&rsquo;ll also see more Pok&eacute;mon gathered around Snorlax, the drowsiest Pok&eacute;mon of them all. The app will identify your sleep as three distinct styles&mdash;dozing, snoozing, and slumbering. The Pok&eacute;mon that match your sleep style will appear around Snorlax when you wake in the morning. You may even get to see a few rare ones, which is pretty darn cool. These Pok&eacute;mon will be catalogued in your sleep style dex, which sounds similar to the famous <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex&amp;xcust=2-1-1529749-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Pok&eacute;dex</a>. </p>



<p>I loved <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;xcust=2-1-1529749-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Pok&eacute;mon Go</a>, as it got me outside and moving a lot more than I normally do. There&rsquo;s nothing more exciting than a game that encourages healthy habits and makes the entire process fun. Who knows? With Pok&eacute;mon Sleep, maybe I&rsquo;ll learn a thing or two about my own sleeping habits. Either way, I&rsquo;m super jazzed about it and can&rsquo;t wait to set it up. Plus, I&rsquo;m a 90s kid that grew up with the trading cards and television show, so nostalgia is a massive factor for me here.</p>



<p>The Pok&eacute;mon Company plans on launching the mobile app in the summer of 2023. To keep track of any upcoming updates, check out <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pokemon.com/us&amp;xcust=2-1-1529749-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Pokemon.com</a>.</p>

## 5 just-released Windows 11 features you need to try now

<p>Windows 11 may have switched to once-yearly major updates, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean new features can&rsquo;t show up more often. Case in point: This week, Microsoft suddenly and surprisingly dropped a massive update for Windows 11 that&rsquo;s absolutely brimming with fresh goodies to play with.</p>



<p>My colleague Mark Hachman covered <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1522426/windows-11-february-update-adds-bing-ai-chat-tabbed-notepad-iphone.html">everything new in the February 2023 Windows 11 update</a>, then went <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1527037/windows-11s-new-features-are-ho-hum-but-the-best-one-saves-you-money.html">hands-on with several of the new features</a>. There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that simply isn&rsquo;t relevant to me, such as better AI tools on Qualcomm-powered PCs, tweaks to the native Teams chat experience, Facebook widgets, improved tablet behavior, and so on. But there are several nifty new features with a broader appeal that I can&rsquo;t wait to try out&mdash;and you probably will too. Let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>



<h2 id="ai-powered-bing-chat-search-box">AI-powered Bing Chat search box</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Bing Chat in Windows 11" class="wp-image-1525522" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bing-in-Windows.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Microsoft certainly isn&rsquo;t wasting its time bringing the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html">new AI-powered Bing Chat</a> to the masses. The company revealed the ChatGPT-powered tool mere weeks ago, rolled it out to mobile Bing and Edge users in short order, and now it&rsquo;s coming right to the Windows 11 taskbar, integrated into the newly returned search box. You&rsquo;ll need to be enrolled in the Bing AI preview to use the chat, though. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html">how to get started with Bing Chat in Windows 11</a>.</p>



<p>Honestly, while asking Microsoft&rsquo;s AI to plan vacations and whip up meals from a list of ingredients is cool and all, I&rsquo;m most excited about the simple revival of the search box. I use it all the time in Windows 10, but Windows 11 dumped it in favor of a search <em>button</em> that summons a separate window where you conduct system searches, adding significantly more clicks and headaches to the process. Even if you don&rsquo;t care about Bing Chat, the return of the search box is a major win for everyday Windows 11 users.</p>



<h2 id="notepad-tabs">Notepad tabs</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 tabbed notepad" class="wp-image-1528326" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/windows-11-tabbed-notepad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Tab all the things! I&rsquo;m a massive fan of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407624/stardock-groupy-manage-windows.html">Stardock&rsquo;s $5 Groupy software</a> to turn every window into a tab, but it won&rsquo;t be needed for much longer if Microsoft keeps this up. At the end of 2023, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430331/use-the-new-tabbed-file-explorer-to-simplify-your-life.html">Windows 11 <em>finally </em>added File Explorer tabs</a> after years of begging by enthusiasts, and the February 2023 update brings tabs to the venerable Notepad app.</p>



<p>Oh, and in case you missed it, Notepad was also updated last year to support Windows 11&rsquo;s Dark Mode. <em>Chef&rsquo;s kiss</em>.</p>



<h2 id="iphone-support-in-phone-link">iPhone support in Phone Link</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Windows 11 Phone Link for iOS better shot" class="wp-image-1525348" height="789" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Phone-Link-for-iOS-better.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Android users have been able to control their phones via the Windows Phone Link app for years now, but Apple&rsquo;s tighter rules have prevented iPhone support. No longer. You&rsquo;ll need to be a Windows Insider to use it right now, but Windows 11&rsquo;s February Update finally adds the ability to manage iPhones from your PC.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to send and receive calls, texts, and more right on your desktop, but Apple&rsquo;s rules mean there are several catches involved in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525289/windows-11-phone-link-manage-iphone-texts-and-calls.html">Windows 11&rsquo;s new iPhone support</a>. Because of that, you may be better off <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1486715/how-to-get-apple-imessages-on-windows-11.html">using Intel&rsquo;s Unison app to get iMessage on Windows</a> instead. It ostensibly only supports Intel-based PCs though, so AMD Ryzen users (like myself) still have a lot to look forward to in Windows 11&rsquo;s new native iPhone capabilities.</p>



<h2 id="snipping-tool-screen-recording">Snipping Tool screen recording</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 February 2023 Update Snipping Tool screen recorder" class="wp-image-1523992" height="801" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-Snipping-tool-screen-recorder.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Windows has offered a rocking Snipping Tool for a <em>long</em> time now, but it could only be used to quickly grab screenshots. With the Windows 11 February 2023 Update, the Snipping Tool can now record videos as well. <em>Finally</em>!</p>



<p>All you have to do is click the new record button in Snipping Tool to start capturing a video, then click it again to stop.&nbsp;Boom! You now have a quick clip to share with friends, helpfully saved to a default folder. This could be insanely handy while troubleshooting or explaining a process to other people.</p>



<h2 id="energy-recommendations">Energy recommendations</h2>

<p>The Humble Bundle company is no stranger to either massive groups of PC games or charitable giving, and it&rsquo;s combining its talents for a deal you don&rsquo;t want to miss. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/games/turkiye-syria-earthquake-relief-bundle?hmb_source=&amp;cjevent=86cc6177b90a11ed83385fdb0a82b836&amp;utm_source=cj&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=Future+Publishing+Limited&amp;utm_content=7706533&amp;utm_term=14473384&amp;cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;xcust=2-1-1529672-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">T&uuml;rkiye-Syria Earthquake Relief Bundle</a> is a package of 69 games (plus some TTRPG elements and comics) sold for a minimum of $30, 100 percent of which goes to charities directly contributing to relief for the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria last month. </p>



<p>In addition to a great cause, it&rsquo;s a great deal. Headlining PC games include <em>Ghostrunner, Euro Truck Simulator 17, PayDay 2, Guilty Gear X2, </em>and <em>XCOM 2</em>, all of which would be worth the $30 entry fee alone. There&rsquo;s also <em>Gotham Knights</em>, the Arkham follow-up from last year that fell a little flat, but is still going for $60 on Steam. The list includes all-time classics like <em>System Shock 2 </em>and<em> Worms Rumble</em>, indie favorites like <em>Hyper Gunsport, Stacking, </em>and <em>Cris Tales</em>, and my personal action-strategy obsession, <em>Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</em> (700 hours and counting). </p>



<p>On top of all of that, you get a smattering of indie games that come from Turkish developers (including <em>Mount &amp; Blade</em>), plus the core rulebook for sci-fi tabletop RPG <em>Starfinder </em>and the <em>Junker&rsquo;s Delight</em> add-on. Still not enough? How about the first ten volumes of <em>Saga</em>, the fantasy-sci-fi graphic novel that&rsquo;s won dozens of awards for its writing and art. The total retail value of the bundle is over $1000, and all of the digital codes can be redeemed on Steam. </p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s the full list of games in the bundle in alphabetical order. </p>

<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s taken forever for the latest and greatest storage standard to release an updated spec, but the wait is over. Gigabyte&rsquo;s Aurous Gen5 SSDs, which appear to be the very first PCIe 5.0 M.2 drives to hit the market, are now available for purchase. You can get this super-fast drive, rated for read speeds up to 9,500 megabytes per second, right now&hellip;if you can find it in stock, and you&rsquo;ve been saving your pennies. </p>



<p>The Aurous Gen5 10000 comes in both 1TB and 2TB capacities, with that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504081/gigabytes-newest-ssd-has-a-heatsink-with-its-own-zip-code.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">massive passive cooler</a> included in the package (you can install it in an 80mm M.2 slot with or without the cooler). According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/first-pcie-gen5-ssds-are-now-available&amp;xcust=2-1-1529758-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>, the retail price of the 2TB capacity was briefly shown at $350 on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-2tb-aorus-gen5-10000/p/N82E16820009042&amp;xcust=2-1-1529758-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Newegg</a>&hellip;before it instantly went out of stock, both there and on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVRS52T5&amp;xcust=2-1-1529758-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. So the drives are going out, but you&rsquo;ll have to be extremely lucky to get one of the first ones. </p>



<p>Of course in order to actually take advantage of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1447979/the-long-promised-pcie-5-0-ssd-revolution-failed-to-arrive-at-ces-2023.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">incredible speed capacity of PCIe 5.0</a>, you&rsquo;ll need a motherboard that can handle it. Those have been on the market for over a year just waiting for the drives to arrive. If you can wait a little longer, Samsung, Corsair, MSI, Patriot, and others should have competing drives out sometime this year or early next. </p>

<p>If you want a gaming laptop with a ferocious Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 paired with an absurdly fast 240Hz display, you&rsquo;d normally spend $2,500 or even more&mdash;sometimes much more. But now that new RTX 40-series laptops are rolling out, we&rsquo;ve spotted a killer deal on an MSI laptop with those exact specs. Best Buy is selling the <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmsi-gp66-15-6-240hz-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-1tb-ssd-16gb-memory-black%2F6492572.p%3FskuId%3D6492572&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">MSI GP66 for $1,599.99</a>. That&rsquo;s <em>ludicrous</em>. This machine practically oozes power and we&rsquo;re so here for it.</p>



<p>The MSI GP66 comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-11800H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. This thing should fly right through most games on Ultra graphics without even breaking a sweat, especially ones that support Nvidia&rsquo;s performance-boosting DLSS technology. The spacious 15.6-inch display has resolution of 1920&times;1080 to go with the blistering-fast 240Hz refresh rate. According to the reviews on Best Buy, many buyers were impressed by the utter speed and graphics power of this particular machine. Sounds good, right?</p>



<p>This is one heck of a deal. Get it now.</p>

<p>Where online storage services such as Dropbox, iCloud, and others only allow you to sync data across devices, Sync.com adds discrete unsynced storage to the mix via its Vault folder. This makes it particularly well-suited for backup. We like the approach, and we think the company should take it even further.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html">best cloud backup services</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in online backup, and product recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="sync-com-features-and-pricing">Sync.com: Features and pricing</h2>



<p>Sync.com sports a web interface that you can use to drag and drop files to and from your desktop, as well as apps that provide sync functionality for Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. There&rsquo;s a free 5GB account available (not to be mistaken for the free trial of the paid tier&mdash;see the screenshot below). End-users can upgrade that storage to 200GB for $5 a month, 2TB for $8 a month, and 6TB for $20 a month.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Sync.com free plan" class="wp-image-1527004" height="661" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sync.com-free-plan.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="930" /><figcaption>Look for the small print!  The offer for the 5GB free plan resides in the lower-left corner.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jon Jacobi / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The free and $5 upgrade lack some features found in the $8 account: such as document previews for viewing files online&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to download; the ability to selectively choose what files in your Sync folder you just want kept locally or cloud-only (a feature that&rsquo;s currently in beta); and the ability to grant a non-user permission to upload files to your Sync folder and Vault. </p>



<p>The $20 Solo Professional tier goes even further with advanced features for branding (using your own logo, etc.) and priority support.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1501435" height="728" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sync-dot-com-11.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Individual plans range from $5 to $20 a month.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There are also business-oriented Team accounts for multiple users. Entry-level for this type of account is $6 a month per user (a minimum of two users) with 1TB of storage per user, while for $15 monthly per user you get unlimited storage, branding, and phone support. </p>



<p>In my opinion, the additional 800GB of storage and extra features such as upload links (you send a link to a location for a customer to upload a file) make the $6 team plan a better deal than the $5 single-user plan. Assuming of course, you can find a partner in crime.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1501436" height="755" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sync-dot-com-10.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>If you have a pal that wants online storage, the $6 team license is the sweet spot in the plans.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Sync.com&rsquo;s web interface is generally attractive and easy, but I was a little confused when I clicked on Help and was immediately presented with a contact form. There&rsquo;s a small link at the top of the form to the Sync knowledge base, but like the offer for the free 5GB plan, it&rsquo;s rather unobtrusive and easy to miss. </p>



<p>Giving the knowledge base its own menu item would be helpful since that&rsquo;s where most users are inclined to look. Also, as the desktop app creates a Sync folder, it might be nice if the corresponding destination on the website was called that rather than the somewhat cryptic &ldquo;Files.&rdquo; </p>



<h2 id="the-sync-folder">The Sync folder</h2>



<p>Said Files folder behaves just like any other sync service&rsquo;s. Any files stored there will be subsequently distributed to any devices running the Sync.com app. Drag-and-drop is fully supported by the web browser interface, which is what I used for my first couple of tests. </p>



<p>I then switched to the local Sync folder installed by the Sync app as it supports the previously described Sync CloudFiles on-demand function, which allows you to decide which files are local and which are cloud-only. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1501466" height="637" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sync-dot-com-7.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The  Sync  folder is where you keep files you want synced across devices.</figcaption></figure></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1502784" height="908" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-02-at-5.30.53-PM.png" width="471" /><figcaption>If you set an external file or folder as Cloud-only, it won&rsquo;t be synced to other devices, or your local Sync folder.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Similar to a feature in OneDrive, Sync CloudFiles lets you set files to on-demand, or &ldquo;cloud-only,&rdquo; so they don&rsquo;t sync with other devices automatically. They&rsquo;re only copied to the cloud where you may then manually download them onto other devices as needed. It can be a way to save space on devices. The option for this is found in the right-click context menu, on your computer; it didn&rsquo;t appear as an option when I tested Sync from the web portal. Remember, the feature is still in beta. Note that files you delete from the Sync folder are retained until you specifically empty the trash.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Sync.com is as easy and secure as any service we&rsquo;ve tried, and the dual sync/simple storage functionality makes it easy to back up as well as keep pertinent data on all your devices.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="the-vault">The Vault</h2>



<p>If you want to back up files without transferring them to the local Sync folder, you use the &ldquo;Copy to Vault&rdquo; option that the Sync program integrates into the context menus of your operating system. Files in the Vault remain unchanged until you delete them using the web interface, or they are replaced by newer versions&mdash;subsequent copies are compared with new or updated files copied into the vault. Files in the Vault are accessible from the Wweb interface and any of the apps. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1502796" height="677" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sync-dot-com-18.png" width="366" /></figure></div>



<p>My only issue with the Vault is that, currently, files must be copied manually. I&rsquo;m not one of those people who always remembers to back up. Data in the Vault is stored online using the same directory structure that the data is copied from (E.g, c:\users\username\documents\copied directory or files). As the program obviously knows where the files are, there&rsquo;s no reason that the Sync app couldn&rsquo;t automatically perform backups. If not in real time or following changes, then at least on a continual schedule. I&rsquo;ve lobbied Sync.com to add this feature.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1501467" height="637" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sync-dot-com-15.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Vault is where you store files you don&rsquo;t want synced across devices.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Not everyone wants to sync data across all their devices, especially those working with large data sets such as my 700GB of recordings, which most definitely will not fit on my phone. (Note that cloud-only files will appear in the apps and local folder, they just won&rsquo;t take up any space.)</p>



<p></p>



<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>



<p>Sync.com&rsquo;s performance will obviously vary by the interface you use and, more importantly, the bandwidth of your internet connection. My initial transfers using a web browser and drag-and-drop were reasonably quick and of course started immediately. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1501463" height="1158" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sync-dot-com-14.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>If you click on the link at the top of the dialog, you&rsquo;ll actually get to the help file. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Syncing 3.5GB of images with the Sync.com folder was complete within a couple of hours. Copies to the Vault commenced in good order, and my initial upload was available online within an hour. Note that my upstream bandwidth is approximately 500MBps.</p>



<p>I did have one minor issue while booting macOS: Sync.com would throw a message about being disabled. Choosing the Re-enable option from the dialog fixed the issue temporarily and providing Sync.com full disk access in Security eliminated the issue.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-use-sync-com">Should you use Sync.com?</h2>



<p>Sync.com is as easy and secure as any service we&rsquo;ve tried, and the dual-role sync/simple storage functionality makes it easy to back up as well as keep pertinent data on all your devices. It would be easier with scheduling and a few language tweaks, but kudos at any rate. To reiterate, we consider the $6 per month Team plan the sweet spot for Sync.com if you can grab another family member or pal to team up with.</p>

<p>With AMD&rsquo;s new V-Cache-infused <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html">Ryzen 9 7950X3D and 7900X3D processors</a> now formally on sale, the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;best of both worlds&rdquo; design is creating confusion.</p>



<p>Both Ryzen 9 X3D chips ship with two dies inside. One die comes stacked with V-Cache on top to speed up gaming, while the other non-cache-laden die can hit higher clock speeds. AMD said it made this decision&mdash;rather than topping both dies with V-Cache&mdash;because many applications don&rsquo;t care about the additional 64MB of cache and benefit from higher clock speeds instead.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of misconceptions of AMD&rsquo;s approach on the Internet, with some enthusiasts outright calling the CPU a &ldquo;scam,&rdquo; and others <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wishcasting&amp;xcust=2-1-1528458-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">wishcasting</a> for the 12-core 7900X3D to be constructed in a manner the company has never done before. In the interest of spreading good information rather than bad information, we&rsquo;re debunking a few of the misconceptions out there that we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html">Ryzen 7950X3D review: AMD&rsquo;s monster gaming CPU works like a pro, too</a></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="the-ryzen-9-7950x3ds-2nd-die-is-disabled-or-a-scam">The Ryzen 9 7950X3D&rsquo;s 2nd die is &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; or a &ldquo;scam&rdquo;</h2>

<p>One common misconception we&rsquo;re seeing often deals with how AMD is managing where applications run on its dual-die approach. These allege that the second die is &ldquo;disabled,&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;is a scam,&rdquo; and that you cannot access it while gaming&mdash;effectively turning your 16-core CPU into an 8-core CPU. <strong>This simply is not true.</strong></p>



<p>Without access to a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338612/check-out-intels-new-thread-director-2-for-13th-gen-cpus.html">fancy Thread Director technology</a> similar to Intel&rsquo;s implementation in 12th- and 13th-gen Core chips, AMD relies largely on the operating system being able to identify games. Once a game is identified as being the focused application in the foreground, the system tells the second die to &ldquo;park.&rdquo; Parking <strong>does not</strong> mean permanently shut off or disabled, as it was with AMD&rsquo;s original Threadripper. That CPU did indeed shut off a die, which could only be turned back on after a reboot.</p>



<p>With the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, parking the 2nd die basically redirects all threads from the the game to the first die, keeping all of the game&rsquo;s threads on the cached or stacked die. In our experience, it&rsquo;s a pretty blunt instrument and everything is then shunted to that die when under a certain threshold. </p>



<p>It does not, however, mean the second die is &ldquo;disabled.&rdquo; Think of it more as on standby to work if there is actually work to be done.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Ryzen 9 7950X3D does indeed give you access to all of your cores while gaming." class="wp-image-1528480" height="450" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>You can see Windows Resource Monitor showing that you can indeed access all of the cores of a Ryzen 9 7950X3D while Cinebench R23 is running using 16-threads, Google Chrome is running WebXPRT 4 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider is being played in the foreground.</p> (Right mouse click and select open in new tab to see the original image.)</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>For example, we played a game in the foreground with Google Chrome running a benchmark (a very lightly-threaded task) as well as Cinebench R23 running on four threads, then switched back to the game. The vast majority of the game as well as Google Chrome and Cinebench would mostly stay on the stacked die&rsquo;s 16 available threads.</p>



<p>We then tasked Cinebench R23 with running 16 threads&mdash;consuming a full die&rsquo;s worth of cores&mdash;in addition to the game in the foreground and Google Chrome running a benchmark. Under this condition, both dies would be awake and working even though a game was being run.</p>



<p>So no, Internet, you are not being &ldquo;scammed&rdquo; out of that second core.</p>



<h2 id="ryzen-9-7900x3d-will-feature-an-8-core-die-and-4-core-die">Ryzen 9 7900X3D will feature an 8-core die and 4-core die!</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3d die" class="wp-image-1446922" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AMD-Ryzen-9-7950X3d-die.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Ryzen 9 7950X3D&rsquo;s chip layout.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>We&rsquo;re not sure where this rumor started from but it&rsquo;s continually bubbled up in recent weeks as the Ryzen X3D launch has approached. Despite the fact that AMD has never made an 8+4 chip in any of its 12-core Ryzen chips, somehow it continually has been whispered that the 12-core 7900X3D would use an 8-core and 4-core design. </p>



<p>That isn&rsquo;t true, according to AMD. As expected, the design for the Ryzen 9 7900X3D will feature the expected 6-core plus 6-core design as previous ones have, with one of the dies being stacked with V-Cache. So why the wishcasting for an 8+4? We suspect some hoped the chip would bias toward giving the CPU the advantage of a full 8-core die that would benefit over having &ldquo;only&rdquo; a 6-core CCD with V-cache.</p>



<p>And yes Internet, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D will also feature a single 8-core design too&mdash;not a 4+4 dual-core design as some have also floated as well.</p>



<h2 id="ryzen-9-7950x3d-requires-a-huge-check-list-to-make-it-even-work">Ryzen 9 7950X3D requires a &ldquo;huge check list&rdquo; to make it even work.</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="You will need the latest BIOS to properly run a Ryzen 9 X3D chip too" class="wp-image-1528484" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AGESA.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>You will need an updated BIOS, updated driver and the latest Windows Xbox Game Bar to properly run a Ryzen 9 X3D CPU.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>This last misconception is largely based on a document provided to reviewers (and we suspect software and hardware developers) to ensure their dual-die Ryzen 7000 X3D systems were functioning correctly. The document provides 47 pages of step-by-step instructions. Some people took that to mean consumers might have to take the same steps for full functionality. That is not true, according to AMD. The company says all a consumer needs to do is make sure the BIOS is updated to the latest one (which adds support for the Ryzen 7000 X3D parts) and load the latest available Ryzen drivers. The third step will be to make sure the Microsoft Xbox Game Bar is updated through the Windows store, as it&rsquo;s in charge of assigning games to the V-Cache-equipped dies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="put-down-your-pitchforks">Put down your pitchforks</h2>



<p>Despite these misconceptions, there are definitely still many, many open questions about AMD&rsquo;s new Ryzen 7000 X3D chips moving forward. </p>

<p>It is, obviously, a different approach to building a CPU than we&rsquo;ve seen before. Could AMD have benefited from less confusion, or relying on the operating system to do much of the heavy lifting like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338612/check-out-intels-new-thread-director-2-for-13th-gen-cpus.html">Intel&rsquo;s Thread Director approach</a>? Perhaps. Taking a longer-term view, it also becomes more clear that as processor companies mix different chips inside with different performance capabilities, managing how the OS and less sophisticated games and applications use those assets is going to be increasingly important too.</p>



<p>For now, AMD&rsquo;s approach &ldquo;mostly&rdquo; works. We found in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html">our testing</a> that it gives us the expected high boost clocks on par with the Ryzen 9 7950X under light loads, slightly less performance under all core-loads (due to its slightly lower clock speeds), and <em>very</em> impressive gaming gains where the cache matters. But there were times when we wished we could assign some games to the non-stacked die rather than have all games being simply pushed to the stacked die.</p>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1522426/windows-11-february-update-adds-bing-ai-chat-tabbed-notepad-iphone.html">latest Windows 11 update</a>, or &ldquo;moment,&rdquo; offers a number of intriguing tweaks and some new additions, but don&rsquo;t be fooled. It largely falls short of the hype. But there&rsquo;s one feature that should be played up more &mdash; one that promises to save you some actual money.</p>



<p>Windows 11&rsquo;s surprise upgrade is frustrating on a number of fronts, because this &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2023/02/28/introducing-a-big-update-to-windows-11-making-the-everyday-easier-including-bringing-the-new-ai-powered-bing-to-the-taskbar/&amp;xcust=2-1-1527037-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">big update</a>,&rdquo; as Microsoft puts it, is apparently somehow less important than the &ldquo;feature update&rdquo; it released last year. Even that update, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/827065/windows-11-22h2-review-subtle-improvements-but-not-where-it-should.html">Windows 11 2022 Update</a>, wasn&rsquo;t much to speak of, either. Features that missed <em>that</em> release appeared in the first &ldquo;Moment&rdquo; <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1356738/tabbed-file-explorer-more-new-windows-11-features-roll-out-today.html">last October</a>. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s a roundabout way of saying that we might not need to pay as much attention to these incremental rollups of new features that we did in the past, especially when they&rsquo;re more tweaks to existing Windows features than anything else. We&rsquo;ve spent some hands-on time with what the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1528312/windows-11-features-bing-chat-tabs-iphone-energy-saver.html">new features Microsoft <em>has</em> rolled out in this update</a>, however, and our impression of the Windows 11 February 2023 update is&hellip;well, mainly disappointment.</p>



<h2 id="big-features-in-name-only">Big features in name only</h2>



<p>The flagship feature of the February 2023 update to Windows 11 is the integration of Bing Chat into Windows.  As our earlier<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html"> hands-on with Bing Chat in Windows 11</a> indicated, Microsoft didn&rsquo;t so much integrate the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html">new AI-powered Bing Chat</a> as provide a <em>shortcut</em> to Bing Chat, via links inside the updated Search box in Windows 11. While the reborn Search box now allows you to type inside it rather than booting you to a new Search window, it quickly opens up the Search menu after just a few characters. </p>



<p>Bing Chat isn&rsquo;t actually inside Windows. Instead, connecting to Bing Chat via either the dedicated &ldquo;Chat&rdquo; tab or via the Bing icon simply opens Edge and directs you the Bing.com site itself. While we don&rsquo;t feel as much outrage about this shortcut as some corners of the Web do, it&rsquo;s also fair to say that we&rsquo;re going to have to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1508826/12-ways-ai-could-improve-windows-11-or-windows-12.html">wait for an AI-powered Windows</a> to debut later. And that&rsquo;s okay! Microsoft has some breathing room before <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1076150/intel-confirms-ai-improvements-will-come-in-meteor-lake.html">Intel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meteor Lake&rdquo; chip</a> joins Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon and AMD&rsquo;s future Ryzen processors with integrated AI, allowing local processing right on your PC.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Search box Bing Chat " class="wp-image-1526875" height="870" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-Bing-Chat-via-Search-edit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Likewise, the promise of controlling your iPhone via Windows falls a bit short, too. That you can connect to your iPhone, manage its contacts, place calls, and send texts is a worthy accomplishment. But <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525289/windows-11-phone-link-manage-iphone-texts-and-calls.html">Phone Link for iOS</a> probably isn&rsquo;t quite what iPhone users hoped for. Yes, people still use iPhones to make phone calls, and what Phone Link does is connect to your iPhone via Bluetooth, and make the call via your PC. </p>



<p>However, the ability to send vanilla SMS texts pales to what iPhone users actually use, iMessage, and Phone Link doesn&rsquo;t support direct interactions with that application. I don&rsquo;t have an iPhone to test (and don&rsquo;t really want one, actually) but it&rsquo;s not clear how SMS texts sent from Phone Link to another iPhone will be read, and whether iMessages sent to your iPhone will be interpreted correctly. (&ldquo;We send the messages back and forth via Bluetooth, Apple <em>I think</em> in turn sends those as iMessage once it gets onto their system,&rdquo; Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft&rsquo;s head of consumer marketing, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/microsoft-s-phone-link-app-now-lets-you-use-imessage-from-your-pc/ar-AA182Ddb&amp;xcust=2-1-1527037-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">told</a> The Verge. Emphasis ours.)</p>



<p>In either case, however, you can&rsquo;t send group texts or multimedia messages. That&rsquo;s a significant limit. Microsoft will have to ramp up its interactions with iOS &mdash; if Apple allows it &mdash; to make it truly useful. </p>



<h2 id="lowering-your-power-bill">Lowering your power bill</h2>



<p>The one redeeming feature of the new update is the one feature that promises to have real value, Energy Recommendations. With power bills spiking across the United States and Europe, the new energy recommendations (which should be in the Windows 11 <em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; battery &gt; Energy Recommendations</em>) offer smart reminders to dial down your PC&rsquo;s performance, screen brightness, and drastically cut your power-on time when idle. (You can see some of the new, suggested settings on Microsoft&rsquo;s support page.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 February 2023 Update Energy recommendations edit" class="wp-image-1528586" height="735" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Windows-11-energy-recommendations-on-my-pc-edit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>If you have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">a laptop with Windows Hello</a>, an SSD, a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">Thunderbolt dock</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">an external display or two</a>, leaving your PC powered on while away can consume significant power. Granted, an average PC doesn&rsquo;t consume that much power by itself &mdash; 65 to 80 watts, most likely &mdash; but higher-performance gaming laptops can consume even more power, up to 200 watts, and even more for a powerful desktop. Add to that the power consumed by those accessories and the power costs can add up over the course of a month, especially if you&rsquo;re tacking on several hours of up time by forgetting to shut it down during lunch or overnight.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s nothing here that you can&rsquo;t do yourself, but Energy Recommendations may help save you some money. </p>



<h2 id="smaller-useful-features">Smaller useful features</h2>



<p>Let&rsquo;s face it: The majority of these new features are just tweaks. I do really think that the screen recording feature of Snipping Tool will be useful for my purposes, as I can quickly record a quick-and-dirty &ldquo;movie&rdquo; of my interactions with various Windows apps, then upload them. But it isn&rsquo;t properly implemented yet, either: the <strong>Win+Shift+S</strong> shortcut supposedly opens the tool, but the only way to open the screen recorder functionality is by launching the app itself. (Frustrating!) </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 February 2023 Update Snipping Tool screen recorder" class="wp-image-1523992" height="801" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-Snipping-tool-screen-recorder.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The  Snipping Tool&rsquo;s screen recorder allows quick &ldquo;movies&rdquo; of what you see on your PC.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Screen recording works by defining a portion (or all) of the screen, clicking the recording button, than performing the actions that you want to record. When done, the file is saved as an MP4 video file. Supposedly, recording video as a GIF is on the to-do list for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563788/seven-ways-in-which-microsofts-powertoys-improves-my-life.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s collection of awesome PowerToys apps</a>; implementing this in either the Snipping Tool or a separate app should be a handy and necessary upgrade.</p>



<p>You may care that Widgets now include Game Pass updates, Spotify news, and some Facebook content (Messenger, not your feed, it appears.) Automatically hiding your taskbar when a Windows tablet is undocked from its keyboard is an okay tweak, but not a necessary one. A tabbed Notepad, updated Windows Chat, and a higher-profile Quick Assist feature are all handy additions, but nothing essential.</p>



<p>You can&rsquo;t blame Microsoft for playing up the Bing Chat hype &mdash; for once, it&rsquo;s finally managed to steal the search spotlight from Google, and it&rsquo;s enjoying the moment. But don&rsquo;t be fooled: there aren&rsquo;t a tremendous number of new additions to Windows in its latest update, and the biggest one is hidden deep within the Settings menu.</p>
