There was a good chunk of time where it looked like Dead Island 2 would never, ever come out. It was mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Half-Life Episode 3- games that were officially announced but then just disappeared off the face of the world. 

First announced nearly a decade ago in 2014, Dead Island 2 was in the works in some form or the other for even longer than that, and it changed developers multiple times, going from Yager Development to Sumo Digital to finally Dambuster Studios, while also being delayed time and time and time again throughout that period.
