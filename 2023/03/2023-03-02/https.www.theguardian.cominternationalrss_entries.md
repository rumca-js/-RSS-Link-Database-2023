<p>Sunak’s handling of the NI protocol suggests a leader – and a Tory party – with more left in the tank than some think</p><p>Does Rishi Sunak deserve some kind of apology? Too soon for that. But don’t underestimate this prime minister, either. His party trails Labour by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">more than 20 points</a> in the polls. His job <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/#sunak-approval">approval rating</a> is bumping along at -26. But his handling of the Northern Ireland protocol changes this week suggests a leader with more in the tank than critics have allowed. Perhaps Sunak should not be too readily dismissed as a caretaker who is seeing out time until Keir Starmer takes over.</p><p>It is, admittedly, early days for such speculation. The protocol deal has not yet been approved. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/27/dup-leader-faces-stark-and-binary-choice-over-any-ni-protocol-deal">DUP is divided</a> about how to respond, and enjoys the feeling of having Sunak’s future in its hands. A return to power-sharing at Stormont, with the DUP playing second fiddle to Sinn Féin, is a long way off. An improved UK-EU relationship that could eventually ease Britain’s trading problems is more distant still. Most voters in Britain don’t have Europe or Northern Ireland on their minds anyway.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/02/rishi-sunak-northern-ireland-protocol-tory-party">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nisar Ahmed was almost killed in the Delhi riots. But when he became a witness in court cases against the alleged perpetrators, he realised that was only the start of his troubles</p><p>This is how Nisar Ahmed remembers it. On 24 February 2020, at about three in the afternoon, an uproar outside his house brought him to his window. A large crowd of men was passing through Bhagirathi Vihar, his neighbourhood in north-east Delhi, chanting “Victory to Lord Ram!” and “Wake up, Hindus, wake up!”. Ahmed conferred with Asma, his wife. They decided, somewhat uncertainly, that the procession was probably harmless to Muslims like them.</p><p>“It felt like the usual political sloganeering,” Ahmed recalled. Politics was politics, but this was a neighbourhood where Muslims and Hindus called one another over for chai and sat outside together late at night. That brotherhood was protection enough. If there was any disturbance, elders would settle it. That was the hope anyway, and Ahmed was a man who lived on hope. His house overlooked a sewage canal, but when he looked out of his window he would choose to see instead the unbroken sky. Small things like this brought him inordinate pleasure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/02/you-wont-find-a-braver-man-the-muslim-witness-confronting-indias-legal-labyrinth-nisar-ahmed">Continue reading...</a>
