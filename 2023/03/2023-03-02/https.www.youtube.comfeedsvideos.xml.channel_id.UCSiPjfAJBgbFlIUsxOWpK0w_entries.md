This cover of JVKE’s "golden hour" really does have all the qualities of real life golden Hours. The harmonies by Erin, Anilee, and Beane are so incredibly tight without feeling forced. And the instruments dropping out in the first chorus really does make time feel slowed as we anticipate the next section. Of course, Swatkin’s tasty solo is such a great ending to such a smooth and joyful song!
