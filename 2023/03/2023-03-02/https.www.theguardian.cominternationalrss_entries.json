This is <a href=\"https://www.bipocemonight.com/\">Bipoc Emo Night,</a> a burgeoning scene that celebrates the experience of queer, Black, and Indigenous emo fans.</p><p>Emo, an abbreviation of \u201cemotional hardcore\u201d, typically describes vulnerable anthems by bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Paramore, My Chemical Romance, and Fall Out Boy. The music spawned a culture rooted in a dark, fragile aesthetic that saw teens emerging from bedrooms in black skinny jeans and band T-shirts, brushing flat-ironed hair away from their kohled eyes. Communities formed around emo music on MySpace and at events like Warped Tour or among the clothing racks at Hot Topic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/02/bipoc-emo-night-club-event-music-diversity\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/02/bipoc-emo-night-club-event-music-diversity", "date_published": "2023-03-02 06:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Hundreds of trafficking victims in UK missing after referral to support scheme", "description": "<p>Home Office data shows 566 people were categorised as missing between 2020 and 2022</p><p>Hundreds of trafficking victims in the UK have gone missing after being referred to the government\u2019s scheme to protect them, the Guardian has learned.</p><p>The news comes after the immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, admitted in January that since 2021 about <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-200-unaccompanied-asylum-seeking-children-still-missing-from-uk-hotels-what-the-government-has-said-explained\">200 child asylum seekers</a> had gone missing from hotels where they had been in the care of the Home Office and its contractors.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/02/hundreds-of-trafficking-victims-in-uk-missing-after-referral-to-support-scheme\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/02/hundreds-of-trafficking-victims-in-uk-missing-after-referral-to-support-scheme", "date_published": "2023-03-02 06:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Overconsumption by the rich must be tackled, says acting UN biodiversity chief", "description": "<p>Wealthy countries and businesses should act now to ensure success of historic nature agreement signed at Cop15 in Montreal</p><p>Governments and businesses must start implementing this <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/e6d3/cd1d/daf663719a03902a9b116c34/cop-15-l-25-en.pdf\">decade\u2019s deal</a> to halt the destruction of Earth\u2019s ecosystems as soon as possible, the acting UN biodiversity chief has said, urging rich nations to tackle overconsumption of the planet\u2019s resources.</p><p>David Cooper, the new acting executive secretary for the UN convention on biological diversity (CBD), said countries and corporations must immediately act on December\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/22/drama-dismay-triumph-nailbiting-climax-to-the-worlds-biodiversity-deal\">historic agreement in Montreal</a>, which includes targets to protect 30% of Earth, reform $500bn (\u00a3410bn) of environmentally damaging subsidies, and address and disclose the impact businesses have on biodiversity.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/02/overconsumption-by-rich-must-be-tackled-says-acting-un-biodiversity-chief-aoe\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/02/overconsumption-by-rich-must-be-tackled-says-acting-un-biodiversity-chief-aoe", "date_published": "2023-03-02 06:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018Nervous\u2019 Kevin Durant scores 23 in winning Phoenix Suns debut", "description": "<ul><li>Durant makes long-awaited Suns debut in return from injury</li><li>13-time All-Star finishes with 23 points in win at Charlotte</li></ul><p>New team, same Kevin Durant.</p><p>The Durant era in Phoenix got off to solid start Wednesday night with the 13-time NBA All-Star scoring 23 points on 10-of-15 shooting, adding an explosive offensive element to an already dangerous offense in his Suns debut.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/01/kevin-durant-phoenix-suns-debut-charlotte-hornets\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/01/kevin-durant-phoenix-suns-debut-charlotte-hornets", "date_published": "2023-03-02 03:25:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "What\u2019s in the air in East Palestine, Ohio? - podcast", "description": "<p>When a train derailed in a small town in Ohio last month, it shed its toxic load, spewed smoke and set off a political firestorm that is still raging</p><p>On the evening of 3 February, a train made up of 149 carriages and more than a mile long came off the rails in the small Ohio town of East Palestine.
