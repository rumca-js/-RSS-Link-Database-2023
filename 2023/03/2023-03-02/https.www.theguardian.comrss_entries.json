[{"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Stephen Fry: Willem and Frieda \u2013 Defying the Nazis review \u2013 oh, what an astounding story this is!", "description": "<p>Fry lovingly brings to life the incredible adventures of two war heroes, whose all-night forgery parties fuelled by booze and amphetamines saved thousands of Jews</p><p>There is so much second world war on television \u2013 history programmes, prestige dramas, celebrity genealogy shows \u2013 that you might assume all the most compelling tales have been told already, three or four times over. But not this one. And, oh, what a story it is. If the gay painter Willem Arondeus and the lesbian cellist Frieda Belinfante seem unlikely heroes of the Dutch resistance, that is only because official histories have taught us so little about the true nature of courage. Their incredible wartime adventures, which saved thousands of Jewish lives, are related here by the famously knowledgable former QI quiz host Stephen Fry \u2013 and even he had never heard of them. Even more noteworthy is the fact that, as Fry points out, their names are little known in the Netherlands.</p><p>Crucially, Fry brings more than erudition to the archive table. Viewing the Arondeus collection in Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum, he not only notes the apparent influence of Oscar Wilde\u2019s most famous illustrator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/28/aubrey-beardsley-tate-britain-klimt-picasso-filthy-obsenity\">Aubrey Beardsley</a>, but draws on his own adolescent experience to speculate on how Wilde\u2019s persecution might have affected young Arondeus. \u201c[It] would have cast a dark shadow on his sense of self \u2026 It made me think, \u2018This is the fate of gay people \u2026 we will be outcast.\u2019\u201d Later, shown a yellow Star of David cloth badge, the kind that Jewish people were forced to wear, Fry shudders visibly. These are the visceral reactions of someone with a personal connection to the history, not a jobbing presenter on another indifferent gig.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/02/stephen-fry-willem-and-frieda-defying-the-nazis-review-oh-what-an-astounding-story-this-is\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/02/stephen-fry-willem-and-frieda-defying-the-nazis-review-oh-what-an-astounding-story-this-is", "date_published": "2023-03-02 22:30:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Advantage Barcelona in Copa del Rey after own goal by Real Madrid\u2019s Milit\u00e3o", "description": "<ul><li>Semi-final 1st leg: Real Madrid 0-1 Barcelona</li><li>Defender turns into his own net to give visitors slender lead</li></ul><p>Barcelona won the first battle against their rivals Real Madrid on Thursday, picking up a 1-0 win at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final.</p><p>In the first of three matches between the Spanish powerhouses in the next few weeks, Barcelona triumphed after an own goal by the Real defender \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o in the first half.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/02/real-madrid-barcelona-copa-del-rey-semi-final-first-leg-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/02/real-madrid-barcelona-copa-del-rey-semi-final-first-leg-match-report", "date_published": "2023-03-02 22:21:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Alex Murdaugh jurors begin deliberations in double murder trial", "description": "<p>Defence says in final arguments South Carolina police \u2018failed miserably\u2019 to consider alternative suspects in death of wife and son</p><p>After nearly six weeks of testimony, jurors in the Alex Murdaugh double murder trial heard the final arguments from opposing legal teams, as presiding judge Clifton Newman prepared to hand them the case for deliberations.</p><p>In the last hours of a trial that has gripped America with its complex blend of deep south violence, power and fraud, defense lawyer Jim Griffin told the court that investigators had \u201cfailed miserably\u201d in their investigation of the deaths of Murdaugh\u2019s wife Maggie and son Paul, and he accused them of \u201cfabricating evidence\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/02/alex-murdaugh-murder-trial-jury-deliberations-south-carolina\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/02/alex-murdaugh-murder-trial-jury-deliberations-south-carolina", "date_published": "2023-03-02 22:09:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Merchant of Venice 1936 review \u2013 Shylock takes on Oswald Mosley\u2019s Blackshirts", "description": "<p><strong>Watford Palace theatre<br /></strong>A striking, slick adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s problematic play sees Tracy-Ann Oberman play a Jewish matriarch up against the fascists of 1930s London </p><p>In Tracy-Ann Oberman and Brigid Larmour\u2019s re-envisioned production, Shakespeare\u2019s merchant is living in 1930s east London amid the rise of Oswald Mosley\u2019s Blackshirts.

The gains are obvious in the first few minutes of the concerto, not only in the clarity and gutsy depth that are combined with the technical brilliance of Faust\u2019s playing, but also in the kaleidoscope of colours that the orchestra creates around her \u2013 whether it\u2019s the chattering flutes or the chuntering bassoons.

But that\u2019s about it; other leading 2024 candidates, such as Florida governor <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong> aren\u2019t showing up, and most of the rest of the speakers are not the prominent GOP congressmen and governors who once graced its stage, but instead well-worn conservative talkers \u2013 think <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong>, <strong>Steve Bannon</strong> and <strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong>.

The electronics intensify, then resolve into something resembling a house pulse, punctuated by voices screaming and whimpering, and more panic-attack breathing.

Genghis Khan could perhaps thank unusually heavy rains in Mongolia for his military success (they increased the amount of pasture for his horses), but his armies also spread the Black Death everywhere they rampaged. Agriculture in turn has transformed the planet, Frankopan shows, as well as the development of global trade in spices, cotton and enslaved people, and even the transplantation of tomatoes and potatoes from the Americas to Europe.
