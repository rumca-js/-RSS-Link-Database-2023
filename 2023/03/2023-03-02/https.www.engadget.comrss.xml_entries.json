It also uses Cherry MX Red switches, double-shot PBT keycaps, anti-ghosting and N-key rollover. The keyboard has an integrated cable routing on its underside that lets you position it toward the left, right or center, depending on your setup (and the USB cable is detachable). It supports per-key RGB lighting in 16.8 million colors. It\u2019s available today for $160.</p><p>Alienware also announced the Dual-Mode Wireless Gaming Headset, which connects to your PC with a bundled USB-C dongle or 3.5mm audio cable. It has a 45mm-wide headband with a sliding adjustment and memory foam ear cups covered in fabric. Alienware says it\u2019s plenty roomy inside with \u201ccomfortable contact points with your head.\u201d It includes a retractable boom mic and can cancel out background noise for your audience while you\u2019re speaking (not to be confused with active noise cancelation, which it doesn\u2019t have). In addition, the headset uses 40mm drivers and supports Dolby Atmos. Finally, the company says its battery will last up to 30 hours. The headset is available today, costing $160.</p><figure><img alt=\"Product photo of the Alienware Wired Gaming Headset, taken from the left-front, with glowing blue alien logo on the left side.

Although you\u2019ll need to plug it in through USB or a 3.5mm cable, it otherwise has near feature parity with the wireless model. It also supports Dolby Atmos and has RGB lighting; it uses a 45mm sliding headband, memory foam ear cups covered in fabric and a retractable boom mic with AI-powered voice isolation. The headset costs $100 and launches on April 14th in North America and China and May 19th in other parts of the world.</p><p>The last of the newly announced gear is the Alienware Wireless Gaming Mouse. It has a sculpted right-handed design with a dedicated thumb channel \u201cto help provide comfortable control during long gaming sessions.\u201d It has independent L / R keyplates and optical switches. Alienware says the mouse\u2019s sensor supports up to 26,000 dots per inch while tracking quick movements with 650 inches per second and 50G max acceleration. Additionally, it has tactile grip zones. Alienware promises up to 140 hours of battery life, and the company says five minutes of charging (while on a low battery) will yield 10 hours of uptime. The mouse (which already launched in China last week) is available today in North America and on March 31st elsewhere; it will cost $100.</p><figure><img alt=\"CES showroom photo of the Alienware m18 laptop.

At least, that's what many people will assume when they tune into the first episode of <em>The Mandalorian's</em> third season. When last we left our lone bounty hunter and cub, Grogu was heading off to Jedi training with a creepy de-aged Luke Skywalker. Mando took off his helmet and braced for solitude. We all shed a tear. (How did a show manage to make us care so much for a monosyllabic man in armor and a green puppet? Bless you, executive producers Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni.)</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But at the start of this season, Mando (AKA Din Djarin) and Grogu are paired up once again, saving people from gigantic monsters, fighting space pirates and generally being adorable. To a casual viewer, it's like that dramatic season two finale was Jedi mind-tricked away. It turns out if you wanted to get the full story \u2013 which also explains why Din is flying a <em>Phantom Menace</em>-era ship, or why Grogu is becoming a more adept force user \u2014 you had to watch the final few episodes of <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>.</p><figure><img alt=\"Din Djarin holding Grogu in The Mandalorian Season 3\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/b9f18200-b92e-11ed-bebf-27db29204110\" style=\"height: 504; width: 960;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Lucasfilm</div></figure><p></p><p>If I wasn't already a hopeless Star Wars fan, I'd be pretty confused and annoyed. How are normal people supposed to know that <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> basically served as a stop-gap between <em>Mandalorian</em> seasons? Disney didn't promote the connection between the shows much, so if you weren't reading geeky news sites, or talking to nerdy friends, it was easy to miss.</p><p>The first few episodes of <em>Boba Fett</em> made it seem like a far less ambitious series \u2013 did we really need to learn the specifics of how he survived the Sarlacc pit? And who cares about his future as Jabba the Hutt replacement? I've talked to several <em>Star Wars</em> fans who tapped out early on, only to catch up once they heard Mando and Grogu popped up. (Honestly, it almost seemed like Favreau and crew got tired of the Boba Fett story \u2013 so did we.)</p><p>It's not like I'm against the idea of narratives shifting between different shows and films. Everything Marvel's done since <em>Iron Man</em> has practically trained us to consume pop culture this way, with the rise of the Avengers initiative to the ultimate smackdown with Thanos in <em>Endgame</em>. The geeky side of me is overjoyed when I discover connections between films I love. (You should have seen me in the theater at the end of M. Night Shyamalan's <em>Split.</em>) But the idea that viewers have to keep tabs on <em>everything</em> is beginning to feel like homework, and it's particularly frustrating when one piece of media is inexplicably crucial to something that comes later.</p><p>It doesn't help that <em>The Mandalorian</em> barely referenced <em>The Book of Boba Fett </em>during its introductory episode. Even a bit of a nudge during the &quot;previously on&quot; opening section would help. Instead, the premiere episode just wants to get us back to normal, with Mando on a video game-like quest and Grogu having fun along the way. It's a shame, since the end of season 2 made it seem like <em>The Mandalorian</em> would actually change things up moving forward.</p><section><img alt=\"Grogu in The Mandalorian Season 3\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/b9f15af0-b92e-11ed-bff7-80dd1dad459b\" /></section><p>Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/the-mandalorian-jon-favreau-talks-boba-fett-1235339032/\"><em><ins>The Hollywood Reporter</ins></em></a>, creator and executive producer Favreau said he appreciated being able to check in on characters between shows.&nbsp; \u201cI knew that I didn\u2019t want to dedicate a lot of screen time within <em>The Mandalorian</em> to a period of time where there wasn\u2019t a lot of character progression,&quot; he said. &quot;Both [Din and Grogu] were kind of stuck, as far as character progression goes, until they were reunited. So, my feeling was that it would allow me to do both of those things and freed me up now two years later to have a whole new context for these two characters to have a relationship and move forward.\u201d</p><p>But what Favreau saw as a problem, I see as an opportunity. In <em>Book of Boba Fett</em>, Din and Grogu's time apart is handled briskly. Neither can fully let each other go. That stalls Grogu's Jedi training, as that's mostly focused on detaching yourself from the world and emotional connections. (Did that really work so well for Anakin Skywalker? <em>Come on</em>, Luke.) Din, meanwhile, acts like an empty nester who's lost his life's purpose. This is all good material for drama, but Favreau cuts through it as quickly as possible on a spinoff show. What a waste.</p><p>I may be particularly annoyed by <em>The Mandalorian's</em> disjointed narrative after seeing how Marvel handled its latest big bad, Kang the Conqueror, in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-review-bad-vfx-130036373.html\"><em><ins>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</ins></em></a>. In that film, Kang is introduced as a castaway, someone banished to the Quantum Realm because of his penchant for, well, conquering. But we never got a sense of his true motivation, his powers or what he's actually trying to accomplish.Perhaps that's because the folks behind <em>Quantumania</em> assumed you saw Kang's brief introduction at the end of the <em>Loki </em>streaming series, where he's presented as more of a trickster and vague threat.</p><figure><img alt=\"Din Djarin holding Grogu in The Mandalorian Season 3\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/b9f15af1-b92e-11ed-bfb3-388b2a11f99f\" style=\"height: 418; width: 1000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Lucasfilm</div></figure><p>If you didn't watch <em>Loki</em> and were confused by <em>Quantumania</em>, it's almost like Marvel is saying that's your own fault. To me, that's simply irresponsible storytelling.</p><p>Coming off of <em>Andor</em>, Tony Gilroy\u2019s self-contained and trenchant exploration of the <em>Star Wars </em>universe, the simplistic and confusing nature of <em>The Mandalorian</em> feels like a letdown. The show was always a pulpy and almost video game-like romp. But after the end of season two, there was potential for something much greater. Instead, Favreau took the easy way out to deliver more of the same.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/dont-make-me-watch-boba-fett-to-understand-the-mandalorian-season-three-203004802.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/dont-make-me-watch-boba-fett-to-understand-the-mandalorian-season-three-203004802.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-02 20:30:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Ford will restart F-150 Lightning production on March 13th", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/ford/\"><ins>Ford</ins></a> says it\u2019s aiming to restart production of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/f-150%20lightning/\"><ins>F-150 Lightning</ins></a> on March 13th, several weeks after it put the EV on hold.

As part of a proposed order, BetterHelp has agreed to pay $7.8 million to consumers to settle charges that it shared sensitive data for advertising purposes after promising to keep the information private.</p><p>This marks the first time the agency has reached an agreement with a company to return money to consumers after their health data was allegedly compromised. The order will be subject to public comment for 30 days before the agency decides whether to finalize it.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>If the order comes into effect, it will ban BetterHelp from sharing data from users (including those who accessed the company's website or app without signing up for its services) with select third parties for ad targeting. The FTC alleges that BetterHelp shared users' email addresses, IPs and health questionnaire responses with Facebook, Snapchat, Criteo and Pinterest. The agency said this allowed Facebook, for instance, to target similar users with BetterHelp ads, which helped to drive tens of thousands of paid users and millions of dollars in revenue to the counseling company.</p><p>The FTC claims BetterHelp didn't receive explicit consent from users before sharing their health data, which it pledged to keep private except for limited uses, such as counseling purposes. In its complaint (<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2023169-betterhelp-complaint_.pdf\"><ins>PDF</ins></a>), the agency also accused BetterHelp of not limiting the scope of how third-party companies could use the health data it shared with them.</p><p>&quot;When a person struggling with mental health issues reaches out for help, they do so in a moment of vulnerability and with an expectation that professional counseling services will protect their privacy,\u201d FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection director Samuel Levine said in a statement. &quot;Instead, BetterHelp betrayed consumers\u2019 most personal health information for profit. Let this proposed order be a stout reminder that the FTC will prioritize defending Americans\u2019 sensitive data from illegal exploitation.&quot;</p><p>The proposed order, which FTC commissioners approved unanimously, will require BetterHelp to, among other things, obtain explicit consent from users before sharing their data with some third parties for any reason. The company will need to establish privacy protocols to protect user data and delete personal and health information after a certain period of time. Moreover, BetterHelp will have to instruct the companies it allegedly shared user health and personal data with to wipe such information from their servers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ftc-moves-to-ban-betterhelp-from-sharing-mental-health-data-for-ad-targeting-184605314.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ftc-moves-to-ban-betterhelp-from-sharing-mental-health-data-for-ad-targeting-184605314.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-02 18:46:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Movies Anywhere will soon shut down its Screen Pass content-sharing feature", "description": "<p>Movies Anywhere announced Wednesday that it\u2019s soon shutting down <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-17-movies-anywhere-screen-pass-sharing-beta.html\">Screen Pass</a>, its movie-sharing feature launched during COVID-19 lockdowns.

The company says you can use it indoors or outside thanks to a powder-coated carbon steel exterior and \"advanced\" insulation that retain heat and withstand the weather. A front-mounted control panel offers temperature, time and balance controls to help you dial-in your cooks. That balance dial allows you to adjust the Volt 12 for different styles, according to Ooni. What's more, an optional boost function returns the baking stone to ideal temp between pies so you're not waiting to launch the next one.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Interior lighting for the 13-inch surface and an insulated glass door let you keep an eye on things. The company explains that the oven can get hot enough for Neapolitan-style pizza in 90 seconds and is capable of hitting 850 degrees Fahrenheit in 20 minutes. Compare that to the multi-fuel Karu 16 which takes 15 minutes to hit 950 degrees. Ooni says the Volt 12 will turn off after 45 minutes if it detects that nothing is being cooked. The company also touts built-in handles for portability, but the oven does weigh nearly 40 pounds, so it's not so easily tossed in the back of the car on a whim.

A more compact version of the Karu 16, this 12-inch model also offers the ability to use wood or gas to bake pizzas (gas burner sold separately). Design wise, it looks a lot like its predecessor, with the key difference being an analog thermometer on the 12G replacing the digital temperature gauge on the 16. The new 12G also keeps the wide-leg design from the Karu 16 with a locking rear leg for extra stability.&nbsp;</p><p>Ooni says the Karu 12G stays hotter for longer versus the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0de15002-ec35-49d8-b24c-3d060213cd2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ooni+Pizza+Ovens&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZGUxNTAwMi1lYzM1LTQ5ZDgtYjI0Yy0zZDA2MDIxM2NkMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9vb25pLmNvbS9wYWdlcy9leHBsb3JlLWthcnUtMTIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg4MTQ5NWJhLTc1NGMtNGIxMy04MjYxLTk2ZTI4YTAxNDg2MSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQR9bzZ1aX2cRbWvFA_F-jd1DimtI3hcPAP3N1S2BnTe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fooni.com%2Fpages%2Fexplore-karu-12\">Karu 12</a> thanks to better heat retention and insulation. There's also a hinged door that helps keep the heat inside, and it's built with a glass panel for baking views.

Ooni says this model can hit 850 degrees 29-percent faster than its previous models and it uses 46-percent less gas. The Karu 12G will be available for $429, which is more expensive than the $300 Karu 12, but a little more than half the cost of the $799 Karu 16.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/oonis-volt-12-is-the-companys-first-indoor-pizza-oven-173011466.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/oonis-volt-12-is-the-companys-first-indoor-pizza-oven-173011466.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-02 17:30:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Satechi and Plugable accessories are up to 42 percent off right now", "description": "<p>If you've been looking to pick up a new docking station for your computer or a multi-device charger for your mobile gear, a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAa1HSUeyyEwyvRFmX1gftv5W0gOaKmoBNULnVLXls9n0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdeal%2F6d97f918%3FshowVariations%3Dtrue%26moreDeals%3Da55c54e3%252Cf92acd35%252Cdd54b2ff%252C184e8b61%252C79c04bbb%26pf_rd_r%3DK1ME61RMNWJV8WBYPQYV%26pf_rd_t%3DEvents%26pf_rd_i%3Ddeals%26pf_rd_p%3D4706bc05-efa5-47e6-bb05-64c1d0bef7c9%26pf_rd_s%3Dslot-15%26ref%3Ddlx_deals_gd_dcl_img_0_6d97f918_dt_sl15_c9\">new Amazon sale</a> has brought a few noteworthy accessories from Satechi and Plugable down to the lowest prices we've seen.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Among the highlights, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TYXRlY2hpLU11bHRpLURldmljZS1DaGFyZ2luZy1TdGF0aW9uLVdpcmVsZXNzL2RwL0IwOFNIUlFESjE_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbXktMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUzM2M4Mzg4LWRmOTktNDY4Yi1hYzczLWQ0YmMwNWM2ZDIwZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAX2RXqp2wBkRM08EGAl_983oJEwfI-xMtyF6Nj80wIr4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSatechi-Multi-Device-Charging-Station-Wireless%2Fdp%2FB08SHRQDJ1\">Satechi's Dock 5 Charging Station</a> is down to $48, which is a $12 discount and matches the device's all-time low.

The Biden administration has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/\">issued</a> a National Cybersecurity Strategy meant to &quot;rebalance&quot; responsibilities toward the larger companies and organizations best-equipped to handle threats. The initiative will most notably expand the use of minimum security standards for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/us-warning-state-backed-malware-critical-infrastructure-155038012.html\">critical infrastructure</a>, and establish a common set of regulations to make it easier to comply with that baseline.&nbsp;</p><p>Accordingly, the administration also wants improved public-private alliances that can more effectively defend infrastructure. The federal government would also modernize its networks and response policies to safeguard against threats.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Companies may also be on the hook for sloppy behavior. The strategy would shift some liability for software and services to developers that ignore recommended cybersecurity practices or ship products with known vulnerabilities. The White House hopes to work with Congress and companies on legislation that bars total liability and sets tougher standards for &quot;specific high-risk scenarios.&quot; A safe harbor provision would protect companies that make a sincere effort to develop secure products.</p><p>The plan would also invest more in cybersecurity research and workforces. The administration hopes to cut back on &quot;systemic&quot; vulnerabilities at the internet's core, and to adapt to emerging technologies such as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-30-nsa-quantum-resistant-encryption.html\">postquantum encryption</a> (that is, protection against quantum-based hacks) and digital IDs. Some policies will be largely unchanged.

As <em>Cyberscoop</em><a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/biden-national-cybersecurity-strategy-2023/\">points out</a>, though, there's no certainty the strategy will work as promised. The outline largely delegates responsibilities to individual agencies, Congress and in some cases state regulators. The result may not be as harmonious as hoped. It's also unclear if developers will welcome laws that make them liable for security holes. Still, the approach sets expectations for how federal officials will tackle digital threats going forward.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bidens-cybersecurity-plan-expands-requirements-for-critical-infrastructure-145019627.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/bidens-cybersecurity-plan-expands-requirements-for-critical-infrastructure-145019627.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-02 14:50:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: The Moon needs its own time zone", "description": "<p>Space agencies and private companies around the world have been scheduling their own lunar missions over the next few years, and that could be quite complicated to coordinate when they all use different time zones.

The invite-only app joins the list of Twitter substitutes, including Mastodon, as Twitter clings on through staff attrition and precarious stability. Bluesky began in 2019 as a Twitter-funded side project. Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter and was still CEO when the initiative started, saw it as a more open alternative to an increasingly centralized Twitter. Then, Bluesky spun off as its own company in 2021.</p><p>You\u2019ll have to enter your email address to join the waitlist. The Bluesky app reportedly borrows heavily from Twitter. However, it includes minor differences like \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d in place of \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d along with a simplified process of creating a post (which can also include photos) by selecting a plus button. So\u2026 yeah.

Apparently, the employees chose to organize out of fear that they could be abruptly laid off, especially since some of them are in Japan on work visas.&nbsp;</p><p>Their concerns stemmed from the tech giant's announcement back in January that it's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-parent-alphabet-is-laying-off-12000-employees-105523115.html\">cutting 12,000 jobs</a> \u2014 that's six percent of the company's overall workforce \u2014 around the world.

The workers said they joined a labor union in response to that announcement and to news about the fate of the company's employees in other countries.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>For a dismissal to be legal in Japan, a company has to prove that it has reasonable grounds to terminate an employee. However, some companies terminate employees without good reason by claiming to have problems with the worker. The group is hoping that joining a union would protect them from sudden termination. In the US, one of the divisions most affected by the job cuts was the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-lays-off-most-employees-area-120-in-house-incubator-154329887.html\">Area 120 in-house incubator</a>, which works on experimental apps and products.
