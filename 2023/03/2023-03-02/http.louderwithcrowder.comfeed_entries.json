By including babies. </p><p>Let's get through this together, shall we?</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cFor reference, this is one of the screen recordings I was sent from this organisation called Caba Baba Rave, that targets BABIES. \\n\\nAbsolutely abhorrent.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Dominique Samuels (@Dominique Samuels)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dominiquetaegon/status/1630948003962912768\">1677683187</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11810305/Fury-Drag-act-BABIES-Semi-naked-man-thigh-high-boots-performs-bondage-routine.html?ito=social-twitter_mailonline\" target=\"_blank\">show</a>, called CabaBabaRave, is a self-described \"little slice of afternoon delight\" that combines cabaret with \"captivating baby sensory moments\" before \"ending in a rave\". The singer in the video is apparently named \"Benloader Circus\". As you can see, Mr. Circus is dressed in bondage gear as he performs acrobatics from the ceiling. For babies. </p><p>Also featured in the video is another performer doing a handstand on a chair while wearing stilettos. <em>Only</em> stilettos. And a thong. Again, for babies. </p><p>Whatever happened to Baby Einstein? Wasn't that supposed to help with developing babies' senses? And to my knowledge, there were no naked stiletto men. Which is preferable. </p><p>After this video went viral, there was obviously a lot of backlash, since our society luckily still has a shred of moral decency left. However, the organizers actually defended the event, saying the babies would have no idea what was going on. To which I ask, <em>then w</em><em>hy is it targeted towards babies?</em></p><p>The organizers also claimed it simply provided a 'fun and welcoming space for parents with young babies'. Like a playground, but with <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/explicit-performance-man-texas\" target=\"_blank\">naked men</a>. And trauma. </p><p>As a result, there is now a campaign to get the show permanently canceled. Because yes, there are unfortunately more shows scheduled. A March 11th show is sold out, and there are more events scheduled to take place through the end of May. A pub's ad for the show claims it was created by two mothers who \"were constantly looking to be entertained whilst holding a baby in one hand and a pint in the other\".</p><p>I feel like mothers could enjoy a beer together whilst holding their children <em>without </em>scantily clad men in stilettos doing handstands for their amusement. Just me? </p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brave-bondage-babies", "date_published": "2023-03-02 22:08:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Watch: Russell Brand Drops Massive Big Pharma Redpills on Joe Rogan And It's Absolutely Glorious", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33190618&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/russell-brand-nancy-pelosi\" target=\"_blank\">Russell Brand</a> appeared on Joe Rogan today and took the opportunity to absolutely shred the healthcare establishment and mainstream media over the COVID pandemic. In case you didn't know, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/russell-brand-pelosi-biden-harris\" target=\"_blank\">Brand has mostly joined the based side</a> since the start of the COVID craze. It seems that locking people in their homes for months on end and accusing them of killing grandma often has that effect on people. </p><p>Brand epically ranted about Big Pharma's collusion with \"science\":<em> \"The rhetoric has become hysterical, and the horse medicine was the same. They had the option of saying look, we don't know- there's no evidence as yet if Ivermectin is effective in these spaces because no one's trialing it, there's no money in it, because science is a subset of Big Pharma.\"</em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cOn Joe Rogan, Russell Brand eviscerates the media and the healthcare establishment.  \\n\\n\\u201cNo one is doing experiments into natural immunity because natural immunity is not profitable\" \\n\\nHe mocks them for being offended when people instinctively doubt institutional credibility.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Mythinformed MKE (@Mythinformed MKE)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MythinformedMKE/status/1631384558254825473\">1677787363</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And it is so true. He then moved on to natural immunity:<em> \"No one's doing experiments into natural immunity because natural immunity is not profitable.No one's doing - those experiments are not being underwritten. There's no clinical trials for that. Because no one wants that data for Vitamin D, or for steroids, or for all of the things that came out as ultimately effective.\" </em></p><p>Brand must be a full-blown conspiracy theorist now because he's making perfect sense. Which I've been told is the exact marking of a dangerous conspiracy theorist. And also probably a white supremacist. </p><p>But he wasn't done. Oh no. He concluded by ripping into mainstream media, saying, <em>\"How can you expect to maintain the authority? How can you expect to sit behind those logos at CNN and MSNBC and claim that kind of piety and certainty?\"</em></p><p>Brand mentioned how outraged these networks were at the slightest mention these drugs may be effective in treating COVID. Remember back when <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-cnn-horse-response\" target=\"_blank\">CNN smeared Joe Rogan </a>as taking \"horse dewormer\" to treat his Ivermectin?

That goes for movies, and it also goes for a lot of television shows as well with some exceptions. One is <em>Yellowstone</em>. Another is <em>Titans</em>, and that goes back to a comic franchise.</p><blockquote>The evolution of the superhero has meant the death of the movie star.
