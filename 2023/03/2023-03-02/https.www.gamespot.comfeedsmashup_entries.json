That hopefully means you recently got your hands on a good Wendigo, but if not, fret not: There's a god roll grenade launcher you can potentially get your hands on right now through a bit of trickery. Here's how it works.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Among the new Season of Defiance weapons you can obtain is a heavy grenade launcher called Regnant. It's an adaptive-frame type, just like Wendigo, and it can roll with some excellent perks. You might luck out and get a great one, or you'll eventually be able to unlock its pattern and craft one. But through an apparent glitch shared by YouTube channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PASSaQ3FwI0\">Above</a>, once you've obtained one Regnant, you have another avenue to securing that god roll.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Assuming you already have gotten Regnant, head into your Collections and find it in the grenade launcher section. Typically, you can't pull weapons with randomized perks from here, but Regnant is an exception. And although the version you see lists Rangefinder and Pugilist as its perks, the version of the gun you receive will actually have randomized perks. Therefore, provided you can afford the cost--1,000 Glimmer, 10 Legendary Shards, and seven Enhancement Cores--you can pull copies of the gun indefinitely until you get what you want.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-easily-get-a-god-roll-grenade-launcher-in-destiny-2-lightfall-right-now/1100-6512003/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-easily-get-a-god-roll-grenade-launcher-in-destiny-2-lightfall-right-now/1100-6512003/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-02 20:48:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "LOTR: Return Of The King Is Coming Back To Theaters For 20th Anniversary", "description": "<p>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is seemingly headed back to theaters in April to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary.

A few months after its Itch.io release, he decided to upload the game onto Steam, where it was met with a lot more excitement. Galante says some of this success comes from the three distinct sources that inspired the game. Its top-down bullet-hell gameplay, for example, was first kindled by a mobile game called Magic Survival, while its impressive visual effects came from the little-known platformer Lapis X Labyrinth. As for the Castlevania-esque set dressing, Galante says he simply had a royalty-free asset pack with that theme lying around, and it seemed fitting.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-vampire-survivors-went-from-hobby-project-to-game-of-the-year/1100-6511980/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-vampire-survivors-went-from-hobby-project-to-game-of-the-year/1100-6511980/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-02 18:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Vampire Survivors 2 Is Unlikely, Would Have To Offer Something \"Radically New\"", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Sleeper hit Vampire Survivors continues to be a very popular game on Steam, with thousands of simultaneous players at any given time.

You'll want to be sure you can complete this phase without needing to use your Dragon Cure Pots to heal--you'll very likely need them later. Lu Bu will begin the fight on horseback, and his moveset will be pretty limited. He'll frequently charge at you with a swipe that is easy to dodge or deflect, and then he'll post up and shoot some arrows at you, which you should usually just block (more on that below). He also has two critical strikes--a high leap attack and a charge--both of which are pretty easy to time deflects for so that you can get massive spirit damage on him.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-lu-bu-boss-guide/1100-6511688/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-lu-bu-boss-guide/1100-6511688/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-02 11:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty - Where To Find The House Keys", "description": "<p>After completing the first handful of missions in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty/\">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>, you'll soon find yourself in a serene Hidden Village.

With so much content to see throughout your first run through the campaign, you might think that's all that is available to you--but there's plenty more to delve into after besting the final boss. As with Team Ninja's other games, there is a New Game Plus mode to experience once you've rolled the credits, and we'll tell you what to expect below.</p><h2>How New Game Plus works in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</h2><p>Once you beat the game by defeating the final boss, you unlock the ability to replay the game on the harder <strong>Rising Dragon difficulty</strong>. Parts 1-3 are available from the get-go on this new difficulty, meaning you can take on missions out of their original order if you find yourself stuck on something or simply don't want to play a particular level. As you reach certain completion milestones, you gain access to more and more late-game missions that you can once again finish in whatever order you prefer.</p><p>Enemies will hit much harder on this new difficulty, so maxing out your 4-star gear and having a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-how-to-respec/1100-6511683/\">solid build</a> will be of vital importance if you want to tackle the whole campaign again. Otherwise, not much changes besides the <strong>addition of 5-star gear</strong>, which can be periodically found in chests or dropped by enemies. Coming by this highest tier of gear won't be common, so you may need to grind certain missions or bosses for chances at scoring specific pieces that would help your build.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-new-game-plus-explained-5-star-gear-and-other-changes/1100-6511878/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-new-game-plus-explained-5-star-gear-and-other-changes/1100-6511878/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-02 11:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Review - Souls-Like Of The Three Kingdoms", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The first boss fight in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is right up there with the toughest first bosses in video game history. This opening battle pits you against Zhang Liang of the Yellow Turbans, as you clash in a kinetic two-phase fight to the death. It's an intense skill check that challenges your prowess of Wo Long's mechanics almost immediately. In many ways, it feels like a rite of passage for the rest of the game and a bold statement of intent from developer Team Ninja. I initially loved how it forced me to adapt to the demands of the game's particular brand of Souls-like combat, yet the further I progressed, the more this feeling dissipated as I realized that this introductory struggle was little more than an unbalanced outlier, providing a much sterner test than the bosses following it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For many, this sudden difficulty spike will be a barrier to entry, halting progress a mere 10 minutes into the game. It's a shame Wo Long begins with such a sturdy roadblock, not least because this initial undertaking isn't indicative of the rest of the game moving forward. In fact, outside of this first boss, Team Ninja has crafted one of the more approachable Souls-likes in what is a traditionally challenging genre.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I didn't encounter another boss fight on par with Zhang Liang's difficulty until roughly 15 hours into Wo Long's campaign. Most of the bosses in between were a relative cakewalk, to the point where I was able to cut down each one on my first attempt--usually in under a minute. I still had fun dispatching every single one, but the ease with which I was able to do so makes them lose some of their luster and reinforces the notion that the first boss is at odds with the rest of the game. The battle with Zhang Liang sets up expectations that never come to fruition, particularly when other fights allow you to summon help from either AI or human teammates.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-souls-like-of-the-three-kingdoms/1900-6418040/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-souls-like-of-the-three-kingdoms/1900-6418040/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-02 11:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Tips And Tricks", "description": "<p>Whether you're a newbie or a genre veteran, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty/\">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> is likely to test your mettle with its risk/reward exploration and punishing boss battles. There's a lot to keep up with in Team Ninja's newest Soulslike entry, and it can seem a little overwhelming when you first dive in--especially since many of the game's mechanics put unique spins on those of similar titles. But we've compiled a few handy tips here that we hope will give you some insight into how to approach Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty's opening hours.</p><h2>Aggression is rewarded</h2><p>Wo Long's spirit system greatly rewards your aggression--at least when that aggression is doled out appropriately. Your standard attacks and well-timed deflects raise your spirit (stamina), which you can then spend on Martial Arts or heavy attacks for significant damage to your enemy's HP and spirit. If you spend too much time blocking or dodging and not enough time dishing out those standard attacks, you'll quickly find that your own spirit gets broken, leaving you stunned and vulnerable as a result. In short, make sure you're maintaining your spirit by staying on top of foes with attacks and deflecting their swings when possible.</p><figure style=\"width: 1920px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4102184-1%281%29.jpg\"><img alt=\"Aggression is encouraged in Wo Long.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4102184-1%281%29.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Aggression is encouraged in Wo Long.</figcaption></figure><h2>There aren't many barriers to experimentation early on</h2><p>Wo Long is one of the genre's least punishing games in terms of experimentation, especially in the opening hours. After completing the first handful of missions in the game, you gain access to an NPC in the village hub that allows you to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-how-to-respec/1100-6511683/\">respec your character's stats</a> at no cost anytime you'd like. Meanwhile, you won't necessarily need to invest heavily in weapon and armor upgrades until much later in the game.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-tips-and-tricks/1100-6511641/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-tips-and-tricks/1100-6511641/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-02 11:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Halo Infinite Team Deep Dives On Season 3's New Maps", "description": "<p>Almost a week ahead of Halo Infinite Season 3's launch, developer 343 Industries has released new information about the upcoming updates maps and modes.</p><p>As previously shown in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-season-3-echoes-within-is-its-biggest-update-yet/1100-6511817/\">Season 3's launch trailer</a>, the season will introduce three new maps to Halo: Infinite. The first, Oasis, is a Big Team Battle map, set on red rocks in the process of terraforming to a verdant green. Basically everywhere on this map is vehicle accessible, meaning that you can take a warthog into the tunnels and buildings that populate the landscape. This offers both chaotic and strategic possibilities, especially for CTF.</p><p>The second is an arena map called Cliffhanger. This map is a snowy mountaintop, which hides an ONI research facility. Cliffhanger was designed with zone-control modes in mind. It's asymmetric and the design team wanted to make each area feel unique and tactically different, depending on the mode you are playing the map in.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-team-deep-dives-on-season-3s-new-maps/1100-6511964/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-team-deep-dives-on-season-3s-new-maps/1100-6511964/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-02 05:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Marvel Snap Decks - Best MODOK Decks", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-snap/\">Marvel Snap</a>\u2019s newest season pass, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-into-the-quantum-realm-season-start-time-new-cards-and-ant-man-details/1100-6511225/\">Into the Quantum Realm</a>, introduces us to a new card: MODOK. MODOK is a 5-Cost card with 8-Power and has a game-changing On Reveal effect that discards your entire hand. MODOK\u2019s effect may seem entirely unfavorable or even game-losing, but Discard decks are incredibly terrifying, surprising, and can turn the tables in a match very swiftly or at the last possible moment to attain that sweet victory. In our best <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-decks-best-pool-2-decks/1100-6509074/\">Pool 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-decks-best-pool-3-decks/1100-6510135/\">Pool 3</a> decks, we did cover two different Discard decks: Discardian Discord and Discardian Dissonance respectively. MODOK is able to improve Discard decks even more so through its On Reveal effect.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This guide will cover a few of the best MODOK-based decks, how to improve your already efficient Discard-centric decks, and even if you are not the sort of cardfighter to purchase Marvel Snap\u2019s season passes, these decks will still be viable in creating in the future when you do eventually obtain MODOK due to the game\u2019s card rollout system.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Discarding Detriment</strong></h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Discarding Detriment is similar to Discardian Dissonance from Pool 3 but swaps out Gambit for MODOK. Colleen will always discard the lowest-cost card, so you want to be discarding Swarm. Swarm, when discarded, creates an extra copy, which also is a 0-Cost card. By playing these 0-Cost Swarm cards on top of Lockjaw\u2019s location, you will be able to swap out for a much stronger card in your deck such as Hell Cow, America Chavez, or even Sword Master.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-decks-best-modok-decks/1100-6511963/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-decks-best-modok-decks/1100-6511963/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-02 00:04:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
