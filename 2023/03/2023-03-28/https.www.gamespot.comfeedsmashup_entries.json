Each season, clans can attempt to claim and hold up to two towers (though each clan can only control one tower the first week of the season). These towers grant powerful rewards and bonuses to clan members in control of them, but to conquer a tower, clan members must first duke it out against the forces of hell in a unique PvE battle. Clans will race to conquer as many Cursed Shards from defeated enemies as possible in order to claim victory.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But conquering a tower the first time around is just the first step. Demons will periodically rise up, and clan members will need to defend their tower or else risk losing it. There is, however, a way to prevent demonic incursions. Clan leaders have the option of powering up claimed towers, which increases the rewards that tower provides. The catch is that doing so essentially turns the game mode from PvE to PvP, after which other clans can challenge those in control of towers to direct PvP battles.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-third-major-update-brings-clan-based-tower-defense-and-cursed-items/1100-6512767/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-third-major-update-brings-clan-based-tower-defense-and-cursed-items/1100-6512767/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-28 18:32:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Report Alleges Crunch Culture At Ubisoft Paris, Including 13-Hour Days", "description": "<p>Ubisoft Paris, the developer of the Just Dance series has reportedly suffered from crunch culture, a new report states.

But unlike the two Collection Events that preceded it, this reward track does not contain any Thematic Packs to unlock premium Sun Squad cosmetics.

Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves spent almost a decade in pre-production as the film went through various phases in development since 2013. Directed and written by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, mostly known as the co-writers for Spider-Man: Homecoming, along with up-and-comer Michael Gilio, the script uses elements from the previous attempt by director Chris McKay and Gilio. The film stars Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Justice Smith, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, Hugh Grant, and Sophia Lillis.

Make sure you keep GameSpot open on your browser as we approach Wrestlemania, as we will have live coverage of the event from the press box at both nights.</p><p>Both nights of the show of shows will be taking place at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. Interestingly, the stadium was originally set to be the home of WrestleMania 37 before the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to be relocated to WWE's Performance Center, which remains the only Wrestlemania to not feature a live audience. Former WWE Champion and Grand Slam winner The Miz will serve as the official host for the event. WrestleMania 39 will be the sixth to be held in the greater Los Angeles area (after 2, VII, XII, 2000, and 21). It'll be the seventh in California overall (including 31, which was held in the San Francisco Bay Area).</p><p>Along with Rhodes and Reigns, another big match is Charlotte Flair defending her Smackdown Women's Championship against 2023 Women's Royal Rumble winner Rhea Ripley. This is a rematch of sorts from 2020 when Charlotte won the Women's Royal Rumble for the right to take on Rhea for her NXT Championship, but since then, Ripley has come into her own as a viable opponent.

So far, three of the archetypes have been revealed: the DPS-focused Gunslinger, the tank-like Challenger, and the supportive Handler. At GDC 2023, I got the chance to play as all three and walked away enjoying the Handler the most--the archetype's dog companion is just wonderful to have, especially when you're playing solo and want an ally on hand.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Much like the first game, Remnant II sees you fight your way through a world twisted by demonic god-like monsters in an effort to prevent humanity from being completely killed off. You primarily rely on firearms throughout your journey, but have access to melee weapons in a pinch as well. Combat is frenetic--your precision is oftentimes rewarded with higher damage numbers but ammo is plentiful and enemies regularly outnumber you, so shooting with abandon is a viable strategy. On occasion, an enemy may have specific weak points--in the demo I played, the boss at the end of the level had distinct points on its massive body that you had to shoot in order to deal damage--but oftentimes it seems the best strategy is to just pump bullets into an enemy before it reaches you for a melee attack. It's not especially challenging, but it seems like it would be good fun in a group.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You can absolutely play through Remnant II entirely solo, but the new archetype system seems to lend itself to a more cooperative experience, encouraging folks to play through the game in co-op. Every archetype feels dangerous in a firefight but each brings a different skill set to combat to inform how they fight, with the Challenger and Handler definitely feeling like they'd better reach their full potential by fighting within a squad that includes a glass cannon class like the Gunslinger.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-makes-a-good-case-for-having-a-dog-with-you-in-a-world-of-monsters/1100-6512744/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-makes-a-good-case-for-having-a-dog-with-you-in-a-world-of-monsters/1100-6512744/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-28 16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "DC's New Card Game Looks More Magic Than Marvel Snap", "description": "<p>DC vs. Marvel is a rivalry almost as old as comic books, and now the two leading capes and cowls companies have another arena where they'll be in direct competition: digital CCGs.

Kingdom. The highly anticipated sequel launches on May 12, and it will be the first Nintendo-published Switch game to retail for $70. In addition to the standard edition of the game, there are several other Tears of the Kingdom products that you can <em>attempt </em>to preorder, including the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-oled-revealed/1100-6512749/\">newly announced special-edition Zelda Switch OLED console</a>. The $360 console is joined by a special-edition Pro Controller and carrying case. </p><p>The trio of new products aren't available to preorder just yet, but they are expected to go live shortly. If the preorder window goes anything like the <a href=\"https://howl.me/ci54SCWEgJd?u1=subid_value\">$130 Collector's Edition</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.me/ci54Q6C6wog?u1=subid_value\">Link Amiibo</a> (it will), preorders will sell out quickly.</p><p>Back to the game: All major retailers had been taking preorders at the original $60 price point, so if you happened to order a copy before the change, you should be good to go. We haven't heard of any retailers canceling or adjusting the price of preexisting preorders.
