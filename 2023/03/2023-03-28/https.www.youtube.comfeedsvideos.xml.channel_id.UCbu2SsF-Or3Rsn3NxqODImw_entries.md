The fuse ability allows Link to combine nearly any object he can find in the open world together. For example, he can combine a stick and a boulder to create a makeshift hammer, several logs and propellers to build a DIY boat, or attach a mushroom to his shield so that it creates a cloud of smoke when hit.

As a part of the Tears of the Kingdom gameplay demonstration, producer Eiji Aonuma shows off the new fuse and ultrahand mechanics from the game. The fuse ability allows Link to combine nearly any object he can find in the open world together. For example, he can combine a stick and a boulder to create a makeshift hammer, several logs and propellers to build a DIY boat, or attach a mushroom to his shield so that it creates a cloud of smoke when hit. The ultrahand mechanic seems to be an expansion of the magnesis ability from Breath of the Wild, where you can now lift nearly any object in the world remotely, not just metallic ones. Ultrahand was shown off in assisting Link fusing objects together.

As a part of the Tears of the Kingdom gameplay demonstration, producer Eiji Aonuma shows off the new recall and ascend mechanics from the game. Recall allows Link to rewind time on an object, as demonstrated by Link reaching the new sky islands by standing on a boulder that has fallen from one of them and using recall on it. Ascend allows Link to phase through ceilings to end up on top of them. This can be done in any interior with a ceiling, meaning that if you are in a cave, you can now phase through its covering to the surface above without having to spend any stamina to climb to the top.
