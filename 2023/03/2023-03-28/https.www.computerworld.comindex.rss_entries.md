<p>Apple, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3688575/why-is-apple-making-big-improvements-to-web-apps-for-iphone.html">as expected</a>, has rolled out support for Web Push on iOS and iPadOS in iOS 16.4, which arrived this week. Here's a look at what it is and how it might be a welcome addition for users and even for business.</p><h2><strong>What is Web Push for Web Apps?</strong></h2>
<p>Web Push makes it possible for web developers to send push notifications to users. The idea is that websites can easily be added to the iPhone or iPad Home from within the Share menu, after which developers can send those notifications.</p><h2><strong>How do notifications appear in Web Push?</strong></h2>
<p>Notifications are made visible in the same way as for any iOS app. That means when you look at the app icon on the Home screen, you’ll see the number of incoming notifications from that app through the use of a new Badging API.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3691899/what-is-web-push-for-web-apps-on-iphone-and-ipad.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Few companies have experienced the ups and downs of the nearly 50-year-old Microsoft. It helped launch the PC revolution in the 1970s and became a colossus of the tech world in the 1980s and 1990s, essentially setting the tech world’s agenda. Then after a federal anti-trust suit and CEO Steve Ballmer’s poor leadership, the company fell into a tailspin and lost its tech luster during a “lost decade” that began in 2000.</p><p>When Satya Nadella took over as CEO from Ballmer in 2014, Microsoft began a slow, steady ascent, betting on the cloud rather than relying on Windows. But its comeback wasn’t based on beating competitors with new, innovative technologies. Rather, Microsoft gained ground by leveraging already existing technologies including the cloud, Office and Windows. No one looked to it for exciting tech; no one expected it to set tech’s agenda.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3691895/how-microsoft-became-tech-s-top-dog-again.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
