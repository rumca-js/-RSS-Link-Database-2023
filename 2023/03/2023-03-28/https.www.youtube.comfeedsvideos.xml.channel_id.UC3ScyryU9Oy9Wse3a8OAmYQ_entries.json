Tower climbers install and service cell phone antennas, ascending hundreds, sometimes more than a thousand feet. Nearly 100 climbers were killed on radio, TV and cell towers in the decade before the documentary was released \u2014 a rate that at the time was about 10 times the average for construction workers. Reporters at FRONTLINE and ProPublica investigated 50 cell-related deaths in this 2012 documentary.\n\nWhile some cell phone tower climbers said they were under pressure to cut corners, layers of subcontracting made it difficult for safety inspectors to determine fault when a tower worker was killed or injured.\n\n\u201cCell Tower Deaths\u201d was a FRONTLINE production with RAIN Media, Inc., in partnership with ProPublica. The documentary was written and produced by Travis Fox. Martin Smith was senior producer and correspondent. Reporting was by FRONTLINE\u2019s Ryan Knutson and ProPublica\u2019s Liz Day. The series senior producer for FRONTLINE in 2012 was Raney Aronson-Rath. The executive producer of FRONTLINE was David Fanning.\n\nExplore additional reporting on \"Cell Tower Deaths\" on our website:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/cell-tower-deaths/\n\n#Documentary #CellPhones #WorkplaceSafety\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW\u200b\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\u200b\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\u200b\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and airs nationwide on PBS.\n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nAdditional funding is provided by the Abrams Foundation; the John D. and Catherine T.
