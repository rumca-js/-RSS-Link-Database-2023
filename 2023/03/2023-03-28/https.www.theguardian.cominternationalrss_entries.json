"description": "<p>There\u2019s just about enough goofy charm, if not enough humour, in this serviceable attempt to create a new big-screen franchise from the fantasy game</p><p>Even with a surprise resurgence in the popularity of the immersive, exhausting role-playing fantasy game Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2017 saw more players of the game than any other year in its entire existence), betting a reported $150m on a new franchise-starting film is a risky, borderline reckless, move, like betting on a regular goblin against a hobgoblin in a magic sorcery battle (note: I have never played Dungeons &amp; Dragons before). As acceptably engaging as Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves might be, it\u2019s hard to fully understand the thinking behind such a wild gambit, especially given that a splashy <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/01/dungeons-and-dragons-live-action-series-paramount-plus-rawson-marshall-thurber-eone-paramount-pictures-1235215486/\">Paramount+ TV series</a> is also in the works, the success of one film immediately dictating the existence of an entire extended universe.</p><p>While other more mainstreamed franchises have touched upon loosely similar fantasy territory, from Game of Thrones to Lord of the Rings, there\u2019s more of a niche, loaded quality to D&amp;D that could prevent a similar trajectory, an association with hardcore geek culture that might be hard to shake for the average multiplex-frequenter. It\u2019s not as if those behind the film aren\u2019t also acutely aware of this as well, hiring the duo behind Game Night, Horrible Bosses and Spider-man: Homecoming to bring some pop and levity, aiming to give the film a Guardians of the Galaxy-esque irreverence, something the cool kids could enjoy just as much. It\u2019s a passable attempt at such and one which is made all the more passable by context, comparing it with recent Marvel and DC films making it seem that much better but is that enough to warrant such lofty universe-starting investment?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/28/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-passable-playful-adventure\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/28/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-passable-playful-adventure", "date_published": "2023-03-28 16:08:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Florida school pulls anti-racism film Ruby Bridges after parent complaint", "description": "<p>Elementary school in Tampa area withdraws screenings of Disney film that tells story of black student in segregated 1960s</p><p>Disney\u2019s anti-racism film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/06/ruby-bridges-the-six-year-old-who-defied-a-mob-and-desegregated-her-school\">Ruby Bridges</a> is the subject of a complaint brought by a Florida parent who claims the movie is not appropriate for second-graders, because it might teach them that \u201cwhite people hate Black people\u201d.</p><p>The film, which tells the story of a six-year-old girl who integrated New Orleans schools in the 1960s, has been a staple of school curriculums during Black History Month in the state\u2019s Tampa-area county of Pinellas.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/28/ruby-bridges-florida-school-anti-racism-film-parent-complaint\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/28/ruby-bridges-florida-school-anti-racism-film-parent-complaint", "date_published": "2023-03-28 14:51:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Charlotte Edwards: \u2018There\u2019s an edge to me \u2013 I am a winner\u2019", "description": "<p>Fresh from Mumbai Indians\u2019 win in the Women\u2019s IPL final, the head coach speaks about the X-factor player England turned down and her desire to coach internationally</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been the most unbelievable six weeks I have had in cricket,\u201d says Charlotte Edwards, fresh off the plane after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/26/sciver-brunt-stars-as-mumbai-indians-win-inaugural-womens-premier-league\">victory with Mumbai Indians</a> in the Women\u2019s Premier League final on Sunday and about to head straight into a coaching session with Southern Vipers.</p><p>This 48-hour turnaround may sound like a comedown after Nat Sciver-Brunt sealed a seven-wicket win against Delhi Capitals at Mumbai\u2019s Brabourne Stadium, but Edwards is buzzing. \u201cI just love it,\u201d she says, before heading to the Ageas Bowl. \u201cMaybe the players will be happy to see me \u2026 maybe not.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/28/charlotte-edwards-theres-an-edge-to-me-i-am-a-winner-cricket\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/28/charlotte-edwards-theres-an-edge-to-me-i-am-a-winner-cricket", "date_published": "2023-03-28 14:42:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018I\u2019ve never felt this pain\u2019: Andreescu leaves court in wheelchair at Miami Open", "description": "<ul><li>Canadian has suffered brutal run of injuries in recent years</li><li>22-year-old had been in good run of form recently</li></ul><p>2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu left the court in a wheelchair due to a leg injury in the second set of her Miami Open match against Ekaterina Alexandrova on Monday night.</p><p>Andreescu was trailing in the match when she fell to the court as she moved across the baseline, clutching her lower left leg and screaming.
