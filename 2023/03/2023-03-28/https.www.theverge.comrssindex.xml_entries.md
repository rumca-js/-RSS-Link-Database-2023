<p id="Zf7QRh">NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) notes two complaints from Model X owners saying their front safety belts failed to stay connected to the seat belt anchor pretensioner. Both owners reported that the separation occurred while driving their 2022 and 2023 model-year Model X SUVs. The investigators write that “both vehicles were delivered to the owners with insufficiently connected anchor linkages.”</p>
<p id="9OD17p">NHTSA first opened the investigation on March 24th and says up to 50,000 or so Model X vehicles could be affected by the issue....</p>

  <p id="nSpSiE">Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the collapsed FTX cryptocurrency exchange, has been charged with yet another crime: bribery. In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23728842-bankman-fried-bribery-charges">an indictment filed on Tuesday</a>, the Department of Justice claims Bankman-Fried “authorized and directed a bribe of at least $40 million to one or more Chinese government officials.”</p>
<p id="NteLOL">The bribe was an alleged attempt to coerce Chinese officials into unfreezing some of the accounts associated with FTX’s sister company, Alameda, which contained over $1 billion in cryptocurrency. According to the DOJ, all of this occurred in November 2021, at a time when Bankman-Fried wanted access to the funds in order to assist Alameda “in obtaining and retaining business.” The indictment states Bankman-Fried exhausted “numerous...</p>

<p id="9jhq3q">It’s unclear how many people the notification went out to. Twitter is flooded with screenshots of it, with posts often tagging the official Starbucks account asking what’s going on. However, every single one I saw showed an iOS notification, so it’s possible Android users were spared Sean K’s greeting. So far, the company hasn’t responded to any of the reports or put out a statement about what’s going on. We’ve also reached out for comment and will let you know if we hear back.</p>

It’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">the OLED model</a> and is slathered with all kinds of <em>Zelda</em> iconography, covering both the system’s dock and its Joy-Con controllers.

  <p id="MWkfwi">HP has unveiled a new range of Omen gaming monitors, designed for switching between work, gaming, and content creation. Announced today at HP’s Amplify Partner Conference, there are nine new Omen monitors coming “this spring” in a wide range of shapes and sizes with distinct features to suit different needs.</p>
<p id="AezHA1">The $579.99 Omen 27k gaming monitor is HP’s standout product from the new portfolio. It’s especially tempting if you work from home and find yourself having to switch peripherals between your work machine and your personal gaming PC each day. It looks like a reasonably-priced Jack-of-all-trades with specifications that are solid on paper.</p>

<p id="n5Bhnx">The Omen 27k sports a 27-inch 4K (3840 x 2160) display, a 1ms response time, and a 144Hz...</p>

<p id="HDTfd9">HP made a bunch of flashy announcements at its Amplify Partner Conference today, but buried within them is one I actually think could make a difference for a lot of shoppers: the Victus 16 has been refreshed for 2023, and it’s gone a little bit wild.</p>
