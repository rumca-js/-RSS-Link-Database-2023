Krauser, once an honourable soldier to whom the thrill of combat gave life meaning, slipped out of favour with the US military. It was during a covert mission to suppress a T-virus outbreak in South America that Krauser and Kennedy first met. \n\nAs the operation progressed, Krauser grew resentful of Kennedy, believing his greater importance to the mission reflected poorly on his self-worth. Compounding matters was Krauser\u2019s growing obsession with the power of the Veronica virus, culminating in him perceiving the T-virus as beneficial, as an opportunity to become formidable, a chance to be stronger than Leon.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCHOzhCNvFk", "date_published": "2023-03-28 15:30:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor vs Fallen Order - 15 BIGGEST DIFFERENCES", "description": "Over three years after the release of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order comes the long-awaited sequel, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.

Each character you meet also seems to indirectly deliver a piece of information that further fleshes out the situation in The Marrows as well as the overall story. \n\nMysterious shipwrecks, a mayor gone mad, a person trying to get away from everything and start a new life on another island, a son lost to the sea.
