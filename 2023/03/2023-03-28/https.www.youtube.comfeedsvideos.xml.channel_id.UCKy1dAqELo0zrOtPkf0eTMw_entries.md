Check out the trailer for Trolls Band Together, an upcoming DreamWorks Animation movie starring Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake. 

After two films of true friendship and relentless flirting, Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) are now officially, finally, a couple (#broppy)! As they grow closer, Poppy discovers that Branch has a secret past. He was once part of her favorite boyband phenomenon, BroZone, with his four brothers: Floyd (Troye Sivan), John Dory (Eric André), Spruce (Daveed Diggs), and Clay (Kid Cudi). BroZone disbanded when Branch was still a baby, as did the family, and Branch hasn’t seen his brothers since. 

But when Branch’s bro Floyd is kidnapped for his musical talents by a pair of nefarious pop-star villains—Velvet (Amy Schumer) and Veneer (Andrew Rannells)—Branch and Poppy embark on a harrowing and emotional journey to reunite the other brothers and rescue Floyd from a fate even worse than pop-culture obscurity. 

The movie also stars Camila Cabello as Viva, Zosia Mamet as Crimp, RuPaul Charles as Miss Maxine, Zooey Deschanel as Bridget, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Gristle, the Icona Pop duo Aino Jawo and Caroline Hjelt as Satin and Chenille, Anderson .Paak as Prince D, Ron Funches as Cooper, Kunal Nayyar as Guy Diamond, and Kenan Thompson as Tiny Diamond. Trolls Band Together directed by Walt Dohrn. Tim Heitz serves as co-director. It is produced by Gina Shay.

Trolls Band Together opens in theaters on November 17, 2023.

Nintendo just released a new look at the gameplay mechanics of Tears of the Kingdom but also gave us a look at the sequel's version of Hyrule. But how different is the map from Breath of the Wild? We jumped back in to our old saves to find out.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom features new gameplay systems such as Fuse, Ultrahand, and Ascend. New ways to traverse the old map and interact with the materials should breathe new life into TotK, and hopefully will keep it from feeling too much like BotW. This Hyrule comparison isn't exhaustive, but should give a good indication of how certain areas have changed.

Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham reviewed by Samantha Nelson. Narration by Max Scoville.

Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham is a treat for Batman fans, putting a suitably horrific Lovecraftian spin on his allies and enemies that brings out some of the best parts of the Dark Knight while heavily emphasizing the “dark” part. While not all the tweaks to the original comic’s story are for the best, this largely faithful adaptation delivers plenty of unsettling horror, well-done action scenes, and detective-driven twists.

## Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn Reveal In Joker 2 Is Darker Than Anticipated - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

We’ve got a new glimpse at Lady Gaga’s DC character, spotted filming the Joker sequel in New York. And while fans might remember the photo posted by director Todd Phillips on Instagram featuring Joaquin Phoenix's Joker and Gaga as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, we now know what Lady Gaga might look like in #Joker2. Looking at this version of Harley Quinn in #TheJoker2 and given the more grounded and dark tone of the first Joker film, it kinda reminds me of DC Black Label’s Harleen, which explores Harley Quinn’s past before the makeup and mallet, diving deeper into how her abusive past affected her and how The Joker was able to manipulate her. From DC to Marvel news, the Disney Plus Daredevil series is apparently already planned out for a second season. Director James Gunn talks about the runtime for Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, and so much more on today's entertainment news on IGN.
