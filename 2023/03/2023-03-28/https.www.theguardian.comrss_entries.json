So it will come as a shock to many that much of the wealth of the Manchester Guardian\u2019s founder, John Edward Taylor, and that of most of his backers was connected to transatlantic slavery. A two-year-long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/ng-interactive/2023/mar/28/the-scott-trust-legacies-of-enslavement-report\" title=\"\">investigation</a> has shown that Taylor traded in slave-picked US cotton and that one of his funders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/28/in-memoriam-the-enslaved-people-linked-to-the-guardian\" title=\"\">enslaved</a> people.

Like many Georgians, the paper dressed in an air of respectability and saw itself as a mouthpiece for much-needed political reform. This image conceals the economic interests of its founders, which were hiding in plain sight. In April 1821, a month before the first Manchester Guardian was published, Taylor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2017/nov/15/manchester-guardian-prospectus-1821\" title=\"\">said</a> that his newspaper would \u201csupply that information on [cotton manufacture], the deficiency of which is often so obviously apparent\u201d.
