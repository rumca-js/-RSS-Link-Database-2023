So behold this Amazon worker who refused to let anything get in the way of his job. Even a police standoff. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>This was in Cary, North Carolina and the video was filmed by a neighbor on March 18th. As for the actual standoff itself, it had a less-than-funny backstory. The police were in an over-24-hour standoff with an armed man who barricaded himself inside and held an 11-year-old boy hostage. It ended when the man committed suicide, and the boy was treated for a gunshot wound.</p><p>In the video, the Amazon worker just walks right on through the police cars, and keeps going toward the house until an officer stops him and takes the package. The worker took a picture of the scene to prove he delivered the package before returning to his car. I hope Amazon gives him a raise for that photo. <br /></p><p>Amazon told <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/amazon-delivery-police-response-b2308950.html" target="_blank">The Independent</a> in a statement, <em>"We always prioritize the safety of the drivers delivering our packages and we regularly communicate with them that if they don’t feel safe, they shouldn’t deliver the package and instead reach out for immediate support." </em></p><p>But I am a <em>tad</em> worried that this could have something to do with Amazon's rumored horrific treatment of its employees. Such as the allegations that workers have to pee in bottles to make their delivery times. It should be noted that Amazon swiftly denied this allegation, claiming that no one would work for them if it were true. But then <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/25/amazon-drivers-pee-bottles-union/" target="_blank">The Intercept</a> obtained documents showing that public urination was a frequent topic of Amazon meetings. So there's that. </p><p>Such a cutthroat environment might explain why this dude was willing to risk a police standoff to deliver his package on time. But it's still hilarious to watch. And I really hope he gets that raise. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## That Senate bill to "ban" TikTok? Read the terrifying fine print and kiss your civil liberties goodbye

I was fully on board, but I actually hadn't read the proposed bill. Silly little me thought that when Congress said they wanted to ban <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-bowman-hard-democrats" target="_blank">TikTok</a>, they just meant they wanted to ban TikTok. But of course, this is another onion of a bill with little Easter eggs hidden throughout. And these are some pretty scary Easter eggs. </p><p>There are actually two proposed bills, but the one we're talking about is called the "RESTRICT Act." It has support from both parties as well as the White House. And it's basically a Patriot Act for the internet, as Greg Price on Twitter put it. It gives the government the authority to go after anyone they deem a national security threat. Which could mean actual terrorists, sure. Or it could mean the sad white kid in the basement who excels in the art of meme-making. Either way, the government would have access to basically anything they own that connects to the internet. </p><p>The penalties for a violation range from 20 years in jail, $1M in fines, and/or seizing your property. All just because we want the Chinese Communists to stop subverting our youth with half-naked dancing girls. I guess that's too much to ask. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>The bill also allows the White House, through the Commerce Department, to ban social media, gaming, and payment apps. Meaning they can ban video games, video game companies, and might even have the power to go after crypto. </p><p>The bill also refers to the ability to ban transactions. The term "transaction" is defined as a "current, past, or potential future transaction." Basically, anything Uncle Sam wants it to be. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>But wait, <em>there's more! </em>All the hullabaloo around TikTok is because it poses an imminent threat from China, a foreign adversary. But in this bill, a "foreign individual" can also be an American citizen! Yaaaay! </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>And for the cherry on top, any details about each usage of the act is <a href="https://www.outkick.com/the-tiktok-ban-bill-applies-to-a-lot-more-than-just-tiktok-and-its-dangerous/" target="_blank">exempt from FOIA.</a> Just cuz.

<p>Reports say the officers received the first 911 call around 10:13 AM, and by 10:27, the shooter was dead. So that's exactly one hour less than it took the Uvalde Officers last year.

<p>I don't have to explain to you how unbelievably tragic this all is. And the immediate calls for gun control are certainly not helping.

## NWA champion Tyrus has a solution to protect our schools, and it involves our nation's veterans

NWA Heavyweight Champion (and former bodyguard to Snoop Dogg) is a regular on Fox News's <em>Gutfield</em>. He had what I felt was a great solution for protecting our schools...back in 2018. Yes, 2018. It's now 2023 and... <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-reid-nashville" target="_blank">well, you know</a>.</p><p>Everything Tyrus laid out back in 2018 SHOULD be common sense.

<em>"4.3 unemployment for returning veterans in this country. That's 430,000 trained men who have eyes and ears. We need to have them at the schools. TSA needs to be at the schools. One way in. One way out. There's not one person in this building who not be ok with upping theirs taxes $25. I would even take money away from other things. Because we need to get with it. Because now it's guys with guns. Ten years from now it's going to be a guy with a drone."</em><br />
</p><p>As I said, this video is from 2018. We're now only five years away from a guy with a drone.</p><p>
	From a branding standpoint, I wouldn't call it TSA for schools. That implies the Blue Gloves of Freedom grabbing someone's junk on the way to AP Biology. Or getting too handsy when the wiring in your bra sets off metal detectors. "Ma'am, I'm going to need to cup your breasts for America." Hello, lawsuits.
</p><p>
	But according to Google, there are less than 38,000 schools in the United States. How many of them have at least one unemployed veteran living near them? No, we wouldn't have to raise taxes to levels that boggle small minds. How many of these schools have a second or third assistant superintendent making a six-figure salary? Show of hands, who knows what an "assistant superintendent" actually does? Uh-huh. A therapist for overworked hamsters makes more sense.
</p><p>
	Cut all the patronage bullplop in schools. Replace the jobs with people who actually protect our kids. From real dangers. Not signs written in chalk.
</p><p>
	It's at least the start of a good idea. Far better than "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-reid-nashville" target="_blank">you Christians asked for it</a>" or "guns look super mean."</p><p>

So make sure to catch the <strong><a href="https://rumble.com/v2f5t9o--live-daily-show-louder-with-crowder.html" target="_blank">full uncensored show on Rumble</a></strong>. </p><p>Crowder began by explaining that there is absolutely a time for mourning and prayer, and that time is now. He also explained how all the people shouting about gun control right now probably genuinely believe it will help. But the politicians at the top who have fooled people into shouting for gun control, like <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-nashville-ice-cream" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a>, definitely know better. </p><p>The two things Crowder wants to focus on when discussing this shooting are love and truth. He emphasized how love without truth is meaningless. Love based on a lie is just a lie. As an example, Crowder compared the claims from the left that there's a "trans genocide," versus claims from the right that activists are coming for the children. One of those claims is true. And it ain't the genocide. </p><p>Two key facts emphasized by Crowder: every single one of these mass shooters were stopped by a gun. And the vast majority of these mass shootings take place in gun-free zones. Guns are not the problem. </p><p>Crowder then asked if we can even find common ground with the opposing side on mental illness. He clarified that he does not support red flag laws, but that if someone publicly professes to be transgender, that places them in a demographic with a 42% suicide rate. So that would certainly qualify for a red flag law. But would the other side agree? Something tells me they wouldn't.</p><p>Watch the <strong><a href="https://rumble.com/v2f5t9o--live-daily-show-louder-with-crowder.html" target="_blank">full, uncensored coverage of this tragic event exclusively on Rumble</a></strong>.

## Watch: Joy Reid suggests Tennessee had it coming since they banned drag shows but uphold the Second Amendment

Due to their opposition to drag shows for children but support for the Second Amendment. Yes, she really was that tasteless. Shocking, I know. </p><p><em>"This is coming at a time when the First and Second Amendments are in a real tension [...] You have this, in the state of Tennessee, which is ironically the Scopes Monkey Trial state [...] They now are racing to enact these 1st Amendment-limiting laws to limit things like drag shows. You have rampant book banning. I think Tennessee might be the most book-banning state, even more than Florida." </em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p><em>"And so they're essentially saying, it's too dangerous to allow children to be exposed to a drag show, a drag queen is dangerous to children. These books are dangerous to children. But when it comes to guns, they're like, no put more guns where children are." </em></p><p>Well yes, guns wielded by <em>good</em> people <em>should</em> be where children are to protect them from violent maniacs who want to massacre them. Notice how the chyron also read, "Republicans prioritize culture war over saving children's lives." It's almost like protecting children with guns would save their lives. And protecting them from drag shows would preserve their innocence and decrease the likelihood that they one day ask to have their genitals mutilated. </p><p>I'm so tired of all the finger-pointing after these mass shootings, when the main issue is so clearly a problem of mental health and godlessness. Sane people do not walk into elementary schools to murder innocent children. But when you strip away any and all sense of meaning from life and tell people they were born in the wrong body and need to take hormones and get surgery for the rest of their lives to feel "normal"... expect some violent outbursts. And until we fix that, can we <em>please</em> just put some more security in schools? Instead of all the gun control grandstanding? </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## "To hell with ratings and talent": A humble Adam Sandler kills as he accepts the Mark Twain Award for comedic genius

So here's Adam Sandler.</p><p>It's a more serious, subdued Sandler. He is accepting the Mark Twain Award for comedy. This is the event Chris Rock was at where he mocked <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-rock-arrest-trump" target="_blank">how stupid Democrats were to think arresting Trump would work out for them</a>.</p><p>Even a subdued, reflective Sandler still has his moments of Sandlerness:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<p>"Hello, my name is Adam Sandler and I am the  Mark Twain Humor Prize Award for Greatness in American Funny, and bringing the thunderous belly laugh to the sweet people of planet Earth.

<p>The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is presented to individuals who have "had an impact on American society in ways similar to" Twain. It was won in the past by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-cosby-eddie-muprhy-prison" target="_self">Eddie Murphy</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-accepts-mark-twain-prize-defends-2nd-amendment-video" target="_self">Dave Chappelle</a>.</p><p>It was funny hearing Sandler say he was discovered by Dennis Miller, because I was watching<em> Saturday Night Live </em>when Sandler debuted on the Weekend Update...and he CHOKED. So bad, Miller had to tell him to calm down. Then in the very next skit, Sandler came out as Axl Rose signing nursery rhymes and the rest was history.</p><p>Love of Sandler might be a generational thing. But for me, I've always appreciated that he is who he is and his movies are what they are. Nothing but dumb laughs. He's spent his career picking an exotic place to vacation and writing a movie around it as an excuse to bring his friends and family. And when all else fails, he does a <em>Grown Ups</em> movie just so he can hang out with Rock, Schneider, and Spade.</p><p>Though ironically enough, my favorite film of his is <em>Funny People</em> where he plays an "Adam Sandler-like" comedian and they make fun of "Adam Sandler-like" movies.</p><p>God bless the Sandman!</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## 'I Just Need To Die': Nashville Shooter Sent Chilling Suicide Note to Longtime Friend Moments Before Shooting

The shooter messaged Averianna Patton, her former Middle School basketball teammate, at 9:57 AM on Monday. </p><p><em>“So basically that post I made on here about you, that was basically a suicide note. I’m planning to die today."</em></p><p><em>“THIS IS NOT A JOKE!! You’ll probably hear about me on the news after I die. This is my last goodbye. I love you … See you again in another life.”</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">None</div> —  (@)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1640677319084785666"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Patton replied:<em> “You have so much more life to live. I pray God keeps and covers you.”</em></p><p>The shooter wrote back,<em> "</em><em>I know but I don’t want to live. I’m so sorry. I’m not trying to upset you or get attention. I just need to die. I wanted to tell you first because you are the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen and known all my life.”</em></p><p><em>“My family doesn’t know what I’m about to do. One day this will make more sense. I’ve left more than enough evidence behind. But something bad is about to happen.”</em></p><p>Patton told The New York Post, <em>“I tried to comfort and encourage her and subsequently reached out to the Suicide Prevention Help Line after being instructed to by my father at 10:08 a.m.”</em></p><p><em>" [The shooter] has shared with others that she had been suicidal in the past and I knew to take this serious." </em></p><p>What really sticks out to me in these messages are the phrases, <em>"I know but I don’t want to live," </em>and <em>"I just need to die". </em>Remember that this person identified as transgender. And may or may not have been hopped up on testosterone via "masculinization hormone therapy". We don' know yet. But high levels of testosterone in women <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0487-5" target="_blank">can cause </a>severe depression and other mood disturbances that could lead to suicidal thoughts. That's probably "transphobic" of me to say, but, oh well. </p>

The shooter messaged Averianna Patton, her former Middle School basketball teammate, at 9:57 AM on Monday. </p><p><em>“So basically that post I made on here about you, that was basically a suicide note. I’m planning to die today."</em></p><p><em>“THIS IS NOT A JOKE!! You’ll probably hear about me on the news after I die. This is my last goodbye. I love you … See you again in another life.”</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Patton replied:<em> “You have so much more life to live. I pray God keeps and covers you.”</em></p><p>The shooter wrote back,<em> "</em><em>I know but I don’t want to live. I’m so sorry. I’m not trying to upset you or get attention. I just need to die. I wanted to tell you first because you are the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen and known all my life.”</em></p><p><em>“My family doesn’t know what I’m about to do. One day this will make more sense. I’ve left more than enough evidence behind. But something bad is about to happen.”</em></p><p>Patton told The New York Post, <em>“I tried to comfort and encourage her and subsequently reached out to the Suicide Prevention Help Line after being instructed to by my father at 10:08 a.m.”</em></p><p><em>" [The shooter] has shared with others that she had been suicidal in the past and I knew to take this serious." </em></p><p>What really sticks out to me in these messages are the phrases, <em>"I know but I don’t want to live," </em>and <em>"I just need to die". </em>Remember that this person identified as transgender. And may or may not have been hopped up on testosterone via "masculinization hormone therapy". We don' know yet. But high levels of testosterone in women <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0487-5" target="_blank">can cause </a>severe depression and other mood disturbances that could lead to suicidal thoughts. That's probably "transphobic" of me to say, but, oh well. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

The kids were all nine-years-old. Details are still coming out. What we know is that she/her had a manifesto, was a former student of the school, and specifically chose the school because she/her's other target had TOO MUCH SECURITY.</p><p>Police Chief John Drake revealed in a press conference The Covenant School was the only school that was targeted.
