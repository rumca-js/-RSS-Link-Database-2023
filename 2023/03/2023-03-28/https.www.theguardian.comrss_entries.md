<p>So far, so good. Wales claimed their first Euro 2024 qualifying win courtesy of Kieffer Moore’s first-half header. This was Wales’s first game back in Cardiff since their group-stage exit at the World Cup and a sold-out crowd gave Gareth Bale, the most-capped male player and the country’s all-time leading goalscorer, a fitting send-off. The Latvia coach, Dainis Kazakevics, went on the charm offensive in the buildup to the game, talking up Wales’s chances of topping Group D ahead of Croatia, but this display provided little evidence of those credentials.</p><p>Fifteen minutes before kick-off Bale bid farewell to the Wales supporters who have adored him since he made his debut for his country in 2006 as a 16-year-old left-back. A visibly choked Bale, who flew in from California for the game, was presented with a commemorative plaque and cap before addressing the Red Wall who serenaded him as he emerged from the tunnel. “I’m going to miss playing in front of you,” Bale said. “It has been the biggest pleasure.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/28/wales-latvia-euro-2024-qualifier-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

He’s not always successful, but that does not mean his trip is in vain.</p><p>Grylls is in his element at the start of the programme, hurtling in a van with his crew through Poland towards the border. He receives a call from Bruce, a fixer inside Ukraine, who has intel that airstrikes on Kyiv are imminent. Once inside the capital, Grylls surveys the eerie street architecture created since the Russians invaded a year ago: steel girders, chopped up and welded together into 6ft-high asterisks to form “tank traps”, lie on pavements as if giants have been playing a game of jacks, and burnt-out Russian tanks lie by the roadside, totems of small victories past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/28/bear-grylls-meets-president-zelenskyy-review-far-from-the-wilderness-survivalist-just-about-manages">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Liaison committee gently questions a prime minister who stands out just for getting a few things half-right</p><p>A minister who has admitted to using cocaine being sent out to announce a clampdown on laughing gas. Totally normal. A home secretary who can’t be trusted to stay on message. Totally normal. A government prepared to break international law by deporting refugees. Totally normal. An environment secretary permanently at war with herself and the farming community. Totally normal. A chancellor unbothered by a 4% hit to GDP from Brexit. Totally normal. A prime minister who finds all the above totally normal. Totally normal.</p><p>It’s sometimes easy to forget just how toxic the Conservative brand really is. How low the bar for normal politics has become. So when we come across a prime minister who appears to manage some of the basics – who gets a few things half-right without crashing the economy, lying through his teeth or starting a civil war in his own party – it’s tempting for some to invest him with superhuman powers. An alien from another world. When in reality he’s only doing what any country has a right to expect from a leader. Strip back the polls and even though Rishi Sunak’s own ratings are improving, those of his party are still through the floor. It turns out you can quite like him but reckon the Tories are out of time and ideas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/28/the-bar-sinks-low-enough-for-sunak-to-enjoy-a-brief-dose-of-popularity">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on our links to slavery: a necessary reckoning with the past | Editorial

<p>Facing up to the fact that Britain was built on subjugation and empire will help navigate the future</p><p>The Guardian has long been considered a champion of progressive values, rooted in a northern English radical tradition. So it will come as a shock to many that much of the wealth of the Manchester Guardian’s founder, John Edward Taylor, and that of most of his backers was connected to transatlantic slavery. A two-year-long <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/ng-interactive/2023/mar/28/the-scott-trust-legacies-of-enslavement-report" title="">investigation</a> has shown that Taylor traded in slave-picked US cotton and that one of his funders <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/28/in-memoriam-the-enslaved-people-linked-to-the-guardian" title="">enslaved</a> people. Now, recognising this historical injustice, the Scott Trust – which owns the Guardian – has offered an apology for our involvement in this crime against humanity and pledges itself to a decade-long programme of restorative justice. This is a moral commitment to the “understanding that the past cannot be erased, and must not be ignored”, as the historian Olivette Otele writes.</p><p>That history begins by seeing the Guardian shorn of idealist illusions. Like many Georgians, the paper dressed in an air of respectability and saw itself as a mouthpiece for much-needed political reform. This image conceals the economic interests of its founders, which were hiding in plain sight. In April 1821, a month before the first Manchester Guardian was published, Taylor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2017/nov/15/manchester-guardian-prospectus-1821" title="">said</a> that his newspaper would “supply that information on [cotton manufacture], the deficiency of which is often so obviously apparent”. In this guise, the Guardian had progressive values, but it was also a lobbyist for slave-produced cotton, which at that time constituted two-thirds of Britain’s cotton imports.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/28/the-guardian-view-on-our-links-to-slavery-a-necessary-reckoning-with-the-past">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu hasn’t abandoned his attack on the supreme court. His opponents should not give up either</p><p>There is no room for relief. Benjamin Netanyahu’s assault on Israel’s democratic institutions is not over; it is merely on pause. After nearly three months of political crisis, popular outrage and mounting protests, the prime minister was forced to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/israel-netanyahu-judiciary-plans-halt" title="">suspend his attack</a> on the judiciary. He has already caused serious damage to the economy and the state through a headlong charge at the supreme court’s independence, which was opposed by most Israelis. Though he said that he was “not willing to tear the nation in half”, his primary motivation is not saving the country, but himself.</p><p>Mr Netanyahu, who has corruption charges hanging over him, has no love for the judiciary. And though the court has repeatedly undercut Palestinian rights in the West Bank and helped to entrench the occupation, the prime minister’s far-right coalition partners are angered by even its modest rulings outlawing Israeli settlements. They are unlikely to back down. Mr Netanyahu’s best hope is that the protests’ momentum ebbs over Passover and in the weeks that follow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/28/the-guardian-view-on-israels-political-crisis-not-over-yet">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Asher Jacobsberg </strong>responds to a letter that said aid is doing more harm than good in Malawi</p><p>Re Benny Dembitzer’s letter on aid to Malawi (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/foreign-aid-is-doing-more-harm-than-good-in-malawi" title="">23 March</a>), as someone who lives in Malawi and has seen first-hand the devastation caused by Cyclone Freddy, and other cyclones in recent years, it seems to me to be the worst time to suggest that Malawi does not need aid. While of course structural reforms are needed in Malawi to make it more resilient, Malawians are also in dire need of immediate support to rebuild their homes, roads and other infrastructure.</p><p>It seems that Mr Dembitzer is confusing and conflating the two issues. A country may need both aid and structural reform. Malawi definitely needs both. He is also incorrect that international NGOs “have not understood that trees are the only form of fuel to heat homes and cook food”. Many international and local NGOs I know of here have projects around reforestation, reducing firewood and charcoal use, and improving food security.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/28/malawi-does-need-foreign-aid-but-structural-reform-too">Continue reading...</a>

Scotland’s team was made up from players from Clyde, Charlton and second-tier wastrels Liverpool, while Spain were a glamorous amalgam of the brightest stars from Barcelona and Real Madrid. The Spanish forward line that evening consisted of Ladislao Kubala, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jul/07/alfredo-di-stefano-real-madrid">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a>, Luis Suárez and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/18/paco-gento-obituary">Paco Gento</a>.

<p>When she thought she was dying, Emin vowed to create a lasting legacy. Now she has opened the doors of a new art school and studio complex in Margate, and found fulfilment in helping younger artists</p><p>It’s a Saturday morning and the band of the 1st Margate Girls’ and Boys’ Brigade is marching down a side street with pipes and drums ringing out amid a crowd that includes luminaries of the art world, Bob Geldof, and the kids across the road who are still in their pyjamas. Then the town’s Social Singing Choir launches into a version of Madonna’s Like a Prayer that is so lovely people cry. Tracey Emin, too, seems to wipe away a tear as she waits in her tricorn hat and red robe – the official costume of a Freewoman of Margate – to cut the red ribbon and officially open her new art school.</p><p>This delightful public performance is an Emin artwork, but not as we know it. Emin’s subject matter until now had always been herself. “That woman knows herself,” as Lucian Freud said approvingly. But this ceremony is about her embrace of other people. It’s about the community she is setting out to create.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/28/tracey-emin-on-the-joy-of-founding-her-own-art-school-margate">Continue reading...</a>

## Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou: the Ethiopian nun who was one of history’s most distinctive pianists

<p>Guèbrou, who has died aged 99, was a classically trained musician and society girl who turned towards faith – and cultivated a style of playing like no other</p><p>The music of the pianist Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou, who has died at the age of 99, seemed to reflect every area of her extraordinary life. A daughter of Addis Ababa’s upper classes, she was immersed in Ethiopian traditional song, then trained in classical violin and piano, embraced early jazz and later took holy orders. So it’s quite fitting that her compositions were a curious fusion of <em>fin de siècle</em> parlour piano, gospel, ragtime, Ethiopian folk music and the choral traditions of the country’s Orthodox church. A BBC radio documentary on her work was entitled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/17/ethiopia-93-year-old-singing-nun-emahoy-tsegue-maryam-guebrou">The Honky Tonk Nun</a>, and it seemed to sum up the paradoxical nature of her music – a mix of high and low art, sacred and profane, precise notation and free improvisation.</p><p>Guèbrou might have remained unknown to the outside world were it not for the French musicologist Francis Falceto, who worked with the record label Buda Music to release <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/1174982-Tsegu%C3%A9-Maryam-Gu%C3%A8brou-%C3%89thiopiques-21-Piano-Solo">an album</a> of her archive recordings in 2006. It was part of a series of compilation albums of Ethiopian music entitled Éthiopiques. The series was a revelation, even to many people who thought they were familiar with Africa’s best music. Where there are certain instruments, rhythms, scales and voicings that are shared by several different regions around the continent, the music of Ethiopia – one of the world’s oldest Christian civilisations – stands distinct and discrete from anything in neighbouring countries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/28/emahoy-tsegue-maryam-guebrou-the-ethiopian-nun-who-was-one-of-historys-most-distinctive-pianists">Continue reading...</a>

Liam Gallagher has been unusually generous about his brother’s new single Dead to the World, saying “how can such a mean spirited little man write such a beautiful song” – an improvement on comparing his music to that of arch-nemeses Blur – while Noel has said of a reunion: “He’s got my number. He’s got my manager’s number. Call us … Stop talking on the fucking internet and let’s see what you’ve got to say.”</p><p>UN diplomats might have advised more dovish phrasing yet, but by the Gallaghers’ standards they’ve each left a teddy holding some roses on the other’s doorstep. Compare with 2020, when Noel said: “I’ve often thought, ‘Let’s just do a gig.’ But I realised I would only be doing it to shut this fucking idiot up.

<p>Cold-case drama The Night of the 12th has just swept the board at the French Oscars and has the nation talking about misogyny and murder. We talk to its director, Dominik Moll, about how it made him question his own place in the patriarchy</p><p>At 6am on a Tuesday in May 2013, the half-charred, petrol-doused body of a young woman was found on a residential street in Lagny-sur-Marne, 25km east of Paris. It was 21-year-old Maud Maréchal, who had been returning at night from a friend’s house to her family home, just a few metres from where she was killed. A neighbour discovered the corpse, the police fruitlessly investigated this horrific murder, and then Maréchal’s death was filed away, hardly noticed by the French press.</p><p>Until now. A fictionalised account of the murder, The Night of the 12th by Franco-German director Dominik Moll, has just swept the boards at France’s Oscars equivalent, the César awards, reviving interest in the Maréchal case. But only, thinks Moll, because he made a point of mentioning her during his speech for best film: “It was important to remind people there was a real victim, and her name was Maud,” says the director, speaking over Zoom from his home in Montreuil, 20km from where the young woman lived. “But then quite a few journalists started to talk about the real case, and some of them not in a very responsible way.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/28/whats-wrong-between-men-and-women-the-thriller-igniting-debate-about-femicide">Continue reading...</a>

## Feelgood factor: Mae Martin’s Sap on Netflix is comedic open-heart surgery

Filmed in their native Canada, on a woodland stage set, it’s a hugely likable hour by a comic who’s made a specialty of emotional self-inquiry, whose standup is like open-heart surgery with a microphone in the scalpel’s place.</p><p>While it incorporates elements from Martin’s previous shows, Sap also feels like a step forward. Unlike <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/24/mae-martin-dope-review-edinburgh-festival">2017’s Dope</a>, say, which zeroed in on Martin’s teenage years and addictive personality, there’s no particular theme here: the show radiates (and justifies) confidence in the 35-year-old’s ability to hold our attention without one. The self-reflexive tics that once characterised Martin’s standup have fallen away, replaced by composure and authority – albeit composure put to the task of depicting a turbulent inner life (“I’m full to the absolute brim with feelings”), and authority in the service of lovably self-mocking humour.</p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81628816">Mae Martin: Sap is on Netflix</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/28/mae-martin-sap-on-netflix-feel-good">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Guardian is facing up to, and apologising for, the fact that its first editor drew his wealth from a practice that was a crime against humanity</p><p>I remember the moment. We were meeting the historians who had been commissioned by the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian, to look into our past. The Black Lives Matter movement had put unprecedented focus on racism in our societies, and it had inspired the Guardian to look at itself. Dr Cassandra Gooptar, an irrepressible expert on the history of enslaved peoples, had done some early work, and the evidence was inescapable: there was no doubt that the Guardian was founded with money partly derived from slavery, and the links were extensive. David Olusoga, one of Britain’s top historians who happens to sit on the Scott Trust, was not surprised; this history had, in many ways, been hiding in plain sight. As editor-in-chief of the Guardian, I felt sick to my stomach.</p><p>It is a deeply uneasy feeling to know that one of my predecessors, the Guardian’s founding editor, John Edward Taylor, derived much of his wealth from Manchester’s cotton industry, an industry that relied on firms such as Taylor’s trading with cotton plantations in the Americas that had enslaved millions of Black people forcibly transported from Africa. The great American abolitionist Frederick Douglass made the connection plain: “The price of human flesh on the Mississippi was regulated by the price of cotton in Manchester.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/commentisfree/2023/mar/28/how-our-founders-links-to-slavery-change-the-guardian-today">Continue reading...</a>

At least, to please dog lovers, who really do appear to be the target audience. “Why not pamper your pooch with a gift from our shop?” suggests the website. Why not? Because I’ve never owned a dog and anyway they’re not allowed in our flats.</p><p>Obviously, the dog in art is a valid subject, even if it lacks the pedigree of the cat, which goes back to ancient Egypt.

As a teacher at a large West London state school and a member of a club nearby where most young players are privately educated, one Tuesday last year gave me a first-hand insight into the experiences of both.</p><p>The yellow box on my timetable jumps out from my laptop screen the second I open it. “COVER DUTY: YEAR 7 BOYS PE, 09:50-10:50”.

<p>This weekend, 8,000 gallons of latex were accidentally dumped in the Delaware River – and tap water across the country is laced with disturbing chemicals</p><p>My wife is wonderful in every way, but I realised over the weekend that she is simply not built for the apocalypse. On Sunday, I was scrolling through Twitter and having a nice cup of tea when I saw a tweet from a guy called <a href="https://twitter.com/YaFavTrashman">Ya Fav Trashman</a> about a chemical spill that might affect Philadelphia drinking water. “<a href="https://www.trinseo.com/News-and-Events/Trinseo-News/2023/March/Latex-Emulsion-Release-to-Waterway-at-Trinseos-Bristol-Plant">Equipment failure</a>” at a Trinseo chemical facility had dumped more than 8,000 gallons (about 30,000 litres) of “latex emulsion product” into the Delaware river. You can’t just boil or filter these chemicals out of your water.</p><p>I immediately spat out my Delaware River tea. (Perhaps the latex was why it was going down so smoothly?) “Yikes,” I said. “We’d better get some bottled water.” My wife volunteered to go to the nearest shop. She came back with … two bottles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/28/the-us-is-the-worlds-richest-country-so-why-cant-i-get-a-glass-of-clean-drinking-water">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve set a goal of reading 50 books this year, and logging my progress is strangely satisfying. Some might not approve of turning reading into a game, but if it works for you, why not?</p><p>This year, for the first time in my life, I signed up for a Goodreads challenge. I decided on the number of books I want to read over the next 12 months (a very modest 50, compared with someone else’s bewildering 300, which I saw float past on my newsfeed) and very quietly I am working towards meeting my target. I have never attempted anything like this before. Reading has always been a very personal thing, a topic to speak about only if someone asks, and I held the firm belief that challenges and targets belonged to my Peloton and not to my bookshelves. Now, however, I have a little percentage tracker on my home page, Goodreads friends applaud my progress each time I finish a book, and it feels … strangely comforting.</p><p>The games, challenges and competitions start with gusto in January. No sooner have we dusted ourselves down from everyone’s “best books of the year”, we’re thrown straight into a literary Alton Towers with an endless choice of book rides on which to hop. The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/show/11633-2023-reading-challenge">Goodreads challenge</a> is the most straightforward, and based purely on numbers, but elsewhere online you can commit to a month of reading stories set in certain time periods or in particular countries, books within specific genres, a year-long <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/22381639-a-z-challenge-locations---2023">A-Z challenge</a> with a selective version of the alphabet (they tend not to bother with X), or even novels only with yellow covers. My particular favourite is a form of book bingo, in which there are no monthly constraints, but you just need to complete all the reading tasks (for example, a book set in France, a book about vampires) in time to shout “Bingo!” very loudly into the internet before New Year’s Day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/28/points-mean-pages-why-ive-embraced-the-world-of-online-reading-challenges">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Animal-friendly cosmetics brand Lush is releasing a range of Mario-themed products – so our reporter tried them, for science</p><p>The announcement that cosmetics chain Lush would be running a collaboration with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/10/can-the-super-mario-bros-movie-end-30-years-of-terrible-video-game-films">Super Mario Bros Movie</a> was met with some incredulity in the video game press last week. The animal-friendly brand is not exactly associated with either movie licences or tech tie-ins, so the idea of Mario shower gel or Princess Peach body spray came as a shock.</p><p>So, driven by an insatiable desire for journalistic investigation, I acquired some. And, look, it’s good stuff: the gloopy red Mario shower gel has a lovely subtle cola tang, while the Luigi has sweet notes of apple and rose and the vibrant green colour and consistency of fluorescent play slime. The gold coin soap uses the brand’s popular and giddily candied Honey I Washed the Kids scent, while Bowser’s version has a spicy, dare I say it, masculine aroma. Most of those are based on established Lush ingredients, but the Princess Peach body spray is a brand new fragrance, a sugar bomb of peach and pineapple, which I probably shouldn’t be wearing but totally am. I smell like a walking sweet shop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/28/super-mario-lush-soaps">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The British are the baddies in a clunky origin story that can’t land a blow on  Donnie Yen’s original series</p><p>A mainland Chinese attempt to cash in on Donnie Yen’s superior Hong Kong series about Bruce Lee’s eponymous <em>sifu</em>, this film’s quickstep fighting rhythms are bogged down by a laughable lack of effort on the narrative front. Budding martial arts master Ip Man, played here by former child star and Jet Li acolyte Miu Tse, arouses the ire of the arrogant British colonialist Mr Stark (played by Sergio de Ieso in a possible nod to Iron Man) after interrupting his human trafficking ring. That’s your lot story-wise; slogging through 76 minutes feels like being forced to do one-finger press-ups for the same length of time.</p><p>This is the kind of plot staple – plucky martial arts school takes on foreign bullyboys – that animated many a Shaw Brothers or Golden Harvest production back in the day. Ip’s wing chun must ultimately trump the bartitsu of Mr Stark and his minions; the latter sounds made up, but was actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartitsu">a genuine 19th-century British martial art</a>. It’s a sign of the times that Britons are now viable bad guys for Chinese and Indian cinema, as in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/15/best-films-of-2022-in-the-uk-no-7-rrr">RRR</a>, and why shouldn’t we be fair game?

<p><strong>Royal Opera House, London<br /></strong>Ashton’s three-act ballet combines escapism, clever classicism and panto, and this new version gets better as it goes along</p><p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2023/mar/24/you-shall-go-to-the-ballet-cinderella-at-the-royal-opera-house-in-pictures">newly designed production</a> celebrates the 75th anniversary of Frederick Ashton’s Cinderella, sprinkling some fairy dust on what was Britain’s first three-act ballet. It’s a combination of 19th-century classicism with Ashton’s delightfully playful, tricksy footwork, and the broad comedy of the pantomime dame in the shape of the ugly sisters. Whether that mix is entirely successful remains moot, along with whether the story has enough emotional heft to sustain three acts, although this one warms up and gets better as it goes along.</p><p>On opening night, Marianela Nuñez plays Cinders, a girl given to beatific smiles even when engaged in servitude, so good-hearted and pure is she. When she arrives at the ball, she is immediately a ballerina – she makes an amazing entrance, slow descent on pointe down the steps, time suspended. There is not a huge sense of character until the end, in her shy delight at realising her life is about to change.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/28/cinderella-review-royal-ballet-fairytale-is-a-shiny-sugar-rush">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Traditionalists will frown but sabbaticals and wildcards could increase skills and talent pool while making for a better game</p><p>It is amazing how swiftly perceptions can change in sport. Remember how English cricket once revolved around the County Championship until Twenty20 cricket and the Indian Premier League came along? Or the days when the most famous footballers in England ran pubs in retirement to help make ends meet? Progress can sweep aside old-school certainties quicker than you can say leather balls and neat side partings.</p><p>The same is true in rugby union. Even without the chilly financial draught blowing through many clubs in England and Wales there is no ignoring the rise of the French Top 14 as an attractive rival to the Premiership. Salaries are higher across the Channel, crowds are growing steadily and the rock stars of the national team are increasingly rubbing shoulders with bright-eyed English émigrés.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/28/english-rugby-union-players-going-abroad-progressive">Continue reading...</a>

It’s an entertaining and affectionate tribute to the men and women who show up week in, week out for 40 quid (plus petrol for a big game). Chasing players around for 90 minutes in the rain isn’t the half of it: verbal abuse comes with the job, as well as spitting and assault from players and spectators, not to mention picking up dog poo off the pitch.</p><p>Director Greg Cruttwell does a terrific job assembling of a lineup of characters. Steve, a retired tube driver with a Benidorm tan, has been reffing for 25 years. Everyone moans about referees, he says, but someone’s got do it. (He looks like a man who can handle a bit of argy-bargy). Glorious Ann Marie Powell is a teacher who moved from Jamaica to work in a London school a decade or so ago. Elderly gent Ron, who has officiated at 6,000 matches, gives the film moments of documentary gold with his views on everything from the state of Coronation Street to cooking sausage rolls in the microwave.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/28/in-the-middle-review-referees-in-grassroots-english-football-take-centre-stage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The longer I stay away, the less I feel completely truthful when I tell people I’m Irish – although I’m certainly nothing else</p><p>Not long ago, a friend said – in passing, as though it was so obvious that it didn’t bear any examination – that nobody would willingly choose to live their life again from the beginning if they couldn’t bring with them the benefit of hindsight. I would, I said instantly. I’d go back and do it all over again, no problem. In fact, I’d <em>prefer</em> not to have any hindsight: the idea of starting over and trying to live an unimpeachable life strikes me as a particular kind of torture. No, I’d go from day one, a blank baby, just for the hell of it.</p><p>The concept of regret is difficult for me – not because I believe myself to have lived particularly well, but because to revise any decision could mean not meeting all the people I love, or not going to all the places that mean the most to me. Rather than specific regrets, I tend to harbour a large, free-floating dread that I will one day feel remorse about the way I live more generally – the biggest and most troubling element of this pre-regret being my decision to leave Ireland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/28/my-biggest-regret-was-it-a-mistake-to-leave-ireland-for-new-york">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How a pair of synthetic booties have seen the author through a grueling book tour and an environmental calamity</p><p>Growing up a first-generation Filipina in a rural mostly white town, banal objects such as slippers took on outsized significance. Just like Mother Goose stories, Lunchables and VHS players (we had a Betamax), slippers – specifically my parents’ disinterest in and lack thereof – were proof that no matter how “American” we were, we were always inherently foreign. Rather than plush slippers, our family had flimsy <em>tsinelas</em>. The closest I could come to making these cheap, indoor flips-flops feel lavish was by wearing them with socks. (Today, as an adult, I believe this look to be an absolute Asian flex, but in childhood it was humiliating.)</p><p>In my teens and twenties, I messed around with Totes and Isotoner slippers, and swiped the complimentary terry slippers from hotels. But no version ever stuck. After becoming a parent in my thirties, I realized I needed to get serious about the need to be as comfortable as possible during the years’ worth of nights spent at home. So I took up the slipper hunt again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/28/what-makes-me-happy-now-instagram-slippers">Continue reading...</a>

But there were women painting at the time – so where are their contributions? </p><p>For a 1936 exhibition at MoMA in New York, Alfred H Bar Jr created a <a href="https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/archives/InventingAbstraction_GLowry_359_363.pdf">flow chart</a> depicting the evolution of modern art in Europe from impressionism through a series of other “-isms”, culminating in abstraction. The chart has become widely derided for its easy-to-follow depiction of art movements evolving in a fixed progression, with no consideration of any artists working outside the Parisian avant garde. The National Gallery’s new exhibition, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/22/after-impressionism-inventing-modern-art-national-gallery-london">After Impressionism: Inventing Modern Art</a><em>,</em><em> </em>feels like walking through this defunct diagram.</p><p>When the gallery announced the exhibition last year, Twitter users criticised its framing around the three “pivotal figures” of Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, and Vincent van Gogh, and its lack of work by women. The gallery <a href="https://twitter.com/NationalGallery/status/1529758889150930944">responded</a> with a claim that more “major” works by women would be announced in due course. In the final exhibition, there are a total of five works made by women: paintings by <a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/ra-magazine-francesca-wade-paula-modherson-becker-artist">Paula Modersohn-Becker</a>, <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/sonia-delaunay-993">Sonia Delaunay</a>, and <a href="https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/koller-pinell-broncia">Broncia Koller-Pinell</a>, and sculptures by <a href="https://www.musee-rodin.fr/en/resources/rodin-and-artists/camille-claudel">Camille Claudel</a> and <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/3201">Käthe Kollwitz</a>. The show includes a total of 94 paintings and sculptures, meaning that 5% of the exhibition is by women – actually a five-fold improvement on the National Gallery’s permanent collection, of which <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/women-in-our-collection">1% of the objects are made by women</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/28/after-impressionism-national-gallery-women-artists">Continue reading...</a>

You’re you’re bringing what is a really serious issue about the future of teachers, about the current state of teachers in the classroom, down to personalities. I think that is really base and it demeans the programme. I’m really sorry. you’ve done that, Nick.</p><p>We need a strong and united union that can make that case, one that fights and wins on the issues that matter to our members, one that boosts pay, reduces workload, wins on funding and one that reclaims education for educators and for our children.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/mar/28/national-education-union-teachers-strike-exams-disruption-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The working-class son of Guyanese immigrants could soon be the foreign secretary. He discusses antisemitism, Suella Braverman – and his experience of being stopped and searched at 12</p><p>Last September, the son of a single mother raised in the shadow of the Broadwater Farm estate in north London attended the official proclamation of the king. It was only as David Lammy was dressing for the privy council ceremony at St James’s Palace that the experience started to feel faintly surreal.</p><p>“I got the bus back home just to feel normal,” the shadow foreign secretary says. “I get a bit emotional about this, but I can’t tell you – I’ve travelled a long, long way from where my parents started, and my upbringing, a long, long way. And that’s, in a way, the miracle of this country.” His Guyana-born parents, ardent monarchists, would doubtless have been proud, but didn’t live to see the day; as he notes, his parents, and those of his childhood friends, led hard lives and mostly died relatively young, while his posher university mates’ parents are still busy “running the world”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/28/david-lammy-on-regrets-rwanda-flights-and-racism-ive-had-so-many-death-threats">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A young woman is murdered on the streets of Grenoble in this unnerving, fictionalised version of a real case that haunts the police officers unable to solve it</p><p>French film-maker Dominik Moll has given us a gripping true-crime procedural, a desolate study of the ubiquity of evil and misogynist violence and the abyss of unknowing into which everyone finds themselves gazing: crime victims, relatives and the police themselves. And crime in the real world is often not bounded by the Agatha Christie conventions of clearcut motives and culprits unmasked.</p><p>Moll and screenwriter Gilles Marchand have fictionalised a real case recounted by the French author Pauline Guéna in her 2020 eyewitness reportage book 18.3: Une Année à la PJ, for which she was embedded for a year with France’s Police Judiciaire (equivalent to the UK’s CID); 18.3 being that part of the French penal code which governs their existence. On a certain ominous night in 2016, a young woman in Grenoble called Clara (Lula Cotton-Frapier) leaves a house after dark where she had been hanging out with her friend, Stéphanie (Pauline Serieys), and impulsively records a video in the street on her phone saying how much she loves her – and is then horrifyingly slaughtered by an unseen assailant. A team of cops is assigned to her case, led by the new chief Yohan (Bastien Bouillon) and a moody, careworn older officer Marceau (Bouli Lanners). One of the first things that the forensic squad naturally have to do is delicately bag up Clara’s smartphone, a precious vessel of potentially useful information (including that video) and, fundamentally, her digital soul, a repository of her entire identity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/28/the-night-of-the-12th-review-gripping-true-crime-drama-dominik-moll">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Butler-Gallie’s wry memoir of his work as a Church of England priest is warm and rewarding, if tinged with disappointment</p><p>When the young clergyman Fergus Butler-Gallie was asked, by the curious and the insolent, “What made you become a priest?” – with a variety of different emphases depending on the interlocutor – his stock answer was to reply: “Well, I heard that black was slimming.” Yet, as he subsequently reveals in this diary-cum-memoir<em>, </em>his true answer, shruggingly expressed, was: “Death, I suppose.”</p><p>It is this dichotomy between the sacred and profane – or to be more exact, tragedy and farce – that permeates Butler-Gallie’s account of contemporary life in the Church of England. After two accomplished volumes of humorous ecclesiastical history, including 2018’s excellent <em>A Field Guide to the English Clergy</em><em>, </em>he now turns his attention to himself and proves a witty and adept guide to the foibles of the well-intentioned and all too human figures who follow holy orders. He comes from a military family, and when he tells his father that he is considering becoming a clergyman, the patriarch’s response, delivered with “a well-worn hereditary hangdog look”, is: “In many ways it’s not so different from the army. The outfit’s stupid and the pay’s crap.”</p><p><em>Touching Cloth: Confessions and Communions of a Young Priest</em> by Fergus Butler-Gallie is published by Bantam Press (£16.99).

However, if you were a pupil in mid-1980s Chicago, you might find house music heroes such as Frankie Knuckles and Ron Hardy rocking up on a weekly basis to turn your school gymnasium into scenes of sweat-drenched jacking pandemonium.</p><p>In her new book, Dance Your Way Home: A Journey Through the Dancefloor, Emma Warren describes such a scene as “the dance music equivalent of having Jean-Michel Basquiat drop into your after-school art club, or Serena Williams cover Friday afternoon PE”.

<p>I am a very sexual man, but my wife has so much to juggle that we aren’t as intimate as we once were. How can I reignite the spark?</p><p><strong>I am </strong><strong>in my 40s</strong><strong> and married to the love of my life</strong><strong>. I am</strong><strong> a very sexual and sensual man. I derive pleasure from pleasing my wife and connecting with her physically and emotionally. However, since having our third</strong><strong> child two years ago</strong><strong> I feel that we have lost</strong><strong> our physical connection. We still have sex but it is less frequent than I would like and </strong><strong>it is usually rushed because the kids are at home or</strong><strong> we are off to </strong><strong>run errands. </strong><strong>At times, I feel </strong><strong>as if my wife is so mentally busy juggling work and the kids</strong><strong> that she doesn’t think about sex and intimacy as much as I do.</strong></p><p>It is perfectly normal for a woman with three children and a job to be less available for sex than she was when she had fewer responsibilities. Many couples benefit from planning time together for sex and it sounds as though this would be very useful for you both. If possible, find specific times to get help with childcare and do something fun together and make love elsewhere. I know this is a change from the past when you could have sex more spontaneously, but it is your current reality. You both need to carve out this special time for intimacy as your sexual reconnection will not happen without it. Try to be patient, support your wife as much as you can and remember that for many busy women the sexiest thing you can do is wash the dishes, organise the fridge and empty the bins.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

One hundred days after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/world-cup-final-argentina-france-match-report" title="">World Cup final</a>, the pitch is still watered daily and cut once a week; a team of around 30 workers are on hand to maintain the site.

The nearby boulevard, where Lionel Messi and his victorious teammates paraded into the December night, is almost empty save for groups of south Asian workers, cloths covering their heads to protect them from the midday sun, filling in the gaps between paving slabs with fresh cement.</p><p>There is still work to be done here even though the circus has moved on. But many of those who remain are patently at risk of exploitation and abuse despite Qatar’s attempts to mask the cracks in its partially successful labour reforms. When Qatar announced those flagship measures in August 2020, a decade after it won the right to host the World Cup, Fifa called them “groundbreaking”. The Qataris claimed they were a “major step forward”. The UN said they marked a “new era”. Even Qatar’s strongest critics gave them a cautious welcome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/28/legacy-fight-goes-on-for-migrant-workers-in-qatar-100-days-after-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The venue boasts of a ‘gold standard’ customer service award, but it made a concert visit impossible</p><p><strong>I hope you can help with the dismal way the O2 Arena treats folks with disabilities. In July 2020, I spent £338 on tickets for two Elton John performances – a seat for myself on one night, and one for myself and my daughter on another. The concerts were due in November 2021, but postponed until May this year after Elton John had a fall. In the meantime, I was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. I can’t attend gigs on my own and cannot manage the stairs required to get to my seats.</strong></p><p><strong>As I’m a frequent gig-goer, this has been replicated in many other big venues and all, except O2, have swiftly and efficiently changed my booking to accessible seats with a carer. O2 simply suggests I turn up and they will see if they can accommodate me, but no guarantees. This seems appallingly out of step with trying to make access easy for everyone, and completely blind to the problems I have even getting out of my front door now, let alone making a long journey into London. They’ve stuck to this position even after a 75-minute wait to talk to their “accessibility” team. My main concern is they sort out the evening with my daughter as it’s her birthday present. The ticket for my solo attendance will have to be passed to a friend as I can’t attend alone. <br /></strong><em><strong>SK, Billingshurst, West Sussex</strong></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/mar/28/o2-arena-showed-a-dismal-attitude-to-my-disability">Continue reading...</a>

## Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman review – Murakami’s surreal tales around a Tokyo earthquake

<p>The seductively quirky sad-serious tone of the author is evident as a constellation of characters try and save the city – including a lost cat and a giant talkative frog</p><p>Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami has inspired some prestigious movies, most recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/14/drive-my-car-review-hamaguchi-murakami">Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car</a>. Regardless of whether this new Murakami adaptation (based on his short story collection of the same name) comes to be considered the best, I think it might actually capture the elusive essence of Murakami more than any other – something in it being a Rotoscope animation of elegant simplicity. It has the ruminative lightness, almost weightlessness, the watercolour delicacy and reticence of the emotions, the sense of the uncanny, the insistent play of erotic possibility and that Murakami keynote: a cat.</p><p>Pierre Földes makes his feature directing debut here, having been long been a composer; his musical credits include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/29/artsfeatures8">Michael Cuesta’s L.I.E.</a> from 2001, and he has written the score for this movie too, which brings together a constellation of characters and storylines around the recent Tokyo earthquake – to which it attributes a tonal sense of disorientation rather than tragedy and sadness. Komura (voiced in the English-language dub by Ryan Bommarito) is a quiet young man working joylessly in a bank; his wife, Kyoko, (Shoshana Wilder) suffers from insomnia and depression, ceaselessly watching TV news reports about the earthquake. She walks out on Komura, plagued by a guilty memory of having made a bizarre Faustian bargain to get together with him in the first place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/28/blind-willow-sleeping-woman-review-murakamis-surreal-tales-around-a-tokyo-earthquake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dr Peter Attia is an expert on longevity and preventative medicine. He explains how sleep, weight training and other incremental changes can make us much more resilient</p><p>Twenty years ago, Peter Attia was working as a trainee surgeon at Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, where he saved countless people facing what he calls “fast death”. “I trained in a very, very violent city,” he tells me. “We were probably averaging 15 or 16 people a day getting shot or stabbed. And, you know, that’s when surgeons can save your life. We’re really good at that.”</p><p>What got to him, he says, were the people he treated who were in the midst of dying much more slowly. “All the people with cardiovascular disease, all the people with cancer: we were far less effective at saving those people. We could delay death a little bit, but we weren’t bending the arc of their lives.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/28/healthspan-revolution-how-to-live-long-strong-happy-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Elvira and her brothers, Ricard and Ramón, were left at a train station in Barcelona aged two, four and five. As an adult, when Elvira decided to look for her parents, she discovered a family history wilder than anything she had imagined</p><p>n 22 April 1984, a sandy-haired, ringleted two-year-old girl named Elvira was driven with her brothers, Ricard and Ramón, aged four and five, to a grand railway terminus in Barcelona. The children, dressed in designer clothes, rode in a white Mercedes-Benz driven by their father’s French friend Denis. He parked near the modernist Estación de Francia and walked them into the hangar-like hall, which had shiny, patterned marble floors and was topped by two glass domes. Once there, he told the children to wait while he bought sweets.</p><p>The three siblings waited, but Denis did not return. Eventually, Elvira started crying. A railway worker asked what was wrong and Ramón, who spoke French and Spanish, explained. The police were called, but when they asked the children their parents’ names, they did not know. Nor could the children give their own surnames, or say where they lived – except that, until recently, it had been Paris.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/28/three-abandoned-children-two-missing-parents-40-year-mystery-elvira-moral-barcelona">Continue reading...</a>
