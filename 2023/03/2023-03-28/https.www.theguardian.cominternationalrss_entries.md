## Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves review – passable, playful adventure

<p>There’s just about enough goofy charm, if not enough humour, in this serviceable attempt to create a new big-screen franchise from the fantasy game</p><p>Even with a surprise resurgence in the popularity of the immersive, exhausting role-playing fantasy game Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2017 saw more players of the game than any other year in its entire existence), betting a reported $150m on a new franchise-starting film is a risky, borderline reckless, move, like betting on a regular goblin against a hobgoblin in a magic sorcery battle (note: I have never played Dungeons &amp; Dragons before). As acceptably engaging as Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves might be, it’s hard to fully understand the thinking behind such a wild gambit, especially given that a splashy <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/01/dungeons-and-dragons-live-action-series-paramount-plus-rawson-marshall-thurber-eone-paramount-pictures-1235215486/">Paramount+ TV series</a> is also in the works, the success of one film immediately dictating the existence of an entire extended universe.</p><p>While other more mainstreamed franchises have touched upon loosely similar fantasy territory, from Game of Thrones to Lord of the Rings, there’s more of a niche, loaded quality to D&amp;D that could prevent a similar trajectory, an association with hardcore geek culture that might be hard to shake for the average multiplex-frequenter. It’s not as if those behind the film aren’t also acutely aware of this as well, hiring the duo behind Game Night, Horrible Bosses and Spider-man: Homecoming to bring some pop and levity, aiming to give the film a Guardians of the Galaxy-esque irreverence, something the cool kids could enjoy just as much. It’s a passable attempt at such and one which is made all the more passable by context, comparing it with recent Marvel and DC films making it seem that much better but is that enough to warrant such lofty universe-starting investment?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/28/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-passable-playful-adventure">Continue reading...</a>

At the age of 81, Darlene Love is still socking it to audiences – and she joins us this week to answer your questions.</p><p>Grounded first in gospel choirs then doo-wop groups, her group the Blossoms caught the ear of producer Phil Spector in the early 1960s. He drafted Love in to sing the lead on the infectiously strutting He’s a Rebel, which was credited to another group, the Crystals, on its release. Love perfectly evoked the infatuation and insubordination in this tale of loving a no-good guy, and took it to the top of the US charts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/28/post-your-questions-for-singing-legend-darlene-love">Continue reading...</a>
