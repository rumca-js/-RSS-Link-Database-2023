<p>There&rsquo;s a cost to Amazon returns&mdash;on both the consumer and retailer side. It takes time and money to make a return, and then there are the environmental costs, not just from additional transit, but also from the dumping of unwanted products. But Amazon appears to be trying to minimize those hits to everyone&rsquo;s bottom line with the launch of warning labels on frequently returned products.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-starts-warning-customers-about-frequently-returned-items&amp;xcust=2-2-1674461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Information</a>, small banners have begun to appear on listings where the product gets sent back often. The label notes the product&rsquo;s status as a frequently returned product, along with a prompt to check item details and reviews before purchasing. You can still make returns on these items&mdash;the 30-day window still applies to most goods. But this warning system is designed to cut down on the number of times people return something in disappointment.</p>



<p>You can see the label in action on several third-party listings found by The Information&mdash;one for the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Ject-A1-Automatic-pre-Adjusted-switchable/dp/B09RKQGGWL/&amp;xcust=2-2-1674461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Pro-Ject Automat A1 record player</a>, as well as two dresses.&nbsp;You may need to be signed into an Amazon account to see the warning label.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1674472" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-13.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The new warning label in action.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Having these callouts should save time during the research phase of choosing a product, as well. Even if you make a habit of thoroughly checking over an item&rsquo;s description and reviews before buying, you can now immediately jump to seeking out <em>why</em> an item was rejected so often, instead of having to first determine what people are saying and then the general mood. Hopefully in the future, common keyphrases (e.g., &ldquo;broke two months in&rdquo; or &ldquo;runs large&rdquo;) will become part of these warning labels as well.</p>



<p>A change in third-party and vendor behavior would be welcome as well, given the ubiquity of cheap or poorly manufactured (and sometimes poorly thought-out) products on Amazon&rsquo;s marketplace. Being branded with a scarlet warning label could force more proactive sharing of detailed and honest information about items. But even with these warning labels in their current form, a wide rollout of them should help reduce the number of trips we all take down to the local UPS store.</p>

## Microsoft may strip down Windows 12 to enable frequent updates

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;Windows 12&rdquo; will be designed as a more modular system that will enable quick, frequent updates without much handholding from the user, according to a new report.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-windows-corepc-modern-platform-hudson-valley-2024&amp;xcust=2-1-1674397-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Central report</a> claims that this new &ldquo;CorePC&rdquo; concept will strip Windows 12 (or whatever it&rsquo;s known as) down to its component parts, representing another attempt at a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; version of Windows. As the story points out, Microsoft tried that with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393937/windows-10x-leaks-hands-on-with-microsofts-new-simplified-os.html">Windows 10X</a>&mdash;but without the under-the-hood components that would actually simplify the operating system. (Subsequently, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394562/microsoft-kills-windows-10x.html">Microsoft cancelled Windows 10X</a> but kept the user interface as part of Windows 11.)</p>



<p>The CorePC concept uses something called &ldquo;state separation,&rdquo; Windows Central says, which essentially breaks up the operating system into various partitions. It&rsquo;s not clear whether these partitions would be user-accessible or not. The other advantage, apparently, is that separating various components into different partitions&mdash;virtual buckets, if you will&mdash;allows each partition to be managed and updated separately. This would theoretically allow for quicker, more seamless updates to the Windows OS.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ve seen hints of this before. Go back far enough, and Windows was once a giant, holistic thing updated via periodic service packs and feature updates. But in 2020 Microsoft introduced the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393771/the-windows-feature-experience-pack-is-a-curated-collection-for-beta-testers.html">Windows Feature Experience Pack</a>, which allowed access to distinct features, and then &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/611767/meet-the-new-ways-in-which-microsoft-is-quietly-adding-features-to-windows.html">experiences</a>,&rdquo; which updated some of the core features of Windows outside of the normal update channels. Apps like Microsoft Edge, which Microsoft would normally update as feature releases, now have their own development track, too. </p>



<p>All this points to Microsoft making Windows more modular over time. What CorePC would do, apparently, is separate some of that code to make this new modularity approach even easier to implement. (A compatibility layer called Neon would help ease older apps into this new scheme, Windows Central reports.)</p>



<p>This new approach will have a number of potential benefits: yet another attempt by Microsoft to take on Chromebooks and Google&rsquo;s Chrome OS in the low-end PC market, while potentially introducing more demanding AI apps into the more powerful upper echelons.</p>



<p>All this is being targeted at the next version of Windows, apparently code-named Hudson Valley. Will it happen? We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.</p>

## Neweggâ€™s ChatGPT-based PC builder is kind of a dumb shill

<p>AI text generation is the hot ticket right now, and Newegg is ready to jump on the bandwagon. In addition to using the popular ChatGPT program for generating website text like product descriptions and customer service chat, the PC-focused web store is integrating the AI system into its PC Builder tool, which <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/786523/newegg-says-you-need-a-1200-desktop-to-play-fortnite.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">first went live last year</a>. Predictably, the tool was already suggesting builds for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/786523/newegg-says-you-need-a-1200-desktop-to-play-fortnite.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">gaming desktops that were kind of ridiculous</a>. The AI version of the tool doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any better. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/newegg-ai-pc-builder-generator/&amp;xcust=2-1-1674148-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">As PC Gamer notes</a>, the conversation-style text inputs make ChatGPT and Newegg spit out results that are, quote, &ldquo;extortionate.&rdquo; A request for a PC that can play <em>The Sims </em>(which can run on most new laptops with integrated graphics) suggested a $1,500 desktop build with an RTX 3070. A request for a PC that could &ldquo;rival a PS5 for the same price&rdquo; gave a $1,300 result. Admittedly, that&rsquo;s about what it takes to build a gaming PC that can play at least some new games at 4K, but the chatbot missed a pretty crucial part of the instruction. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Newegg AI pc builder, $500" class="wp-image-1674285" height="307" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/newegg-builder-beta.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Newegg</p></div>



<p>I gave it a shot myself. When I asked the AI to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/tools/custom-pc-builder/pl/ID-343&amp;xcust=2-1-1674148-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">build the &ldquo;best gaming PC for $500,&rdquo;</a> it gave me two bundles as a result. One was $602, and the other was $984. Seems like the near-infinite combinations of parts on Newegg could have hit a little closer to the mark. I decided to go more specific. When I asked for a &ldquo;mini itx build for fortnite under $1000,&rdquo; all three options used full-sized ATX motherboards and were over the price limit. </p>



<p>The prompt &ldquo;cheapest sff pc for web browsing&rdquo; recommended I buy a brand new Intel Core i5-13600K processor, an AsRock ATX Z790 motherboard, an RTX 3060 GPU (why is it even telling me to buy a discrete GPU?), 32GB of RAM, a CPU cooler with a 140mm fan, a full ATX Corsair 4000D case, and an 850-watt full modular power supply. The only remotely reasonable part in there is a 1TB M.2 SSD for fifty bucks. The full build, which is anything but &ldquo;small,&rdquo; costs $1351.27. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Newegg AI pc builder beta " class="wp-image-1674280" height="977" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/newgg-builder-beta.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="764" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Newegg</p></div>



<p>Oh, and the RAM is DDR4, while the motherboard uses DDR5 DIMM slots. So this build doesn&rsquo;t work, which is something the tool recognizes: there&rsquo;s a little badge that says &ldquo;Individual components do not match.&rdquo; Robot, if you <em>know </em>the parts don&rsquo;t work together, and you have hundreds of alternative options that do, why aren&rsquo;t you offering me any of those? </p>



<p>So yeah, even putting aside Newegg&rsquo;s vested interest in selling you expensive PC parts, the AI-powered suggestions seem to be flat-out broken. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an AI just starting out,&rdquo; the tool says apologetically, &ldquo;so results may vary.&rdquo; Tech writers and YouTube PC builders can breathe a sigh of relief for the moment. </p>

## Microsoft enlists AI to supercharge PC security and hinder hackers

<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1511380/ai-services-that-can-improve-your-life.html">a long list of tools</a> that AI has been applied to: AI art, AI chatbots, even AI assistants to control your home. Now, Microsoft is adding AI security to the list, too, with its new Security Copilot feature.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever managed (or, likelier, probably haven&rsquo;t) your own security on your PC, you&rsquo;re probably aware of little more than making sure your antivirus is up to date. If your PC is hacked, though, it&rsquo;s an entirely different story. Suddenly, you&rsquo;re thrust into an unfamiliar world which requires several stressful, immediate decisions that you have to make correctly.</p>



<p>In such a situation, it would be extremely helpful to have someone or something to walk you through what happened, what to do, and how to prevent it from happening again to you or someone else. Security Copilot is the tool that Microsoft is making available for the job, using OpenAI&rsquo;s new GPT-4 chat interface to help enterprise IT workers navigate through the maze of potential responses.</p>



<p>Yes, enterprise IT workers. For now, Microsoft is only making its Security Copilot available to its enterprise customers. But we can certainly hope that Microsoft may release something similar for consumers, too. Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>



<p>First, this isn&rsquo;t the same large language model (LLM) that drives consumer applications like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html">Bing Chat</a>. Microsoft developed Security Copilot with a security-specific model, tuned with the knowledge and terminology that security professionals use. Microsoft also has already connected it to its own security products &mdash; and eventually, Microsoft says, Security Copilot will be able to integrate with third-party security solutions as well. </p>



<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s up to date &mdash; while most consumer implementations of GPT-4 (Bing Chat and ChatGPT, among a few others) only &ldquo;know&rdquo; facts up to 2021, Microsoft says Security Copilot is constantly being fed with the 65 trillion threat signals that Microsoft sees every day. Microsoft said in a blog post that it has a &ldquo;growing list of unique skills and prompts&rdquo; that security teams can take advantage of.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Security Copilot" class="wp-image-1674275" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Threat-Hunting-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Microsoft Security Copilot shows how the tool could be used to help react to a potential attack. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Microsoft says that the advantage of using Security Copilot is that its language model can be used to detect otherwise imperceptible signals that an attack is taking place, and is constantly learning to improve those skills. The company showed off how Security Copilot could be used as an assistant to identify problems and mitigate them.</p>



<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s familiar with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">ChatGPT</a>, Bing Chat, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504572/google-announces-bard-ai.html">Google&rsquo;s Bard</a>, or other AI chatbots understands, however, that AI sometimes &ldquo;hallucinates&rdquo; facts that may not be true &mdash; not a critical issue when a user correctly understands that Abraham Lincoln was not voted out of office in 2000, say. But it&rsquo;s much more of a concern when a security professional isn&rsquo;t quite sure that a department or user or email may have suspicious activity attached to their email or shared files. </p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s response isn&rsquo;t entirely convincing. &ldquo;Security Copilot doesn&rsquo;t always get everything right,&rdquo; Microsoft said. &ldquo;AI-generated content can contain mistakes. But Security Copilot is a closed-loop learning system, which means it&rsquo;s continually learning from users and giving them the opportunity to give explicit feedback with the feedback feature that is built directly into the tool. As we continue to learn from these interactions, we are adjusting its responses to create more coherent, relevant and useful answers.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Security Copilot" class="wp-image-1674276" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Incident-Response-3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Security Copilot" class="wp-image-1674277" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IR-Reporting-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Of course, Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t address what could happen in a world of AI versus AI, where AI-assisted attackers tailor AI-designed phishing emails and other attacks on both consumers and businesses alike. That &ldquo;smart war&rdquo; would hopefully take place behind the scenes.</p>



<p>What this implies, however, is that enterprises may potentially test Security Copilot on a small segment of its users. That&rsquo;s not necessarily bad news, for them or for you. If AI really becomes the tool Microsoft wants it to be, consumers and businesses alike are going to have to trust it knows what it&rsquo;s talking about, and can do the job of a human. If the world&rsquo;s top businesses eventually trust Security Copilot, that may assure you that AI can help secure your PC, too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but I really like uniquely designed peripherals that turn heads. So, if you&rsquo;re in the market for a new gaming mouse, I&rsquo;ve found a reasonably priced one that&rsquo;s drop-dead gorgeous. Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BGS8PG3K?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1674080-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">DIERYA X TMKB wired gaming mouse for just $14.99</a>, which is 50 percent off of the original $29.99 price. The ceramic white color scheme nicely compliments the rainbow RGB lighting and honeycomb structure. It&rsquo;s definitely a looker, but what about the specs and features? Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>



<p>The DIERYA mouse has six programmable buttons, a maximum DPI of 12,800, and an adjustable light band that encircles the peripheral&rsquo;s bottom half. Given the maximum DPI, this mouse should be ultra-responsive in games. However, you may want to scale back the DPI to a more reasonable number, especially if you&rsquo;re not accustomed to using a gaming mouse. This peripheral also weighs just 75 grams thanks to the honeycomb structure. There&rsquo;s even a flexible braided cable, which allows for more movement. </p>



<p>This is a fantastic deal, especially if you&rsquo;re hunting for a good-looking mouse with quite a number of features.</p>

## The future of streaming is here: YouTube gets AV1 broadcasts

<p>Live streams will start looking a whole lot nicer soon. YouTube has begun rolling out support for an updated streaming protocol, which when paired with the upcoming OBS Studio 29.1 update, will allow users to broadcast <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/827992/tested-intel-arc-av1-video-encoder-vs-nvidia-amd.html">AV1 video, a.k.a. the future of GPU streaming</a>.</p>



<p>The improvement is so substantial that users can stream great-looking 4K 60FPS video at just 6 megabits per second &ndash; a bitrate that historically been deemed &ldquo;not enough&rdquo; to produce high-quality 1080p streams in H.264 over on Twitch.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-av1">What is AV1?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Halo Infinite stream" class="wp-image-1674230" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1-15.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>At just 10mbps, an AV1 YouTube stream at 4K 60FPS looks far superior to most 1080p 60FPS Twitch streams at 6mbps.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor / IDG</p></div>



<p>AV1 is a new, open source video codec that aims to dethrone H.264 as the primary video standard after its nearly 20 year-long reign. AV1 is developed by the<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://aomedia.org/membership/members/&amp;xcust=2-1-1674202-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"> </a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://aomedia.org/membership/members/&amp;xcust=2-1-1674202-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Alliance for Open Media</a> &ndash; a consortium backed by lots of major tech corporations adjacent to streaming and video, including the likes of Google, Netflix, Arm, Apple, Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, and Nvidia.</p>



<p>The AV1 encoder has been very tough to run at high speeds when running in software on your CPU, but the past couple years have seen huge improvements to the efficiency of the available encoders. Over the past 9 months we&rsquo;ve gotten graphics cards from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">AMD</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html">Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia</a> that have hardware AV1 encoding built-in, allowing users to encode AV1 video in real-time with minimal performance penalty.</p>



<h2>Enhanced RTMP</h2>



<p>For the first time in 10 years, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol">RTMP streaming protocol spec</a> has received an update, dubbed<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp&amp;xcust=2-1-1674202-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"> </a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp&amp;xcust=2-1-1674202-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;Enhanced RTMP.&rdquo;</a> The highlight from this update is support for more video codecs: HEVC/H.265, VP9, and AV1. YouTube supports RTMP.</p>



<p>HEVC was already supported by YouTube using the HLS protocol &ndash; but that protocol didn&rsquo;t always play nicely with some internet connections and typically brought higher latency to getting streams to viewers. Enhanced RTMP seems (in my testing) to carry the same latency that normal RTMP streaming had.</p>



<h2>OBS 29.1</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="YouTube RTMPS in OBS 29.1" class="wp-image-1674228" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2-15.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>In the upcoming <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio 29.1 update</a>, users will be able to use these codecs by selecting &ldquo;YouTube &ndash; RTMPS&rdquo; in Stream settings. Then any available HEVC and AV1 encoders will be made available, including the SVT and AOM CPU-based AV1 encoders.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AV1 in obs 29.1 update" class="wp-image-1674231" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>At the time of testing, only Nvidia and Intel hardware AV1 encoders are supported, but AMD support will be coming shortly.</p>



<p>Graphics cards that support AV1 encoding:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series</a></li><li><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html">AMD Radeon RX 7000 series</a></li><li><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1341464/intel-arc-a770-a750-graphics-card-xe-hpg-review.html">Intel Arc Alchemist</a></li></ul>



<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Nvidia GeForce RTX 3000 and AMD Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards support AV1 <em>decoding</em> for playback, but do not support encoding on hardware.</p>

<p>Users of graphics cards going back to even Nvidia&rsquo;s older GTX 10-series (GTX 1050 ti and higher) will be able to stream HEVC with this update, however, bringing higher quality streams to older GPUs too!</p>



<h2>Lower bitrates</h2>



<p>In my testing over the course of multiple multi-hour streams, you can achieve high quality, clear video with far lower bitrates than ever before.</p>



<p>Streaming 1440p 60FPS can look great with just 4-8mbps. 4K 60FPS can look great with just 10-20mbps. This is truly game-changing&mdash;both for people with limited upload bandwidth and those with not much hard drive space for recording capacities.</p>



<p>Currently, AV1 streams to YouTube are not delivered to viewers in AV1. As YouTube always transcodes the videos and streams it ingests (compared to Twitch, where the default is &ldquo;Source Quality&rdquo; untouched by compression), streams at higher than 1080p resolution (1440p and 4K) will be delivered to viewers in VP9, and 1080p and lower streams will be delivered in either AVC (H.264) or VP9, depending on viewership. This doesn&rsquo;t significantly impact quality more than expected, and VP9 does a great job at preserving image integrity over blocking and artifacts.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="500kbps av1 stream YouTube" class="wp-image-1674229" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/4-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>This isn&rsquo;t a great-looking stream, but it&rsquo;s quite familiar to those who browse random Twitch streams. But this isn&rsquo;t the typical 3.5-4mbps Twitch stream, this is 1440p60 at a mere 500kbps streamed to YouTube!</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Taylor/IDG</p></div>



<p>In my testing, I did notice that the various AV1 encoders did struggle to stick to their exact-specified CBR targets I entered in OBS &ndash; but it wasn&rsquo;t a huge issue, and the overall gained headroom makes up for it.</p>



<p>I even tested as low as 500kbps for 1440p60 and while it was obviously a pixelated mess, my viewers determined it was still surprisingly watchable compared to a lot of current 1080p Twitch streams.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2><a></a>The Future of Streaming</h2>



<p>This is a huge win for YouTube and immediately starts allowing creators to save on bandwidth and gain quality within their live streams. As hardware continues to improve AV1 performance, more and more streamers will start using this feature.</p>



<p>But some questions about the future of AV1 implementations still remain.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AV1 AOM consortium" class="wp-image-1674227" height="438" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/5-5.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alliance for Open Media</p></div>



<p>First I have to wonder, when will Apple start supporting AV1? Apple is an early AOM member, having joined in 2018, but they&rsquo;ve never once listed AV1 decode support within their hardware specs&mdash;even when plenty of game consoles, smart TVs, and other Android devices have implemented multiple generations of support. Knowing Apple, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they are waiting on the &ldquo;right moment&rdquo; to announce that the current generation (be it M2 or iPhone 14 or 15, whatever is the latest generation at the time) of hardware has had AV1 support this whole time and they&rsquo;re just now turning it on&mdash;probably announced at WWDC or another similar event. But thus far, they&rsquo;ve been silent on the topic.</p>



<p>Speaking of silence, there&rsquo;s also the question of Twitch. The streaming giant has been pretty quiet about their<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=131163&amp;xcust=2-1-1674202-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"> </a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=131163&amp;xcust=2-1-1674202-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">original AV1 Roadmap</a> since their Principle Video Engineer Yueshi Shen left for TikTok in 2021. I hope AV1 is still on track for Twitch, especially since an updated RTMP spec <strong><em>should</em></strong> be easier to implement than a whole new protocol. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing at this time. Adding to the discomfort, Video Encoding and Playback Software Engineer &ldquo;M3U8&rdquo; suggests Twitch has a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of work ahead of them to implement this update:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Probably a very long time. They need to implement the ingest spec into their custom RTMP server, update the player, change the delivery format to fmp4 (or cmaf) and update the transmuxing pipeline.</p>&mdash; M3U8 (@m3u8) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/m3u8/status/1640469050118795265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1674202-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">March 27, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Should Twitch nail AV1 support sometime soon, they may have an advantage over YouTube for visual streaming quality for the first time. Since Twitch defaults to &ldquo;Source&rdquo; quality &ndash; a stream that isn&rsquo;t compressed between streamer and viewer &ndash; the advantages of low-bitrate AV1 streaming will be much more apparent to the viewer than the same stream transcoded by YouTube&rsquo;s VP9 encoders.</p>



<p>Only time will tell, but competition is ramping up. Enjoy those drool-worthy YouTube AV1 streams!</p>

## Sorry, folksâ€”2FA shouldnâ€™t be treated as optional anymore

<p>In an ideal world, no one would need two-factor authentication. A good, strong password would be enough to keep hackers at bay.</p>



<p>But this life is imperfect, and humans are fallible creatures. We reuse passwords, or rely on ones that are easily guessed or cracked. We share passwords. We accidentally fall for phishing scams during moments of stress and fatigue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even when you have a password manager full of entries with long, strong, and unique passwords, other people&rsquo;s mistakes can trip you up. As the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526524/the-latest-lastpass-fail-came-from-an-employees-home-pc.html">LastPass debacle keeps proving</a>, you can do everything right and still be made painfully vulnerable to security threats.</p>



<p>You need a second line of defense, and that&rsquo;s two-factor authentication (2FA). It erects another barrier for malicious actors to have to overcome before they can gain unrestricted access to an account.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re not already familiar with 2FA, it&rsquo;s a form of multi-factor authentication. You use two different ways to verify identity. Passwords serve as &ldquo;something you know,&rdquo; and then you pick a second method that qualifies as &ldquo;something you have&rdquo; or &ldquo;something inherent to you&rdquo;:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Hardware tokens:</strong> You plug a dongle like a Yubikey into your PC and press a button on the device when prompted. (NFC-enabled dongles let you authenticate via a tap against your phone or NFC reader.) These are an extremely strong form of 2FA, since they require you to physically possess the token.</li><li><strong>Software tokens: </strong>You input a numeric code generated by an app (e.g., <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://authy.com/download/&amp;xcust=2-1-1672985-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Authy</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beemdevelopment.aegis&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;xcust=2-1-1672985-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Aegis</a>, or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app&amp;xcust=2-1-1672985-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Authenticator</a>) as your second authentication factor.</li><li><strong>Push notifications:</strong> A prompt is sent to your phone or other authorized device, asking you to confirm that the login attempt is valid.</li><li><strong>Text (SMS) messages:</strong> Similar to software tokens, a numeric code is texted to you for input into the login form.</li><li><strong>Biometric data: </strong>You use facial recognition, a fingerprint, or other physical feature as a method of verification.</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Yubikey" class="wp-image-1376020" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/yubikey.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>If you choose a hardware token as your second factor, be sure to have backups ready (either another key or alternate 2FA method) in case you lose your primary token.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;ve likely already used some of these methods on your phone before, and may be familiar with them. For everything else, you can read <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1376010/how-to-use-two-factor-authentication-to-lock-down-your-accounts-the-right-way.html">our primer on setting up 2FA on your accounts</a>. The important part here is applying this second layer of protection to <em>all </em>your accounts.</p>



<p>Yes, I know that no 2FA method is bulletproof (though hardware keys are the closest we&rsquo;ll get). You can accidentally lock yourself out of an account with software tokens; click &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when you mean &ldquo;No&rdquo; for push notifications; see your cell phone account hijacked because someone wants your 2FA codes that badly; or discover someone unlocked your phone with your finger while you were sleeping. You should still use something, though, because having two locks on your door (so to speak) slows down someone from getting into your stuff.</p>

<p>As we all learned recently, a password manager isn&rsquo;t impenetrable. Should it be? Yes. Can you pick one that has a reputation of keeping things locked up tight? Absolutely (and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">our recommendations for the best password managers</a> has an eye to that). But inevitably, someone always has a bad day, whether that&rsquo;s you or someone else, and a second line of defense can save you a lot of headache whenever that happens next.</p>

## Steam will stop working on Windows 7 and 8 next year

<p>Despite releasing more than 13 years ago, Windows 7 is still remembered more fondly than the operating systems that came both before and after it &mdash; that&rsquo;s probably why one in twenty Windows machines is still running it. But if you&rsquo;re a PC gamer, it might finally be time to let go. According to a new support page, PC game market juggernaut Steam will stop supporting the operating system on January 1st, 2024. Oh, and the same goes for Windows 8, not that anybody cares. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A&amp;xcust=2-3-1674070-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to the support page</a>, the culprit is actually Chrome. Steam uses an embedded version of Google&rsquo;s Chrome browser to serve up store pages and other content, and that specific feature of the browser is no longer actively updated. The page says that upcoming Steam releases will rely on Windows security updates that are only available in Windows 10 and 11. You can hardly blame Valve <em>or </em>Google: Microsoft officially ended support for Windows 7 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398648/windows-7-is-dead-how-to-stay-as-safe-as-possible-after-the-security-updates-stop.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">more than two years ago</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448683/windows-8-1-support-ends-january-10-secure-your-pc.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the last version of Windows 8</a> followed a few months ago. </p>



<p>Once the deadline hits, you&rsquo;ll have to upgrade Windows to continue playing your games. Here&rsquo;s the info verbatim from Valve:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&ldquo;As of January 1 2024, Steam will officially stop supporting the Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 operating systems. After that date, the Steam Client will no longer run on those versions of Windows. In order to continue running Steam and any games or other products purchased through Steam, users will need to update to a more recent version of Windows.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>



<p>Fortunately the cloud-based nature of Steam, and its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406687/how-to-back-up-your-steam-games.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">built-in tools for migrating downloaded games</a>, should make it relatively painless to move over to a new operating system or an entirely new Windows PC. </p>

<p>Lenovo recently announced the latest versions of its Slim Pro and Yoga laptops, both of which are designed with on-the-go content creators in mind. While the lineup is no doubt impressive, given the inclusion of the latest 13th-gen Intel Core processors, there are two laptops that really stand out from the rest. </p>



<p>The Slim Pro 9i, the manufacturer&rsquo;s flagship laptop, features a PureSight Pro display with a maximum brightness level of 1,200 nits. Visuals should be nice and vibrant, which is ideal for video and photo editors. The convertible Yoga 7i, the other laptop that caught my eye, has the latest hardware upgrades as well as a stunning display.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Looking for more 2-in-1 options? Check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917881/best-2-in-1-laptops.html">best 2-in-1 laptops</a> available today.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="lenovo-slim-pro-9i">Lenovo Slim Pro 9i</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro 9i" class="wp-image-1673018" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-23.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Lenovo</p></div>



<p>From the teal-colored chassis to the powerful parts inside, the new Lenovo Slim Pro 9i is just plain stunning. The top-tier configuration has an Intel Core i9-13905H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 64GB of RAM, and 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. In other words, it has enough oomph for resource-heavy tasks like video or photo editing as well as some gaming. The LCD version of the 14-inch display has a resolution of 3072&times;1920 and a refresh rate of 120Hz. The mini-LED version has the same resolution, but with a bumped-up refresh rate of 165Hz and a maximum brightness level of 1,200 nits. Visuals should be both crisp and vibrant, which is perfect for gamers and video editors.</p>



<p>The Slim Pro 9 is expected to launch in May 2023. The 14-inch model will have a starting price of $1,699.99 and the 16-inch version will have a starting price of $1,799.99. </p>



<h2 id="lenovo-yoga-7i">Lenovo Yoga 7i</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Lenovo Yoga 7i" class="wp-image-1673019" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lenovo-Yoga-7i.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Lenovo</p></div>



<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s Yoga line of laptops are portable, versatile, and sleek as hell. The latest Yoga 7i takes much of the same design cues as previous iterations. However, that&rsquo;s not a bad thing at all. Available in either arctic grey or storm grey, the convertible laptop is both chic and sophisticated, making it the perfect machine for professional environments. It also weighs about 3.28 pounds, which is light enough for travel. The newest version also comes with the latest 13th-gen Intel Core or AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors, which is a solid boost in performance. It&rsquo;s the type of laptop that can easily handle photo editing and streaming music. </p>



<p>The top configuration features a 13th-gen Intel Core i5 processor, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. The 14-inch touch OLED display has a resolution of 2880&times;1800, a refresh rate of 90Hz, a maximum brightness level of 400 nits, and an aspect ratio of 16:10. According to those figures, this display should deliver a sharp, vivid picture. The 16:10 aspect ratio is the perfect size for scrolling through multiple documents, too. It&rsquo;s also a 2-in-1 device, which means you can flip the screen around 360 degrees and use it like a tablet.</p>

## HP reveals 9 budget-friendly Omen gaming monitors

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>HP is all-in on its Omen gaming brand, at least if you&rsquo;re looking for a new display. The company announced no fewer than nine new models, from a meager 24-inch 1080p display all the way up to a feature-packed 34-inch ultrawide. Prices range from just $200 up to a surprisingly reasonable $580, and all are planned to release sometime this spring. </p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s take it from the bottom. The Omen 24 and 27 are the entry-level gaming displays, packing the standard 1080p resolution, flat panels, 165Hz refresh rates, and 1ms response times. Color accuracy isn&rsquo;t the greatest, but they use a speedy IPS panel, so that&rsquo;s more than you&rsquo;d get from the cheaper VA designs. Double HDMI 2.0 and HisplayPort 1.41 cover the inputs&mdash;no USB extras. The 24-inch version will go for $200 while the 27-inch version is $250. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Omen 27qs" class="wp-image-1672856" height="1020" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/OMEN-27qs-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">HP</p></div>



<p>The Omen 27q keeps the lower 165Hz refresh rate but brings the resolution up to 2560&times;1440, really taking advantage of the extra screen real estate. The Omen 27s has the same 1080p resolution as the cheaper displays, but bumps the speed up a notch and adds RGB rear lighting. It&rsquo;s using a 240Hz panel that&rsquo;s hard to find in an IPS-based display, especially one that preserves the usual 400 nits of brightness. You also get a couple of USB-A ports for accessories. And if you want the best of both worlds, The Omen 27qs has the full 1440p resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, RGB lighting, and USB extras. The Omen 27q, 27s, and 27qs will be $300, $350, and $429, respectively. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Omen 27k gaming monitor" class="wp-image-1672852" height="937" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/OMEN-27k-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">HP</p></div>



<p>Now we&rsquo;re stepping into the big leagues, in terms of specs if not the screens themselves. The Omen 27k is a full 4K display (3840&times;2160) with a still-respectable 144Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time on its IPS panel. It also gets a lot of extra bells and whistles, including HDMI 2.1 support, a USB-C port, two USB-A ports, and an integrated KBM switch. The screen is rated for 120fps support for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, and the cherry on top is rear-facing RGB lighting. If you want all these goodies, you&rsquo;ll need to pay up: The Omen 27k will cost $580 upon release. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Omen 32 inch gaming monitors" class="wp-image-1672849" height="589" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/OMEN-32c-3a.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">HP</p></div>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for big screen real-estate on a budget, the Omen 32c might fit the bill. Its 1500R curved panel is a step down in quality to VA, but it has a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and 1440p resolution, making it a formidable and plus-sized gaming display for only $380. The Omen 32q drops the curve, but upgrades the monitor to a more color-accurate IPS panel. It&rsquo;ll cost an even $400 at retail. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Omen 34c gaming monitor" class="wp-image-1672845" height="1020" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/OMEN-34c-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">HP</p></div>



<p><br /><br />Finally, the Daddy Bear of the bunch is the Omen 34c, a 21:9 ultrawide with the semi-standard 3440&times;1440 resolution. It&rsquo;s packing a curved VA panel with the familiar 165Hz/1ms specs, and to be honest, very little else. But if you want an ultrawide at full resolution on the cheap, it&rsquo;s hard to find one from a major brand that can undercut the $480 price tag. </p>

<p>HP recently unveiled new Omen and Victus gaming laptops at the Amplify Partner conference in Chicago and they&rsquo;re so beautiful, they&rsquo;re like works of art. The ceramic white color scheme isn&rsquo;t anything new or groundbreaking as far as laptops go, but it&rsquo;s chic as hell and the elevated design is a welcome departure from the usual gaming aesthetic of a jet black chassis and glaring crimson red accents. Personally, I&rsquo;m a big fan of the little details like the silver V on the back of the Victus machine. However, at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s under the hood that really matters and these two laptops are rocking some seriously powerful hardware.</p>

<h2 id="hp-omen-transcend-16">HP Omen Transcend 16</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="OMEN Transcend 16 laptop" class="wp-image-1672531" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-15-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">HP</p></div>



<p>The HP Omen Trascend 16 laptop was designed with both gaming and content creation in mind. The machine comes with an Intel Core i9-13900HX CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. Given those specs, this rig should be able to handle intensive FPS-style games as well as video or photo editing. However, I&rsquo;m a little surprised that HP went with the RTX 4070 and not the brand-new RTX 4090. That said, it&rsquo;s still a powerful rig. The 13-inch display is pretty darn impressive, too.</p>



<p>The display has a resolution of 2560&times;1600, a refresh rate of 240Hz, an aspect ratio of 16:10, and a response time of 7ms. The 240Hz refresh rate is super fast, so you can probably expect smooth, responsive gameplay. The 16:10 aspect ratio is also the perfect size for scrolling through documents. The new square vent design allows for more air intake, which helps cool things down when your laptop is working overtime. Other features include a 1080p webcam, a full-sized RGB backlit keyboard, and one month of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?&amp;ef_id=CjwKCAjw_YShBhAiEiwAMomsEENHkIUqsrO8sFclzfVoCNrm_ST0fPgdsb58WRG-DNjxvmHnxwwCyBoCPFcQAvD_BwE:G:s&amp;OCID=AIDcmmiixzwwab_SEM_CjwKCAjw_YShBhAiEiwAMomsEENHkIUqsrO8sFclzfVoCNrm_ST0fPgdsb58WRG-DNjxvmHnxwwCyBoCPFcQAvD_BwE:G:s&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_YShBhAiEiwAMomsEENHkIUqsrO8sFclzfVoCNrm_ST0fPgdsb58WRG-DNjxvmHnxwwCyBoCPFcQAvD_BwE&amp;xcust=2-2-1672516-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>. </p>



<p>The Omen Transcend 16 will launch this spring with a starting price of $1,669.99. </p>



<h2 id="hp-victus-16">HP Victus 16</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="HP Victus" class="wp-image-1672558" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-15-13.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">HP</p></div>



<p>HP&rsquo;s Victus line largely appeals to budget gamers. That said, the new HP Victus 16 definitely looks more expensive than it really is. It will be available in eye-catching color options such as mica silver, performance blue, and ceramic white. It&rsquo;s more than just a pretty face, though. This rig comes equipped with up to an Intel Core i7-13700HX or AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS CPU. The graphics options go up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, as well. That&rsquo;s a good amount of power right there, so it should be able to handle anything from schoolwork to gaming. </p>



<p>The Victus now comes with the Omen Tempest Cooling solution plus an IR thermopile sensor. The Omen Tempest Cooling solution means it will have three-sided venting and five-way airflow, according to the manufacturer. The sensor also manages inside temperatures, which should help keep the laptop nice and cool. If you&rsquo;re a gamer, you&rsquo;ve probably dealt with a blazing-hot laptop at some point in your life (I know I have), especially if you&rsquo;re playing an action-packed title. </p>



<p>The Victus 16 will be available to purchase this spring with a modest starting price of $1,049.99.</p>

## Havit KB487L keyboard review: PBT keycaps on the cheap

<p>Mechanical keyboards are great. But they&rsquo;re also pricey, at least most of the time. The average retail price of the last five keyboards I reviewed is 200 freakin&rsquo; dollars, which would elicit justified scoffs from anyone who&rsquo;s never heard the phrase &ldquo;N-key rollover.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I purchased the Havit KB487L, the cheapest board I could find on Amazon from a brand I actually recognized, for just under 40 bucks. I wanted to see if I could find a keyboard that anyone on a budget would appreciate, and without having to sacrifice too much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I found it! Sort of. The Havit board is technically sound, with solid construction and a few surprising goodies, like real PBT keycaps. But it makes a few layout decisions that are just baffling. If you can live with a few of its quirks&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t actually need the 10-key area it provides&mdash;it&rsquo;s a good budget option.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="havit-kb487l-design">Havit KB487L: Design</h2>



<p>At first glance, this looks like any other tenkeyless (TKL) board, with a color scheme that&rsquo;s a bit retro and inspired by the popular Carbon keycap set. But look a little closer at the right side of the board, and you&rsquo;ll spot a strange inclusion. This design crams a 10-key area into just three columns of keys. It&rsquo;s sort of like a &ldquo;1800&rdquo; layout, as seen on keyboards like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823922/keychron-q5-mechanical-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Keychron&rsquo;s Q5</a>, but even more compacted.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Havit mechanical keyboard PBT keycaps" class="wp-image-1666822" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC00140.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>We&rsquo;ll get to that odd layout later (because there&rsquo;s a lot to say about it). The other distinctive feature of the Havit board is the inclusion of PBT keycaps. PBT stands for polybutylene terephthalate, a more premium type of plastic than you usually get on budget keyboards. For example, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPRSWPZ/&amp;xcust=2-1-1666820-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Razer asks 30 bucks</a>&mdash;most of the cost of this entire board!&mdash;just to upgrade from basic ABS keycaps to PBT. These are also doubleshot, which means that the legends are separate pieces of plastic and will never wear out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other than the unique layout and the surprising inclusion of high-end keycaps, this is your basic budget mechanical board. The only choices are Red linear switches, from a company called Jixian that I&rsquo;ve never heard of. All parts are plastic, including the PCB deck, and the braided cable is fixed in place. The plastic case includes feet with just one alternate typing angle.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Havit KB487L is an undeniably good value. It would be so even without the upgraded keycaps, but with them it&rsquo;s absolutely fantastic if you&rsquo;re on a shoestring budget.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Havit mechanical keyboard from the side" class="wp-image-1666823" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC00034.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>The keyboard technically includes backlighting, but only for the 10-key area, Num Lock, and Caps Lock keys. This will come into play when you&rsquo;re using (or disabling) Num Lock. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a simple, effective design. Those premium, high-profile keycaps give it a slightly retro look, with a color scheme that&rsquo;s unique, if not entirely original. If you want a keyboard that stands out without spending any extra money, this will do.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="havit-kb487l-typing-experience">Havit KB487L: Typing experience</h2>



<p>One of the more subjective advantages of PBT keycaps is a better, &ldquo;rougher&rdquo; texture to typing. These keycaps do get a bit of that, though they&rsquo;re more smooth and slippery than some premium sets. With a super-tall profile&mdash;shaped like Cherry or OEM, but almost as tall as SA&mdash;typing on these linear switches with long key travel feels kind of old-fashioned, like a keyboard you&rsquo;d get with a Dell desktop in 1995.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Havit mechanical keyboard with exposed switches" class="wp-image-1666824" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC00079.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>It is, for want of a more definitive word, nice. You&rsquo;re not going to get the same &ldquo;clonk&rdquo; or springiness you&rsquo;d feel from a more premium typing-focused board, or the smoothness and relative quiet you&rsquo;d find from a gaming board. But even though it has rather cheap stabilizers and a lot of &ldquo;ping&rdquo; in its body, it achieves the satisfying typing that first-timers and budget buyers are probably looking for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PBT keycaps help make up for a lack of other goodies. There are not hot-swap switches, no RGB lighting, no programming options. And at this price point, that&rsquo;s fine&hellip;though I would have appreciated a non-fixed&nbsp;cable just for the sake of easier routing on a desktop setup. </p>



<p>And then you start with the layout. Oof.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="havit-kb487l-layout-woes">Havit KB487L: Layout woes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Okay, so presumably the strange layout was designed with the idea of keeping a 10-key area available to the user in a much smaller size&mdash;again, reminiscent of the 1800 layout from decades ago. The problem is this: It&rsquo;s fairly clear that whoever designed and approved this layout doesn&rsquo;t actually use the 10-key area, which is so popular in accounting, data entry, and similar fields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because the 10-key is limited to just three columns, it omits the -, +, and Enter keys on the right side. And because it&rsquo;s crammed into the space of a TKL board, it <em>also</em> chops off / and * keys, and sticks the Num Lock in the Function layer, along with the Scroll Lock, Pause, and Print Screen keys. This is going to create pretty huge usability problems for anyone who&rsquo;s used to dedicated 10-key input, which immediately undermines the operational premise. (I asked several 10-key users, and they agree, they&rsquo;d rather just use <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZNVLQSR/&amp;xcust=2-1-1666820-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a separate gadget</a> than try to input data on this board.)&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Havit mechanical keyboard 10-key area" class="wp-image-1666825" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC09981.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>But here&rsquo;s the kicker. Because the superfluous 10-key is taking up the space where Detele, Page Up, and Page Down would be, it <em>also </em>has to share space with those keys. So with Num Lock disabled, all six of those keys are now in the top layer&hellip;but with the exception of Page Down, they&rsquo;ve all moved around. The Delete key in particular is two keys over and one down from where it should be, which plays hell with my muscle memory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it seems like I&rsquo;m piling on, consider the following: In the name of adding functionality, this layout messes up both the usability of a full-sized board <em>and </em>that of a TKL board. It&rsquo;s a baffling design decision that I can&rsquo;t believe was tested very much at all.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-havit-kb487l">Should you buy the Havit KB487L?</h2>



<p>The Havit KB487L is an undeniably good value. It would be so even without the upgraded keycaps, but with them it&rsquo;s absolutely fantastic if you&rsquo;re on a shoestring budget. The typing experience, while far from premium, is punching way above its price tag. Without any other frills, it&rsquo;s a great and inexpensive entry into the mechanical keyboard space.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Havit mechanical keyboard label" class="wp-image-1666846" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC00148.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>That&rsquo;s assuming you can deal with the incredibly weird and unintuitive layout, of course. Anyone interested in the 10-key area for its own sake will be turned off anyway, but those who can&rsquo;t make adjustments for less-often-used keys like Delete or Print Screen will also find it hard to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you can get over that quirk, and you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a great value, you&rsquo;ve found it.&nbsp;</p>
