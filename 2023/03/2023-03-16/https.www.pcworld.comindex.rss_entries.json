And soon you&rsquo;ll be able to use a version of it directly from within Firefox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In welcome news for all Firefox users, Mozilla announced this week that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://relay.firefox.com/&amp;xcust=2-2-1661973-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firefox Relay</a>, its version of email masking, will <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/email-protection-just-got-easier-in-firefox/&amp;xcust=2-2-1661973-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">become integrated into its browser</a>. Launched in 2020, Relay has only been accessible so far through a browser add-on. That separation has likely kept masked email and its privacy benefits from becoming more popular, despite Mozilla offering all Relay users up to five email masks for free.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people aren&rsquo;t aware they can easily block email tracking and spam via Relay, much less protect themselves in the wake of endless data breaches. With even just one email mask in use, you can shield your true address, making a hacker&rsquo;s attempts to take over that account much harder. And if you have unlimited masks and create a new one for each site and app, malicious actors can&rsquo;t easily take info from data breaches and apply it widely across the web.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Firefox Relay animated gif of using service\" class=\"wp-image-1661989\" height=\"595\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Relay5.gif\" width=\"595\" /><figcaption>This animated gif from Mozilla&rsquo;s blog post about the Firefox Relay integration demonstrates how Relay works.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mozilla</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With the coming browser integration, masked email should become far more convenient to try out, and possibly a more common habit too. Before Firefox Relay and other services like DuckDuckGo Email Protection and SimpleLogin started appearing, you could spin up a home-brew version with email aliases, but you also had to manage the whole endeavor: buying your own domain, creating each alias, and tracking each one, typically via a cumbersome, bare-bones web interface. Making unique addresses for every site and service on the internet was generally a time-consuming slog and not many people went that far. Easier access and wider awareness should help everyone maintain better privacy, and thus security, on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing email masks in action, you can sign up for Firefox Relay now. Otherwise, you can read more about <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/708303/what-is-masked-email-this-new-spin-on-an-old-practice-supercharges-your-security.html\">email masks in our primer</a> while you wait for the integration to launch.

But to celebrate the start of its <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/?snr=1_5_9__global-header&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Spring Sale</a>, the Steam Deck is getting its first-ever discount. All versions of the Steam Deck, including the $400 base model, are now 10 percent off for the duration of the sale. That means you can get one for as little as $359.10. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other two models of the Steam Deck &mdash; the 256GB and 512GB models, which use faster NVMe storage and upgraded glass on the 512GB version &mdash; also get the 10 percent discount. That brings them down to $476.10 and $584.10, respectively. All three models come with a free carrying case. The sale will continue until the end of the Steam Spring Sale on March 23rd, though delivery times might be severely delayed as Valve&rsquo;s stock runs low. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of the first-ever hardware discount for the Steam Deck, the regular Steam sale hullaballoo is worth your attention. Hundreds and hundreds of PC games are on sale for up to 90 percent off their regular prices. Here are 10 great deals we saw from the sale, in no particular order: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deep Rock Galactic</a></em>: $9.89, 67% off</li><li><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/387290/Ori_and_the_Blind_Forest_Definitive_Edition/&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ori and the Blind Forest</a></em>: $4.99, 75% off (<em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1057090/Ori_and_the_Will_of_the_Wisps/&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ori and the Will of the Wisps</a></em>, too!)</li><li><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/534380/Dying_Light_2_Stay_Human/&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dying Light 2</a></em>: $29.99, 50% off</li><li><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/582010/Monster_Hunter_World?snr=1_7_15__13&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Monster Hunter World</a></em>: $14.99, 50% off</li><li><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252330/DEATHLOOP&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Deathloop</a></em>: $19.89, 50% off </li><li><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061910/Metal_Hellsinger/&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Metal: Hellsinger</a></em>: $19.79, 34% off</li><li><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Hades</a></em>: $12.49, 50% off</li><li><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Moonlighter</a></em>: $2.99, 85% off</li><li><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em>: $29.99, 50% off</li><li><em><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Stellaris</a></em>: $9.99, 75% off</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the discounts on games and hardware, Valve is also introducing <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3675538825747583355&amp;xcust=2-1-1661882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">the ability to customize the bootup animation</a> for the Steam Deck.

That&rsquo;s about as great a compliment as I can offer to a piece of software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason is simple. In all the years I&rsquo;ve been using the low-resource-consuming program (nearly 20), it&rsquo;s never failed once at its primary task of creating images of partitions or disks. Nearly every other backup program I&rsquo;ve used has hiccupped in one way or another. In fact, I use R-Drive Image for backing up my backups and failing hard drives, where you may not get more than one shot at it. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>This review is part of our ongoing roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3201971/best-windows-backup-software.html\">best backup software</a>. Go there for information on competing products and how we tested them.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 7 introduced a friendlier interface; file and folder backup; and a partition manager that made the program significantly more versatile. If the company ever rolls in its excellent <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.r-studio.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-605046-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">R-Studio</a> recovery software, the boot disk count in my repair kit will go down to exactly&hellip; one. Now there&rsquo;s a new version that expands those capabilities even further.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"r-drive-image-whats-new\">R-Drive Image: What&rsquo;s new</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 7.1 addresses one of my main complaints about R-Drive Image in the past: its complete reliance upon its own proprietary images. While the program has never glitched for me, my preference with any backup program is to keep a couple of backups around in VHD (Virtual Hard Disk) format, which you can mount using nothing but the Windows operating system (or macOS with the help of VirtualBox or other software). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that version 7 did support the high-end Hyper-V VMDK format at the corporate level.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>In all the years I&rsquo;ve been using this low-resource-consuming program (nearly 20), R-Drive Image has never failed once at its primary task of creating images of partitions or disks.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1523637\" height=\"710\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/R-Drive-Boot-disc-type.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>R-Drive  Image now supports both Linux and Windows PE boot media.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The other major good news for Windows users is the addition of a WindowsPE boot disc. The Windows Pre-install Environment (Windows 10) may offer some Windows-only drives not available from Linux and allow booting on some systems with Secure Boot enabled in the BIOS.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s also now the option to convert partition layouts from MBR (Master Boot Record) to GPT (GUID Partition Table) and vice versa. I&rsquo;ve never had the need, but some systems boot better using one or the other. AES-XTS image encryption is now supported and you can also resize the C: (OS) partition without having to reboot afterwards. Lastly, there is a new option to check multiple images for errors with a single command.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"r-drive-image-interface\">R-Drive Image: Interface</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>R-Drive Image maintains the new interface that was introduced with version 7.0. The old version was efficient, but dated in appearance. The current GUI not only has a more modern look, the workflow should be a tad more intuitive to the average user. Below you can see the older version (upper left), as well as the new one (bottom), plus my personal favorite: the character-based interface that I use to intimidate customers looking over my shoulder. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-605433\" height=\"799\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rdrive-old-new-interface.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Clockwise from upper left: R-Drive Image&rsquo;s old Windows/Linux boot interface, the still existent character-based interface from the Linux boot disk, and the latest Windows/Linux boot GUI.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the new GUI and DOS-like interfaces are available from the Linux boot disc, however the WinPE version features the new GUI only. Alas, the new partitioning facilities are only available from the modern GUI. Honestly, I can&rsquo;t be too sore about the omission, as porting it to the older DOS-like GUI would likely be a lot of work. But, hey, R-Tools, if you&rsquo;re ever bored&hellip;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"r-drive-image-features\">R-Drive Image: Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>R-Drive Image will create full (all data), incremental (all data changed since the last image), or differential (all data changed since the original full image) images. It will also verify them, copy disk-to-disk (cloning), and mount images as virtual disks that you can browse and recover individual files and folders from. It understands Microsoft&rsquo;s FAT (16/32), NTFS, and exFAT formats; Apple&rsquo;s HFS/HFS+, and APFS; as well as the Little and Big Endian variants of UFS1/UFS2 and Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 FS (Linux), and ReFS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other file systems are supported on a byte-by-byte (all sectors are backed up&mdash;containing data or not) basis with no preview or file-level access from within the program. R-Drive Image also supports hardware RAID (as single volumes) and software RAID: Windows, Apple, and Linux mdadm. You can save your images just about anywhere and to just about any media. The program even burns CDs and DVDs on its own. Don&rsquo;t laugh&mdash;optical media is still in widespread use for corporate archiving.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"R-Drive Image 71 options\" class=\"wp-image-1523629\" height=\"738\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/R-Drive-Image-71-options.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>R-Drive Image 7.1 options</p>. </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Related features include email notifications on job completion; running programs based on the success or failure of the process; the ability to bypass file or disk errors and continue the job (great for recovering data); using Windows or its own proprietary shadow service (flushing and locking data); as well as task throttling (reduced CPU usage).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scheduling is supported, and I like that it leverages the existing Windows task scheduler. Too many vendors add their own for no particularly good reason. It&rsquo;s also nice reassurance that there&rsquo;s no ongoing telemetry (communications between the program and the company) in play. Not to be paranoid, but that&rsquo;s something you might want to consider when providing low-level access to your data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before version 7.0, R-Drive Image would back up only entire partitions or drives. Now it can create the same type of image files from groups of files or folders you select. You can&rsquo;t use these for disaster recovery, just to restore said files or folders. This allows for fast backup of your essential data and can reduce storage requirements drastically.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"R-Drive Image 71 partition manager\" class=\"wp-image-1523628\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/R-Drive-Image-71-partition-manager.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>R-Drive Image 7.1&rsquo;s partition manager</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>R-Drive Image also features a partition manager, which allows you to delete, secure wipe, create, and re-size partitions without leaving the R-Drive Image interface. As mentioned, it&rsquo;s available only from the graphic interfaces (Windows native and Linux/WinPE boot disks). Sigh. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"r-drive-image-performance\">R-Drive Image: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, R-Drive Image has been 100 percent reliable for me over the years. It can even skip bad sectors and copy what remains, though this can be an exceedingly long procedure if you have a lot of read failures. Aside from that, R-Drive Image is quite fast. Version 7.x averaged around 90MB/s reading, compressing, and writing 650GB of data to a SATA SSD in my testing, as well as to a network location. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just FYI, R-Drive Image consistently over-estimates the time a job will take initially. Sometimes by a very large amount. No doubt it&rsquo;s assuming a worst-case scenario, such as backing up non-compressible data to an old, slow hard drive. If you see an exorbitant time, click start and you&rsquo;ll likely be pleasantly surprised at the speed of the backup.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"R-Drive Image 71 complete\" class=\"wp-image-1523633\" height=\"673\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/R-Drive-Image-71-completed.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>R-Drive Image 7.1 complete<span>s its multi-partition backup task successfully. I&rsquo;ve never seen a job-failed message unless the hard drive was beyond hope.  </span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When I say R-Drive Image consumes few resources, I&rsquo;m not kidding. The minimum system requirement is only that the CPU be Intel-based. If you&rsquo;re using older hardware, R-Drive Image is by far your best bet. I wrote most of this article with a very large backup running on my 2015 iMac (running Windows via Boot Camp) and forgot it was in progress. Note that the company&rsquo;s R-Studio supports Apple Silicon, so perhaps there&rsquo;s ARM support in R-Drive Image&rsquo;s future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oddly enough, I did get my first-ever R-Drive Image error code with version 7.0 (7000 build) when selecting the modify function of the partition manager on an external, exFAT-formatted USB drive. It was non-fatal, which indicates superior error-checking, and R-Tools shipped me a fix (build 7001) almost immediately. Yes, the company is that dedicated and responsive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While R-Drive Image offers just about every option and feature you can think of for local and network use, I&rsquo;d still lobby for multiple-destinations per job and support for online storage services. Add those and I&rsquo;m thinking it gets another half star.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that I tested a pre-release version of 7.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-r-drive-image\">Should you buy R-Drive Image?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, I came close to awarding R-Drive Image 7.1 a 5-star rating. It matches the competition in ease of use and features, and is a tier up in terms of reliability and hardware/OS compatibility.

It looks <em>awesome</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella introduced its vision for the future of work as a &ldquo;symbiosis&rdquo; between human and machine. Microsoft announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, with AI embedded in Word, PowerPoint, Teams, and more. Business Chat will serve as an assistant to that. Microsoft also applied AI to its Power Platform, a little-known tool for actually writing code &mdash; something Bing and rival ChatGPT have already shown that they can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft previously launched AI as a consumer initiative, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504771/microsoft-unveils-ai-powered-bing-search-edge.html\">revealing the AI-powered Bing chatbot </a>at the beginning of February. While Bing was originally subject to a waitlist, it now appears that the waitlist has disappeared. Microsoft also placed <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1515160/microsoft-is-making-bing-chat-less-weird.html\">Bing AI conversations under strict limits</a>. After going through some growing pains with reports of weird content and worse, Microsoft migrated <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1656353/microsoft-edge-copilot-adds-ai-content-creation-to-your-browser.html\">Bing Chat to the Microsoft Edge browser sidebar with its Edge Copilot</a>, using Bing as a content-creation tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Today we are at the start of a new era of computing and another step on this journey,&rdquo; Nadella said. &ldquo;You can say that we&rsquo;ve been using AI on autopilot and now moving from autopilot to copilot,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft 365 Copilot for Word\" class=\"wp-image-1661557\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/copilot-word_print.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the point of Microsoft&rsquo;s event: To move Bing and its AI powers from a search tool to a content-creation tool. PCWorld was one of the first publications to get <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419066/microsoft-designer-is-almost-a-masterpiece-already.html\">hands-on access with Microsoft Designer</a>, which uses generative AI art in conjunction with text to create flyers and the like. Rival Canva has launched a similar product, with a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424421/ai-text-generation-is-moving-mainstream.html\">Magic Write tool </a>that can generate text for blog posts, or supply text for flyers and the like. Microsoft has also used <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/549224/microsoft-editor-now-knows-who-to-talk-to-and-what-to-share.html\">Microsoft Editor as a subtle AI tool</a> to improve your writing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI has simply exploded across the Internet, with multiple generative art sites and even generic chatbots. Actual chatbot integration, though, has been more limited. Slack is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1534320/several-bots-will-be-typing-on-chatgpt-for-slack.html\">one of the few that has integrated chatbot plans</a>, and Google lurks on the horizon, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft, though, was pretty up-front: Microsoft 365 Copilot may still be &ldquo;usefully wrong,&rdquo; so that you&rsquo;ll still need to check your work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft 365 Copilot will essentially serve as a copilot for your productivity, with Business Chat supplementing Bing Chat in the workplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company showed how Copilot will live in the taskbar at the top of apps like PowerPoint, excel, OneNote and more. You&rsquo;ll be able to interact with Copilot in the sidebar of the app, asking Copilot questions, directing it to create copy, and so on. Executives showed off how it can be used to expand text, shorten it, and add images too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Word, Copilot can create copy, managing the copy by lengthening it or changing the tone.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Microsoft 365 Copilot for Word\" class=\"wp-image-1661556\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/copilot_word_gifs_print.gif\" width=\"960\" /><figcaption>Microsoft 365 Copilot in action, helping in Word.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Copilot with Business Chat also understands what you&rsquo;re doing and what documents are relevant to you, pulling in related materials you are working on as appropriate. In PowerPoint, Copilot can be used to design slides, adding animations and images, and even create speaker notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Excel, you can ask questions of the data, creating a &ldquo;playground&rdquo; to interact it with in a new sheet, executives said. Natural language can be applied to highlight specific cells, without referring to them by name. Naturally, you can ask it to add a graph to the data, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Here's Microsoft Copilot in action: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/1o5yU4QjTn&amp;xcust=2-1-1661514-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/1o5yU4QjTn</a></p>&mdash; Mark Hachman (@markhachman) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markhachman/status/1636384540586561544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1661514-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">March 16, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In Outlook, Copilot can summarize a string of emails, and respond to them as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Teams, Copilot can even perform summarization in real time, highlighting who said what, and interacting with interactive Loop documents, according to Charles Lamanna, the corporate vice president in charge of the Power Platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lamanna also showed off how the Power Platform, specifically Power Automate, could be used to write an &ldquo;app&rdquo; that would alert you of a problem with a client, and summarize the problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the months ahead, we&rsquo;re bringing Copilot to all our productivity apps&mdash;Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, Viva, Power Platform, and more,&rdquo; according to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/&amp;xcust=2-1-1661514-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jared Spataro</a>, the corporate vice president of Microsoft 365.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-microsoft-365-business-chat\">What is Microsoft 365 Business Chat?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Business Chat &ldquo;works to apply all your data into knowledge,&rdquo; said Spataro.

Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Pro X tablet, which typically costs $1,499.99 at full price, is on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GZKXQRK?th=1?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">sale for $559.99 at Amazon</a>. That&rsquo;s a whopping 62 percent off of the original price. Not only does it weigh a measly 1.7 lbs, but it&rsquo;s also surprisingly sturdy for such a portable device. Let&rsquo;s get into the specs then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Surface Pro X features Qualcomm-powered Microsoft SQ 2 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage. You should be able to zip through most day-to-day tasks like surfing the web, responding to e-mail, and so on, though Arm-based processors sometimes hiccup with apps downloaded from somewhere other than Windows 11&rsquo;s Microsoft Store. It&rsquo;s not the most powerful machine we&rsquo;ve ever seen, but that&rsquo;s not what it was designed for, and at a whopping $940 off, that&rsquo;s an acceptable trade-off. The 13-inch PixelSense touchscreen also has a resolution of 2880&times;1920, so visuals should be nice and vibrant. The only drawback is that it doesn&rsquo;t come with a keyboard or pen. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Keyboard/dp/B07YNLYYNK?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">keyboard alone will set you back $98.99</a>, which is a real bummer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind spending extra on the accessories, and can live mostly off the web or apps found in the Microsoft Store, then the Surface Pro X is a really good deal. You won&rsquo;t find a versatile tablet this powerful and well-designed going for under $600 very often.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GZKXQRK?th=1?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Microsoft Surface Pro X tablet for $559.99</a></p>\nTablets</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661307/microsofts-lightweight-surface-pro-x-tablet-is-62-off.html", "date_published": "2023-03-16 14:58:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Intel updates power spec over melting 12VHPWR plugs, but existing PSUs are fine", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>An Intel update to the ATX power supply spec doesn&rsquo;t mean your current 12VHPWR adapter or PSU is obsolete or dangerous.

Many of the pictures of melted cables posted on Reddit and Twitter also showed melt lines indicative of a cable that had backed out or had not been inserted fully.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"12VHWPR Connections\" class=\"wp-image-1660338\" height=\"514\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Connection_Intel_Upres.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Intel is recommending PSU vendors use 4 spring connectors instead of dimple-type connectors for 12VHPWR connectors.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite installation likely being the cause of the problems, there Intel&rsquo;s update indicates room for improvement to the connector&mdash;but not enough to mandate it. The new ATX 3.01 spec, in fact, &ldquo;recommends&rdquo; the four spring connection but does not require them, which means a power supply vendor can continue to manufacture and sell units with the dimpled connectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eastman said in indication of how minor this update to the spec is, he doesn&rsquo;t think PSU vendors will bother to note it on boxes and Intel&rsquo;s own test procedures on PSUs won&rsquo;t even change for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why even bother to update the spec if the older one is fine?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eastman said publishing it as part of the spec helps &ldquo;to make sure PSU vendors know there are options&mdash;it has worked as some PSU vendors have started to explore all the options.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update for the 12VHPWR itself is part of other tweaks to the spec to clean up language and make changes such as no longer requiring that a power supply vendor put the wattage of a 12VHWPR on the cable itself. That change was made due to fully modular cables where a cable might be used in different models power supplies so labeling would be used on the PSU body rather than the cable.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-rtx-4090-uses-a-12vhpwr-connector\">\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rtx 4090 uses a 12vhpwr connector\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition\">GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nvidia-GeForce-RTX-4090-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>And despite some thinking the spec means a new connector, Eastman stresses that it is not a new connector at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This shows some options that PSU vendors can look at for options as they design PSUs with 12VHPWR connectors,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated spec also appears to bring the ATX spec in line with the PCI-SIG&rsquo;s spec change introduced in January.

New PC gaming laptops will deploy three big upgrades: new processors from Intel and AMD, new RTX 40-series graphics hardware from Nvidia, and new PCIe Gen5 solid state drives. The MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V has all three and, together, they give gaming laptops a real kick in the pants.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For more options, check out our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407493/best-gaming-laptops.html\">best gaming laptops</a>.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-specs-and-features\">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V: Specs and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Titan&rsquo;s specifications can be summed up with ease. It has the best of everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSI crams in the latest Intel Core i9 processor, top-tier Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics, 64GB of RAM, and a 2TB PCIe Gen5 solid state drive. The only obvious weak spot is the webcam which, for some reason, remains stuck at 720p (but at least includes an IR camera for biometric login)</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i9-13980HX</li><li>Memory: 64GB DDR5</li><li>Graphics/GPU: Nvidia RTX 4090</li><li>Display: 3,840 x 2,160 144Hz IPS Mini-LED</li><li>Storage: 2TB PCIe Gen5 M.2 solid state drive</li><li>Webcam: 720p with IR</li><li>Connectivity: 2x Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode, 3x USB 3.2 Type-A, 1x SDXC card reader, 1x HDMI 2.1, 1x Mini-DisplayPort, 1x RJ-45 (Ethernet)</li><li>Networking: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2</li><li>Biometrics: None</li><li>Battery capacity: 99 watt-hours</li><li>Dimensions: 15.6 x 13 x 0.9 inches</li><li>Weight: 7.3 pounds</li><li>MSRP: $5,299.99</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s one other item on this list worth considering&hellip; the price. The Titan&rsquo;s $5,299.99 MSRP will immediately take it out of contention for most people. Still, its sheer audacity holds a certain appeal&mdash;and there&rsquo;s no denying the Titan can stomp any benchmark that dares to stand in its way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-design-and-build-quality\">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V: Design and build quality</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI Titan design\" class=\"wp-image-1563264\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>binary comment</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s reasonable to expect the expensive MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V to deliver a garish, overwrought design. On the contrary, MSI keeps it simple. Perhaps <em>too</em> simple. At a glance, the Titan&rsquo;s thick, matte black body could be easily mistaken for any high-end gaming laptop produced in the last decade. A series of RGB lights dotting the rear fans adds some flair when used in a dark room, at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build quality is unremarkable. The lower chassis feels solid, but the materials cladding the laptop seem the same as those found on those sold for thousands less. Picking up the laptop from one side creates noticeable flex throughout the machine. The same is true of the display, which warps and wavers when it&rsquo;s opened. Most gaming laptops have these issues&mdash;but those hoping the Titan&rsquo;s price tag might buy a dash of luxury will be disappointed.

That&rsquo;s heavy, but not surprising. Most 17-inch laptops land between six and eight pounds. The laptop&rsquo;s weight is obvious when stowed in a bag. And you&rsquo;ll need a big bag. At 15.6 inches wide, and 13 inches deep, the Titan won&rsquo;t fit in most backpacks and messenger bags with a laptop compartment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-keyboard-and-trackpad\">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V: Keyboard and trackpad</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI Titan keyboard and trackpad\" class=\"wp-image-1562895\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>binary comment</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V has a Steelseries-branded mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX switches. It&rsquo;s an excellent typing experience, with long key travel and a crisp, taut bottoming action that provides tactile feedback. Keystrokes are audible, but not annoying, so the Titan (probably) won&rsquo;t drive everyone nearby batty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether this matters in games is debatable. Personally, I didn&rsquo;t find the Titan&rsquo;s keyboard any more responsive than most, but I&rsquo;m not on the &ldquo;path to pro.&rdquo; My love of the keyboard&mdash;and, to be clear, it&rsquo;s great&mdash;is rooted in simple day-to-day use. It&rsquo;s a great keyboard for writing or browsing the web, yet also ideal for gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard is backlit with RGB LED lighting that can be customized per-key. Backlight customization is handled through the Steelseries GG app instead of an app from MSI. This is a perk. The Steelseries GG app is rather good, with easy to understand controls and a very wide range of customization options. The app can also be used to customize keyboard functions, which is handy if you want to make your own keyboard shortcuts for gamers or productivity apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I adore the keyboard, it does have one flaw. The numpad is too small. It offers only half-sized keys crammed into the keyboard&rsquo;s right side. A laptop of this size could provide a full-sized numpad, but MSI instead uses the space for user-facing speakers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The touchpad is good, too. It&rsquo;s large, measuring five inches wide by 3.25 inches deep, and provides a smooth, responsive surface. Windows&rsquo; multitouch gestures are easy to activate, mostly thanks to the touchpad&rsquo;s large surface. Physical, clicky left and right-mouse buttons are available and work well. The touchpad also accepts mouse input by tapping its surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-display-audio\">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V: Display, audio</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI Titan display\" class=\"wp-image-1563114\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-4-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V&rsquo;s has a 4K IPS Mini-LED display with a 144Hz refresh rate. Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro 14 and Pro 16 get the credit for bringing Mini-LED to laptops in 2021, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/399339/hands-on-with-the-worlds-first-miniled-laptop-msis-creator-17.html\">MSI actually introduced the first Mini-LED laptop display back in 2020</a>. MSI has experience with the technology, and it shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brightness is extremely high even in SDR content, reaching a maximum of 585 nits. That&rsquo;s the highest brightness I have on record for any laptop in SDR. The display also delivers a wonderful contrast ratio of 19440:1. That&rsquo;s not as good as OLED (which usually reaches an effectively infinite contrast ratio when tested with my SpyderX colorimeter), but it&rsquo;s a huge step up from a typical IPS display. The MSI Sword, for example, offers a contrast ratio of 1220:1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Color gamut is also excellent, covering 100 percent of sRGB and 97 percent of DCI-P3. OLED laptops will often perform better. The Acer Predator Triton, for example, covers 100 percent of both color gamuts. The Titan&rsquo;s performance is still excellent, though, and delivers a vibrant, punchy image.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HDR is supported, and turning it on ups the ante. I measured a maximum sustained full screen brightness of 947 nits. I was pleasantly surprised to see the laptop has few problems handling SDR content when HDR is turned on in Windows 11. Colors remain fairly accurate and content still appears to have the proper luminance. HDR does shift the color temperature noticeably, however, and appears rather warm and reddish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether the Titan&rsquo;s Mini-LED display defeats OLED depends on your priorities. It&rsquo;s much better in HDR content, due to its added brightness. The display also has a non-gloss coat which, paired with the display&rsquo;s high brightness, makes the laptop easy to use in rooms where glare can be an issue. OLED displays technically deliver better color performance, however, and will still appear darker and richer when displaying dark content, especially when viewed in a dark room.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motion clarity is excellent thanks to the IPS panel&rsquo;s low response times and 144Hz refresh rates. Test images of <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>DOTA 2</em> showed character silhouettes and heath bars were easy to see while scrolling. Character names were hard to make out, though, which is typical for even the best 144Hz displays. Fast camera pans in 3D games will show plenty of detail, with only small elements obscured.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audio is delivered by a pair of 2-watt speakers and a pair of 2-watt woofers. These offer good sound quality with a clear mid-range, plenty of separation between high and lows, and some oomph to bass. I didn&rsquo;t notice any rattle, distortion, or other unwanted issues when listening to bass-heavy tracks. Maximum volume is a bit low, which may disappoint if you want the Titan to double as a boom box, but it&rsquo;s an enjoyable audio experience overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-webcam-microphone-biometrics\">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V: Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V, despite its high price, makes do with an old-school 720p webcam. It&rsquo;s not great. The image appears softy and grainy and color reproduction isn&rsquo;t accurate, with a notable shift towards green in my testing. Streamers looking for an all-in-one streaming laptop won&rsquo;t find it here. The microphone is also mundane: it sounds clear and offers good volume, but audio seems tinny and distant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the primary webcam falls short, MSI does offer an IR camera that enables Microsoft Windows Hello facial recognition login. It worked well in my testing, as it does on every laptop that supports this feature. It&rsquo;s a great alternative to logging in with a password or PIN.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-connectivity\">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V: Connectivity</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI Titan ports\" class=\"wp-image-1563261\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-1-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A healthy selection of ports line the MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V&rsquo;s flanks, but the laptop doesn&rsquo;t go above and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSI includes two <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/399348/intel-unveils-the-thunderbolt-4-spec-which-amd-believes-it-can-use.html\">Thunderbolt 4</a> / USB-C ports. Both support DisplayPort Alternate Mode, so they can be used to output video. One of the two ports also provides up to 100 watts of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/418850/usb-c-charging-universal-or-bust-we-plug-in-every-device-we-have-to-chase-the-dream.html\">USB-C power delivery</a>. That&rsquo;s not enough to handle the laptop under load, but does provide a backup option in case you forget the massive 330-watt power brick (or don&rsquo;t feel like packing it). Additional video connectivity is provided by HDMI 2.1 and Mini-DisplayPort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The laptop has three USB-A 3.2 ports, an SDXC card reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack. This is adequate but not special. The Titan&rsquo;s price sets high expectations, so I would have liked to see multiple audio jacks and another USB-A port.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSI does upgrade the RJ-45 port, to its credit, providing 2.5Gbps Ethernet speeds. Wireless connectivity is also top-notch with support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. Wi-Fi performance was excellent in my testing with a Wi-Fi 6 router, hitting maximum speeds of just over 900 Mbps even when two rooms away from my router. This is roughly the maximum speed I can access through my home&rsquo;s Gigabit Internet connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-performance\">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V has all the latest hardware. The processor is<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504711/core-i9-13980hx-tested-4-key-things-about-intels-ferocious-cpu.html\"> Intel&rsquo;s Core i9-13980HX</a> with 24 cores (eight performance cores and 16 efficient cores) and a maximum turbo frequency of 5.6GHz. That&rsquo;s joined by Nvidia&rsquo;s new RTX 4090 mobile graphics. 64GB of DDR5 memory and a 2TB PCIe Gen5 solid state drive round out this powerhouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how does it handle benchmarks? Let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI Titan PCMark\" class=\"wp-image-1563266\" height=\"769\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-pcmark10.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>MSI comes out swinging with a score of 8890 in PCMark 10, the highest PC World as recorded from a laptop. This isn&rsquo;t shocking. It&rsquo;s normal for a new generation of hardware to deliver improved performance. Still, it&rsquo;s clear the Titan lives up to its name, as it delivers strong results in all of PCMark 10&rsquo;s subcategories.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI Titan Cinebench\" class=\"wp-image-1563267\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-cinebenchr15.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Cinebench R15 delivers an even more impressive result, as the Titan races to a score of 4,971. Nothing else we&rsquo;ve recently tested comes close.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI Titan Handbrake\" class=\"wp-image-1563269\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-handbrake.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Handbrake is the odd duck here, delivering a good but not spectacular result of 904. I&rsquo;m left a bit puzzled by this, but did note that Handbrake did not appear to fully saturate the processor&rsquo;s 24 cores. The Core i9-13980HX, though impressive, does rely heavily on core count to thump its competitors, so any situation that doesn&rsquo;t tax all cores will eat into its margins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Processor benchmarks are only half the story, of course, and arguably the lesser half. The MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V also delivers Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4090 graphics with 16GB of GDDR6 memory and a maximum graphics power of 175 watts.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI Titan Time Spy\" class=\"wp-image-1563271\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-3dmark.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone curious if the new generation of RTX 4090 mobile hardware would deliver an uplift similar to its desktop peer (which, for the record, is significantly more powerful than the mobile RTX 4090) should now have their doubts squashed. The Titan&rsquo;s score of 19531 flat slaps, leaving even the RTX 3080 Ti begging for mercy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI Titan Shadow of the Tomb Raider\" class=\"wp-image-1563273\" height=\"811\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> is a bit less embarrassing for the RTX 30-series laptops, but still shows a big lead for the RTX 4090. It delivers roughly 35 additional frames-per-second, on average, at 1080p with detail settings at Highest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI Titan Metro Exodus\" class=\"wp-image-1563274\" height=\"774\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-metro-exodus.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Firing up <em>Metro Exodus</em> gives the Titan another chance to eat last year&rsquo;s cream-of-the-crop for lunch. An average score of 88 frames-per-second at 1080p and Extreme detail is frankly unprecedented. Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4090 mobile redefines high-end laptop performance in this title.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give the Titan a more worthy challenge, I popped into <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and ran the game at 4K resolution with Ultra detail settings and ray-tracing on, with ray-traced lighting set to Ultra. DLSS was turned off. The Titan averaged 41 frames-per-second, which is excellent. These settings tend to dip even the stoutest laptops under 30 FPS. Turning on DLSS 3 roughly doubles this performance to 88 frames-per-second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I find it almost hard to believe that a laptop can achieve this level of performance. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was considered a real system-thrasher upon its release in 2020 and, with ray-tracing turned on, it remains among the most technically demanding games available. Yet the Titan cruises through it, providing an enjoyable experience even at 4K and very high detail settings. This is good news for the laptop&rsquo;s potential in the future. Ray tracing is still a somewhat niche feature, but finally starting to go mainstream thanks in part to games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-battery-life\">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V: Battery life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V is a power-hungry laptop that ships with a huge 330-watt power brick that&rsquo;s difficult to pack and impractical to bust out at a coffee shop. Fortunately, the Titan also has a 99 watt-hour battery that holds up well on the road.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"MSI Titan Battery Life\" class=\"wp-image-1563276\" height=\"791\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-battery-life.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I recorded five hours and 56 minutes of endurance from the Titan in our standard battery life test, which loops a 4K clip of the short film <em>Tears of Steel</em>. That&rsquo;s a good result for a large, power-hungry gaming laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be warned. Because it&rsquo;s so powerful, the Titan can drain the battery much more quickly. 3D gaming and intense workloads, like encoding video, can drain the battery in two hours or less. Still, the Titan can handle about a bit more than a half-day of work if you stick to less demanding applications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-conclusion\">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V: Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, my practical advice: Don&rsquo;t buy the MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V. It&rsquo;s big, heavy, loud, and terribly expensive. You&rsquo;ll need a huge backpack to haul it and it barely fits on some coffee shop desks, never mind an airplane&rsquo;s seat-back tray. It&rsquo;s an impractical showpiece for people with more money than sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you still want it, don&rsquo;t you? So do I. The Titan successfully sets a new definition of high-end laptop performance that rivals many desktop computers and renders last-generation hardware irrelevant. That alone would be noteworthy, but MSI goes the extra mile with a class-leading Mini-LED display that delivers eye-searing brightness and outstanding contrast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, the Titan isn&rsquo;t a practical choice&mdash;but if you want the ultimate in performance, and have the cash, don&rsquo;t hesitate. This is the hard-charging, benchmark-obliterating laptop you crave.</p>\n\nLaptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1561127/msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-review.html", "date_published": "2023-03-16 10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Turn audio into text with this specialized transcription app", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>While going to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1447954/best-of-ces-2023-the-most-intriguing-and-innovative-pc-hardware.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">conferences</a>&nbsp;or lectures is fun, it can be difficult to derive any sustained meaning from them with so much else going on.
