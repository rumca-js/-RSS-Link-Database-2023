You may recall how she <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-iwo-jima\" target=\"_blank\">inexplicably claimed </a>the Battle of Iwo Jima was evil and refused to elaborate.

The video was taken before she was elected, and was unearthed by investigative journalist <a href=\"https://asrainvestigates.substack.com/p/full-transcript-muslim-power\" target=\"_blank\">Asra Q. Nomani. </a></p><p>Omeish made the comments at a September 2019 American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) fundraising event. She said,<em> \"I'm running for Fairfax County School Board at large.

That's just one school board in Northern Virginia. That is over half of the Fairfax County budget, OK?

These are just examples of, again, power of us needing to be involved.\" </em></em></p><p><em><em>\"We can mobilize our community to start talking about the textbooks, and talking about the teachers, and what, you know, what they're talking about in the classrooms.

The problem comes when she, or anyone really, tries to push a certain agenda onto kids in public schools. Fox News <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/controversial-school-board-member-endorsed-curriculum-removes-islamic-terror-9-11-history-lessons\" target=\"_blank\">recently found</a> that Omeish recommended teachers use a \"culturally responsive\" curriculum guide for lesson plans about 9/11 history. The plan opposed using terms like \"radical Islamic terror,\" \"Islamic terrorists\" and \"jihadists.\" </p><p>The curriculum read, in part, \"Do not frame the lessons as a chance to explore the definition of terrorism or a clash of two different societies/cultures. There is much disagreement about what terrorism means, and it\u2019s often used in a biased manner.\"</p><p>Obviously, random Muslim kids shouldn't be bullied or called \"terrorists\" for their religion. But that doesn't mean 9/11 wasn't a terrorist attack.

Instead, the doctor (whom you are literally paying for a service) completely disregards your wishes and gangs up on you. That's exactly what med school students are being taught in South Carolina. </p><p>The Twitter account @ExposeDarkDeeds recently shared a thread of videos produced by the Medical University of South Carolina. In one, a father arrives at the doctor with his ten-year-old, gender-confused male child. While filling out a registration form, the father selects \"male\" as his child's gender identity. </p><p>The doctor asks the child, \"Can you tell me, do you feel like a boy, like a girl, like both, or neither?\u201d The father then explains to the doctor that his child is a male, but has recently insisted they are actually a girl. The father and his wife allowed their child to go by the gender-neutral name \"Sam,\" but haven't \"affirmed\" him any further. Sam responds, \"Dad, I told you, I'm a girl.\" </p><p>Seems like any reasonable doctor would accept the father's wishes. But it's 2023,<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gender-affirming-seven-year-olds\" target=\"_blank\"> so of course not.</a> </p><p>The doctor instead asks Sam to clarify. Sam says, \"I'm a girl.\" The doctor then asks the 10-year-old child how long they've known they're a girl. Sam says \"a long time\". </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">None</div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ExposeDarkDeeds/status/1610858148268544001\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The training video concludes with a voiceover that explains, \"In this scenario, the registration form provided an opportunity for the parent to share his child's name, pronouns, and gender identity [...] The provider was able to update the EHR after talking to Sam, to make sure that the information about Sam's pronouns and<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jazz-jennings-themselves\" target=\"_blank\"> gender identity</a> was correct.\"</p><p>So in other words, doctors are being trained to bypass parent's wishes and listen only to the children, even about dramatically life-altering decisions. When I was a child, I literally hoped I was secretly a wizard who would get a letter from Hogwarts until my 11th birthday came and went, and I was left letterless.
