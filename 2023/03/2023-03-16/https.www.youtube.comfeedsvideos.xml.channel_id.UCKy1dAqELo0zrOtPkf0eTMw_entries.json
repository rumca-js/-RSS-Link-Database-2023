Occasionally the best-laid plans get their neck snapped like General Zod after a horrific battle that levels half of Metropolis.\u00a0Which brings us to the DCEU...\n\nWith DC\u2019s Cinematic Universe about to reset with this summer\u2019s multiversal mayhem movie, The Flash, as the DCU reins are handed to James Gunn and Peter Safran, a ton of teases, setups, and planted seeds from the past decade of DC movies are going to wind up going nowhere. The Snyderverse is officially dunzo, so let\u2019s take a look at the many storylines that are getting the shaft. Gunn\u2019s DCU means what once was will now\u2026never be.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Shazam! Yes, even the charming, comedic bubble created by the first Shazam! film has a few connections to the Snyderverse saga, and those threads are probably gonna get snipped. Everything is still supposed to shake out and straighten up when Gunn\u2019s Gods and Monsters refresh kicks in but these past few years definitely spotlight an awkward phase in the already scattershot DCEU. There was even enough of a power vacuum that Dwayne Johnson tried to capitalize on it with Black Adam, with the promise that the hierarchy of power was going to change. It didn\u2019t. The Rock\u2019s cooking, however, was not smelled - smelt? - and we\u2019d learn very soon after that movie\u2019s release that actor Henry Cavill wouldn\u2019t be a part of Gunn\u2019s vision for Superman. \n\nAnd that news, like a plummeting Kyrptonian escape pod, took Johnson\u2019s Teth-Adam down with it. You know what they say\u2026 \n\nBut what about Wonder Woman? Martian Manhunter? Mr. Mind and Dr. Sivana? Batman's Knightmare?! Let's dig into it.\n\n#IGN #Movies #DC", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxXdtbJYCEY", "date_published": "2023-03-16 16:35:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken - Official Trailer (2023) Lana Condor, Toni Collette", "description": "Sometimes the hero you are meant to be lies just beneath the surface. Check out the trailer for Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken. The upcoming animated movie stars Lana Condor, Jaboukie Young-White, Toni Collette, Jane Fonda, Annie Murphy, Colman Domingo, Sam Richardson, and Blue Chapman. \n\nThis summer, DreamWorks Animation dives into the turbulent waters of high school with a hilarious, heartfelt action comedy about a shy teenager who discovers that she\u2019s part of a legendary royal lineage of mythical sea krakens and that her destiny, in the depths of the oceans, is bigger than she ever dreamed. \n\nSweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor, To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before franchise) is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible. \n\nShe\u2019s math-tutoring her skater-boy crush (Jaboukie Young-White, Ralph Breaks the Internet), who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she\u2019s prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom (Oscar nominee Toni Collette, Knives Out), has forbade Ruby from ever getting in the water. \n\nBut when she breaks her mom\u2019s #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother (Academy Award winner Jane Fonda), the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas. \n\nThe Kraken are sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There\u2019s one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school\u2019s beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Emmy winner Annie Murphy, Schitt\u2019s Creek) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most. \n\nRuby Gillman, Teenage Kraken stars an extraordinary cast that includes Emmy winner Colman Domingo (Fear the Walking Dead) as Ruby\u2019s supportive dad, Emmy nominee Sam Richardson (Veep) as Ruby\u2019s enthusiastic uncle and Blue Chapman (Council of Dads) as Ruby\u2019s cool little brother. \n\nDirected by Academy Award nominated filmmaker Kirk DeMicco (Vivo, The Croods) and produced by Kelly Cooney Cilella (Trolls World Tour, Trolls), with Faryn Pearl (The Croods: A New Age, Trolls World Tour) serving as co-director, the film features a comedic powerhouse supporting cast, including Emmy nominee Will Forte (The Last Man on Earth), Emmy nominee Nicole Byer (Nailed It!), YouTube Diamond creator Liza Koshy (Liza on Demand), Ramona Young (Never Have I Ever), Eduardo Franco (Stranger Things) and Echo Kellum (Arrow).\n\n#IGN #Movies #Dreamworks", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNc5igZ29NM", "date_published": "2023-03-16 15:42:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "The Ted Lasso Crew Fell Apart, Can They Reunite?", "description": "Ted Lasso returns with Season 3, but crew is more spread out than ever as Ted, Roy, Coach Beard and Rebecca try to bring AFC Richmond to the top of the Premier League.

James Gunn and Peter Safran already revealed their plans for Chapter One of the DCU, which made no mention of Darkseid. While we can only speculate at this moment what the three day reveal will be, it\u2019s probably a safe assumption that it won\u2019t be film related. DC Comics Chief Officer Kim Lee mentioned at SDCC in 2022 that The Snyder Cut is likely the last entry in Snyder\u2019s film franchise. Another surprise for DC fans is the reveal of Dark Flash in the upcoming Flash movie. We get this by way of McFarlane Toys, which released images of official merch for the DC movie.
