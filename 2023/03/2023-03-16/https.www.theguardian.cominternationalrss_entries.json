Here is<a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2023/03/Were-going-on-a-growth-hunt.pdf\"> the full report </a>from the thinktank. And here is my colleague <strong>Phillip Inman</strong>\u2019s story.</p><p>Good morning. Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget self-destructed last year for many reasons, but the first element to get unpicked was the abolition of the 45p top rate of tax, a tax cut for the very rich. Labour is attacking <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>\u2019s budget in the same manner, attacking his plan to abolish the pensions lifetime allowance (the limit on how much can be saved tax free) as a tax cut for the very rich.</p><p><em>I think this could unravel as quickly as it began. If you remember last September, Liz Truss tried to cut the top rate of tax from 45p to 40p, everybody kicked off about it. </em></p><p><em>Next week there will be a vote on this, Labour will force a vote on this next week. And I would say to Conservative MPs in places like Ashfield, or Bolsover, or Stoke-On-Trent, whose side are you on? Are you on the side of ordinary working people in your constituencies who are seeing their taxes go up, or are you going to vote with Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt for a tax cut for the wealthiest in society? </em></p><p>We have a particular problem in the NHS. We have large numbers of doctors who are reducing their hours or retiring early. The Royal College of Surgeons say that 69% of their members have reduced their hours because of the way pension taxes work. We have a big backlog in the NHS and all of us depend on the NHS.</p><p>We need to do everything we can. This is a measure that we can deliver quickly. The British Medical Association \u2026 say that this will mean that doctors do not leave the NHS because of pension tax rules. I think that\u2019s very important.</p><p>We\u2018re spending \u00a33bn a year in the NHS on locum doctors and agency nurses because of doctor shortfalls. If you ask doctors, they say this is one of the biggest reasons why consultants aren\u2019t available.</p><p>If you\u2019re asking what will have an impact on ordinary families up and down the country, it is getting their NHS operation done more quickly. And this is the simplest and quickest way to resolve that issue.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/mar/16/budget-backlash-jeremy-hunt-pension-tax-giveaway-labour-conservatives-latest\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/mar/16/budget-backlash-jeremy-hunt-pension-tax-giveaway-labour-conservatives-latest", "date_published": "2023-03-16 09:09:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "AFL 2023 season opener: Richmond v Carlton \u2013 live", "description": "<ul><li>Updates as the Tigers take on the Blues at the MCG</li><li>Any thoughts? <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">Email</a> or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">@JPHowcroft</a></li></ul><p>And now Richmond take to the turf in their familiar yellow and black uniform.</p><p>It\u2019s pretty warm in Melbourne tonight with the temperature still in the mid-20s, making all those preseason bicep curls nice and shiny.</p><p>We feel we\u2019ve got an extra level of detail in our game style and roles and hoping that turns into consistency as a footy team and we can execute under pressure and no doubt the Tiges tonight will put the pressure on.
