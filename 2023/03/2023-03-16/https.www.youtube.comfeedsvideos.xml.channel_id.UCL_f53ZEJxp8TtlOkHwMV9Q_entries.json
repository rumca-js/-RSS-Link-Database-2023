Peterson, Michael Yon, and Eva Vlaardingerbroek discuss recent events encircling the Dutch farmers protest, how their anti-globalist movement mirrors the Canadian Freedom Convoy, and how their message has resonated across the world despite best efforts to silence their voices.\n\nAt age 19, Michael Yon completed Green Beret training. His Green Beret experience taught him the art of observing and surviving in the most dangerous environments on earth. Combining his skills as a writer and a photographer, and with the encouragement of fellow veterans, Michael began his correspondent career by traveling to Iraq in December of 2004. That was the first step in his nearly 20-year journey\u2014traveling the globe to report on world events firsthand. He has traveled to more than 80 countries including China, India, Bhutan, and Vietnam studying issues from cannibalism, information warfare, insurgency, protests, migration wars, and more.  His most recent journey has taken him from Asia to Europe, America, and Central and South America to study the conditions for global famine.\n\nEva Vlaardingerbroek is a Dutch journalist and host of the \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About It\u201d program on the YouTube channel Riks. Vlaardingerbroek has published opinion articles in newspapers such as the Dutch weekly and Elsevier Weekblad. She has also appeared on programs like Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News. She advocates for a cultural return to faith, a rejection of the WEF manifested, globalist ideology.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsor -\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Michael Yon:\n\nWebsite: https://michaelyon.com/ \n\n\nFor Eva Vlaardingerbroek:\n\nEva's Blog on Substack: https://evavlaardingerbroek.substack.com/ \n\nEva on Twitter https://twitter.com/EvaVlaar \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:38) Coming up\n(2:10) Intro\n(3:43) Straight to the farmers\n(4:50) Information warfare\n(5:39) Why Eva protests\n(7:19) Leading via tractor\n(8:36) What\u2019s going on in Holland?\n(10:39) When farmers protest\n(12:01) Nitrogen crisis?\n(13:20) Peak Polluters and other terms of attrition\n(15:38) EU mandated, Holland enforced\n(17:26) Why Holland seeks to destroy farmers\n(18:30) Support base versus apathy\n(19:20) Nitrogen is the wrong motive\n(20:03) Stalin\u2019s famine, replacement strategy\n(21:30) The Darien Gap\n(22:26) Flood of migrants, forced lodging\n(24:46) What happens to the supply chain?\n(28:00) The Dutch Spirit\n(32:32) WEF, Trudeau, a just transition\n(35:50) Don\u2019t say Holland\n(37:30) Sending Germans to police the Dutch\n(38:55) The distance of communication\n(42:46) The intent of the Globalists\n(48:01) The failed Google smart port\n(49:11) Dystopian tech, CCTV and skynet\n(53:02) Smart city, smarter control\n(55:20) Digital currency, no going back\n(1:00:00) ARC and a better narrative\n(1:02:50) Individual truth despite global destiny\n(1:04:38) Weaponized immigration\n(1:05:36) Poverty and tribalism\n(1:09:00) The Birthgap\n(1:11:10) Tri-state city\n(1:15:11) Fertilizer shortages\n(1:19:04) Farmers can only sell their land to the GOV\n(1:22:10) Effect and backlash on Dutch society\n(1:26:16) Freedom is taken, not granted\n(1:27:55) What will the farmers do?\n(1:30:23) What can we do to help?\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqHQN54XCL0", "date_published": "2023-03-16 15:00:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
