The agency is also exploring whether or not it can apply the framework to other purposes, regions and wireless bands.

If a work\u2019s traditional elements of authorship were produced by a machine, the work lacks human authorship and the Office will not register it.&quot;</p><p>Last month, the USCO <a href=\"https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/zarya-of-the-dawn-how-ai-is-changing-the-landscape-of-copyright-protection\"><ins>determined</ins></a> that images generated by Midjourney and used in a graphic novel were not copyrightable. However, it said the text and layout of Kris Kashtanova's <em>Zarya of the Dawn</em> could be afforded copyright protection. The office said there was too much \u201cdistance\u201d between Kashtanova's inputs and Midjourney's output for the images to be copyrightable. Kashtanova's lawyers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VanL/status/1628468104345841673\"><ins>have said</ins></a> that by focusing on the output rather than the input, the office &quot;applied the wrong legal standard.&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, the USCO has <a href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/newsnet/2023/1004.html\"><ins>started an initiative</ins></a> to further explore copyright law and policy issues related to AI following requests from Congress and the public. It will host several panel discussions on the topics in April and May. The office plans to solicit public comments later this year on a swathe of copyright issues relating to the use of AI.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai-generated-images-from-text-cant-be-copyrighted-us-government-rules-174243933.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ai-generated-images-from-text-cant-be-copyrighted-us-government-rules-174243933.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-16 17:42:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "'Diablo IV' and 'Redfall' will support NVIDIA's DLSS 3 on launch", "description": "<p>NVIDIA's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-3-ada-lovelace-160404110.html\">DLSS 3 upscaling</a> (Deep Learning Super Sampling 3) will soon be <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-accelerates-neural-graphics-pc-gaming-revolution-at-gdc-with-new-dlss-3-pc-games-and-tools\">available</a> for some particularly high-profile games.

Epic is integrating DLSS 3 support into Unreal Engine 5.2 through an upcoming plug-in, so developers won't have to go to great lengths to add the performance-boosting feature to their titles.

For example, you can specify whether you\u2019re seeking monogamous or non-monogamous relationships (or are still figuring it out) and list your preferred gender pronouns. Both new features are borrowed from Hinge, owned by the same parent company, which added the same profile options last year.</p><p>Tinder\u2019s new relationship-type options, spurred by growing interest in less traditional dating approaches, include monogamy, ethical non-monogamy, open relationship, polyamory and \u201copen to exploring.\u201d The company cites a study of 4,000 18-to-25-year-olds showing that 41 percent are open to or seeking non-monogamous connections. Among those, open relationships (36 percent) and hierarchical polyamory (26 percent) are the most popular choices. Perhaps just as critical, a survey indicated that 73 percent of young singles of any gender say they want someone who is clear about what they want.

Additionally, it says the LGBTQIA+ community is the platform\u2019s fastest-growing demographic. Thanks to these revelations, Tinder now lets you select up to four pronouns out of more than 15 options to show on your profile.</p><p>This follows the app\u2019s addition of relationship goals, <a href=\"https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2022-12-14-Tinder-Introduces-Relationship-Goals,-Because-Sharing-What-You-Want-Is-Sexy\">launched</a> in December. That option lets users clarify whether they want short-term, long-term or an uncertain combination. The company says 40 percent of its users who specify their intent say they\u2019re looking for a long-term relationship, while 13 percent claim they only want a short-term connection.

Most modern cases allow you to do this without any tools, but you'll need at least one screwdriver for most of the work we'll detail in a moment. When it comes to most screws inside your computer, a 4-inch Phillips screwdriver should be all you need. Some components, such as your GPU, may include Torx screws and the like, but don't worry about those for now since we won't be taking them apart.

Depending on how long your computer has been collecting dust, you may want to remove some components such as the GPU to make it easier to clean everything.</p><p>If that's something you feel comfortable doing and it's your first time removing any of the internals, use your phone to take photos of the interior. The images will help you put all the parts in their original place at the end. That's important to do since there's an optimal way to install many of the components in your computer. For instance, you always want to install your GPU in the fastest available PCIe lane. When it comes to removing any PCI cards, first unscrew its mounting bracket and then push the corresponding release on your motherboard before pulling the card out.</p><figure><img alt=\"Back to School cleaning products\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8e751480-e8be-11eb-a6fb-18fd90064826\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Whether you decide to keep all your computer's internals in place or not, you'll need something to blow all that dust away.

It's here you can see how much of its resources your computer is devoting to specific processes. Since everyone will have different software installed on their PC, it's hard to offer blanket recommendations, but using the Task Manager you can get a sense of the apps that may be slowing down your computer. For most people, there will be two main culprits: bloatware and antivirus software.</p><p>If you bought your PC from a system integrator like Dell, it will almost certainly include software your computer doesn't need to operate. You can safely uninstall unused, preloaded apps to improve performance and save on space.</p><p>This next tip may be contentious for some: I believe as long as you avoid clicking on sketchy links and stay away from the dark corners of the internet, Windows Defender is all you need to protect your computer from the majority of malware that's out there. While there are good antivirus programs like <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=611316b6-01c7-4271-8c69-1aaf6d7108ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Bitdefender&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2MTEzMTZiNi0wMWM3LTQyNzEtOGM2OS0xYWFmNmQ3MTA4YWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYml0ZGVmZW5kZXIuY29tL21lZGlhL2h0bWwvY29uc3VtZXIvbmV3LzIwMjAvY2wtb2ZmZXItb3B0LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmEzZDgxYTUtZjJiNC00OTBmLWJhOGMtNDllMTIxOTJiYWIwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbOD3o1DHwRBukvVgggEWte9JpdCoRLMgpoER60SJgCG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fmedia%2Fhtml%2Fconsumer%2Fnew%2F2020%2Fcl-offer-opt%2F\">Bitdefender</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=de672dc6-c8dc-4845-af8c-ebf5e59ce373&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Malwarebytes&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkZTY3MmRjNi1jOGRjLTQ4NDUtYWY4Yy1lYmY1ZTU5Y2UzNzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFsd2FyZWJ5dGVzLmNvbS8_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmYTNkODFhNS1mMmI0LTQ5MGYtYmE4Yy00OWUxMjE5MmJhYjAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf-TLRLAQ35zTa0akf5_L95rxSwKa4oRKXJ6IHO4caB9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malwarebytes.com%2F%3F\">Malwarebytes</a>, the majority cost far too much for what they offer and will only slow down your computer. If you don't feel comfortable uninstalling your antivirus software, then by all means, leave it on your computer.</p><p>While you're in the task manager, you'll also want to click on the \"Startup\" tab to see what programs your computer is launching when you power it on. You can speed up that process simply by limiting that list to as few apps as possible. As for the actual process of deleting any software you don't need, always uninstall programs from the Control Panel as this will leave the fewest leftovers when everything is said and done. If you've used Windows for a while, you'll have errant files all over the place. It's possible to cull those manually, but doing so can be time-consuming. Thankfully, Windows 10 and 11\u2019s built-in Disk Cleanup will help you wrangle those with ease.</p><p>If you have any mechanical drives installed in your computer, it's good to get into the habit of defragging them regularly. First, launch the built-in Defragment and Optimize Drives app and click the \"Optimize\" button. Depending on the size of your hard drive, this process may take a while. Don't defrag your SSDs, as you'll only shorten their lifespan for little to no performance improvement.</p><h2>How to organize your apps, tabs and other windows</h2><figure><img alt=\"Melbourne, Australia - Jun 13, 2016: Clicking the Windows Store icon on Surface Pro 4.

You don't need to download any additional software to organize your desktop, but there are some settings you can tweak to get even more out of its signature Snap functionality.</p><p>As you may already know, you can press the Windows and Tab keys at the same time to bring up the Task View pane. It's here that you can add additional virtual desktops. If you're not already using virtual desktops, they're great for organizing your active windows so that you don't have to constantly rearrange them when you're trying to find a specific one. You can quickly press the Windows key, Ctrl and either the left or right arrow keys to move between desktops. But to make things even simpler, head to the Settings app and into the Multitasking section of the System menu. Under the \"Virtual desktops\" heading, switch both settings to \"All desktops.\" You can now use the Alt-Tab shortcut or taskbar to switch to any app on any desktop.</p><p>When it comes to wrangling your tabs, a lot of that will depend on the browser you use. But as a decent starting point, all the most popular ones include a feature that allows you to pin tabs. I use this to keep the websites I visit most frequently throughout a workday (in my case, Gmail, Trello and Google Drive) open at all times and at the top of my tab bar. In that way, those tabs never get lost among the countless other websites I might have open for a story I'm writing. What's more, in the case of Brave, the browser I use, I can use a handful of keyboard shortcuts to jump to those tabs quickly.</p><p>In closing, we want to highlight just how much customization Windows 10 and 11 offer you when it comes to the organization of your computer. As just one example, you can right-click on items located on the taskbar and start menu to put the apps and shortcuts you use most frequently within easy reach. However, if you want to really dig into all the options Windows 10 offers on that front, websites like <em>Windows Central </em>have <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/tips-tricks-increase-pc-performance-windows-10\">detailed how-tos</a> that are an excellent starting point.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-clean-and-organize-your-windows-pc-150026502.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/how-to-clean-and-organize-your-windows-pc-150026502.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-16 15:00:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "UK bans TikTok from government devices with immediate effect", "description": "<p>The UK has become the latest major jurisdiction to ban <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/tiktok/\"><ins>TikTok</ins></a> from government devices.

You can buy distilled water at a grocery store or <a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Distilled-Water\">make it yourself</a> with some simple cookware.

I can\u2019t say enough good things about the latter. It will save you from buying expensive and wasteful cans of compressed air.</p><p>As for the process of cleaning your Mac, the most important tip to remember is to start with a clean cloth (that\u2019s part of the reason we recommend buying them in bulk). You\u2019ll save yourself time and frustration this way. Begin by turning off your computer and unplugging it. If you went out and bought a Rocket Blower, use it now to remove any dust. If not, take a dry microfiber cloth and go over your computer. Take special care around the keys, particularly if you own a Mac with a butterfly keyboard.</p><p>Next, dampen one side of your cleaning cloth with either water or Whoosh. Never spray any liquid directly on your computer. You\u2019ll have more control this way and you\u2019ll avoid getting any moisture into your Mac\u2019s internals. I always clean the display first since the last thing I want to do is create more work for myself by transferring dirt from some other part of my computer to the screen. The last step is to buff and polish your computer with the dry side of the cloth. Be gentle here as you don\u2019t want to scratch the screen or any other part of That\u2019s it. Your Mac should be looking clean again.</p><h2>How to organize your hard drive</h2><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/3f3c0b80-7de3-11eb-bbdd-a0da0dcfa81e\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>One of the hardest parts of cleaning your Mac\u2019s hard drive is knowing where to start. After all, most of us have apps on our computers we don\u2019t even remember installing in the first place. Thankfully, macOS comes with a tool to help you with that exact issue.</p><p>Navigate to the \u201cStorage\u201d section of the \u201cAbout This Mac\u201d menu and click the \u201cManage\u2026\u201d option. Here you\u2019ll find a tool that sorts your files into broad categories and offers recommendations on how to free up space on your hard drive. You can use those in combination with the handy \u201cShow in finder\u201d button at the bottom of the interface to quickly navigate your hard drive. No need to search for files manually.</p><p>The section dedicated to applications is particularly helpful since you can see the last time you used a program, as well as if it\u2019s no longer supported by the operating system or if it\u2019s outdated thanks to a more recent release.</p><figure><img alt=\"AppCleaner\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/14698fd0-7de4-11eb-bfee-4cdd3519eb20\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>You don\u2019t need me to tell you to uninstall programs you don\u2019t use, but what you might not know is that there\u2019s a better way to erase them than simply dragging them to the trash can. A free program called <a href=\"https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/\">AppCleaner</a> will help you track down any files and folders that would get left behind if you were just to delete an application.</p><p>After deleting any apps you don\u2019t need, move to the documents section. The name is somewhat misleading here since you\u2019ll find more than just text files and excel spreadsheets. Documents, in this case, turns out to be the tool\u2019s catch-all term for a variety of files, including ones that take up a large amount of space and DMGs you may have forgotten to dismount. The other sections on the sidebar are self-explanatory. The only other thing I\u2019ll mention is if you\u2019ve been using an iPhone for a while, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll have old iOS backups stored on your computer. You can safely delete those too.</p><figure><img alt=\"CleanMyMac X\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/7b65a800-7de3-11eb-aebe-6ed983c468b7\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>By this point, your hard drive should be in pretty good shape. If you want to take some additional steps to clean it, there are dedicated apps that can help.

At $51 per year, it\u2019s on the expensive side, but will save you the time and trouble of doing everything I mentioned above (and then some) on your own. It also doubles as a malware removal tool.</p><h2>Tips and tricks for keeping a neat Desktop and Finder</h2><figure><img alt=\"Bartender\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e4a37d60-7de3-11eb-bbf3-cd5dedfe20d8\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Igor Bonifacic</div></figure><p>Let\u2019s start with the menu bar. It may not technically be part of the desktop, but a tidy one can go a long way toward making everything else look less cluttered. My recommendation here is to download a $16 app called <a href=\"https://www.macbartender.com/\">Bartender</a>. At first glance, it\u2019s a simple program allowing you to hide unwanted menu bar items behind a three dots icon. However, the strength of Bartender is that you get a lot of customization options. For example, you can set a trigger that will automatically move the battery status icon out from hiding when your computer isn\u2019t connected to a power outlet.</p><p>While we\u2019re on the subject of the menu bar, take a second to open your Mac\u2019s System Preferences menu and go to the \u201cUsers &amp; Groups\u201d section. Now click on the \u201cLogin Items\u201d tab at the bottom of the interface and take a look at all the apps that launch when you boot up your system. You can speed up your system by paring this list down to only the programs you use frequently.</p><p>When it comes to the desktop itself, the best advice is less is more. Nothing will make your computer look like a cluttered mess more than a busy desktop. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLWNhL2d1aWRlL21hYy1oZWxwL21oMzU5NTEvbWFjIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjNTdiYmQ2ZS0zNDYxLTQ3ODAtYjExMC03MzliMzg2MTMwZTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWCbVFijphJ9snlYrVjtq6KdMsrWLn6yQX4SxF01a9be&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-ca%2Fguide%2Fmac-help%2Fmh35951%2Fmac\">Folders and stacks</a> can help, but, for most people, I suspect part of the problem is they use their desktop as a way to quickly and easily find files that are important to them.</p><p>If you\u2019ve ever struggled to find a specific file or folder on your computer, try using your Mac\u2019s tagging capabilities instead. Start by opening the Finder preferences menu<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(\u201ccommand\u201d + \u201c,\u201d) and click the \u201cTags\u201d tab. You can use the default ones provided by macOS or make your own. Either way, drag the ones you think you\u2019ll use most often to the favorites areas at the bottom of the preferences window. This will make it so that they\u2019re easily accessible when you want to use them. To append a tag to a file or folder, click on it while holding the ctrl key and select the one you want from the dropdown menu. You can also tag a file while working on it within an app. Keep in mind you can apply multiple tags to a single file or folder. You can even apply them to applications.</p><figure><img alt=\"macOS tagging\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cdabab00-7de3-11eb-b7fe-a327716c01d0\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>What makes tags so useful in macOS is that they can appear in the sidebar of the Finder and are easily searchable either directly through the Finder or using Siri. As long as you have a system for organizing your files, even a simple one, you\u2019ll find it easier to keep track of them. As one example, I like to apply an Engadget tag to any files related to my work. I\u2019ll add an \u201cImportant\u201d tag if it\u2019s something that\u2019s critical and I want to find quickly.</p><p>One tool that can help supercharge your Finder experience is <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\">Alfred</a>. It\u2019s effectively a more powerful version of Apple\u2019s Spotlight feature. Among other things, you can use Alfred to find and launch apps quickly. There\u2019s a bit of a learning curve, but once you get a hang of it, Alfred will change how you use your Mac for the better.</p><h2>How to organize your windows and tabs</h2><figure><img alt=\"Magnet\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/97abd0c0-7de3-11eb-bf3b-233c2c82359a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you\u2019ve used both macOS and Windows 10, you\u2019ll know that Apple\u2019s operating system doesn\u2019t come with the best window management tools. You can click and hold on the full-screen icon to tile a window to either the left or right side of your screen, but that\u2019s about it and the feature has always felt less precise than its Windows counterpart.</p><p>My suggestion is to download an app that replicates Windows 10\u2019s snapping feature. You have several competing options that more or less offer the same functionality. My go-to is an $8 program called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id441258766?mt=12\">Magnet</a>. If you want a free alternative, check out <a href=\"https://rectangleapp.com/\">Rectangle</a>. Another option is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12\">BetterSnapTool</a>, which offers more functionality than Magnet but doesn\u2019t have as clean of an interface. All three apps give you far more ways to configure your windows than what you get through the built-in tool in macOS. They also come with shortcut support, which means you can quickly set up your windows and get to work.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-clean-your-mac-macbook-cleaning-supplies-digital-organization-153007592.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/how-to-clean-your-mac-macbook-cleaning-supplies-digital-organization-153007592.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-16 14:18:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "JBL portable speakers are up to 38 percent off right now", "description": "<p>Now that it's getting warmer, you might want a Bluetooth speaker to soundtrack your outdoor excursions.

The company\u2019s signature look of metal and leather, immediately set it apart from the competition when the wired MH40 debuted in 2014. M&amp;D followed up with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-headphones-announced.html\"><ins>a wireless version</ins></a> in 2019, giving its non-ANC (active noise canceling) over-ear headphones a modern update. Now the company is back with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-gives-its-mh40-headphones-new-drivers-and-longer-battery-life-120001289.html\"><ins>a second-generation wireless model</ins></a>, touting improvements to audio, battery and more. The third iteration of the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d0b7cb3e-39f3-4fd4-96b6-85f0d7a5aa0a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Master+%26+Dynamic&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkMGI3Y2IzZS0zOWYzLTRmZDQtOTZiNi04NWYwZDdhNWFhMGEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFzdGVyZHluYW1pYy5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbWg0MC13aXJlbGVzcy1vdmVyLWVhci1oZWFkcGhvbmVzLXYyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhMWFhZDZlYi1lZTdlLTRlN2YtYjIzYS1iNDBhYTUzODBjNWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXBscecIzACqh2DHagjite1BveKLOtDhI6homJ4fTVcA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fmh40-wireless-over-ear-headphones-v2\"><ins>MH40</ins></a> is undoubtedly an improvement on the last, but are the company\u2019s design chops enough to overcome the lack of features compared to similarly priced alternatives?</p><h2>Design</h2><p>One element that has always set Master &amp; Dynamic apart from the competition is its design. From those first MH40 headphones, the company has relied on aluminum construction instead of plastic for several products. What\u2019s more, it blends the metal with other premium materials like canvas and leather. For the second-generation MH40 Wireless, the company has stayed true to its roots, right down to the vintage, aviator-inspired look.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Alongside the aluminum body, a coated canvas-wrapped headband is color matched to removable lambskin leather ear pads. With all of those high-end materials, the MH40 weighs 280 grams \u2013 30 grams more than <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html\"><ins>Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM5</ins></a>. Still, the extra heft isn\u2019t a burden, these feel lightweight, comfy, and the cushiony ear pads keep you from feeling the outer rim of the ear cups.</p><p>Like the previous version, the on-board controls reside on the right ear cup. A three-button array is positioned near the headband hinge, giving you controls for calls, music, voice assistant and volume (including a mute button). The dual-function power/pairing button sits on the outer edge alongside the USB-C port and a multi-color pairing/battery life indicator. I\u2019ll always advocate for physical controls over a touch panel, mostly because they\u2019re more reliable. That\u2019s certainly the case here, as I was easily able to execute multiple presses on the center button for skipping tracks.</p><h2>Software and features</h2><figure><img alt=\"There\u2019s no denying Master &amp; Dynamic offers a unique take on headphone design, and the MH40 is the earliest example of what the company can do. This third iteration of the model improves sound quality, extends battery life and does a better job with calls. Despite the fact that the MH40 covers the basics well, some will want more in a set of $399 headphones. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/5bdb4af0-c358-11ed-bc5d-f4e53c6d24b1\" style=\"height: 1333; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The M&amp;D Connect app is the companion software for the MH40. Here, battery level is the most prominently displayed item, along with a note if your headphones are up to date firmware-wise. A tap on the gear icon reveals options for sound, controls and \u201cabout device.\u201d Inside the sound menu, Master &amp; Dynamic gives you four EQ presets: bass boost, bass cut, podcast (mids and vocals) and audiophile (mids and highs). By default, there\u2019s no equalizer setting selected and the app will remember which one you picked so you don\u2019t have to select it each time you activate the so-called E-Preset EQ. You can also enable Sidetone on the sound menu, allowing you to hear some of your own voice during calls. This comes in handy as it keeps you from feeling the need to speak loudly to hear yourself through the passive noise isolation.</p><p>While Sidetone is a nice feature, you can only activate it in the app, which means before a call (or more likely, during the first few seconds of one) you\u2019ll have to swipe over to the sound menu to turn it on. I realize the MH40 doesn\u2019t have ANC so there\u2019s not a dedicated button that selects a noise-canceling mode. But perhaps there could be an option to reassign the long press on the center button, from summoning a voice assistant, to triggering Sidetone.</p><p>On the controls menu, the app gives you the option of renaming the device from M&amp;D MH40W and changing the automatic shut-off timer from the default 30 minutes (one hour, three hours and never are the other options). From this screen you can also trigger a factory reset.</p><h2>Sound quality</h2><figure><img alt=\"There\u2019s no denying Master &amp; Dynamic offers a unique take on headphone design, and the MH40 is the earliest example of what the company can do. This third iteration of the model improves sound quality, extends battery life and does a better job with calls.

Across genres, there\u2019s no over-reliance on bombastic bass or painfully brilliant highs. That continues on the second-gen MH40 Wireless where there\u2019s ample low-end tone when a track demands it, like Mike Shinoda\u2019s remix of Deftones\u2019 \u201cPassenger.\u201d But the bass is a complement to everything else, and the default EQ works well across the sonic spectrum.</p><p>Master &amp; Dynamic swapped out the drivers on the previous version for 40mm titanium units that it says produce \u201cclearer highs and richer lows.\u201d Indeed, the treble is punchy throughout a range of musical styles, and the bass can be as thick and thumping as a song requires. Other headphones may offer low boom, but it blends better with the mids and highs on the MH40, making the even the deepest bass on <em>RTJ4 </em>more pleasant to listen to.</p><p>There\u2019s great attention to detail in the sound profile of the MH40 too, and again, it\u2019s apparent across different types of music. However, this is most evident with genres like bluegrass and jazz \u2013 multi-instrumental arrangements with interwoven sections emphasizing different players at different times. It\u2019s not quite on the level of what Bowers &amp; Wilkins manages with its latest headphones, which are some of the best-sounding I\u2019ve reviewed. But Master &amp; Dynamic does a solid job with the subtle nuances of sound, from pick noise on a mandolin to the percussive thumps of an upright bass.</p><p>When it comes to calls, the new MH40 offers a better overall experience than its predecessor, but there\u2019s still room for improvement. The new microphone setup does a solid job with constant background noise. It doesn\u2019t pick up things like white noise machines and clothes dryers. The headphones aren\u2019t great with louder distractions and it picks those up in greater detail if you\u2019ve got Sidetone active.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><figure><img alt=\"There\u2019s no denying Master &amp; Dynamic offers a unique take on headphone design, and the MH40 is the earliest example of what the company can do.

That\u2019s up from 18 hours on the first wireless version of the headphones, but it's not any longer than most ANC models. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-m50xbt2-wireless-headphones-155041750.html\">Audio-Technica's best non-ANC model</a> lasts up to 50 hours, for example. There\u2019s also a quick-charge feature that will give you up to six hours of use in 15 minutes. During my testing, I managed to hit the stated time before having to plug them in, but I didn\u2019t go beyond. That\u2019s doing a mix of music, podcasts and calls (with Sidetone) at around 75 percent volume and leaving the headphones off overnight a few times.</p><h2>The competition</h2><p>In terms of non-ANC headphones, one of my favorite options is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-m50xbt2-wireless-headphones-155041750.html\"><ins>Audio-Technica\u2019s ATH-M50xBT2</ins></a>. Like the MH40, this is a second-generation model with notable improvements over the M50xBT. Multi-point Bluetooth pairing, built-in Alexa and a low latency mode were added on top of the company\u2019s blend of warm audio tone with a really comfy set of cans. Plus, they\u2019re currently on sale for $179 \u2013 $20 less than the original price and less than half of what you\u2019ll pay for the new MH40.</p><p>If you\u2019re looking for noise canceling headphones, Master &amp; Dynamic sells <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mw75-announced-price-specs-availability-120049188.html\"><ins>the MW75</ins></a> with a more modern design than the company\u2019s other over- and on-ear products. Adaptive ANC is powered by a set of four microphones and there are three noise-canceling modes to choose from. The MW75 is also equipped with wear detection to help you extend that 28-hour listening time (with ANC on). However, these headphones are a whopping $599, only surpassed by <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html\"><ins>Bowers &amp; Wilkins\u2019 Px8</ins></a> for the most expensive headphones I\u2019ve tested recently.</p><p>For the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html\"><ins>best wireless headphones</ins></a> currently available, you\u2019ll want to consider <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html\"><ins>Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM5</ins></a>. Simply put, no other company comes close to what Sony offers on its flagship set in terms of mixing features, sound quality and ANC performance. While they\u2019re pricey at $398, you get more for that investment. Plus, we\u2019ve seen the M5 on sale for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonys-wh-1000-xm5-anc-headphones-fall-to-a-new-all-time-low-of-279-093756682.html\"><ins>as low as $279</ins></a>.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>What features are you willing to give up for headphones with standout looks and good sound? That\u2019s really what you have to consider with the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d0b7cb3e-39f3-4fd4-96b6-85f0d7a5aa0a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Master+%26+Dynamic&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkMGI3Y2IzZS0zOWYzLTRmZDQtOTZiNi04NWYwZDdhNWFhMGEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFzdGVyZHluYW1pYy5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvbWg0MC13aXJlbGVzcy1vdmVyLWVhci1oZWFkcGhvbmVzLXYyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhMWFhZDZlYi1lZTdlLTRlN2YtYjIzYS1iNDBhYTUzODBjNWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXBscecIzACqh2DHagjite1BveKLOtDhI6homJ4fTVcA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fmh40-wireless-over-ear-headphones-v2\"><ins>MH40</ins></a>. There\u2019s no denying this second-gen model is an upgrade from the first wireless version. All of the things the company says it improved hold true, from the sound quality to the battery life and microphone performance. Had the company done so without boosting the price, I could make a strong argument for the new MH40. But at $399, there are flagship noise-canceling headphones from other companies that simply offer too much when compared to M&amp;D\u2019s latest. Unless, of course, the main thing that matters to you is a deft hand with product design.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-2nd-gen-review-133022239.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-2nd-gen-review-133022239.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-16 13:30:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "TikTok now lets you start afresh with your For You feed", "description": "<p>Back in February, TikTok <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tikttok-strike-system-transparency-140033358.html\">revealed</a> that it was testing a feature that will give you a way to reset the recommendations that pop up on your For You page.

Examples include videos that feature sadness or extreme dieting and exercise.

Each of its three seasons have felt like one or two made-for-TV-movies' worth of story stretched thin to <em>ten</em> near-hour long episodes. Nowhere is this more evident than in this season\u2019s fifth episode, where five minutes of plot is expanded to a full episode. Here, Team Picard learns that Starfleet has been infiltrated by super-Changelings before teaming up with Team Worffi. Oh, and Beverley, who has been in relatively close contact with him for most of his life, has finally noticed that Something Is Up With Her Son. But even that fairly slender advance in the plot has to take a back seat to the main centerpiece of the episode: The moment when Picard stands face-to-face with [CHARACTER].</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The power of [CHARACTER\u2019S] return is all held in the moment that they step into camera focus, such is the extent of the surprise. After all, there are textual and meta-textual reasons why you wouldn\u2019t expect to see them popping up in any Star Trek, let alone this one. For a start, their plot was done after they \u2013 for right or wrong reasons \u2013 betrayed the Enterprise crew in [TNG EPISODE]. And, of course, [ACTOR] had been expected to make the transition to <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, but turned the role down. In fact, esteemed Trek wiki Memory Alpha suggested they were even offered a role in Voyager, either as a regular or as a guest star, and similarly turned it down. If there\u2019s any person who you\u2019d think was never coming back to <em>any</em> Star Trek, it would be [ACTOR]. And not even I, much as you keep telling me I\u2019m a cynical hater expressing these opinions to milk your hate-clicks, was immune to the initial flush of emotion seeing them in a Starfleet uniform again.</p><p>Unfortunately, the main confrontation between Picard and [CHARACTER] is dulled by both the needlessness of it all, and its execution. The pair talk about their \u201cfaith\u201d in \u201cinstitutions\u201d or the lack of such, and why this is or is not a good thing, but I don\u2019t feel any of this. Part of it is the streaming era-Trek problem of telling us things rather than showing, so we have these gestures toward a grander theme that are never properly explored on screen. But it\u2019s also because many of these themes were already well-explored on <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, even if the execution there was always a little hamfisted. After all, while there was every sense that we <em>should</em> side with the Maquis \u2013 don't forget that they were the little people tossed aside by the grand machinations of empires with no care of the lives that were directly impacted. But this is Star Trek, and so whatever the problem, whatever the grand conundrum at hand, the answer is pretty much always Starfleet.</p><p><em>Picard\u2019s</em> obsession with continuity for the sake of itself does little more than remind us of older, better Treks. I might as well add, because it\u2019s been on my mind for years at this point, that there\u2019s a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1YR2NBYkktNF9pbyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTczZGE3ZTAtOTU5My00Yzg1LWI4NjMtZTFjMzMwY2EyY2RhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAecLD8LojgtbEyWCP92qyWXN52QnYtWQfH8oWDxDtRgM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXGcAbI-4_io\">YouTube</a> clip from the <em>DS9</em> episode \u201c<a href=\"https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/For_the_Uniform_(episode)\">For The Uniform</a>\u201d describing Sisko as a \u201cbadass.\u201d Specifically because he carries through a threat to sterilize a planet to inflict petty revenge on Commander Eddington, who he felt betrayed Starfleet to go support the Maquis. This is the Star Trek problem in a nutshell: Sisko\u2019s in the wrong here, but the show can never quite allow us to stop sympathizing with our hero because he\u2019s <em>our</em> hero. Picard, this year, has behaved pretty illogically, and recklessly, and yet because he\u2019s <em>our</em> hero too, the show can\u2019t quite question his actions in anything more than a single line of sassy dialog from Riker.</p><p>I don\u2019t consider myself pharisaical in my approach to continuity, and I do think that it can be a benefit to storytelling rather than a burden. But Picard\u2019s use of golden-era Trek deep cuts often takes me out of the show as I wonder how this tracks in any way logically. Picard himself even says as much, asking how in the hell [CHARACTER] wound up back in a Starfleet uniform. She explains the \u201carduous\u201d process taken to get back into the fleet, but I couldn\u2019t help but interrogate this further. Imagine if a mid-level officer in the US Navy put a major aircraft carrier in any degree of jeopardy to cover their own defection to an (ostensibly) enemy terror group? Do you think <em>any</em> military organization worth its salt would allow that same person to serve in active, regular duty again? And if anyone says \u201cbut Tom Paris\u2026\u201d bear in mind that he was a) a Nepo Baby, b) Wasn\u2019t with the Maquis for very long and c) Wasn\u2019t expected to serve once he\u2019d done his time assisting Voyager during its short trip into the badlands.&nbsp;</p><p>And then [Character] dies in a set-up to implicate the Titan, and you wonder if death will be doled out so cheaply in the rest of the series. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve had whole seasons of <em>Picard</em> structured around saying farewell to long-running characters.</p><p>There\u2019s not much to say about this week\u2019s b and c-stories because they feel so derivative and shallow. Worf and Raffi\u2019s plan to smoke out the villains with a fake-out sniper that\u2019s instantly foiled feels pulled from an early-noughties thriller. The fact it was counter-foiled by a fake-out death on Worf\u2019s part felt thin too, there\u2019s no way you\u2019d bring back Michael Dorn just to off him so cheaply. And on a similar theme, Jack is yet another streaming-era Trek character with the <em>Jason Bourne</em> disease; troubled by visions of a secret past that keeps going into a phaser-fu fugue state whenever placed in danger. A storyline so stale it was already covered with mold when <em>this very series</em> did it with Dahj and Soji in its first season. I haven\u2019t seen any episode after the next one, so I <em>genuinely don\u2019t know</em> how this particular plotline is going to resolve itself. But I\u2019ve seen <em>those</em> threads on Reddit, and if it\u2019s true, I\u2019m really going to sigh myself in two if we\u2019re doing this same stuff <em>yet-a-bloody-gain</em>.</p><p>Speaking as a parent, if my kid coughs more than twice in their sleep in quick succession, I\u2019ll just stick my head into their bedroom door to check if they\u2019re okay. If I was the chief medical officer on a starship that spent more than a decade at the far reaches of known space investigating weird stuff, I reckon I might have a tricorder or two at hand. And if my kid stopped being able to sleep, was troubled with dangerous visions and his eyes started to <em>glow red</em> in moments of emotional or physical turmoil, I reckon I wouldn\u2019t keep it to myself until he reached adulthood. In fact, I might even have thought to take them to a hospital or biobed myself just, you know, to be on the safe side.

The phone detects when you're taking a clear photo of the Moon at 25X zoom or above and captures multiple frames. It then uses a neural network to enhance the detail, using a high-resolution reference image for comparison. It\u2019s that latter part that\u2019s rankling folks. So are the images you\u2019re taking fake? Well, Samsung is using the actual shot as a baseline, but the phone is producing photos that don't represent what you get through the lens. The company appears to be aware of this, too, as it says it's refining Scene Optimizer to &quot;reduce any potential confusion&quot; between taking photos of the actual Moon and augmented images of it.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-explains-its-fake-moon-photos-170233896.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/blackberry-movie-trailer-jay-baruchel-191747935.html\">The 'BlackBerry' trailer looks funnier than you'd expect</a></h2><h3>The rise and fall of the keyboard-toting smartphone business.</h3><p></p><p>When we learned that a <em>BlackBerry </em>movie was in the works, no-one thought it would be a comedic feature.

It's the latest version of the company's ERNIE (Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration) Bot that it has been developing over the past decade and was first launched back in 2019. In a press event, Baidu CEO Robin Li said this version of ERNIE Bot has capabilities close to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/openai-just-released-gpt-4-a-multi-modal-generative-ai-172326765.html\">GPT-4</a>, the latest iteration of OpenAI's large language model released just a couple of days ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The chatbot apparently has 550 billion facts in its knowledge graph, but they're mostly focused on the Chinese market. So while it will be able to list Chinese idioms for you, it may not be able to answer as many questions for certain subjects outside the region. ERNIE Bot has the capability to answer a user with audio responses in different Chinese dialects, though, and it can also generate images and videos out of Chinese text.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>During its demo at the event, the chatbot was able to summarize a Chinese sci-fi novel and give suggestions on how to continue writing the book if it were to be expanded. It was also able to name the actors in its film adaptation, compare their heights and conclude who was taller between the two of them. In another demo, it was able to suggest names for a high-tech service company catering to small and mid-size enterprise, write slogans for it and even generate a newsletter with a specified word count.</p><p>Li said that 650 companies have already signed up to use ERNIE Bot's technology, but he also admitted that it's not ready for a public debut. Baidu has merely unveiled it early due to market demand brought about by ChatGPT's meteoric rise in popularity. For now, the Chinese tech giant will only grant access to those who've already received invites, though more companies can apply for the ability to embed the chatbot into their products via Baidu's cloud platform.</p><div id=\"19cba6e30701464d907389a0486f7694\"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/baidu-unveils-ernie-bot-its-chatgpt-rival-105509006.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/baidu-unveils-ernie-bot-its-chatgpt-rival-105509006.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-16 10:55:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Microsoft begins making Bing Chat AI searches available to everyone", "description": "<p>Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html\">launched</a> its ChatGPT-powered version of Bing last month in a limited beta, and it promptly brought a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bing-crossed-100-million-daily-active-users-080138371.html\">bunch of new viewers</a> and some respect to the beleaguered search engine.

OpenAI's latest language model (LLM) has taken the tech world by storm with its ability to handle both text and images. Some of its feats include passing simulated exams like the Bar and LSAT with a score &quot;around the top 10 percent of test takers,&quot; and outperforming other LLMs in a variety of benchmark tests.&nbsp;</p><p>Bing gives users a taste of GPT-4 without the need to pay for it or be a developer. The new search engine got off to be a bit of a shaky start, though, as up to 10 million users signed up to test it. Some were able to \u201cjailbreak\u201d the chatbot, making it spew false information and essentially gaslight users. That forced Microsoft to limit conversations, but it has subsequently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-already-reversing-some-of-the-limits-it-put-on-bings-ai-chat-tools-212138986.html\">removed</a> some of those limits after strengthening the search engine's &quot;guardrails.&quot;</p><p>Microsoft was an early backer of the company behind ChatGPT, Open AI, and strengthened that commitment in 2021 with $2 billion dollar investment.

In SpaceX's announcement, it said the option is meant for people &quot;traveling to locations where connectivity has been unreliable or completely unavailable.&quot; The global roaming option will set you back $200 a month instead of the $150 a month its regional counterpart costs. Starlink's service for RVs was originally priced at $135 a month, but it raised its prices this February.</p><p>Further, if you look at the Starlink website, you'll see that global roaming is only available with the $599 portable hardware.

It said back then that global roaming services are &quot;contingent on regulatory approvals,&quot; because it still doesn't have the authority to offer internet connectivity in some countries like India.
