## Launch HN: Outerbase (YC W23) – A new UI and editor for your database

<p>Hi HN – we are Brandon and Brayden (confusing we know), and we are building Outerbase (<a href="https://www.outerbase.com">https://www.outerbase.com</a>) a better interface for your databases. Think Google Sheets or Airtable, but on your relational database. We provide a collaborative UI on top of Postgres, MySQL and other databases, enabling teams to view, edit and visualize their data.  Here’s our short demo video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38RslBYdZnk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38RslBYdZnk</a><p>Accessing data is a challenge to team members who aren’t data analysts or engineers. Databases are usually locked down to a few team members, and everybody else has to rely on them to get access. Most non-engineers can’t (and don't want to) use developer tools, and developers don't want to write SQL for teammates all day. Technical employees end up being bottlenecks for access to data. In some cases this can be extreme—we’ve seen publicly traded companies with only 2 data scientists for the whole org!<p>Our goal is to make data accessible to everyone who needs it. We have an intuitive spreadsheet-like editor that sits on top of your databases, as well as the capability to save and share queries. You can take those queries to create charts and dashboards for your team. You can also query your data using EZQL, our natural-language-to-SQL conversion. We use OpenAI to power the natural language process, and we pass the relational schema on top so we can easily know the relationships between your tables.<p>Prior to starting Outerbase, I (Brandon) was a product designer at DigitalOcean and noticed that while DO did a good job making it simple to create databases, there wasn't a modern solution to manage them afterwards. Often users had to use PHPMyAdmin, psql, or $insertDBGUIHere, and to be honest most of them do not provide the best user experience. They’re for a very technical audience, and fall short of making data accessible for everyone. We saw a need to do for data what DigitalOcean did with the droplet.<p>Brayden led an engineering team at Walmart and dealt with data at a completely different scale. He led the iOS, Android, and web teams for their amends experience and a lot of time was spent pulling, querying, and generating reports on that data. So when we talked about building this he was immediately in.<p>How it works: We have a React-based frontend that uses a combination of Sequelize and some native libraries to normalize the underlying SQL, which allows us to query and connect to different relational databases. Currently we support Postgres, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift. We don't store any of your end data—everything else is encrypted and all credentials are stored in KMS.<p>Tools like Outerbase make it possible for people to do their jobs more directly. One of our larger customers uses us as a way to moderate what gets posted to their app. Users submit data and our customer will actually go in and mark a column approved if the content is ok for their audience.<p>Outerbase is available to use today. You can try it for free with 1 user and then if you want to collaborate or use additional features you can upgrade to our pro tier or the obligatory “call us” enterprise tier.<p>We would love to hear your thoughts on the product, you can sign up today for free, use the sandbox database or connect your own! We know the space isn’t exactly uncrowded, but we hope our approach to building something that is intuitive and collaborative will make it easier for everyone to access their data. We know some HN users are not our target audience because they’re technical and already have tools they’re comfortable with—but even then you might want a tool so your team doesn’t have to bug you as much with data requests! We let you simply give them read access to their db and enable them to do their own queries.<p>We’d love to hear your views, opinions, experiences about this. What would you want to see from a database/data visualization tool? Looking forward to discussion in the comments!</p>

## Launch HN: Sidekick (YC W23) – AI support bot for developers
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184120](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184120)

<p>Hi Hacker News! We’re Jason and Ayan, the cofounders of Sidekick (<a href="https://www.getsidekick.ai/">https://www.getsidekick.ai/</a>). We made a GPT-driven bot for developers that runs in Slack and Discord and answers questions about your developer docs, while automatically keeping them up to date with new info. You can join our public Slack where you can ask Sidekick questions about Airbyte, a popular open source data connector catalog:
<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/sidekick-public/shared_invite/zt-1ra86qug3-~UWNCISLWpNj55Im6C6OaQ" rel="nofollow">https://join.slack.com/t/sidekick-public/shared_invite/zt-1r...</a><p>Or if you prefer to not sign up to our Slack, here's a demo video showing the same thing: <a href="https://youtu.be/fPhP1325RkI" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/fPhP1325RkI</a><p>We’re in the process of making everything open source (there are some contractual issues we’re working through), but our client side code and basic infra is here: <a href="https://github.com/ai-sidekick/sidekick">https://github.com/ai-sidekick/sidekick</a>.<p>Providing technical support to developers has been expensive for companies because they need to hire skilled engineers to do it. We’ve seen community support channels with a 2000:1 ratio of developers to support engineers - there’s no way every question will get answered. We built Sidekick to make this much easier. It’s particularly helpful for open-source companies/projects because many OSS communities have a lot of people asking questions, but hardly anyone helping troubleshoot.<p>We integrate with Slack and Discord, since that’s where developer support is already happening. On the backend, we use Weaviate to index the data and OpenAI’s text-davinci-3 model to generate responses.<p>In addition to answering questions, Sidekick can also update .md files automatically with new information. When someone reacts to a message in Slack with the emoji, Sidekick will use Weaviate to find the part in your documentation that’s most related to the message, then use GPT3 to merge the new info into the documentation. Finally, it will submit a pull request on Github with the changes. We saw that devrel teams are already making product announcements and helping users troubleshoot common issues in the community, so we built this feature to save them even more time.<p>We use GPT for generating the responses and new documentation, but are relying less and less on it after learning that you hit a ceiling on answer quality very quickly by using only GPT and prompt engineering techniques. Here’s some of what we learned trying to prevent hallucinations in our answers: <a href="https://medium.com/@jfan001/how-we-cut-the-rate-of-gpt-hallucinations-from-20-to-less-than-2-f3bfcc10e4ec" rel="nofollow">https://medium.com/@jfan001/how-we-cut-the-rate-of-gpt-hallu...</a><p>What we found makes a much bigger difference is the breadth and quality of the content you can search through, which is why we now rely a lot more on cleaning and annotating data, which yields far better results when combined with prompt chaining. For example, instead of naively chunking data into 1000 token blocks, we parse the markdown into semantically meaningful sections (e.g. paragraphs, lists, code blocks) and tag the content with the header name and document name so it’s more likely to surface for searches that are match for the section it’s from, even if it doesn’t exactly match the content in that chunk.<p>One fun thing we also learned is that when Sidekick gets added to a #help channel, people who otherwise wouldn’t ask questions start using it. It turns out, there are a lot of “lurkers” who come to these channels to find answers, but don’t want to bother anyone with their issue. Adding a tool that they can get answers from instantly brings these people out into the community, giving founders and community managers an opportunity to reach out to them.<p>To summarize, Sidekick 1) saves support engineers time, 2) keeps the docs up to date and 3) helps engage developers in the community. Long-term we want to provide an analytics product on top of Sidekick so companies can understand how their product is being used and where there are opportunities to add more value to their customers (and charge more money for it).<p>We’d love to hear from the HN community about this product! Do you think using a tool to search through and update developer docs from Slack would save you time?</p>

## Show HN: Quality News – Towards a fairer ranking algorithm for Hacker News
 - [https://news.social-protocols.org/top](https://news.social-protocols.org/top)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage
 - date published: 2023-03-16 15:37:09+00:00

<p>Hello HN!<p>TLDR;<p>- Quality News is a Hacker News client that provides additional data and insights on submissions, notably, the upvoteRate metric.<p>- We propose that this metric could be used to improve the Hacker News ranking score.<p>- In-depth explanation: <a href="https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme">https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme</a><p>The Hacker News ranking score is directly proportional to upvotes, which is a problem because it creates a feedback loop: higher rank leads to more upvotes leads to higher rank, and so on...<p><pre><code>                →
             ↗     ↘
    Higher Rank   More Upvotes
             ↖     ↙
                ←
</code></pre>
As a consequence, success on HN depends almost entirely on getting enough upvotes in the first hour or so to make the front page and get caught in this feedback loop. And getting these early upvotes is largely a matter of timing, luck, and moderator decisions. And so the best stories don't always make the front page, and the stories on the front page are not always the best.<p>Our proposed solution is to use upvoteRate instead of upvotes in the ranking formula. upvoteRate is an estimate of how much more or less likely users are to upvote a story compared to the average story, taking account how much attention the story as received, based on a history of the ranks and times at which it has been shown. You can read about how we calculate this metric in more detail here: <a href="https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme">https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme</a><p>About 1.5 years ago, we published an article with this basic idea of counteracting the rank-upvotes feedback loop by using attention as negative feedback. We received very valuable input from the HN community (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28391659" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28391659</a>). Quality News has been created based largely on this feedback.<p>Currently, Quality News shows the upvoteRate metric for live Hacker News data, as well as charts of the rank and upvote history of each story. We have not yet implemented an alternative ranking algorithm, because we don't have access to data on flags and moderator actions, which are a major component of the HN ranking score.<p>We'd love to see the Hacker News team experiment with the new formula, perhaps on an alternative front page. This will allow the community to evaluate whether the new ranking formula is an improvement over the current one.<p>We look forward discussing our approach with you!<p>Links:<p>Site: <a href="https://news.social-protocols.org/" rel="nofollow">https://news.social-protocols.org/</a><p>Readme: <a href="https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme">https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme</a><p>Previous Blog Post: <a href="https://felx.me/2021/08/29/improving-the-hacker-news-ranking-algorithm.html" rel="nofollow">https://felx.me/2021/08/29/improving-the-hacker-news-ranking...</a><p>Previous Discussion: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28391659" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28391659</a></p>

## Show HN: Chainloop, A Software Supply Chain Attestation solution devs won't hate

<p>Hi, my name is Miguel and I am very happy to share what's been months worth of work :)<p>The project has rough edges for sure, but any early feedback, comments or concerns are appreciated!<p>=== The Problem ===<p>You work on the Security and Operations (SecOps) team in charge of your organization's Software Supply Chain Security. You feel pretty good about the state of things already, your developer teams are signing their commits, deliverables, scanning for vulnerabilities,… Life is good!<p>Then you realize that you are not compliant with the latest security requirements. You get referred to slsa.dev and are told that you need to be at least level 3, whatever that means!<p>Aha! I “just” need to implement an attestation and artifact layer in our Software Supply Chain, which you complete after a couple of months of work.<p>Now to the easy part (or what you think). To make the developer teams adopt it.<p>You quickly realize that standardizing best practices and security requirements is very hard.  Development and SecOps team dynamics are clashy and poorly defined due to priorities mismatch. Also, from the developer's point of view, it’s very time-consuming and frustrating to pollute your CI/CD systems with convoluted, error-prone and complex processes to comply with the SecOps team.<p>So there has to be a better way that satisfies both sides...<p>=== The Solution ===<p>Enter Chainloop. You can think of it as an API for your organization's Software Supply Chain that both parties can use to interact effectively to meet their mismatched priorities.<p>SecOps teams regain security compliance, visibility, standardization and control by having a mechanism to define and propagate attestation requirements. Developers, on the other hand, get jargon-free tooling that can be used to meet compliance with minimum friction and effort.<p>=== Give it a try ===<p>Eager for feedback from the community so please reach out. Happy to chat!<p>Thanks!<p>PS: You can see an attestation end-to-end demo here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_0dlBqKtIU&amp;t=384s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_0dlBqKtIU&amp;t=384s</a></p>

## Tell HN: Chase shadow banned and closed my bank accounts
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35179427](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35179427)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage

<p>Yesterday someone tried to deposit money in my account and they were told my account was "closed". I logged into my account to see and everything looked normal, so I told them they probably had the number wrong and to try again. They went back the next day and got the same response. "Account is closed."<p>I called Chase today and was informed that my account was "locked". I asked why and how I could get it unlocked. They ended forwarding me multiple times and finally sent me to the Chase compliance department. They informed me again that the account was "locked" and said the account will be closed in a couple days. I asked why and they said your account has been flagged, they did a review and there is no way to reverse the decision. In addition, I am no longer allowed to open any new accounts. I asked what the reason was and they said "For compliance reasons we are not allowed to disclose the reason". They mentioned that the only way they could reverse the decision was to speak with a branch manager.<p>I immediately went to my local branch and spoke with my branch manager. After multiple phone calls by the manager to the Chase compliance department, she informed me there was no way to appeal and my account would be closed. In addition, my other checking and savings account will be closed in the next couple days and I won't be able to open any new accounts with Chase (new info). The bank manager said she has no power in this situation and doesn't even know the reason. If the compliance team decides something, the branch manager can't do anything.<p>I never even thought this was a possibility and I feel powerless. Anyone have any ideas of what I should do next? The crazy thing is that when they lock an account, it's frozen for 10-15 days and then when it's closed they send a check in the mail. My money is now being held hostage at Chase until they decide to send me a check.</p>
