In the time since then, the fate of the DC film universe--and content universe as a whole--has been turned on its head with James Gunn and Peter Safran taking over executive duties from Walter Hameda. While not a lot is known about where Gunn and Safran want to take DC's film universe, we do know that they are essentially burning the house that Zack Snyder and Geoff Johns built to the ground and starting (kind of) from scratch.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This brief lesson in Hollywood politics and inside baseball is all to say that Fury of the Gods has not only the pressure of a pandemic-delayed film but also the fate of the franchise on its shoulders. The question on the minds of viewers going into the theater is not just is the movie good or bad, but does Shazam: Fury of the Gods make a case for the Shazamily to live on? Kind of, but not really.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Shazam remains a bright spot of humor and heart within the dying DCEU. The second film keeps the comedy of teenagers morphing into the bodies of their super-powered, older alter-egos intact and manages to weave in a heartwarming backstory even more effectively than the first film. In the sequel, Billy (Asher Angel) is months away from turning 18 and aging out of the foster care system. Faced with the fear of being turned out of his newfound home once the state stops sending checks to his foster parents, Billy is ardently pushing for the Shazamily to fully mesh as a group and cement themselves as a family before circumstances tear them apart. Unfortunately, they each have individual interests and goals that don't leave them with much time or desire for teambuilding or family bonding. Trying to stick together only becomes more complicated when the three daughters of the vengeful god Atlas--played by Helen Mirren, Lucy Liu, and Rachel Zegler--arrive, ready to take the Shazamily's powers to restore their decaying world after being stuck there by the Wizard (Djmon Honsou).</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shazam-2-fury-of-the-gods-review-the-shazamily-lair-is-too-crowded/1900-6418046/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shazam-2-fury-of-the-gods-review-the-shazamily-lair-is-too-crowded/1900-6418046/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-16 18:44:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Destiny 2: Lightfall Update Fixes Invisible Guardian Bug, Reduces Commendations For Guardian Ranks", "description": "<p>A new patch for <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/\">Destiny 2</a> has gone live and addresses a number of issues that have popped up since the start of the Lightfall expansion.

The rest of the island is cool too, but many players know those places very well by now. So when it's time to pick your drop, it's pretty tough to resist going for the new places right now.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So, yes, we're going to focus more on newer locations on our list of this season's dopest drop spots. But don't worry--we haven't forgotten about the rest of the map, which still has plenty of great places to land. While most of the old spots are much more quiet than they used to be, that doesn't mean they're safe--wherever there are kind folks looking for a quiet landing, there are also spicy boys and girls hunting those folks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But let's not waste any more of your time with small talk. Here are the best current places to land on the Fortnite island in Chapter 4 Season 2.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. This skyscraper in Mega City with a little mall under it</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112879-fortnitechapter4season2bestlandingspotsmegacity.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Each of the large structures of Mega City have their own pros and cons that shift throughout the course of a round of battle royale, but when it comes to landing at the start, there's only been one choice for me. The building that you'll find on the map just south of the word \"Mega\" in Mega City isn't the tallest in town, but it's got enough loot for a full squad on the bottom floors, including a vending machine on the lowest level, and on the southern end there's a skyway to the next building, so you don't even have to go outside when it's time to move on.</p><p>And with the mall at the base being such a labyrinth, it's a great place to lose pursuit and pull an ambush--I've spent entire solo games holding this area down. So while landing directly in Mega City is always a bit risky, this building has worked consistently as a foothold for me. It <em>will</em> take you a few rounds to get a hang of the complicated layout, but once you do you'll have a big leg up on everybody else in town.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. The two medium-sized buildings at the top of the mountains east of Mega City</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112881-fortnitechapter4season2bestlandingspotsmountainarea.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>To the west of the new metropolis is a large mountain with a crater lake at the top, with a reboot van next to the water on the north side and two buildings on the crater rim to the south. There's plenty of loot for a squad to get basic loadouts here, <em>but also</em> the NPC who lives here, Neuralynx, sells Epic-quality Twin-Mag SMGs and small shields. So if you wanna make sure you have at least one excellent gun before you start fighting, this is the place to go.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. The beach to the southwest of Kenjutsu Crossing</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112878-fortnitechapter4season2bestlandingspotskenjutsucrossing.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">There are several spots in this season's new section of the map where you'll find dueling circles that have two guaranteed Kinetic Blades. But there's only one that I specifically like to head to straight from the battle bus: the one to the south of Kenjutsu Crossing. Once you grab your sword, dart along the coast to the west, where you'll find a beach that should have at least four treasure chests on it: two with a fishing boat that's sticking out of the sand, and either two or three at the end of the beach next to this fallen Sticks sign from the Chapter 3 map.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Then, near that is a small tower with two more treasure chests, four kegs of Slap and/or Slurp, several key chests, and a port-a\u2013toilet that will take you to an identical tower with an identical assortment of chests and kegs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, the loot is kinda spread out over this area, but that's what makes it an attractive spot--since it's at the very edge of the island, and since it doesn't look like there's anything there on the map, you'll frequently have this whole area to yourself.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. The small castle just north of the new race track</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112877-fortnitechapter4season2bestlandingspotsnorthofracetrack.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The race track itself, which is just north of Mega City, isn't a bad spot to drop on, but it's such a flat and open area that it can be a crap shoot. Not to mention that rooftop snipers from Mega City will have a clear view of the place if they look north--which is not <em>usually</em> a major threat, but I <em>did</em> get stuck in a tense three-way standoff with one other person at the track and a rooftop sniper one time in a solo round, and now I'm skittish about the place.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So instead of the track itself, I've preferred starting just outside the new biome to the north of the track, at one of the old small castles from last season. This spot has lots of Slurp and Slap kegs, plenty of loot to go around for your squad, and one of this season's only hirable NPCs, Remedy. Since it's outside the new biome and not a major POI, you'll probably have it to yourself for a while. And when you're geared up, you're just steps away from the border with the new part of the island, so you can head right in and tear it up.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Breakwater Bay, across the river from the main part of town</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112882-fortnitechapter4season2bestlandingspotsbreakwaterbay.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">If you want absolutely nothing to do with the new additions to the Fortnite island, then Breakwater Bay is your spot--it's at the far opposite end of the island. You should still exercise caution, however, when landing here, and that means dropping outside of the main part of town, to the east across the river. There are several houses here with plenty of gear for your crew, and anybody else who lands at Breakwater will probably go to the main part of town.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. The tower at Anvil Square</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112880-fortnitechapter4season2bestlandingspotsanvilsquare.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Anvil Square is much quieter than it used to be, but it's hardly a dead zone like some of the other holdover POIs from last season. <em>And</em> it remains the location that most players know the best, so you'll need to be careful when dropping here--that means that the tower on the northeastern end of town remains the best and most defensible spot to start at. If you can hold the tower, you can hold the town.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Under the bridge at the front of Brutal Bastion</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112883-fortnitechapter4season2bestlandingspotsbrutalbastion.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The front entrance of Brutal Bastion boasts a large bridge with a vending machine and a small secret room with Slurp kegs and buried treasure under it, with floor loot and other chests nearby outside the fortress. No matter if I'm playing alone or with a full squad of four, we always land on or under the bridge for starter loot before moving in on whoever else is around. There have been times where we had to fight for that spot, but it's been remarkably rare.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As a side note: Since, like everybody else, I've been primarily dropping in the new part of the island this season, I've been using the little hidey hole under the front of Brutal Bastion mostly as my beachhead when the storm takes me there later on. And it's worked very well in that capacity too.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-best-landing-spots-in-chapter-4-season-2/2900-4681/", "date_published": "2023-03-16 17:16:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Far Cry 5 Gets 60 FPS Update On PS5 And Xbox Series X|S", "description": "<p>Ubisoft announced that a patch is available for Far Cry 5 that enables 60fps on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

keyboard, plenty are designed with a traditional controller in mind. It\u2019s also a bit more comfortable to recline in your gaming chair and kick back with a controller, giving you an easier way to unwind with your favorite games. In 2023, there really is no shortage of PC controller options, largely because almost every controller designed for specific consoles also has built-in PC support. Essentially, PC users have their pick of the best controllers across all platforms. We've rounded up the best PC controllers in 2023.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Due to the plethora of possibilities, picking a PC controller can be somewhat challenging. Of course, if you own a console or two, you probably already have a great controller that will work well on PC. That said, you may want something with more features than the standard Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch controllers. PC users typically have more control over their gaming experience in general, so it makes sense to want a versatile PC controller. </p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-controllers-in-2023/1100-6496530/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-controllers-in-2023/1100-6496530/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-03-16 17:05:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "WoW Classic Hardcore Is Having A Surge In Popularity, And Blizzard May Have Taken Notice", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/\">World of Warcraft's</a> Classic Era realms could receive official \"hardcore\" servers in the future, if a since-deleted line of code found in the recent WoW 10.1 public test realm build is to be believed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">WoW Classic Era realms have seen a big uptick in players in the past few months thanks to a community \"hardcore\" challenge where dying even once in Blizzard's old-school MMORPG means that character gets deleted.

However, if it doesn't meet your standards, you can return the headset for free within 30 days.</p><p>The Inzone headsets released last year and serve as multiplatform devices that works on both PC and PS5. Note that these carry the Sony logo, not the PlayStation logo, and they're arguably a better fit for PC than PS5 (since you'll gain access to the 360 Spatial Sound to customize your listening experience). That being said, you'll get a lot of cool features regardless of what platform you hook these up to, including Tempest 3D audio support on PS5.

You\u2019ll also be treated to a premium design that takes strong cues from the new-gen console, up to 40 hours of runtime on a single charge, and a convenient, wireless connection that works via a USB dongle and Bluetooth. There\u2019s also a Discord-certified microphone that makes it easy to communicate with your teammates. </p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/314169461327?_trkparms=5079:5000006401\">See at eBay</a> </div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sony Inzone H9 Wireless Noise Canceling Headset</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4056449-h9.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>$229 ($<del>300</del>)</strong></p><p>The Inzone H9 is only seeing a discount of $71, which makes it worth considering.

From exploring flashbacks and introducing the series' iconic Witch Time mechanic in the original Bayonetta to jumping between timelines and magically restoring worn relics in Bayonetta 3, the games have always had a reverence for the passage of time and how it shapes our world. In a way then, it feels only natural that studio Platinum Games longed to take fans back to where it all began.

So while this episode may have been light on the plot we <em>thought</em> we were going to get this week--the redeemed Mando returns home--this thoroughly surprising tangent has so much other stuff for us to chew on.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Warning: The following contains spoilers for The Mandalorian Season 3, Episode 3, \"The Convert.\" If you want to avoid spoilers before you watch it, you should head over to <span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/1804712/564546/9358?subId1=subid_value&amp;u=https://www.disneyplus.com/\">Disney+</a> </span> to do that now.</strong></em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">As is usually the case with these things, Chapter 19 contained a bevy of references to the past of Star Wars--fortunately, though, not really in intrusive or overly obnoxious ways. We've got some visits to locations from past movies and shows that fit well, we've got offhand references to existing Star Wars items, like a cocktail drink, and we've got a major plot thread that takes a nugget from elsewhere in the canon and runs with it in a really cool and interesting way.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In other words, The Mandalorian seems to currently be in the process of finding its sweet spot on these franchise Easter eggs, opting for a mix of low-key nods and meaningful substance this time out. And it's working out really well, because the show is much improved in Season 3, at least so far. But enough rambling. Let's get to those Easter eggs.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. The New Republic Amnesty program</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112838-mandaloriantherapydroid.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>While the Amnesty program is technically a new thing, the entire concept is derived from the 2019 novel Alphabet Squadron, which is canon. That novel opens a month or two after the destruction of the second Death Star and focuses on an Imperial character defecting to the Rebel Alliance-turned-New Republic. This character, Yrica Quell, begins the story on a small colony nicknamed Traitor's Remorse that the Republic is using specifically for bringing in former Imperials and rehabilitating them, complete with a droid therapist/parole officer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Amnesty program we see on this week's The Mandalorian, which takes place years after Alphabet Squadron, is the more formal, institutional version of that program.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Photon Fizzle</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112845-photonfizzlethemandalorian.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The Photon Fizzle mentioned by Elia Kane in this week's episode is a cocktail that we first heard about in the animated Droids series from the 1980s, and that we first saw in Dex's Diner in Attack of the Clones, and that we learned how to make in the Black Spire Outpost Cookbook, which was released around the time of the openings for Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disney's theme parks. And, as you can probably tell by the image, Obi-Wan has to make one in the Attack of the Clones portion of the LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga video game.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Taungsday</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112844-taungsdaysamirightthemandalorian.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This is maybe the most obscure pull I've ever seen from a Star Wars thing. Taungsday--mentioned in a jokey \"Mondays, am I right?\" kind of way in this episode--is the third day of a Coruscant week, and this was established in a now-deleted blog for Hyperspace subscribers in 2009. And no Star Wars character had ever mentioned it in-universe before this episode of The Mandalorian. There's a lot more meaning to this name, though, than just its weird origin.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Taung, who are an alien species native to Coruscant, have no presence to speak of in the current Disney canon outside of this one bit, but they were important to the galaxy's history in the old Expanded Universe canon. Back then, the Taung lived on Coruscant before it was a planet-wide city, but they were largely supplanted by humans in ancient times before the Galactic Republic was formed with the planet as its capital.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When those ancient humans drove most of the Taung off Coruscant, they fled to the outer rim, where they stayed for centuries until a warlord united the entire species for a war of conquest against a new planet that would become their new birthright as a species. That planet was Mandalore, and these Taung were the original Mandalorians.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">None of that is part of the current Star Wars continuity, but we're talking about hundreds of thousands of years before the time of any Star Wars story. This doesn't have much bearing on the present so you could include this in your headcanon without it affecting anything else, really.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Some familiar Coruscant spots</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112840-themandalorianoldattackoftheclonesplaces.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Several locations from Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith and the Clone Wars animated series appear in early scenes with Dr. Pershing on Coruscant, such as the Senate plaza where he gives his speech and where he has his little meet-and-greet afterward. He also rides in an airspeeder taxi that is very similar, if not identical, to those seen in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Monument Plaza</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112841-themandaloriancoruscantmountaintop.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>While this location also appeared in Clone Wars, its history is more interesting than just that. This place began life as several pieces of Ralph McQuarrie concept art that were first seen in the Illustrated Star Wars Universe book and then incorporated into the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi in 1997. The end of that version of the film added several looks around the galaxy at folks celebrating the death of the Emperor, including Monument Plaza on Coruscant, where we see a statue of the Emperor being pulled down. All the big details about this, including the mountain peak that is the only place where the surface of Coruscant is visible, come from those old concept drawings.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6.

That it was a trap! This is an Easter egg because of who Pershing was pleading <em>to</em>: a doctor who is of the same species as Admiral Ackbar. Ha ha ha.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. That beefcake Mandalorian</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4112839-themandalorianbeefcake.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>We've seen this guy pop up on The Mandalorian here and there, and this time he's there to challenge Din Djarin and Bo-Katan when they arrive at the home of the Tribe at the end of this episode. He doesn't get his way this time, but he <em>does</em> have one of the oldest Mandalorian names: Vizsla. In the current continuity, Clan Vizsla was founded by Mandalore Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian Jedi and the creator of the Darksaber, and during the Clone Wars series Pre Vizsla was Mandalore for a time. This character's name has never been important on The Mandalorian, but the more involved Bo-Katan is in things, the more likely it's going to matter that a Vizsla is hanging around.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-mandalorian-season-3-episode-3-easter-eggs-7-things-you-missed-in-chapter-19-the-convert/2900-4680/", "date_published": "2023-03-16 01:06:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
