<p>With the arrival of the iPhone 14, Apple has <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3673100/the-quick-and-easy-guide-to-esim-on-apples-iphone-14.html">only sold smartphones with eSIM support in the US</a>. But that may be about to change. At least one analyst thinks Apple plans to extend eSIM use to Europe and some Asian markets by next year, when SIMs will be removed from its devices.</p><h2><strong>eSIM for the rest of us?</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve expected the move since Apple began with eSIM inside the iPhone in 2018, though consumers have complained at the complexity of setup in the US. In part, these challenges reflect inconsistent approaches to the tech across mobile carriers, but there could be a reason for that — particularly if Apple and Google begin to try to monetize carrier choice on new devices.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3691228/will-apple-switch-the-iphone-to-esim-only-everywhere-by-24.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Applications aimed at helping office workers do their jobs more effectively in a remote or hybrid work environment — such as videoconferencing, project management, and other collaboration software — have surged during the pandemic era. But many employees don’t spend their workdays sitting at a desk.</p><p>Employees who work away from a desk in such verticals as healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing, service and repair, transportation, logistics, construction, utilities, and retail are usually referred to as frontline workers. Many of these workers act as the “faces” of their organizations, coming into direct contact with customers; others perform the behind-the-scenes tasks that keep the modern world humming.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3690412/frontline-worker-apps-on-the-rise.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
