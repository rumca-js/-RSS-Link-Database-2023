## Australia’s ODI series in India may provide more questions than answers | Geoff Lemon

<p>The three games have been shoehorned in to make a few extra dollars and is unlikely to be instructive ahead of the World Cup</p><p>Afterthoughts don’t get much less thought than this. Australia’s Test series in India has come to an end after six weeks of scrutiny and emotion, probably leaving the visitors feeling a little satisfaction at some of the gains and a lot more frustration at the shortfalls that cost them a chance to win it. Now players have to switch focus immediately to one-day cricket. Steve Smith, Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Marnus Labuschagne, Travis Head and Mitchell Starc are the Test players staying on, with David Warner and Ashton Agar returning from a brief spell at home after leaving the Test tour partway through.</p><p>The company line is that this will be useful preparation for the 50-over World Cup in India later this year. That might mean something if Australia did not already have a three-match date in India in September for exactly that purpose. The later series has long been in the calendar, the current one was shoehorned in a couple months ago when it became clear that a few unexploited days could be manufactured between the Tests and the new season of the Indian Premier League. This was also around the time that Cricket Australia cited ethical concerns while cancelling a planned series against Afghanistan due in a similar late-March window.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/mar/17/australias-odi-series-in-india-may-provide-more-questions-than-answers">Continue reading...</a>

## Sporting shock Arsenal after Gonçalves wonder strike sets up shootout win

<p>This time the late drama did not go Arsenal’s way. They were below par for much of this match and were ultimately knocked out of the Europa League on penalties, Nuno Santos ramming in Sporting’s winner to prompt ecstatic celebrations after Gabriel Martinelli had seen the previous spot kick saved. Pedro Gonçalves had earlier equalised Granit Xhaka’s opener with a remarkable 50-yard strike; the Portuguese side earned their route to the last eight and Mikel Arteta’s players will, by way of consolation, feel free to focus on their title push.</p><p>Much of the talk in advance had been of Arteta’s rebranding of substitutes as “impacters”. There was certainly plenty in reserve here if he wished to use it but the starting lineup was, as ever, not too far off full fat. Even if Bukayo Saka was given a rare rest there was the sight of Gabriel Jesus, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/12/arsenal-gabriel-jesus-mikel-arteta-fulham-premier-league" title="">eased back in at Fulham</a> on Sunday, being returned to the XI; Martinelli, Xhaka and four of the preferred back five were also deployed, Ben White the only regular defender stood down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/16/arsenal-sporting-europa-league-last-16-report">Continue reading...</a>

## A Town Called Malice review – you don’t get more 1980s than this bloody crime drama

<p>Zippy, brash and so 80s it’s exhausting, this murder-packed gangland show is sheer mindless entertainment</p><p>Is it Peaky Blinders but 50 years on with cockney accents? Is it Gangs of London but 50 years ago with sunshine? Is it McMafia but worth watching? The answer is yes. Sky’s new drama series A Town Called Malice is, fairly unabashedly, a little bit of every crime family thriller of the past few years, this time set – completely unabashedly – in the 1980s.</p><p>I mean, goodness, is it the 80s. The show and each of the eight episodes is named after an 80s pop hit (don’t write in to tell me that Daddy Cool was ackcherly late 70s. Why be that person, when we all have so little time on the planet?) and almost every scene is accompanied by one of the era’s other big chart tunes, sometimes even with lip-synching from a character – who might be better off kept behind the fourth wall, allowing the series to hang on to its internal logic and vestiges of believability.</p><p>A Town Called Malice aired on Sky Max and is on Now TV.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/16/a-town-called-malice-review-you-dont-get-more-1980s-than-this-bloody-drama">Continue reading...</a>

## Nazanin review – the British government will make you lose your faith in humanity

<p>This forensic look at what happened when Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was imprisoned in Iran is incredibly moving – and a fury-causing indictment of Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson</p><p>Watching Nazanin, the documentary that chronicles Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s imprisonment in Iran and the fight to bring her home, is an emotional rollercoaster. The unwavering dedication of her husband, Richard, who campaigned to free her, the reunions for both with their daughter, Gabriella, and the hunger strikes that Richard and Nazanin endured are incredibly moving. But as the 75-minute film draws to a close, one emotion far surpasses all others: this film will make you furious.</p><p>Journalist turned director Darius Bazargan, best known for The Great Game: Iran versus USA, had intimate access to the family and shows them talking lovingly on the phone, Gabriella’s birthday celebrations and fruitless Zoom meetings with Dominic Raab, the then foreign secretary. This is intercut with interviews, and the well-circulated footage of her arrest and the family’s eventual tearful reunion. Zaghari-Ratcliffe narrates scenes, reading aloud letters to her daughter. Much of what she says is incredibly painful to hear. Images of her in a blissful cocoon of new motherhood are shown as she recalls the overwhelming joy of Gabriella’s birth and reflects sorrowfully: “My darling daughter. Those sweet and beautiful days didn’t last long. A trip to Iran in 2016 when you were 22 months was one of no return.”</p><p><em>Nazanin aired on Channel 4 and is available on All 4</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/16/nazanin-review-iran-channel-4">Continue reading...</a>

## Rashford strike eases Manchester United past Real Betis into last eight

<p>Two minutes before eight o’clock local time, the Benito Villamarín rose to its feet and began to applaud, 55,000 Real Betis fans then breaking into song. There was recognition there, and resignation too. Marcus Rashford had just sent an absurd shot spearing past Rui Silva to make him the Europa League’s top scorer and, they knew, take Manchester United through to the next round. They had always suspected as much and now it was confirmed. United were 1-0 up on the night, 5-1 on aggregate and it was done. And so they stood to applaud.</p><p>Ultimately, United would be able to ease into the next round, where they will surely be favourites. They did so without the one real risk they had faced, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, impressive here avoiding suspensions. In the end, their superiority told. The surprise was perhaps that there was only one goal: once United had found a way through, Harry Maguire would head over soon after, Wout Weghorst shot at Silva, and Jadon Sancho was sent clean through only to be ruled offside as Erik ten Haag’s side racked up 15 shots in the south of Spain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/16/rashford-strike-eases-manchester-united-past-real-betis-into-last-eight">Continue reading...</a>

## Tetris review – rise of 80s game makes for mostly entertaining drama

<p>An Apple TV+ movie tells the compelling story of how Tetris found its way out of Russia but adds a few too many flourishes</p><p>Hollywood’s lazy yet lucrative obsession with adapting material that carries a pre-awareness with it shows no obvious sign of abating and why would it given the ease that comes with marketing something new that automatically reminds so many of something old. But with other, more obvious barrel bottoms scraped, from comic books to video games, there’s been a recent rise in looking toward products and businesses instead and an attempt to turn Wikipedia backstories into compelling dramas.</p><p>Last year saw TV shows detailing the ups and downs of Uber and WeWork, upcoming films will focus on BlackBerry, Nike and Cheetos and this month sees a delve into the origins of Tetris, the deviously addictive game that quickly become a worldwide phenomenon. As hit-and-miss as these projects have often been, it is thankfully a more appealing prospect than a film based on the game itself, something that was threatened back in 2014 as an “epic sci-fi adventure” but has mercifully never been heard of since. Tetris, like many of the adjacent shows and films before it, is aiming for the same effect that The Social Network had back in 2010, slickly transforming the mechanical beats of a timeline into the smoother beats of a story, and like many of the adjacent shows and films before it, that becomes an impossibly high bar to meet. But it does a solid enough job trying to meet it, admirably attempting and failing to capture that same Sorkinesque snap, but proving entertaining enough to justify its existence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/16/tetris-movie-review-taron-egerton">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The chancellor wants to get more parents into work – but additional free hours won’t fix this broken system</p><p>On hearing that Jeremy Hunt plans to extend the offer of 30 free childcare hours to children under three, many parents will have breathed a collective sigh of relief. The prominence of childcare in his budget is evidence of how far opinion has shifted. Though a vital part of the economy, childcare has long been treated as a domestic issue. Parents have been expected to conjure up an additional salary for the luxury of being able to go to work. Provision is patchy, complicated and ruinously expensive.</p><p>Mr Hunt’s recognition of these facts was a welcome change in tone. But his offer, which would only come into full effect after the next election, treats childcare as a means to a single end: getting parents into work. Childcare isn’t just an economic growth issue. Early years education plays a crucial role in <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c818#:~:text=News-,Focus%20on%20early%20years%20will%20create%20fairer%20society,health%20inequality%2C%20Marmot%20review%20says&amp;amp;text=More%20public%20money%20should%20be,evidence%20based%20review%20has%20concluded." title="">targeting inequalities</a> and <a href="https://www.suttontrust.com/news-opinion/all-news-opinion/a-fair-start-how-the-government-can-tackle-inequalities-in-the-early-years/" title="">closing attainment gaps</a>. For this reason, quality matters as much as availability. Mr Hunt, like his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/07/liz-truss-should-focus-on-nursery-funding-not-staffing-ratios" title="">predecessors</a>, sees childcare primarily as a labour market tool. The risk is that simply expanding the number of free hours without reforming the childcare system will drive down quality. Moreover, limiting free hours to families where both parents work will cut out those who could also benefit, such as parents who are looking for jobs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/16/the-guardian-view-on-hunts-childcare-plans-jobs-arent-all-that-matter">Continue reading...</a>

## Swiss authorities only buy Credit Suisse time with £44bn loan | Nils Pratley

<p>Leisurely turnaround timetable can’t take many more setbacks after a crisis 10 years in the making</p><p>Midnight manoeuvres by central bankers don’t always work, but the Swiss National Bank clearly did the right thing by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/16/credit-suisse-takes-50bn-loan-from-swiss-central-bank-after-share-price-plunge">advancing a 50bn Swiss francs (£44bn) liquidity facility to beleaguered Credit Suisse</a>. The action has bought some time for everybody to breathe and take stock. Credit Suisse itself did its bit by <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/csg-announcement-202303.html">saying it would repurchase about $3bn (£2.5bn) of its own debt</a>, presumably at an enormous discount to face value, to improve its financial ratios.</p><p>As it happens, the bank’s liquidity ratios were reportedly fine anyway, but extra capacity still matters at a moment when the specific worry is depositors yanking their money. In any case, once Credit Suisse had asked for a new facility, the request had to be granted. Refusal would have been devastating. A globally systemic bank cannot be left to flap in the wind. Credit Suisse’s shares rebounded on Thursday (albeit a net fall of 15% over four days this week should be nobody’s idea of a triumph) and the wider European banking sector enjoyed a better day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/mar/16/swiss-authorities-44bn-loan-only-buys-credit-suisse-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New powers for Greater Manchester and the West Midlands to control funding point the way to genuine levelling up</p><p>Across great swathes of English local government, three lost years of levelling up have served principally to foster a growing sense of frustration, resentment and disappointment. The value of piecemeal pots of money made available by Westminster has been <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/regional-development/2023/01/levelling-up-funding-austerity-cuts" title="">dwarfed</a> by the impact of long-term austerity on council finances.

<p>From longer waiting lists to discouraging nursing applicants, the costs are huge – for patients and the service itself</p><p>When the mighty Royal College of Nursing walked out on its first ever national strike, there was never a doubt that the government would fold and offer a pay increase to NHS staff. Nurses could never be conveniently branded as “militants”, though at first, pathetically, the Tories tried it; nor did that epithet stick to the ambulance staff, physiotherapists and the rest who went on strike. Why did ministers waste all this time, with all those lost appointments and operations, inflicting extra suffering on patients while lengthening the politically damaging waiting lists?</p><p>It was blindingly obvious that NHS staff would require a better offer for this year when inflation topped 11%, as well as for next year.

There was a note of schadenfreude in Putin's voice as he gleefully touted the resilience of the Russian food sector.

He said: 'Turnip is a good product, but they would also probably have to go for turnips to Russia, because our level of the harvest, after all, significantly exceeds those figures of our neighbours in Europe.'</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/mar/16/come-to-russia-for-turnips-putin-mocks-western-vegetable-shortage-video">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Crime dramas such as Better, The Capture and Karen Pirie increasingly depict officers as corrupt. Given the scandals that have eroded confidence in British police, it’s no wonder</p><p>When I was recovering at home after a brief stint in hospital in 2021, I spent weeks watching British crime dramas. I became adept at telling the red-herrings from the genuine clues, and the wrong ’uns from the unfairly accused. I didn’t care that these shows were often formulaic. In fact, that was part of the appeal.</p><p>Increasingly, that formula includes the bent copper. This week, BBC One aired the finale of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/13/better-review-this-moreish-bent-copper-show-gets-stronger-and-stronger">Better</a><em>, </em>its latest contribution to the medium-budget crime mini-drama canon.

Last year, ITV’s Karen Pirie ended with a Fife police chief being unmasked as the murderer of a St Andrews barmaid.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/16/better-karen-pirie-the-capture-why-tv-is-filled-with-bent-coppers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the US, Biden has assured voters that no taxpayer money would go to at-risk banks, but trust in the system relies on such support</p><p>Banks are a special type of organisation. They take deposits and lend these funds to borrowers over long periods. It is pretty remarkable when you think about it. Banks make loans over many years, but you and I can withdraw the savings that banks use to fund the loans instantly.</p><p>For banks to operate this franchise model profitably, they essentially rely on two ingredients. First, they need to earn a profit by charging <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/01/bank-of-england-interest-rates-andrew-bailey">higher interest</a> on long-term loans than they pay on short-term deposits. This model has come under severe strain in recent years. Owing to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/14/uk-wage-growth-inflation-employment-ons">high inflation</a> now and lower expected inflation in the next few years, many banks currently pay more for deposits and other funds than they earn on long-term loans and other assets.

<p><strong>(Pentatone)</strong> <br />Superlative renditions of the composer’s two string quartets illuminate his musical transition from communist Hungary to the western avant garde</p><p>Some 15 years separate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/aug/27/gyorgy-ligeti-contemporary-music-guide">György Ligeti</a>’s two numbered string quartets, and stylistically they belong to strikingly different phases of his creative career. The First, subtitled “Métamorphoses nocturnes”, was begun in 1953, when Ligeti was still living in his native Hungary, where socialist realism had been the rule for composers since the communist takeover five years earlier. By the time he came to write the Second he was based in western Europe, having left his native country during <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2021/oct/13/hungarian-revolution-begins-october-1956">the uprising of 1956</a>.</p><p>Heard in succession, the two quartets demonstrate where the mature works came from, and the newly minted musical world which they then inhabited – the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/bela-bartok">Bartókian</a> gestures of the 12 tiny movements of the First, already chafing against authoritarian stylistic prescriptions, are replaced in the Second by the shifting textures, interlocking mechanisms and harmonic sleights of hand with which Ligeti established his distinctive niche among the postwar avant garde. Sadly he never completed a quartet during the remarkable third period of his career, though after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/14/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries">his death</a> in 2006, sketches for two such works were found among his papers, apparently intended for the Arditti and Kronos Quartets respectively.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/16/ligeti-metamorphoses-review-quatuor-diotima">Continue reading...</a>

## Where will the budget's magic nursery places come from, Jeremy Hunt? | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett

<p>The chancellor’s early-years promise may seem a tasty carrot for voters, but most of it won’t be delivered until after an election</p><p>Wednesday’s budget announcement represents the largest ever expansion of free childcare that England has ever seen, and from a Tory government. I can’t believe that I actually typed that sentence. Extending the 30 free childcare hours to children aged nine months to two years <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/mar/15/hunts-4bn-childcare-boost-welcomed-but-fears-remain-for-struggling-sector">will cost £4bn</a> and will, the chancellor claims, cut families’ childcare costs by 60%. Combined with the intention to increase the availability of wraparound care for parents of school-age children, it could be the news that many campaigners and parents have been waiting for.</p><p>When you live in the UK and you start thinking about having a child, or are perhaps already pregnant with one, there is, I think, a moment when you look into what the childcare offer is and realise, with a sinking heart, that between the ages of nine months and three years old you’re basically on your own. Although it’s often necessary to work full-time, as most modern households require two incomes. So unless you have family support, you’re going to need to pay someone if you wish to return to the workplace. And with the second most expensive childcare system in the world and nursery waiting lists that can last years (one couple I know just paid £14,000 upfront for a child that has yet to be conceived but don’t worry, they refund you if you don’t get pregnant): good luck!</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/16/budget-childcare-nursery-jeremy-hunt-chancellor-early-years-voters">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>AO Arena, Manchester</strong><br />The veteran rapper may now be walking a fine line between parody and pantomime, but his California flow and copper-bottomed classics remain irresistible</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/snoopdogg">Snoop Dogg</a>’s 31-year career has seen an array of incarnations including gamechanging Doggystyle gangsta rapper, moral panic instigator, actor, chef, film-maker and anti-gun campaigner. He markets cannabis and coffee, makes food delivery adverts and once underwent a bizarre reggae incarnation as Snoop Lion. Tonight, though, he gets back to the day job of veteran rap showman. The 90-minute, 30-song performance begins with the icon walking out in his trademark braids and puffing on a blunt. With pungent weed smoke hanging over the audience, the Dogg certainly knows his vast, multi-generational crowd. “Does anyone want to get fucked up with the Dogg?” he asks, and 21,500 voices chant that yes, actually, they do.</p><p>It’s that type of show: an unreconstructed, unrepentant and slightly pantomime showcase of Snoop’s career and old-school 90s/00s hip-hop, complete with turntables, rap crews, a gun spraying dollar bills and an able support act in Eminem’s old homies, D12. At the centre, though, is what started all this: Dogg’s inimitable, instantly recognisable California flow and iconic if slightly cartoonish stage persona. He’s 51 and looks older, but has never lost his endearing, mischievous grin at the ridiculousness of where life has taken him, whether guesting with Katy Perry (California Gurls) or suggesting a song called Wet for Prince William’s stag do: an unexpected guilty pleasure tonight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/16/snoop-dogg-review-rap-icon-still-dropping-it-like-its-hot">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A vase with some pears? A jug with some bananas? <em>Cutlery?</em> Are you kidding? Painters of still lifes have a lot to answer for – and today’s new breed would be better off tackling air fryers or discarded Deliveroo packaging</p><p></p><p></p><p>High up on the wall in the first room of the Tate Modern’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/oct/09/cezanne-tate-modern-london-review-a-mesmerising-master-of-mystery">blockbuster Cézanne exhibition</a>, there was a quote from the revered postimpressionist: “With an apple, I shall astonish Paris.” To which, surely, the only response is: “OK mate. Nobody has ever been astonished by an apple. Least of all Parisians, who tend to greet most things with a Gallic shrug.”</p><p>There is no doubt that Cézanne was extremely influential and did, indeed, astonish. The very fact a 19th-century artist was being shown at the Tate’s modern arm is down to his avant garde impact on cubism and beyond.

## Tunnock’s tea cakes, Depeche Mode and non-stop smoking – how TV is bringing the 80s to life

<p>From specialising in retro criminal lingo to buying 100-year-old Christmas decorations, a batch of new dramas are obsessively reincarnating the 80s. Not that they always get it right…</p><p>It’s all too easy to take period drama for granted. Flick on the TV, open your laptop, and there you are: transported to a world that is at once foreign and deeply familiar. But how do you go about building a small-screen vision of the past? And what if that past isn’t from centuries ago, but within many viewers’ lifetimes? This spring, a series of dramas is doing just that – bringing the early 80s back to life. According to the people behind them, it’s a process that is at once trickier, less pernickety and a lot more Judith Chalmers-based than you might imagine.</p><p>When Neil Forsyth began writing The Gold, the BBC’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/12/the-gold-review-a-24-carat-drama-about-one-of-the-uks-most-shocking-robberies">excellent dramatisation of the fallout from the 1983 Brink’s-Mat robbery</a>, he turned to the wealth of documentary footage about the crime from the time. Yet he soon found that the key to writing realistic dialogue was not to mimic unnaturally formal appearances on news reports, but to immerse himself in “fly-on-the-wall, street-level documentaries with normal people talking in an unguarded, unfiltered way”. A crucial influence was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0074tkn/40-minutes-heart-of-the-angel">The Heart of the Angel, a 1989 documentary</a> about the last days of Angel tube station before it was renovated, which features “a lot of real London voices”, says Forsyth. “You spot little bits of language that aren’t widely used now and you leap on them because they feel very real.” (One distinctive period term he came across during his research was “villain”, which is used repeatedly in The Gold to denote a certain type of dyed-in-the-wool criminal, distinct from the financially dodgy Thatcher’s children on the make.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/16/tunnocks-tea-cakes-depeche-mode-and-non-stop-smoking-how-tv-is-bringing-the-80s-to-life">Continue reading...</a>

A confession for all 13 was secured from one Albert DeSalvo, but with forensic evidence linking him to only the last victim. Just four years after DeSalvo conviction, Tony Curtis famously went against his dreamboat image <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Strangler_(film)">by playing him in a brassy film</a> with Henry Fonda as the detective on his trail.</p><p>This version tries getting to grips with the possibility of multiple culprits and that the Boston Strangler was in fact a misogynist hivemind phenomenon. It moreover tells the story of the women whose role has almost been forgotten: two tough, resourceful journalists, Loretta McLaughlin (Knightley) and Jean Cole (Coon), who first christened the killer “The Boston Strangler” and whose fiercely persistent reporting for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald#The_Boston_Herald_Traveler_and_Record_American">Record American</a> (a paper later merged into the Boston Herald) forced the cops and city hall to take notice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/16/boston-strangler-review-keira-knightley-serial-killer-story-tells-fierce-tale">Continue reading...</a>

## Behind the fanfare of James Cleverly’s visit to Sierra Leone, the need to restore aid is starkly apparent

<p>The foreign secretary received a warm welcome in the country of his mother’s birth but critics say the slashing of aid budgets undermines the message of support for women and girls</p><p>In the lush garden of the British High Commission in Sierra Leone, the UK foreign secretary James Cleverly addressed a gathering of mostly female politicians, campaigners and entrepreneurs: “You cannot have a successful country without successful women. The future of this country rests on the shoulders of strong, powerful women. You are the future of this country.”</p><p>It was International Women’s Day and Cleverly’s speech last week was the culmination of a whistlestop tour of his late mother’s birthplace. Earlier that day he had been welcomed to the southern city of Bo, the second largest in the country, by hundreds of people riding motorbikes and wearing T-shirts bearing the message: “The people of Bo Town warmly welcome Rt Hon James Cleverly.” Car horns were honked, schoolchildren and brass bands lined the road, and anxious radio exchanges were going on between the official cars as Foreign Office staff worried about the delay to the tight schedule.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/16/behind-the-fanfare-of-james-cleverlys-visit-to-sierra-leone-the-need-to-restore-aid-is-starkly-apparent">Continue reading...</a>

## Quentin Tarantino’s next film is about a film critic: should I be scared? | Peter Bradshaw

<p>The director’s last film is rumoured to centre on the life of New Yorker film writer Pauline Kael – if true, her 1970s face-off with Warren Beatty would make a thrilling plot line</p><p>How intriguing to hear that Quentin Tarantino’s new film is going to be about a film critic – the news has sent all of us in the film-critic community into a nervy tizzy of pre-emptive gags and warily dismissive tweets about what this means for the discourse. And The Movie Critic (a working title?) is reportedly to be Tarantino’s final film, his signoff. It’s no surprise that this fanatically encyclopaedic cinephile wanted this film to be set within the film world – but it’s not about a movie actor or a movie producer or a movie director, but a movie <em>critic</em>, surely a hilariously marginal, impotent and parasitical figure, who deserves no more than a walk-on part at best?</p><p>Well, the word is that this isn’t just any old film critic, but one based on the most famous film critic of all – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/13/the-warrior-critic-in-praise-of-pauline-kael">Pauline Kael</a>, the New Yorker’s legendary star. If true, it means that Tarantino faces the male-gaze challenge of creating a film around a woman who isn’t sexualised in any way, an intellectual blackbelt who saw off condescension from entitled men, like rival critic Andrew Sarris with whom she clashed on the ostensible issue of auteurism, but also, she suspected, the issue of men having a hard time debating a woman. Pauline Kael isn’t going to be putting her bare feet up on the car dashboard in this film. At least I don’t think so.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/16/quentin-tarantino-next-film-critic-pauline-kael">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve found so many life-enhancing kitchen utensils on Instagram that I’ll have to share them with you. It’s the thoughtlessness that counts</p><p>Sometimes, in pursuit of a better life, I turn to the ads on Instagram, because the world is always better there. It has the gloss you get off a coffee table that’s just had a polish after a spray of Mr Sheen. When you look at Instagram you hope to see your own face reflected back at you, only prettier. For here are an array of devices specifically engineered to make working in the kitchen a more blissful experience; a place where you can cook un-aproned in a white shirt and never get stained; where your hair will always be glossy, and your mood so serene that Buddhist monks will tap you up for wisdom. I trust Instagram. Perhaps, as Mother’s Day is upon us, you have considered having a browse here too for gifts. Because as we all know, it’s the thoughtlessness that counts.</p><p>A chef friend of mine has a cast-iron rule that no gadget in his kitchen can have a single use. His rice cooker is also a slow cooker. The toastie maker can be used to grill vegetables. The frying pan can be used to smack intruders across the head, and so on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/16/i-dont-need-more-gadgets-in-my-kitchen-jay-rayner">Continue reading...</a>

## U2 Songs of Surrender review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week

<p><strong>(Island/Interscope)</strong><br />In a typically grand gesture, 40 songs are picked by the band for muted acoustic treatments, with varying degrees of success</p><p>U2 have always dealt in grand gestures. No other rock artists from the world of post-punk chased megastardom with the same missionary zeal: they seldom made any bones about wanting to be the biggest band in the world, something they duly achieved in grandstanding style. Their tours have involved everything from stage sets so big they required aircraft warning lights to prank calling the White House to the highest-resolution video screen ever seen at a gig: the most recent one grossed $390m. Even when they screw up, it’s on a monumental scale: the PopMart tour of 1998, with its malfunctioning 40ft motorised mirrorball – or <a href="https://norselandsrock.com/when-u2-got-trapped-inside-a-giant-lemon/">was it a giant lemon?</a> – that got stuck; the debacle of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/free-u2-album-how-the-most-generous-giveaway-in-music-history-turned-into-a-pr-disaster-9745028.html">Songs of Innocence’s unexpected appearance</a> in 500 million iTunes users’ libraries.</p><p>So perhaps it’s unsurprising that what should theoretically be a low-key project – reworking their back catalogue in muted, largely acoustic style – has turned into an epic undertaking. Songs of Surrender is 40 tracks long and lasts the best part of three hours. So much for understatement. Neither a greatest hits nor a selection of deep cuts, its title suggests a link to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/06/surrender-40-songs-one-story-by-bono-review-from-boy-to-mandela">Bono’s recent autobiography</a>, Surrender, its 40 chapters each named after a U2 song – but that’s not quite the case. Picked by all four members, 11 of Songs of Surrender’s tracks don’t appear in Bono’s book. The main takeaway from its tracklisting is that U2 think Songs of Innocence was underrated, its contents drowned out by the iTunes controversy: it has a stronger presence here than any other album.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/16/u2-songs-of-surrender-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The biggest ever update to Spotify’s app is set to bring artists and fans closer together.

These updates, which are being rolled out to users in the UK in the coming weeks, include the ability for artists to add 30-second videos to their pages, target superfans with special releases, and give higher profile placement to merchandising and gig tickets.

## The Tories keep bottling their push for more grammar schools. Is it because they know they don’t work?   | Lola Okolosie

<p>England’s existing grammars cream off the most able students from privileged backgrounds, yet their results are only marginally better</p><p>Five years into the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/memorandum-of-understanding-between-dfe-and-grammar-school-heads-association">government’s drive</a> to make grammar schools more inclusive, the results are mixed at best. An investigation <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-64714201">by the BBC</a> revealed that a quarter of England’s 160 grammar schools remain woefully behind in offering places to disadvantaged children – who still make up less than 5% of the student body. Fewer still will have a special educational need.</p><p>But any push for inclusivity, well meaning as it may seem, is still based on a mistaken assumption: that grammars are intrinsically better than comprehensives; that they are bastions of old-world excellence that get the very best out of their students. Ever since Labour banned the creation of new grammar schools in 1998, those on the right have argued that grammars are the silver bullet with which that pernicious demon, lack of social mobility, can be vanquished.</p><p>Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and writer focusing on race, politics, education and feminism</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/16/grammar-schools-inclusivity-england-students-results">Continue reading...</a>

All of the 200 or so attendees –peasants, conservationists and journalists – would have taken something different from this remarkably Amazonian service, but for me it brought home how the murdered British journalist Dom Phillips is undergoing his own transformation from a journalistic colleague, self-effacing friend and drinking mate into an internationally recognised icon of freedom of expression and the fightback in the war against nature. He and the Brazilian indigenous expert Bruno Pereira now stand alongside Stang and hundreds of others in the pantheon of martyrs of the rainforest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/16/my-mate-dom-phillips-joins-the-rainforest-martyrs-amazon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A federal judge is poised to restrict mifepristone – even though the drug has been safely and effectively used in the US for more than 20 years</p><p>This week a Republican-appointed federal judge weighed whether to grant an injunction that could remove mifepristone, the drug used in most American abortions, from the market nationwide.

In <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/judge-kacsmaryk-mifepristone-abortion-secret">a conference call</a> with lawyers for the anti-choice groups and the Department of Justice, Kacsmaryk asked attorneys not to disclose the existence of the hearing (“This is not a gag order,” he said repeatedly), and said that the event would only be made public late on Tuesday to minimize popular awareness. “It may even be after business hours.” The judge’s courtroom in Amarillo, Texas, is hours away from any major city.

<p>The artist makes a powerful case for a natural way of living in a mindful present</p><p>Time took on an elastic and sinuous quality during the Covid-19 lockdowns, if it retained any coherence at all. Days bled into each other, as did walks and Zoom catchups and Sopranos episodes. Feeling a sense of “temporal weirdness”, California artist and writer Jenny Odell set up a camera on a tripod facing her window. “Time felt the same in my room, but in the photos, it rained, it stormed, and the fog rolled in from San Francisco,” she recalls. Flicking through the photos, Odell encountered a mysterious emotion that she calls “it”: an experience of being taken out of the present moment, with all that was familiar rendered strange and changeable, and wide vistas of possibility opened up.</p><p>This feeling of “it” – the sense that everything and everyone could at any moment be made anew – runs through her cultural and political meditation, Saving Time. Odell, who previously critiqued the attention economy in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/02/jenny-odell-how-to-do-nothing-attention" title="">How to Do Nothing</a>, sets the stakes high for her new investigation. Observing that popular attitudes to time – as, say, an unrelenting march towards inevitable climate apocalypse – encourage a self-fulfilling nihilism, she proposes a different model, more attuned to the natural world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/16/saving-time-by-jenny-odell-review-clocking-off">Continue reading...</a>

## After Lionesses roar, UK’s pledge on school physical education is a whimper | Cath Bishop

<p>Government’s response to demand for Euros to have a legacy wafts at school sport structures that were not fit for purpose</p><p>Wasn’t it brilliant to see the Lionesses back on our screens recently, dribbling balls with schoolgirls outside No 10 Downing Street as the government responded to their campaign to improve PE? They are truly inspirational players and people. It felt good to relive the highs of the Euros last summer, stuck in this never-ending winter. But before we all sink into a huge sigh of relief that our children’s health is fixed and England’s entitlement to win major football trophies in perpetuity sorted, we must pause and question what’s actually changed and whether this will improve the country’s long-term health.</p><p>Firstly, why does it take a sustained high-profile campaign from England’s elite women footballers to get the government to address something so fundamental to health? Secondly, on a closer look, what has actually changed? In England and Scotland there is already government guidance that schools should provide a minimum of two hours of physical education a week. The funding announced is not new – it continues existing levels of Primary PE and Sport Premium funding (now confirmed so late, many schools already had plans to reduce sports provision). There is nothing additional to support the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/08/government-pledges-equal-access-to-school-pe-sports-for-boys-and-girls" title="">“equal access” commitment</a> despite confused reporting suggesting there is. And the outdated existing model and concept of PE remains unfit for purpose, and another opportunity is missed to connect PE into a broader perspective and proactive strategy towards health.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/16/uk-government-pledge-school-physical-education-whimper">Continue reading...</a>

## Weight Watchers wins when our diets fail – it won't change society's broken thinking around food | Susie Orbach

## Dormant volcanoes and working monorails: the grand designs of Ken Adam, master of the Bond-villain lair

<p>A new book celebrates the late production designer whose elaborate concepts for films from Bond to Dr Strangelove influenced the likes of Norman Foster – and it all started with a felt-tip</p><p>Villains hiding out in underground lairs, councils of war meeting at spotlit circular tables, bank vaults full of gold bullion piled high. The popular imagination of what these secret, off-limits places might look like has been shaped, more than anything else, by the dramatic visions of the late production designer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/11/sir-ken-adam-obituary" title="">Ken Adam</a>. <br /><br />As the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2016/mar/11/james-bond-production-designer-ken-adam-a-career-in-pictures">creative mind behind</a> seven James Bond films across the 60s and 70s, and numerous other movies, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/15/dr-strangelove-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb-review-stanley-kubrick-peter-sellers" title="">Dr Strangelove</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/aug/20/why-i-love-wednesday-addams-thanksgiving-play" title="">Addams Family Values</a>, Adam dreamed up the look of nuclear submarine bases, mountain laboratories, hi-tech space stations, glamorous Las Vegas penthouses, and missile launchers hidden inside volcanoes. In doing so, he built some of the most memorable and influential spaces, not only in the history of cinema but also in the history of architecture, real or imagined.</p><p>Today, his influence can be felt whenever you walk into a soaring office atrium, take a vertiginous escalator ride into a cavernous subway station, or even get shuttled through a tunnel between airport terminals. He was the master of a style he termed “heightened reality”, taking everyday spaces and giving them a theatrical, supercharged glamour.<br /><br />Countless architects have copied it since. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/03/lord-norman-foster-i-still-get-the-same-buzz-from-designing-buildings-" title="">Norman Foster</a>’s design for the cone-shaped room at the top of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/oct/18/architecture.regeneration">Gherkin</a> is perhaps the most Adam-esque space in London; his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/25/artnews.architecture">Faustino winery</a> in Spain could be a Bond baddie’s lair. A longtime fan, Foster once described Adam as “a master of space and light”, who realised the kinds of spaces that the 18th-century architectural draughtsmen-dreamers, like Giovanni Piranesi and Étienne-Louis Boullée, had only imagined. “Those legendary architectural figures” had “hypothesised visually, graphically, environments of awesome power”, he said. “Ken Adam builds them.” <br /><br />Seven years after his death, the workings behind the magic have been brought together in a mammoth new book, The Ken Adam Archive, featuring interviews and production sketches from some of the 70 completed and 15 unrealised projects that he worked on over his 50-year career. Weighing in at 4kg, with the dimensions and heft of a paving slab, it feels like a suitably colossal tome to mark the mind behind the most ambitious film sets ever built.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/16/ken-adam-bond-dr-strangelove-set-designer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If Manchester United had Muslim or Asian representation in the 1990s, an extract from a new book says, it could have led to great things for a generation of youngsters</p><p>I sometimes wonder what it would have been like to have an Asian football role model growing up. How would that feel? How amazing would it be? To have a brown footballer to look up to and maybe even aspire to emulate. When the hype started around Manchester United’s Class of 92 – winning the FA Youth Cup against Crystal Palace in 1992; losing in the final against Leeds in 1993; one by one making a name for themselves in the first team – I felt a huge sense of pride and emotional investment in them. Of course there tends to be a collective soft spot among fans for players who’ve graduated through the academy, but for me it wasn’t really that.</p><p>They were older than me, so I wasn’t going easy on the kids. For me it was more that a lot of them were local. I’d read all about the Busby Babes in the books I’d borrowed from the library and bought for a pittance at jumble sales. I knew that a fair few of them were local lads too. Then with the Class of 92 there was this sudden arrival of similarly local lads in the first team. Paul Scholes was born in Salford; Nicky Butt was from Gorton; and Phil and Gary Neville were from Bury, where I went to school. Even Ryan Giggs sounded like he was from here with his Swinton accent. Granted David Beckham was from Essex and sounded extremely Essex but he had a fanny parting and wore baggy jeans so he was basically an honorary Manc.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/16/inshallah-united-if-only-the-class-of-92-had-a-nassar-butt-instead-of-nicky-nooruddean-choudry">Continue reading...</a>

## Tomás Nevinson by Javier Marías review – the final mystery

<p>The last novel from the late Spanish author is a mesmerising addition to his world of spies and lies</p><p>There is an irony in this novel’s title being the name of its protagonist/narrator. Tomás Nevinson has had many personae. He sometimes loses track of which character he is inhabiting. In the long middle section, when he is living undercover in a provincial Spanish city where his true identity (he hopes) is unknown to anyone, his narrative slips unpredictably from first person to third. He is “I”: Tomás, an Anglo-Spanish British secret agent with a complicated history containing lethal violence, enforced disappearances and betrayed love. But then in the very next sentence he is “he”: Miguel Centurión, an innocuous-seeming all-Spanish schoolteacher. Whoever he is, though, Tomás/Miguel has been sent to watch three women, one of whom he may be required to kill.</p><p>This is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/15/javier-marias-obituary">Javier Marías</a>’s last book. Or, more accurately, it is the last part we will get of a composite work the late and much lamented author was writing for decades. It’s not a sequel or a prequel to its predecessors – those words imply a narrative progression quite alien to the way Marías operated. He preferred the phrase “companion piece”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/16/tomas-nevinson-by-javier-marias-review-the-final-mystery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There are two kinds of people pedalling those ungainly bikes you see everywhere – and only one can afford the price tag</p><p>Some time in the early years of this century a new kind of bicycle, or rather tricycle, appeared on the roads around me. They were big, heavy things with open wooden boxes bolted on the front. In these boxes sat a small child or two being transported to or from nursery or primary or prep school. In the saddle perched a pedalling parent, red of cheek and heavy of breath. The determined look on their faces conveyed something along the muttered lines of: “This is a good idea, the right thing to do – good for the kids and good for me,” repeated with every revolution of the pedals.</p><p>To my mind, though undoubtedly noble in purpose, these machines were a worry. They looked a bit Heath Robinson to me, like something my dad might have cobbled together for my brother and me to lark about with. The kids in the box always looked so vulnerable, sitting there at white-van exhaust-pipe height. And unless the parent was super-fit, pedalling miles every morning, I couldn’t see how they were an alternative to car use. More likely they were an alternative to walking. Not for me.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/16/3999-for-a-cargo-bike-how-a-new-kind-of-class-politics-arrived-on-britains-streets">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Artificial intelligence in its current form is based on the wholesale appropriation of existing culture, and the notion that it is actually intelligent could be actively dangerous</p><p>In January 2021, the artificial intelligence research laboratory OpenAI gave a limited release to a piece of <a href="https://openai.com/research/dall-e" title="">software called Dall-E</a>. The software allowed users to enter a simple description of an image they had in their mind and, after a brief pause, the software would produce an almost uncannily good interpretation of their suggestion, worthy of a jobbing illustrator or Adobe-proficient designer – but much faster, and for free. Typing in, for example, “a pig with wings flying over the moon, illustrated by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry” resulted, after a minute or two of processing, in something reminiscent of the patchy but recognisable watercolour brushes of the creator of The Little Prince.</p><p>A year or so later, when the software got a wider release, the internet went wild. Social media was flooded with all sorts of bizarre and wondrous creations, an exuberant hodgepodge of fantasies and artistic styles. And a few months later it happened again, this time with language, and a product called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/05/what-is-ai-chatbot-phenomenon-chatgpt-and-could-it-replace-humans" title="">ChatGPT</a>, also produced by OpenAI. Ask ChatGPT to produce a summary of the Book of Job in the style of the poet Allen Ginsberg and it would come up with a reasonable attempt in a few seconds. Ask it to render Ginsberg’s poem Howl in the form of a management consultant’s slide deck presentation and it would do that too. The abilities of these programs to conjure up strange new worlds in words and pictures alike entranced the public, and the desire to have a go oneself produced a growing literature on the ins and outs of making the best use of these tools, and particularly how to structure inputs to get the most interesting outcomes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/the-stupidity-of-ai-artificial-intelligence-dall-e-chatgpt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From sleeping rough in Paris to being cast as a slave three times in five years, the Shazam! star is no stranger to hardship. Will Hollywood finally give him the great roles he so clearly deserves?<strong><br /></strong></p><p>The extraordinary story of Djimon Hounsou began in the 70s with a weekly hunt for five empty Omo detergent sacks. The prize on offer: one free ticket at the local cinema in Cotonou, Benin. The recycling scheme made the cinema the place to be every Wednesday, when Hounsou and his schoolmates had the afternoon off, so tracking down the packages was a priority: asking family, door-knocking neighbours and riffling through rubbish. Regardless, every Wednesday afternoon, the cinema was rammed.</p><p>“You’d have the theatre packed all the way to the bathroom; all kids,” says Hounsou. “I remember vividly: sometimes you would be in the back of the theatre and you couldn’t see the screen. But you could hear it. These were cowboy films coming from America and all you could hear were the shoes and the spurs. The sounds were like a dagger; it really pierced your inspiration.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/16/i-felt-seriously-cheated-djimon-hounsou-on-the-oscars-poor-pay-days-stardom-and-struggle">Continue reading...</a>
