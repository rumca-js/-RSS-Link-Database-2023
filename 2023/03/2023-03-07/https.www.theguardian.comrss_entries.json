Despite carrying a maximum two-year sentence, indecent exposure is still too easily brushed off as an unpleasant but ultimately inconsequential act. The stereotypical image of a man in a mac, and even the language of \u201cflashing\u201d, diminish the seriousness of this crime and make it easy to trivialise. Couzens\u2019s offences are further proof that such crimes can be precursors to more dangerous behaviour.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-indecent-exposure-a-that-must-be-taken-seriously\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-indecent-exposure-a-that-must-be-taken-seriously", "date_published": "2023-03-07 18:57:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Tories are doing the same thing yet again and nobody expects results | John Crace", "description": "<p>Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman unveil a plan for small boats that is performative and cruel </p><p>If insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result, Rishi Sunak and the Conservative government must need 24-hour psychiatric supervision.

You could, for example, knock up a risotto, biryani, jambalaya, or, as Poon suggests, a \u201ccheat\u2019s\u201d claypot rice. \u201cCut boneless chicken thighs into small pieces, marinate in potato starch, light soy sauce, white pepper, salt, sugar, shaoxing wine, sesame oil and finely chopped ginger, then mix with rehydrated Chinese (or other) mushrooms and spread the mixture over the rice.\u201d Once cooked, garnish with chopped spring onions. Coombes, meanwhile, dials things up a notch with stories of a viral food hack from a few years back when some leftover takeaway fried chicken, stock, soy sauce and rice went into a rice cooker. \u201cThe crispy chicken became soft and was broken up into the rice with a dollop of butter,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried it myself, but that\u2019s because I so seldom have any

Without the latter you will never be \u201cin the mood\u201d with anyone. Try to change your mindset by releasing yourself from any pressure of expectations to have sex that might come from either yourself or others. Make it your mission to simply enjoy being with people you like in non-intimate ways, and always withdraw if they make you feel uncomfortable. You have every right to take your time so wait until you really feel ready to be sexual with someone. Never allow anyone to coerce you into sex, and never force yourself to go through with a sexual experience for any other reason than pure desire. Given your true feelings about sex, sending erotic images of yourself may not have authentic meaning for you, and might be read as willingness to be sexual immediately. Instead, by holding back, you will send a different unspoken message \u2013 that you are discerning and will wait for the right person and the right time.

He dismissed Meghan\u2019s claims about racism in the royal family, saying: \u201cSome of that shit she went through was not racism\u201d, but \u201cin-law\u201d behaviour. He also joked about how it was odd Meghan seemed surprised by the fact the royal family might harbour archaic views. \u201cIt\u2019s the royal family! They\u2019re the original racists.

If AI is the future of tech, then big tech companies need to control their own models or be left behind by the competition. LLaMA joins OpenAI\u2019s GPT (licensed by Microsoft for Bing and underpinning OpenAI\u2019s own ChatGPT) and Google\u2019s LaMDA (which will power Bard, its ChatGPT rival) in the upper echelons of the field.</p><p>Meta\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t simply to replicate GPT. It says that LLaMA is a \u201csmaller, more performant model\u201d than its peers, built to achieve the same feats of comprehension and articulation with a smaller footprint in terms of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/28/techscape-black-box-neural-networks-ai-acronyms\">compute</a>*, and so has a correspondingly smaller environmental impact. (The fact that it\u2019s cheaper to run doesn\u2019t hurt, either.)</p><p><em>Even with all the recent advancements in large language models, full research access to them remains limited because of the resources that are required to train and run such large models. This restricted access has limited researchers\u2019 ability to understand how and why these large language models work, hindering progress on efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues, such as bias, toxicity, and the potential for generating misinformation.</em></p><p><em>By sharing the code for LLaMA, other researchers can more easily test new approaches to limiting or eliminating these problems in large language models.</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/07/techscape-meta-leak-llama-chatgpt-ai-crossroads\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/07/techscape-meta-leak-llama-chatgpt-ai-crossroads", "date_published": "2023-03-07 11:45:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Two people killed in stampede at GloRilla concert in New York", "description": "<p>Memphis rapper says she is \u2018devastated and heartbroken\u2019 over fans\u2019 deaths as eight people remain injured</p><p>Two people have died and eight remain injured after a stampede at a concert by the US rapper GloRilla in New York state.</p><p>Rochester police initially told CNN that they believed that at the end of the night, fans rushed for the exits of the Main Street Armory venue in response to the sound of gunfire.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/07/two-people-killed-in-stampede-at-glorilla-concert-in-new-york\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/07/two-people-killed-in-stampede-at-glorilla-concert-in-new-york", "date_published": "2023-03-07 11:24:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger calls antisemites losers who will die miserably", "description": "<p>The actor and former governor of California tells YouTube viewers he wants to steer them away from \u2018a trap of prejudice and hate\u2019</p><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger has confronted the rise of antisemitism in the US in a new YouTube video.</p><p>The Austrian-born actor, who began as a bodybuilder and served as governor of California between 2003 and 2011, told viewers \u201cthere has never been a successful movement based on hate\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/07/arnold-schwarzenegger-calls-antisemites-losers\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/07/arnold-schwarzenegger-calls-antisemites-losers", "date_published": "2023-03-07 11:22:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Ron DeSantis has his next target in his sights: freedom of the press | Trevor Timm", "description": "<p>Florida\u2019s rightwing governor and legislature want to gut one of the United States\u2019 most important first amendment rulings</p><p>Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, and his cronies, not content with destroying free speech in public schools, have set for themselves a new target: destroying press freedom and every Floridian\u2019s right to criticize public officials.

He set up the <a href=\"https://www.thewvc.org.uk/history.html\">Wimbledon Village Club</a>, a working men\u2019s institute for edification, entertainment, refreshments and a library, in much community use now. Family history records that his rigorous selflessness included dragging his nine children across Wimbledon Common on Christmas Day to make them donate their Christmas dinner to a Travellers\u2019 encampment. The plaque on the fountain says that working men of Wimbledon and those \u201cinterested in the public good\u201d paid for this memorial.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/07/great-great-grandfather-plastic-pollution-drinking-fountain-bottles\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/07/great-great-grandfather-plastic-pollution-drinking-fountain-bottles", "date_published": "2023-03-07 06:00:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "SNP at a crossroads as leadership candidates gear up for first TV debate", "description": "<p>TV cameras will further expose the gulf between the competing visions of the main contenders </p><p>As the candidates vying to replace Nicola Sturgeon as Scotland\u2019s first minister prepare for their first televised debate, they all agree on one thing: that the Scottish National party is at a crossroads.</p><p>That is an understatement.
