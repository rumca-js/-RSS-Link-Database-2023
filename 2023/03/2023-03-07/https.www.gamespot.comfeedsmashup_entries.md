<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4108980-haloinfiniteseason3thumb.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/">Halo Infinite</a> Season 3: Echoes Within has finally arrived, bringing new maps, modes, and a brand-new battle pass. The Season 3 battle pass includes 100 tiers, with 180 items in the premium track and over 80 items in the free track. This new battle pass includes 1,000 Credits, which is how much the base version costs (about $10). There is also a bundle option for 2,800 Credits, which jumps you ahead 25 tiers in the battle pass. Like the other Halo Infinite battle passes, this one never expires, so you can continue to progress it and earn rewards, even when Season 4 rolls around.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the new battle pass, there are three new maps joining the rotation in Season 3. The first is Oasis, a Big Team Battle map located in a sandy desert. The second is Cliffhanger, taking place on top of a cliff at an Oni Facility. The third is Chasm, taking place deep within a Forerunner structure, featuring the metallic aesthetic those facilities are known for. There is also a new game mode called Escalation Slayer, which functions similar to Call of Duty's Gun Game, tasking players with working through different weapons in a match. The final weapon is an Oddball, making for a difficult final kill.</p><p dir="ltr">This update also brings some changes to the in-game shop, promising better deals, more frequent item rotations, and more overall items available throughout this season than the previous two. Here's every reward you can earn in the Halo Infinite Season 3 Echoes Within battle pass.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tier 1 - Coordination Protocol Backdrop, Slipstream Vectorstrike Armor Effect</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4108981-1large.jpeg" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Tier 2 -

<p>Elden Ring's sprawling and hauntingly beautiful world is easily one of the most well-realized settings we've seen in an open-world game. If you spent dozens of hours in the Lands Between, you already know it's the type of video-game world that you want to stop and admire. As such, it makes sense that Elden Ring's world will soon fill the pages of an official art book. The two-volume set is available to preorder now at Amazon ahead of its July 25 release, and Volume I is on sale for a massive discount.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1772942693?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">Preorder at Amazon (Vol 1)</a> </div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1772942707?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;ascsubtag=ag:|vg:-|st:dtp">Preorder at Amazon (Vol 2)</a> </div><p>Each volume is being sold individually with an MSRP of $60. However, Volume I has already received a steep discount, dropping the price to just $36. Volume II is available for a smaller discount at $54.

We wouldn't be surprised to see preorders sell out, so Elden Ring fans may want to secure their preorders soon--especially with Volume I on sale for such a great price right now.</p><figure style="width: 1000px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4107426-eldenringartbook.png"><img alt="Elden Ring - Official Art Book" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4107426-eldenringartbook.png" /></a><figcaption>Elden Ring - Official Art Book</figcaption></figure><p>Together, the two-volume set eclipses 800 pages.

<p>After ten long months, 343 Industries released a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/">Halo Infinite</a> season. Season 3, Echoes Within, introduces lots of new features to the game, such as balance changes being made to ranked mode that'll reduce the amount of ammo you can hold in certain guns while playing ranked, new Forge features that'll allow you to customize specific 343 Industries maps, and more.

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">Movies previously on track for the Star Wars universe from Marvel boss Kevin Feige and Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins are no longer in active development, according to a new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/star-wars-kevin-feige-patty-jenkins-movies-shelved-1235545774/">Variety</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In Variety's analysis, unnamed sources with knowledge of both productions say that the surprise success of underdog Mandlorian, and it outpacing expectations for The Rise of Skywalker has led to a change in strategy for the franchise. Jenkins' Rogue Squadron was scheduled to come out in December 2023, until it was pulled from Lucasfilm's release schedule last September with little explanation. Feige's Star Wars feature was still untitled, and not much was known about the project.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-movies-from-kevin-feige-patty-jenkins-shelved-report/1100-6512130/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Hogwarts Legacy Is The Fastest-Selling Non-FIFA Game In Europe In A Long Time

<p dir="ltr">We know that Hogwarts Legacy is shaping up to be one of the best-selling games of 2023 (if not the number one best-selling outright), and it's already notching new records in Europe. As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/hogwarts-legacy-is-europes-fastest-selling-game-that-isnt-fifa-for-a-generation-european-monthly-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Hogwarts Legacy has already become the fastest-selling non-FIFA game in Europe since the creation of the charts in 2017.</p><p dir="ltr">That makes it the sixth-biggest launch for a video game in the past six years in Europe, ahead of massive hits like Elden Ring, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and Red Dead Redemption 2. It's already the fifth-best selling game of the past 12 months in Europe, behind FIFA 23, Modern Warfare 2, Grand Theft Auto V, and Elden Ring.</p><p dir="ltr">Hogwarts Legacy's runaway success comes at a soft time for video game sales in Europe, which are down 10% compared to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fifa-call-of-duty-elden-ring-top-uks-best-selling-games-of-2022/1100-6512099/">February 2022</a>. Industry observers cited the fewer major releases of February 2023 as a major reason for this downturn, as that period in 2022 had several major games, including Elden Ring and Horizon: Forbidden West. In other news, the European data showed that PS5 sales have skyrocketed in recent weeks, outselling both the Switch and Xbox consoles in February.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-is-the-fastest-selling-non-fifa-game-in-europe-in-a-long-time/1100-6512128/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Lince Works, the studio behind the Aragami series, will end the development of new projects indefinitely, starting in April. The studio was in operation for nine years.</p><p>"The last couple of years have been particularly difficult as we shifted towards the development of new IPs and a new course for the company," Lince Works said in a statement. We were ambitious about what we wanted to achieve as a studio, but sadly, although we made good progress, the economic context was not favorable and we ran out of time."</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Thank you for this journey.

<p dir="ltr">We're now a week into Destiny 2's Lightfall expansion era, and it's that exciting period of time when we don't yet know what to expect week to week from the expansion or the accompanying Season of Defiance. The first weekly reset has now occurred, with players discovering a secret new Exotic mission--and it's entirely possible you didn't even notice.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Exotic mission is not located in the Director, and there is seemingly nothing in the game guiding you to its location. To start the mission, known as The Variable, you'll need to head to the Gulch area of the EDZ. Once you're there, search for objects that emit a morse code-like noise and then quickly activate all six. From there, you'll be on your way to unlocking a new Exotic weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll be putting together a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-and-season-of-defiance-guides-season-pass-gear-exotics/1100-6511885/">guide</a> as we make our way through the quest, but for those eager to know what awaits, this reportedly leads to unlocking an Exotic glaive called Vexcalibur. This is a Void weapon whose trait and perks involve absorbing damage with its shield to grant you and others an overshield, which in turn also boosts the amount of damage the weapon deals.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-secret-new-destiny-2-lightfall-exotic-mission-is-now-live/1100-6512123/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Jon Bernthal will be reportedly returning as Frank Castle/the Punisher for Disney+'s Daredevil: Born Again series according to sources with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/daredevil-born-again-casts-jon-bernthal-punisher-1235342229/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. Bernthal joins Charlie Cox and Vincent D’Onofrio in the new series, all reprising their roles from Daredevil's original series from Netflix.</p><p>After his appearance and arc in Daredevil Season 2, Bernthal went on to star in his own solo series for Netflix, playing the titular character for two seasons that spanned 2017-19. Daredevil: Born Again is a continuation of the Netflix series and takes its name from one of the most popular Daredevil arcs of all time. Created by Frank Miller and David Mazzuchelli in 1986, it redefined Daredevil for a grittier 80s audience and set a lot of modern-day mythos for the character. This was right before they would go on and collaborate once again for another iconic comic book masterpiece: Batman: Year One in 1987.</p><p>Bernthal would be the latest actor from previous television productions to crossover to the MCU proper. Cox had a cameo in Spider-Man: No Way Home before becoming a recurring guest role in She-Hulk. D’Onofrio appeared in Hawkeye, with both Cox and D’ONofrio being central figures in the upcoming Echo series.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jon-bernthal-returning-as-the-punisher-for-daredevil-born-again-series-report/1100-6512122/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Original Angry Birds Could Return To Google Play (Or Might Just Vanish From iOS Too)

<p>The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/angry-birds/">Angry Birds</a> could return to Google Play in the future, developer Rovio says in a new statement, but only if the studio's experiment of renaming the game on iOS is a success.</p><p dir="ltr">Rovio in February removed the title from Google Play and renamed it to Red's First Flight on iOS. At the time, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rovio/status/1627956351002443778?s=20">Rovio said the decision</a> was due to the classic game's "impact on our wider game portfolio," and in its statement, pointed disappointed fans towards other Angry Birds titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/angry-birds-2/">Angry Birds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/angry-birds-friends/">Angry Birds Friends</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/angry-birds-journey/">Angry Birds Journey</a>.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Please read below for an important announcement regarding the availability of Rovio Classics: Angry Birds. <a href="https://t.co/a4n4bU5gQJ">pic.twitter.com/a4n4bU5gQJ</a></p>  — Rovio (@Rovio) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rovio/status/1627956351002443778?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">February 21, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Fans have been critical of the move, with many taking Rovio's statement to mean that the popular $1 remake of the original (which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-original-angry-birds-is-making-a-comeback/1100-6502073/">was released last year</a> due to popular demand, according to Rovio's CEO) was having a negative financial impact on the developer. Fans assumed that those who bought the remake of the original Angry Birds wouldn't spend time or money downloading and playing the various free-to-play, and microtransaction-filled, Angry Birds sequels, something that would ultimately hurt Rovio's bottom line.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-angry-birds-could-return-to-google-play-or-might-just-vanish-from-ios-too/1100-6512121/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><h2>Wraith's new Hope's Dawn Heirloom Set can be crafted for 50% off.</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1752/17528202/4108786-newkunai.jpg" /><br /><em>Imperial Guard Collection Event</em><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a>' new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-imperial-guard-collection-event-includes-discounted-wraith-heirloom/1100-6511988/">Imperial Guard Collection Event</a> launched today, introducing a new series of 24 new premium cosmetic items with a Japanese theme. Oni masks, cherry blossom motifs, and other homages to traditional Japanese culture are featured heavily in the collection's items--just in time for the annual Japanese Cherry Blossom festival, which starts on March 20 this year.</p><p dir="ltr">But one of the most notable additions to this collection is Hope's Dawn, a new, recolored version of Wraith's original kunai knife <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-heirlooms-guide/1100-6495067/">Heirloom Weapon</a>. Just like in previous Collection Events, the new Heirloom Set can only be unlocked by purchasing and/or crafting all 24 cosmetic items in the event. But this time, there's a twist--while each of the items in the Imperial Guard Collection still cost the standard 1,000 (Epic-tier) or 1,800 (Legendary-tier) Apex Coins to purchase individually, crafting them only requires half the Crafting Metals. This means that Epic-tier items only require 400 Crafting Metals instead of 800, while Legendary-tier items only require 1,200 Crafting Metals instead of the standard 2,400.</p><p dir="ltr">EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/imperial-guard-collection-event">official Imperial Guard Collection Event page</a> claims that two Event Packs will be included in the event's free reward track. This means players only need to craft 22 of the 24 event cosmetics, allowing them to craft the entire collection for only 16,800 Crafting Metals (or purchase it via Event Packs for $154, saving $14). Unfortunately, at the time of publication, it appears that both <a href="https://twitter.com/BranthiumBabe/status/1633170387109400577">Event Packs are missing from the free reward track</a> for some players.

## Destiny 2: Lightfall - Turn Your Warlock Into An Unraveling Wizard With This Strand Build

<p>Strand has become one of the most interesting subclasses in Destiny 2: Lightfall, thanks not only to its wild mobility options, but also its potential to deliver some of the most devastating offense in all of Destiny 2. For Warlocks, Strand has become a new system with which to summon a small army of Threadlings that can be let loose on the battlefield, but another build shows just how effective this subclass is at immobilizing and destroying anything that gets in your way. For a more general idea of how to use the subclass, you can check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-build-your-strand-subclass-in-destiny-2-lightfall/1100-6512106/">Strand breakdown</a>.</p><p>This particular build is focused on two specific effects with Strand combined with two key Exotics, and if you've got the right gear in your inventory, it'll absolutely annihilate anything in front of you and it pairs extremely well with team-based builds. Here's how you can turn your Warlock into a master of unraveling enemies.</p><p>The key strategy behind this build is to apply Suspend and Unravel debuffs to enemies. Suspend will keep your enemies locked in place when you generate a web of psychic energy to hold them, while Unravel creates projectiles as you do damage to your target, creating projectiles that seek out targets and damage them further.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-warlock-strand-build/1100-6512091/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Playdate handheld console will be getting a price increase next month, creator Panic has announced. Originally launching last year for the price of $179, the compact console with a built-in hand-crank will cost $199 from April 7 due to an increase in manufacturing costs.</p><p>"That $20 delta is largely because our factory recently gave us the inevitable news that in 2023, the price of building a single Playdate is going up," Panic co-founder Cabel Sasser explained in a press statement.</p><p>Also announced for the cute console is an on-device store known as Catalog, which Panic has described as a "boutique digital on-device and web-based storefront" that has launched with 16 games. 11 of the titles available right now are brand-new, and two games will be free to all Playdate owners as an extra bonus for Playdate Season One. More games will be added over time and prices for the launch titles range from $1 to $15.

## Lost Ark's Paint-Wielding Artist Class Arrives Next Week, With A Few Localization Changes

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lost-ark/">Lost Ark's</a> new Artist class arrives on March 15 as part of the game's Art of War update, and it looks to be unlike any other class Western players of the free-to-play Korean MMORPG have seen before.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike previous classes added to Lost Ark that fell within general class archetypes like Warrior, Mage, Gunner, Martial Artists, and Assassin, the Artist is in a new category all its own--Specialist. As such, the Artist is fairly unique amidst the rest of the game's class roster, wielding a giant paintbrush and bringing summons to life with the flick of their brush. Those summons can both help allies or damage enemies, making the Artist a support-focused class that can still dish out some serious damage.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">🖌️ It all starts with the stroke of a brush...<br />🎨 Witness Arkesia's greatest masterpiece -- The Artist Class! Using her giant paintbrush, she summons beasts and paints Arkesia black with destruction! <a href="https://t.co/HKfTYsW1YD">pic.twitter.com/HKfTYsW1YD</a></p>  — 🎂 Lost Ark (@playlostark) <a href="https://twitter.com/playlostark/status/1633165638083682304?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">March 7, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Artist's two Awakening Skills reflect that philosophy. The first, Masterwork: Spectacle, catches enemies in a giant scroll, damaging foes caught in the attack and reducing their critical resistance and movement speed, perfect for letting teammates follow up with even more damage. Their second Awakening skill, Masterwork: Efflorescence, summons a whirlwind of flower petals that inflict damage to enemies, and then grants a shield to every nearby ally.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lost-ark-paint-wielding-artist-class-arrives-next-week-with-a-few-localization-changes/1100-6512119/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Take-Two, the parent company of GTA developer Rockstar Games, is undergoing a round of layoffs. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who was first to report, said the cuts are coming from Take-Two's Private Division label "and other divisions."</p><p>A spokesperson for Take-Two, Alan Lewis, said the impact on development teams specifically is "minimal," suggesting the layoffs stem from non-development positions. Lewis said the move will help Take-Two "better align our organization with our long-term priorities."</p><p>The job losses are not a surprise. Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-is-implementing-50-million-cost-reduction-program-in-q4-fiscal-year-2023/1100-6511223/">$50 million in cost-reductions in February</a>, also confirming that layoffs were looming. "The program includes personnel, processes, infrastructure, and other areas, and will primarily focus on corporate and publishing functions," Take-Two said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-confirms-layoffs-primarily-impacting-non-development-positions/1100-6512117/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Tunic's Instruction Manual Is Now A Hardcover Book You Can Preorder

<p>Tunic was one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2022/2900-4517/">best games of 2022</a>, offering tight combat, striking graphics, and a mysterious world to explore. Much of that mystery was derived from its lack of handholding, which forced you to learn its nuances on your own and slowly piece together a cryptic in-game instruction manual. Now that instruction manual is being brought to life. To coincide with the game’s physical launch later this summer, you can now <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/products/tunic-hardcover-manual">preorder</a> </span> a gorgeous replica of the in-game manual for just $19.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/products/tunic-hardcover-manual">See at Fangamer</a> </div><p>This isn’t your average instruction manual found in games from a decade ago; it's a hardcover book that comes with a protective slipcase for easy storage.

## PlayStation Plus Free Games For March 2023 Are Live

<p>The latest batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers is live now. The PS Plus March 2023 lineup includes three games: Battlefield 2042, Minecraft Dungeons, and Code Vein. All three games are available to claim until April 3. </p><p>Both the PS5 and PS4 versions of <strong>Battlefield 2042</strong> are up for grabs. Though the latest entry in EA's long-running FPS series got off to a rocky start when it launched in 2021, consistent updates have been rolled out ever since that have improved the online experience. With Battlefield 2042 now on PS Plus, you can expect an increase in player counts, so it's a good time to give it a go.</p><p><strong>Minecraft Dungeons</strong> is essentially Minecraft's version of Diablo, and it's pretty darn good. Played from an isometric perspective, Minecraft Dungeons is all about slashing your way through groups of enemies in search of new loot. Like Diablo, Minecraft Dungeons really hits its stride the more you play and is best enjoyed with friends. This is a great family-friendly cooperative game to play with kids, and it could help you scratch that Diablo itch while waiting for Diablo 4.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-for-march-2023-are-live/1100-6511790/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actor Hugh Grant plays the villain the new Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves movie due out this month, and he was something of a bad guy on the film's set, too. The 62-year-old actor said he had a Christian Bale-like temper tantrum on the set of the film when he got into it with a woman who he believed to be a studio executive. This person, who was in Grant's eyeline, was actually a chaperone of a child actor.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/totalfilm/">Total Film</a> (<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/hugh-grant-on-set-tantrum-200749312.html">via Yahoo Entertainment</a>), Grant said the mistake happened on the first day of filming. "I lost my temper with a woman in my eyeline on day one. I assumed she was some executive from the studio who should have known better," he said. "Then it turns out that she's an extremely nice local woman who was the chaperone of the young girl. Terrible. A lot of grovelling...

<p dir="ltr">Hardcore online shooter Escape From Tarkov is well-known for its brutal consequences for death, and its developer Battlestate Games is taking a similar tack with those who get caught cheating. The studio recently released 6,700 names of banned cheaters in a public <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRutocKkK3nk91ORmArC4_sOWGFpipL1hNPYytEpdQ-70WkQnVQJlxMmULIaViqpm31J_I0_pIBVTlN/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true">Google Sheet</a> simply titled: "List of banned players."</p><p dir="ltr">Battlestate told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/06/russian-game-developer-bans-and-doxes-6700-cheaters/">TechCrunch</a> that the measure is intended to punish cheaters beyond the traditional banning, and to confirm to everyday players that their reports are being heard.

<p>Paramount's Dungeons and Dragons movie, Honor Among Thieves, comes out at the end of the month and the studio just released an international trailer that features more wonder and sorcery. We've seen Justice Smith's Simon, who is classified as a Sorcerer in the movie and not a Wizard, use his spells in previous trailers, but here he tiptoes into necromancy to help his team's quest. </p><p>Simon casts Speak with Dead, which is a 3rd Level spell so we know at least Simon isn't completely incompetent but not super powerful. The spell grants "the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose." Check out the hilarious results with the spell below.</p><div>          </div><p>After the spell is cast, you can ask the corpse up to five questions, but Simon should have known the answers are usually brief, cryptic, or even repetitive. The corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer as well. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dungeons-and-dragons-international-trailer-dabbles-with-necromancy/1100-6512105/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
