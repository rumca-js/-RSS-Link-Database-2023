And quite recently, co-creator Kevin Eastman teased The Last Ronin 2, which is a prequel and sequel of sorts that shows Mikey trying to find purpose in life after the loss of his family, and the next generation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles tasked to take over from the first generation of mutated heroes. The Ronin-verse is a vastly different take on the TMNT franchise, giving fans a glimpse at what would happen if these teenage turtles aged into adulthood.
