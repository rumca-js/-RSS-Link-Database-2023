<p>No one should feel unsupported and inferior about the way they feed their child</p><p>My aggressive breast cancer diagnosis at 29 weeks pregnant came as a shock. It had major implications: I needed chemotherapy right away, with a strong possibility that my delivery would be brought forward by an induction and/or surgery.</p><p>I was also given the upsetting news that – due to the toxicity of the chemotherapy – I wouldn’t be able to breastfeed. This was my first pregnancy, and although healthy (until cancer), it had an unexpected psychological toll. Breastfeeding was a milestone I looked forward to; an opportunity to hopefully step back some of the emotional distance that grew between me and the foetus in my swelling womb.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/08/unable-to-breastfeed-my-baby-due-to-cancer-i-was-made-to-feel-like-a-failure">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When the decisive moments arrived on a night of rare fortune for Graham Potter, Raheem Sterling fooling Borussia Dortmund with an air shot, Kai Havertz overcomplicating a penalty, perhaps it was inevitable that Chelsea had not taken the easy route to goal.</p><p>Yet it was never going to be simple with this team. Goalscoring has been an issue for Chelsea all season and it had seemed their wasteful finishing would undermine them again. That they were better than Dortmund was not in doubt. But the question was whether Chelsea could make their superiority count and, as the misses piled up, it was hard not to wonder if it would be the same old story.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/07/chelsea-borussia-dortmund-champions-league-last-16-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As young stars smile brightly and declare their love for him, this documentary about a music svengali’s gruesome history of abuse is a rare and terrifying insight into how grooming works</p><p>Hold on to your hats here but – I think it’s possible that the patriarchy might not be a great system by which to organise a society.

How long do we give it before we start treating anyone who wants to become rich, famous or powerful in any way as automatically suspect?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/07/predator-the-secret-scandal-of-j-pop-review-japan-johnny-kitagawa">Continue reading...</a>

Political cartoonist and jazz clarinettist who, using the pen name Trog, created the Flook strip<p>The career of the cartoonist and jazz clarinettist Wally “Trog” Fawkes, who has died aged 98, was an extraordinary one, a mixture of luck and perseverance. His cartoon strip Flook appeared in the Daily Mail and then the Mirror for more than half a century, while his political cartoons were a staple of the British media for just as long.</p><p>In 1948 Lord (Vere) Rothermere, proprietor of the Daily Mail, was much taken on a visit to the US by a children’s strip about a small boy and his magic uncle, and thought something similar might enhance his own paper. What was decided was that a small boy named Rufus has a dream in which he rescues from prehistoric times a furry creature being bullied by a nasty caveman. On awakening, Rufus finds the little animal has fallen through a timewarp into his own bed. Its name is <a href="https://animationresources.org/comics-trogs-rufus-and-flook/" title="">Flook</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/07/wally-fawkes-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

He was a pivotal part of the group as both musician and songwriter, his most arresting claim to fame being his slide guitar work on the band’s imperishable theme song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LwcvjNJTuM" title="">Free Bird</a>. He also co-wrote their most successful single, the US Top 10 hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GxWmSVv-cY" title="">Sweet Home Alabama</a>, and wrote songs regularly throughout the band’s career, up to their final studio album, Last of a Dyin’ Breed (2012).</p><p>Lynyrd Skynyrd reached the US Top 30 with each of their first five albums, three reaching double platinum status, but the group was plagued by a horrific litany of tragedies. Rossington, under the influence of drugs and alcohol, had survived a road accident in 1976 in which his car hit a tree, prompting Skynyrd’s lead vocalist, Ronnie Van Zant, to write the song That Smell – “Ooh that smell / The smell of death surrounds you”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/07/gary-rossington-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a string of serious dramas underperform at the box office, silliness has instead taken over Hollywood from Megan to Cocaine Bear</p><p>It wasn’t the big-budget bullishness of Christopher Nolan that lured understandably wary audiences back to the multiplex after Covid struck. The director tried harder than most to be Hollywood’s head cheerleader for the cinema experience, insisting his sleek thriller Tenet be seen on the big screen and the big screen only back in the cursed days of 2020, but it was too much and too soon, and ultimately his film was too bad for it to work too well.</p><p>The film was by no means a flop, but it was a concerning under-performer, caveats and all, and it wasn’t until the following March that we found out what it took to truly lead the masses from their couch. Rather than style or sophistication, as Nolan had offered, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/07/why-godzilla-vs-kong-saved-cinema-not-tenet">it was the primal appeal</a> of watching a giant ape fighting a giant lizard that roused crowds into a grand return, Godzilla vs Kong winning the title of first legitimate hit of the pandemic. Various hits have followed, most of them involving superheroes, but the film’s early global popularity remains telling. We knew audiences would rush back in droves for whatever guff had the Marvel logo attached, but it was a sign that there was another type of spectacle being craved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/07/cocaine-bear-megan-b-movie-hollywood-film">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The case of Wayne Couzens should be a wake-up call for how we view this sexual offence</p><p>When police are contacted three times about a man exposing himself in public, you would expect them to investigate. And when his vehicle registration and credit card number are provided, you would expect them to act swiftly. The failures of the Met and Kent police to investigate these reports of Wayne Couzens served to strengthen his “dangerous belief in his invincibility”, Mrs Justice May said on Monday, when she handed Couzens a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/06/wayne-couzens-sentenced-to-19-months-in-prison-for-indecent-exposure" title="">19-month sentence</a> for indecent exposure, on top of the life sentence he is serving for the rape and murder of Sarah Everard.</p><p>The attitude of the police to sexual offences is under close and growing scrutiny. But officers are not alone in treating “flashing” as a crime deserving less attention. Despite carrying a maximum two-year sentence, indecent exposure is still too easily brushed off as an unpleasant but ultimately inconsequential act. The stereotypical image of a man in a mac, and even the language of “flashing”, diminish the seriousness of this crime and make it easy to trivialise. Couzens’s offences are further proof that such crimes can be precursors to more dangerous behaviour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-indecent-exposure-a-that-must-be-taken-seriously">Continue reading...</a>

## The Tories are doing the same thing yet again and nobody expects results | John Crace

<p>Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman unveil a plan for small boats that is performative and cruel </p><p>If insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result, Rishi Sunak and the Conservative government must need 24-hour psychiatric supervision. There have been dozens of initiatives and six new bills aimed at stopping people entering the UK since 2015. The most recent one, the nationality and borders bill, promised to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/07/conservatives-channel-crossings-small-boats-tories-rwanda-deportation">end small boats crossings once and for all</a>. That went well. Last year saw a record 45,000 arrivals.</p><p>But Rish! is nothing if not pig-headed. So he’s now made stopping the small boats an election promise. And to make good on it, he has now introduced yet another bill that to all intents and purposes looks hopelessly flawed and completely pointless. The chances of it achieving its objectives are nil. It’s performative dadaist politics. Something that is designed to con his dimmer backbenchers and a small minority of the country. And if all else fails, Sunak could go begging to voters. “I know I’ve failed. But at least I tried.” Good luck with that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/07/the-tories-are-doing-the-same-thing-yet-again-and-nobody-expects-results">Continue reading...</a>

With an exhibition of daring, early ball-striking and her deep toolbox of variety, the Czech toppled Swiatek in straight sets. She is the only player since 2019 to defeat Swiatek in a final, a distinction she has now achieved twice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/07/iga-swiatek-still-the-one-to-beat-at-indian-wells-but-challengers-lining-up">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The shadow chancellor has read the room on the need for a stable tax regime, but the ‘to-be-decided’ list is long</p><p>It was easy to spot the gaps that Labour needs to fill in the review of business taxation announced by the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves. On the rate of corporation tax, Labour wants to be “in lockstep with the G7”, which is a terribly vague formulation. On long-term tax breaks to boost investment, Reeves is enthusiastic but has committed to nothing specific. Any role for windfall taxes, where Labour is still calling for a “proper” additional levy on North Sea producers, was not mentioned in her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/mar/06/leading-uk-ceos-attack-energy-support-policy-as-brake-on-investment">speech to the trade body Make UK</a>.</p><p>The “to-be-decided” list, then, is long. In the meantime, Reeves said Labour would support “a genuine boost to investment … if it is affordable”, if that’s what the government produces in next week’s budget. There was nothing here to frighten business – but, equally, nothing much to excite.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/mar/07/labours-messaging-on-business-tax-is-right-just-dont-leave-a-long-term-plan-until-the-last-minute">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s been bubbling up for a while, but now it seems the hairstyle has reached another tipping point. And no wonder. It’s weird, cool, sexy and liberating</p><p></p><p>Mullets, it seems, are “back”. Again. In recent years celebrities including Miley Cyrus, Lil Nas X and Rihanna have sported “parties in the back”, while swathes of TikTok users have made videos showing off theirs (the hashtag “mullet” currently has more than 10 billion views on the app). But Paul Mescal, star of Normal People and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/21/aftersun-review-beach-holiday-with-paul-mescal-and-daughter-is-a-sunny-delight">Aftersun</a> and heart-throb of straight woman everywhere, has somehow tipped the scales and made it official: mullets, once acceptable only for hippies and Australians, can be – and very much are – sexy.</p><p>Up until about a month ago, I had been wearing my hair in some approximation of a mullet for just over a year. It is now a bit too short at the back to count, which is more a result of my miscommunication with the barber (it was my first time risking a visit to a regular “men’s” barbershop and I panicked) than any real desire to de-mullet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/07/the-massive-mullet-moment-why-the-worlds-hair-is-all-business-in-the-front-party-in-the-back">Continue reading...</a>

Oh Bruno, Luke, Lisandro <em>et al</em>! Did Reiss Nelson calmly slot a spectacular, 96th-minute, possible-season-defining, rising, screaming, net-ripping, opposition-gut-punching, stop-the-world, top-class half-volley <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/04/the-greatest-end-arteta-hails-nelsons-dramatic-winner-against-bournemouth">for nothing</a>?</p><p>While Mike Smith can rightly compare the last-minute drama at Chippenham Town in the National League South to the similar scenes at the Emirates (yesterday’s Football Daily letters), can I offer a further step on the way down the proof-ladder that the drama doesn’t reduce just because there are fewer there to witness it? Last week Glan Conwy Under-9s visited the fortress home of the mighty Clwb Peldroed Bethel in a friendly arranged to practise for next season’s change from five-a-side up to seven. In front of maybe 20 ‘fans’ (mums, dads and grandparents) and with the sloping pitch finally in their favour, the GC stormed back from 2-0 down with just a couple of minutes left to triumph 3-2 in a real smash-and-grab raid.

Plus further evidence of my pet theory that the third goal always wins” – Simon Lewis.</p><p>Can you please spearhead a STOP BAD GAME APOLOGIES movement? There’s myriad reasons for genuine apologies from players, managers and clubs in modern football, but the risk-free ‘we’re sorry we played so bad’ version seems to be the only one that’s given freely” – Kristian.</p><p>ChatGPT is in the news at the moment. But has anybody else noticed the similarities between ChatGPT and the outpourings of all those former Liverpool and Manchester United player bots … sorry, pundits on Sky Sports? OpenAI, ChatGPT’s creator, say that its responses ‘may be inaccurate, untruthful, and otherwise misleading at times’. OpenAI’s CEO also admitted recently that the AI chatbot is ‘incredibly limited’ and that ‘it’s a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now’. Sounds familiar.

And it’s three years since the disappearance of Sarah Everard, murdered after being stopped on her way home by the rogue police officer Wayne Couzens (affectionately known by his colleagues as “the rapist”).</p><p>Against the backdrop of these horrific headlines, I have been having more and more conversations with women about how they feel unsafe in the streets. We’ve exchanged stories of being followed and catcalled, of sharing Uber rides with each other and making sure we text when we’re home safe. We’ve lamented the increased risk of attack that trans women face, and how Black and minority ethnic women face the threat of both racism and misogyny. We’ve discussed the 800 Met police officers <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-64293158">under investigation</a> for domestic and sexual abuse, and what it means for women’s trust in the police – though that’s a privilege many women of colour have never had.</p><p>Jinan Younis is Head of the diversity, equity and inclusion practice at the strategy firm Purpose Union, and a former assistant politics editor at gal-dem magazine.

He opened the door to police officers who came to escort him to a centre to await deportation to Jamaica, the country he had left at the age of 10. O’Connor had no idea why. No one had told him, it seems, that a deportation order was made against him as early as 2017.</p><p>When the Home Office made the decision to deport O’Connor, he was being treated in a psychiatric hospital. The letter notifying him of the decision was delivered to the ward and left unopened on his bedside table, says Simon Robinson, a lawyer representing O’Connor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/07/jamaica-hostel-vulnerable-us-uk-mental-health-deportees-acc">Continue reading...</a>

On its 40th birthday, here are the songs that fed into its creation – and the songs that wouldn’t have existed had Blue Monday not existed first.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/07/forty-years-of-new-order-blue-monday-inspirations">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Grains, pasta, fish, eggs and even fondue are just some of the things that be prepared in a rice cooker, says our panel of cooks</p><p>• Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></p><p><strong>What else can I do with my wonderful rice cooker?<br /></strong><em><strong>Jo, London</strong></em><strong><br /></strong>“Oh, so much,” says Amy Poon, founder of <a href="https://www.poonslondon.com/">Poon’s London</a>. “I basically use my rice cooker like a [not so] slow cooker.” But to best understand what else you can do with it, Jo, you need to start at the very beginning and consider how rice cookers function. “They work on weight,” explains Ping Coombes, former MasterChef champion and author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/malaysia-9781474601498">Malaysia</a>. “You add water and, as the rice cooks, the water soaks into the grain.” So, on that basis, you’re really looking at liquid-based things.</p><p>Let’s, however, stick with rice for a second, because there are many possibilities beyond steaming for a side. You could, for example, knock up a risotto, biryani, jambalaya, or, as Poon suggests, a “cheat’s” claypot rice. “Cut boneless chicken thighs into small pieces, marinate in potato starch, light soy sauce, white pepper, salt, sugar, shaoxing wine, sesame oil and finely chopped ginger, then mix with rehydrated Chinese (or other) mushrooms and spread the mixture over the rice.” Once cooked, garnish with chopped spring onions. Coombes, meanwhile, dials things up a notch with stories of a viral food hack from a few years back when some leftover takeaway fried chicken, stock, soy sauce and rice went into a rice cooker. “The crispy chicken became soft and was broken up into the rice with a dollop of butter,” she recalls. “I haven’t tried it myself, but that’s because I so seldom have any leftover fried chicken.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/07/can-i-use-my-rice-cooker-for-anything-else-kitchen-aide">Continue reading...</a>

## I’m a virgin and too scared to have sex. How can I get over my fear?

<p>At 19 I would like to experience sex. But the reality makes me extremely anxious – and what if it is all a partner wants from me?</p><p><strong>I’m 19</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>scared to have sex</strong><strong>. I’ve had a couple of relationships in the last </strong><strong>two months but whenever anything sexual comes up, I become extremely anxious and scared. I can have sexual thoughts about my partners but when they bring up wanting to have sex</strong><strong> I immediately back out</strong><strong>. I’m still a virgin and </strong><strong>afraid that if I have sex with someone that</strong><strong> that is all they will want from me</strong><strong>. I want to experience sex but it makes me </strong><strong>nervous to the point where it causes anxiety attacks. I’m </strong><strong>OK with sending </strong><strong>nude</strong><strong> photos</strong><strong>, but </strong><strong>hop</strong><strong>e you may be able to help me figure out why I’m like this and help me to get over this fear.</strong></p><p>Your sexual desire is connected with a sense of safety. Without the latter you will never be “in the mood” with anyone. Try to change your mindset by releasing yourself from any pressure of expectations to have sex that might come from either yourself or others. Make it your mission to simply enjoy being with people you like in non-intimate ways, and always withdraw if they make you feel uncomfortable. You have every right to take your time so wait until you really feel ready to be sexual with someone. Never allow anyone to coerce you into sex, and never force yourself to go through with a sexual experience for any other reason than pure desire. Given your true feelings about sex, sending erotic images of yourself may not have authentic meaning for you, and might be read as willingness to be sexual immediately. Instead, by holding back, you will send a different unspoken message – that you are discerning and will wait for the right person and the right time. Sex should simply be fun for you – and never, ever terrifying.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

## The Middle Man review – relentlessly pointless non-comedy hits cul-de-sac of quirk

<p>Bent Hamer’s films are known for their deadpan humour but nothing funny – nor sad, nor plausible – happens in this film about a man whose job is to break the news to those whose relations have been killed</p><p>Bent Hamer is a Norwegian film-maker who began his career with quirky absurdist movies in the 00s such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1114614,.html">Kitchen Stories</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/07/o-horten-film-review">O’Horten</a>, and also his rather tougher film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/nov/18/3">Factotum from 2005</a> – a fictionalised study of Charles Bukowski starring Matt Dillon. Perhaps Hamer’s career benefited a good deal from international festival juries having a soft spot for his kind of goofy deadpan humour, but I was never entirely sure exactly how funny or meaningful his creations ultimately were. However, his film-making had a certain rigour and poise.</p><p>The same, sadly, can’t be said for his new film, set in some featureless anytown in North America, in which a bland young guy called Frank (Pål Sverre Hagen) gets an official position as a “middle man”: someone whose job it is to deliver bad news to people whose relations have been killed. It is a post that leads him into all sorts of difficulties, especially when he delivers bad news to the wrong people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/07/the-middle-man-review-bent-hamer">Continue reading...</a>

## Going out-out again: Micky Flanagan’s irresistibly unreconstructed comedy comeback

<p>After several years away, the cheeky cockney comic is doubling down on his good-old-days brand – but despite his geezerish nostalgia he’s no anti-woke crusader</p><p>Micky Flanagan was worried, he says, that audiences might have moved on. Fair enough: it has been half a decade since he last graced the nation’s stages, when the man who defined the difference between going “out” and “<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5k8Su_ek2k&amp;ab_channel=MickyFlanaganChannel">out</a></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5k8Su_ek2k&amp;ab_channel=MickyFlanaganChannel"> out</a>” was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/18/micky-flanagan-and-another-fing-tour-o2">arguably the UK’s most popular comedian</a>. But time waits for no standup, least of all when the intervening period has seen him hit 60, and seen the context change in which old-school, cheeky chappy comedy might be delivered.</p><p>And yet, his worries are without substance, if the opening night of his Hammersmith run was any gauge. These were the last warm-up gigs before Flanagan’s tour proper starts next week, and they found the east Londoner in evergreen form, and rapturously received by a crowd that still adores him. Watching it, one could believe the market may even be growing for Flanagan’s brand of comedy, which looks at poncy modernity with the sceptical eye of one who grew up poor and without sentimentality in the middle of the previous century. These are confusing times, and there’s something reassuring about the solid certainties from a simpler age that Flanagan brings – or at least there is when delivered with Flanagan’s fundamental unseriousness and sense of fun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/07/micky-flanagan-comedy-return-tour">Continue reading...</a>

It’s starting to look that way. Only a few months ago the pair were media darlings in the US; now they have become a bit of a joke. The animated sitcom South Park gave the first big blow to their stateside brand a couple of weeks ago with an episode featuring a couple bearing an uncanny similarity to the Sussexes. In the episode, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/22/baseless-nonsense-meghan-and-harry-wont-sue-south-park-for-mocking-them">titled The Worldwide Privacy Tour</a>, the pair travel the globe with placards saying: “Stop looking at us!” and chanting: “We want privacy!” Harry’s memoir, Spare, is parodied as “Waaaagh”. The couple also get advice from a PR expert who tells them to portray themselves as victims. Not terribly flattering stuff.</p><p>Now the comedian <a href="https://www.skynews.com.au/opinion/piers-morgan/chris-rock-targets-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-in-his-new-netflix-special/video/40dfb3d1e8196a97840e93c7a24b9e4b">Chris Rock has taken aim</a> at the couple in his new Netflix special, Selective Outrage. He dismissed Meghan’s claims about racism in the royal family, saying: “Some of that shit she went through was not racism”, but “in-law” behaviour. He also joked about how it was odd Meghan seemed surprised by the fact the royal family might harbour archaic views. “It’s the royal family! They’re the original racists. They invented colonialism,” Rock said.</p><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/07/how-is-brand-harry-and-meghan-faring-in-the-us-news-just-in-not-good">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up for the full article here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Last week, Meta announced LLaMA, its latest stab at making a GPT-style “large language model”*. If AI is the future of tech, then big tech companies need to control their own models or be left behind by the competition. LLaMA joins OpenAI’s GPT (licensed by Microsoft for Bing and underpinning OpenAI’s own ChatGPT) and Google’s LaMDA (which will power Bard, its ChatGPT rival) in the upper echelons of the field.</p><p>Meta’s goal wasn’t simply to replicate GPT. It says that LLaMA is a “smaller, more performant model” than its peers, built to achieve the same feats of comprehension and articulation with a smaller footprint in terms of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/28/techscape-black-box-neural-networks-ai-acronyms">compute</a>*, and so has a correspondingly smaller environmental impact. (The fact that it’s cheaper to run doesn’t hurt, either.)</p><p><em>Even with all the recent advancements in large language models, full research access to them remains limited because of the resources that are required to train and run such large models. This restricted access has limited researchers’ ability to understand how and why these large language models work, hindering progress on efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues, such as bias, toxicity, and the potential for generating misinformation.</em></p><p><em>By sharing the code for LLaMA, other researchers can more easily test new approaches to limiting or eliminating these problems in large language models.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/07/techscape-meta-leak-llama-chatgpt-ai-crossroads">Continue reading...</a>

When I was taken to see it recently by National Portrait Gallery director Nicholas Cullinan I was left stunned. Seeing it where it currently hangs in the gallery, which is undergoing a refit to reopen on 22 June, is a breathtaking experience. It showcases the genius of Reynolds at the height of his powers.</p><p>And yet not long ago it looked like we might lose it. The National Portrait Gallery has been fighting for a way to keep it in this country, to be enjoyed by future generations, but at times it looked like it could not be saved. Recently, however, we have started to believe it might be possible. Yet more help is needed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/07/joshua-reynolds-omai-portrait-uk-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Everybody knows the playmaker is first among equals but perceptions change and the position is an indicator of intent</p><p>It has been the same for as long as the game has been played. Talk up a fly-half for his dash and vision and someone with big hands and a crooked nose will take a long sip from his pint before putting you straight. Back in the day the words “fancy dan” or “luxury item” might have been used. Now it will be “game plan” or “defensive solidity” or some other mood-dousing excuse why talent, on its own, is not to be trusted.</p><p>In the late 70s and early 80s in Ireland, for example, you were either a Tony Ward or an Ollie Campbell fan. Both were wonderful players but only one of them could start. It was a similar story when England had to choose between Rob Andrew and Stuart Barnes. Roundheads v Cavaliers. Glass half empty or half full. After a while it becomes less a sporting debate than a soul-baring symbol of your entire personality. A Finn Russell man?

## Laura Bates: ‘For teenage girls, escaping harassment, revenge porn and deepfake porn is impossible’

<p>She wrote the definitive book on online misogyny – which led to the police installing a panic alarm in her home. Bates explains how the ‘manosphere’ radicalises boys, how the media feeds the problem – and why she is still hopeful<br /></p><p>“I think this is the biggest generation gap we’ve seen,” says Laura Bates. “It hasn’t happened before, and it might not ever happen again.” Five minutes into a conversation that lasts nearly two hours, Bates is crisply reminding me of one of the key things that define this bit of the 21st century. We have met to talk about misogyny, the online gathering grounds known as the manosphere, and Andrew Tate, the Big Brother contestant turned influencer responsible for webcam pornography businesses and a great splurge of misogynistic rhetoric. But the conversation also keeps returning to the huge gap between the younger generations, Z and alpha, who have never known anything other than the chaotic, sense-distorting, internet-defined reality of the 21st century; and the parents, politicians and journalists who are still running to keep up.</p><p>Older people, she says, tend to be resident in a world where YouTube is reducible to “movie trailers and cat videos” and social media largely means Facebook. Bates is 36, and from the cohort that cut its teeth on MSN Messenger and Myspace, and became immersed in the online world, but was spared the kind of adolescence that would soon be completely dominated by phones, platforms for constant communication, online porn and internet videos. Today’s teenagers, by contrast, know nothing else.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/07/laura-bates-for-teenage-girls-escaping-harassment-revenge-porn-and-deepfake-porn-is-impossible">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Projectile vomiting and exploding toilets aside, Ruben Östlund’s satire about the super-rich is more thoughtful than it initially appears – it’s a film for our times</p><p>T<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/21/the-triangle-of-sadness-review-heavy-handed-satire-on-the-super-rich-loses-its-shape">riangle of Sadness</a> debuted at Cannes last May and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/28/ruben-ostlunds-triangle-of-sadness-wins-palme-dor-at-cannes">won the Palme d’Or for best film</a>. The chances of it repeating the feat at the Oscars 10 months later seems about as likely as Jeremy Clarkson duetting with Beyoncé. The Academy doesn’t seem to go for films that have 15-minute set pieces in which almost the entire cast projectile vomits, topped off with backed-up toilets exploding in a surge of sewage.</p><p>Well, more fool them – because Triangle of Sadness is a film for our times. It follows Carl (Harris Dickinson), a model, and his influencer girlfriend Yaya (played by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/30/charlbi-dean-was-a-true-star-in-the-making-her-loss-is-a-huge-one">Charlbi Dean</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/30/charlbi-dean-dies-model-actor-triangle-of-sadness">who tragically died aged 32, just before the film was released</a>), as they take a free luxury cruise, Instagramming as they go. The other holidaymakers are particularly grotesque examples of the super-rich. There’s a sweet, elderly English couple who turn out to be arms dealers; Dimitry, a Russian oligarch who has earned his billions selling fertiliser – or, as he more bluntly puts it, shit (this is quite an excrement-focused film), and a woman who insists that the entire staff of the ship take a swim. Since they have been told that any request from the passengers, however ludicrous, cannot be refused, they comply – which leads to the food for that evening spoiling, and the volcanic puke-fest. Meanwhile, the captain spends most of his time in his cabin getting pissed, until he emerges in order to swap Chomsky and Marx quotes with Dimitry over the ship’s PA system while it is battered by a terrible storm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/07/why-triangle-of-sadness-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar-ruben-ostlund">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A study of a female painter who exhibited with the first impressionists in 19th-century Paris but saw little of their renown is fascinating and moving</p><p>Here is an interesting and, towards the end, actually quite moving study of American émigré painter Mary Cassatt, one of three female artists who took part in the celebrated impressionist exhibitions in late 19th-century Paris, and whose biographers here do an excellent job of reclaiming from relative obscurity. In fact, they do considerably more: Cassatt is built up to be a pioneering feminist voice in an art world that at the time was largely hostile to female painters.</p><p>Unlike most of films in the Exhibition on Screen series, this is not related to a blockbuster exhibition, or even a specific collection: it’s instead a general overview of Cassatt’s life and work, starting with her privileged upbringing in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, before her near-permanent shift to Europe after the American civil war, and the consequent headway she made with the then radical impressionist movement (including her strong friendship and collaboration with Edgar Degas.)</p><p>Mary Cassatt: Painting the Modern Woman is released on 8 March in cinemas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/07/mary-cassatt-painting-the-modern-woman-review-fine-portrait-of-a-neglected-artist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>No scare prop is left out in a clunky tale of magical daggers and spooky furnishings as a family find their daughter is up to her eyes in hellishness</p><p>Cluttered as it is with magical, mystical MacGuffins, ghosts, curses and ominous knick-knacks, this cheap but seldom cheerful horror feature is the cinematic equivalent of a thrift store of evil. The plot revolves around the Snyder family: insurance salesman dad Daniel (Will Klipstine, also the film’s writer-director), fervent Catholic mum Theresa (Amanda MacDonald), and young daughter and conduit of evil Rosalie (Madeleine McGraw). The poor kid used to be a happy, unexceptional moppet who, judging by the many saccharine sun-filled flashbacks we’re shown, enjoyed playing football and making cupcakes with her parents. But something happened along the way and now she ominously announces at funerals that the deceased is burning in hell at that very moment, and that a servant of the devil called the Harbinger has arrived (does that make her the Harbinger’s harbinger?).</p><p>Either way, the Snyders move to what seems like an unremarkable midwestern suburb where the neighbours are super-creepy with their excessive hospitality and talk of neighbourhood watch. On the outskirts of town there’s a Native American seer called Floating Hawk (Irene Bedard) who conveniently dispenses exposition about what’s really going on which, honest-to-God, involves sacred burial grounds, giant keys and evil-dispersing daggers. If a monkey’s paw and a cursed amulet had been thrown in the mix, I wouldn’t have been surprised.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/07/the-curse-of-rosalie-review-horror-moppet-presides-over-thrift-shop-of-evil">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The failure of Pete Buttigieg, the US secretary of transportion, to appear for nearly three weeks recalls the incompetence of Fema during Hurricane Katrina</p><p>“Where’s Pete Buttigieg?” someone<strong> </strong>shouted at a February 15 town hall meeting in East Palestine, Ohio. “I don’t know,” Mayor Trent Conaway replied.</p><p>Twelve days earlier, a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous chemicals had derailed near the town. Three days later, the company announced it was going to carry out a controlled burn of vinyl chloride that would send dangerous gasses into the air, forcing many of East Palestine’s 4,700 residents to evacuate. They returned after receiving assurances that the air and water were safe, but a strong chemical odor clung to the town, and many continued to complain of headaches, nausea, and burning throats. And so several hundred residents had crowded into a local school to demand answers. Conaway said that two weeks had passed before anyone at the White House had contacted him, and the US secretary of transportation still hadn’t materialized.</p><p>Michael Massing is the author most recently of Fatal Discord: Erasmus, Luther, and the Fight for the Western Mind</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/07/the-democrats-botched-the-ohio-disaster-response-and-handed-trump-a-victory">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The London R&amp;B trio are building a fanbase through an intriguing mix of 90s hothousing, a 00s-style ‘journey’ and modern-day social media intimacy</p><p>Last week, two brand new UK girl bands spent some time with their respective fanbases. For Flo – the Brit-award-winning, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/05/girl-group-flo-win-bbc-sound-of-2023">BBC Sound of poll-topping</a>, magazine-covering new hope – the fans were in Paris, waiting outside a star-studded Loewe fashion show in the hope of grabbing a selfie. In London, meanwhile, an R&amp;B girl band so new that they have almost no music or even a name held a gathering at a branch of ice-cream parlour Creams to celebrate a year since completing their lineup. Billed on their social media accounts as “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@needanamebro">needanamebro</a>”, teenagers Yssy, Amelia and Maddie have quickly gathered momentum, reaching nearly 250,000 followers and 11m likes on TikTok. Their path has been an intriguing, era-straddling mix of classic 90s girl band hothousing, letting fans share in a 2000s X Factor-style “journey” and a hefty dose of modern-day social media intimacy and world-building.</p><p>While the nascent girl band’s event had the feel of a typically ad hoc, ironic teenage hangout at a brightly lit sweet emporium, it was underscored by major label efficiency: they’re signed to Atlantic and managed by pop band star-maker Modest, former incubator of Little Mix and One Direction – both parties clearly keenly aware of the potential for a new girl group to fill a Little Mix-shaped hole in pop. A special needanamebro menu was created as a keepsake featuring different ice-cream specials for each member (Amelia’s teeth-rotting Amazing Kinder Bueno Waffle With Bueno Gelato, for example). Over the course of a sugar-rich 90 minutes, the London-based band hung out with a portion of their fanbase like best mates, immersing them in a world that’s still being constructed: their <a href="https://soundcloud.com/needanamebro">Soundcloud page</a> has one song – a gorgeous, harmony-drenched cover of Drake’s Massive – while a playlist of favourite tracks (and obvious stylistic signposts) features the Sugababes, SZA and 90s US R&amp;B trio Brownstone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/07/needanamebro-why-the-uks-next-girl-band-stars-dont-even-have-a-name-yet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new book paints President Woodrow Wilson’s wife as a complex change-maker who refused to blend into the background</p><p>A century before the dawn of Instagram, Edith Wilson had her own means of distorting reality for the watchful masses. Her husband, President Woodrow Wilson, was recovering from a stroke, in no shape to be seen by the public or his political foes who suspected he wasn’t up to leading a country. Unbeknown to anyone but his super-inner circle, he spent his days on his back in a hole-ridden sweater, his entire left side paralyzed.</p><p>As Rebecca Boggs Roberts details in the nail-biter opening of Untold Power: The Fascinating Rise and Complex Legacy of First Lady Edith Wilson, the woman who would stealthily become the nation’s first female acting president oversaw a meet-and-greet with a nosy band of visitors, including the secretary of state, Robert Lansing, and a couple of senators who insisted on a face-to-face. The event had all the ingredients of a disaster. Wilson’s visitors were coming under the false pretenses of discussing an international kidnapping but their true aim was to gather evidence of the Democratic president’s unfitness for office. But somehow, with the help of a circus of doctors and aides all overseen by Mrs Wilson, as well as the husband who followed her cues and even shaved for the occasion, managed to leave everybody under the impression that the man supposedly running the country was in perfectly fine fettle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/07/edith-wilson-book-interview-rebecca-boggs-roberts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In one of my daughter’s classes, she was shown footage of me talking about ethics a decade ago. The views I’m espousing made me double-take</p><p>“You were in our PBE video,” my youngest said, when she got home from school. I find it hard to disaggregate the acronym lessons in the timetable, and tend to assume everything is PE. It struck me as unlikely, however, that I’d be in a PE video, so I dredged my brain and found “philosophy, beliefs and ethics”. Sure, that checks out. I have beliefs, a couple of ethics. I must have said them in a video at some point or other.</p><p>“I said you were my mum, and nobody believed me,” she continued, and I said: “Why? Are you known for making up weird lies?” And she said: “That too, but also, different surnames. Then, when the teacher believed me, she asked if you’d come in and talk to the class, and I said you’d probably like that but, from my point of view, absolutely no way.”</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/07/an-old-video-of-me-is-on-the-school-curriculum-unfortunately-i-am-shocked-by-my-own-arguments">Continue reading...</a>

Ahmed’s pithy yet lyrical writing was the final piece of work needed for the project. With more than 50 artworks completed, a long list of quotes agreed on and the inclusion of candid photographs of their wing’s servery, the group had pulled off what at one point had seemed impossible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/07/if-only-my-tastebuds-could-paint-how-prison-food-art-reveals-life-inside-pentonville">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With his dinner parties for 900 and weakness for Coca-Cola in Lalique goblets, the designer was a great eccentric whose sense of absurdity is largely absent from this thorough profile</p><p>Costume historians will doubtless look back on the day Karl Lagerfeld died in February 2019, leaving in his will lavish instructions for the ongoing care of his Birman cat Choupette, as the precise moment when the fun finally went out of high fashion. Yes, it’s possible another full-blown eccentric will one day preside over a big house. But it doesn’t feel, in the era of the global conglomerate, terribly likely. “Creation,” as Lagerfeld once put it, “is not a democratic process.” The more people (I may mean accountants) who stick their oar in, the more likely we are to get half a dozen good camel coats on a catwalk than the kind of show, <em>raffiné</em> but wildly exuberant, that could reduce the late André Leon Talley, of American <em>Vogue</em>, to tears of joy. The cape-clad, fan-carrying, monocle-wearing, be-ponytailed Lagerfeld was the last of the last and he deserves a serious biography.</p><p>Does <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/paradise-now-9780062969033">Paradise Now: The Extraordinary Life of Karl Lagerfeld</a> </em>do the job? Or is it, like a toile, only about halfway there? <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/43247/william-middleton/">William Middleton</a>, its author, certainly has the fashion chops: he used to head the Paris bureau of <em>Women’s Wear Daily</em>. But the trouble with insiders is that their respect is usually too ardent, and their need to remain on good terms with their world’s big names too powerful, for the distance required of biography. Yes, he gives us in its entirety the long reign of Kaiser Karl, from his peculiar childhood in Germany to the lonely months at the end when he was secretly fighting cancer, leaving out – or so it feels – not a single one of the parties he threw along the way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/07/paradise-now-the-extraordinary-life-of-karl-lagerfeld-by-william-middleton-review-planet-fashions-caped-crusader">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The likable new release Rye Lane bills itself as ‘a love letter to south London’. But, like Amélie in Montmartre, could it end up damaging the place it sets out to celebrate?</p><p>It’s always fun to see an area you know in a movie, so as a Peckham local, the new romcom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/24/rye-lane-review-engagingly-cartoony-romcom-on-the-streets-of-south-london">Rye Lane</a> is literally up my street. It is named after the bustling main thoroughfare of our south London neighbourhood, which is in the early stages of gentrification. African groceries and pound shops jostle up against new cocktail bars and art galleries. Go back 20 years and all Peckham was known for was working-class wheeler-dealing – largely thanks to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/23/only-fools-and-horses-lawson">Only Fools and Horses</a> – and violent crime. Even our MP, Harriet Harman, wore a stab vest when she visited in 2008. Today, Peckham is a hip, popular destination, described by the New York Times as “the beating heart of London’s most dynamic art scene”. And now we’ve got our own romcom, too.</p><p>Rye Lane the movie is a very likable variation on a very familiar formula, making Rye Lane the place look somehow better and brighter on screen than in real life. Everything pops with colour as if it’s had a new coat of paint. There’s an absence of homeless people, drunk people, noisy schoolkids, traffic jams. Instead, there are quirky characters, like a grey-haired rhinestone cowboy who body-pops surreally across Rye Lane market as our lovestruck couple (David Jonsson and Vivian Oparah) stroll through it. When I walked through the same market the other day, the local colour took the form of a shouting match between rival stallholders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/07/the-romcom-effect-will-a-new-movie-gentrify-peckham-as-richard-curtis-gentrified-notting-hill">Continue reading...</a>

## The creeping threat of the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt

<p>Visible from space, an explosion of harmful seaweed now stretches like a sea monster across the ocean. Could robots save us from it – and store carbon in the process?</p><p>Seaweed has been having a moment. Eco-influencers and columnists rave about its benefits, in everything from beauty products to biofuels. Jamie Oliver has embraced it as a recipe ingredient; Victoria Beckham uses it to keep off the pounds. And they’re right: seaweed is packed with nutrition, it sucks up carbon and is an amazingly versatile addition to the green economy.</p><p>But one type of seaweed is not a benign force. Vast fields of sargassum, a brown seaweed, have bloomed in the Atlantic Ocean. Fed by human activity such as intensive soya farming in the Congo, the Amazon and the Mississippi, which dumps nitrogen and phosphorus into the ocean, the sargassum explosion is by far the biggest seaweed bloom on the planet. The Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt, as it’s known, is visible from space, stretching like a sea monster across the ocean, with its nose in the Gulf of Mexico and its tail in the mouth of the Congo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/07/great-atlantic-sargassum-belt-seaweed-visible-from-space">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I know where the bodies are buried’: one woman’s mission to change how the police investigate rape

<p>For the past two years, Betsy Stanko has been leading an unprecedented investigation into why the police have been failing so badly to tackle sexual violence. But is there any chance of fixing a system that seems so broken?</p><p>In September 2021, the criminologist Betsy Stanko went into the Metropolitan police force to work out why they weren’t catching rapists. The previous year, less than 3% of rapes reported to the Met had resulted in charges being brought; in 2021, that percentage almost halved. The Home Office had given Stanko a mandate to force the Met to open its files,<strong> </strong>and now she and her team – 54 academics, 47 of them women, all of them scholars of sexual violence – gained<strong> </strong>access to everything: tens of thousands of case files covering the previous four years, shift observations, video-recorded interviews, conversations with officers at every rank. “I wanted to rip the heart out of the police, put it on the table and do a bypass,” the 72-year-old American told me last year.</p><p>Six months earlier, Stanko had been working with the Avon and Somerset police force on a project to improve its rape investigations, when the news broke that a 33-year-old woman named Sarah Everard had been kidnapped from a London common. The man who was later arrested for Everard’s rape and murder, Wayne Couzens, was a Metropolitan police officer. In the weeks that followed, there were demonstrations, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/07/met-officers-feared-sarah-everard-vigil-had-become-anti-police-protest">vigils and calls for</a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/07/met-officers-feared-sarah-everard-vigil-had-become-anti-police-protest"> </a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/07/met-officers-feared-sarah-everard-vigil-had-become-anti-police-protest">inquiries</a> – an outpouring of rage that reminded Stanko of her time in the women’s movement of the 1970s. If many people, especially people of colour, had long been distrustful of the police, others were for the first time questioning who they were really for.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/mar/07/one-womans-mission-to-fix-how-the-police-investigate-rape-operation-soteria-betsy-stanko">Continue reading...</a>

Its ribbon was cut by local children involved in its current purpose: to urge people not to buy plastic water bottles but to refill their own bottles here.</p><p>I was there because the fountain was erected in 1868 in memory of my great-great-grandfather, <a href="https://makingscience.royalsociety.org/s/rs/people/fst00134694">Joseph Toynbee</a>, otologist and ear-syringer to Queen Victoria: he died young in his laboratory experimenting on himself with chloroform for tinnitus.

She won the Wairarapa seat – once considered a rural, conservative stronghold – with a resounding victory and a 32% swing to Labour. Having served her community as mayor for five years, Beyer won over constituents with a straight-talking, upfront style and a constant presence at community events. In parliament, she became a force on behalf of the rainbow community, helping push forward progressive law reform on sex work and civil unions, often despite fierce opposition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/07/georgina-beyer-worlds-first-transgender-mp-remembered-as-trailblazer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Volodymyr Zelenskiy commits to defending Bakhmut and pays tribute to executed soldier</p><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine is committed to defending the embattled city of Bakhmut despite a partial encirclement. </strong>The Ukrainian president said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/06/ukraine-continues-to-defend-bakhmut">he had held a meeting with senior generals and commanders</a> in which it was resolved that there was “no part of Ukraine” that “can be abandoned”.</p><p><strong>Both Kyiv and Moscow appear to be struggling with ammunition shortages and mounting casualties.</strong><strong> </strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, which is leading the Russian offensive in Bakhmut, said that his representative had been denied access to the headquarters of Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine after Prigozhin repeatedly complained about a lack of ammunition.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian forces appeared to be “conducting a limited fighting withdrawal” in eastern Bakhmut</strong>, the Institute for the Study of War said,<strong> but continued to inflict high casualties on the advancing Russian forces</strong>. The US thinktank said it was too early to judge Ukraine’s intentions but the defence of Bakhmut “remains strategically sound”.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy </strong><strong>paid tribute to a soldier whose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/06/ukraine-urges-icc-to-investigate-video-appearing-to-show-russians-killing-pow">execution by machine gun was filmed</a> and uploaded to social media.</strong> The graphic video shows a man smoking a cigarette who says “glory to Ukraine” before he is shot at what appears to be close range.</p><p><strong>The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited Mariupol in a rare trip to occupied Ukraine by a senior Moscow figure. </strong>The Russian defence ministry issued images on Monday of Shoigu “inspecting Russian reconstruction efforts of infrastructure”.</p><p><strong>The exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has been handed a 15-year jail term after being convicted in absentia for treason and “conspiracy to seize power”.</strong> She said the verdict was punishment for her efforts to promote democracy.</p><p><strong>The European Union is reported to be edging closer to joint procurement of ammunition to help Ukraine and replenish members’ stockpiles.</strong> Major questions regarding funding and scale remain to be resolved in what would be <strong>a landmark move</strong>.</p><p><strong>Russia’s premier tank force is expected to be re-equipped with Soviet-made T-62 tanks first fielded in 1954 to make up for combat losses</strong>, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. The MoD said there was a “realistic” possibility” that the 60-year-old tanks would be supplied to units that had been expected to receive the next-generation T-14 Armata main battle tank.</p><p><strong>Russia’s prosecutor general has said it is labelling German-based anti-corruption group Transparency International an “undesirable organisation”.</strong> “It was found that the activities of this organisation clearly go beyond the declared goals and objectives,” it said.</p><p><strong>A British-led £520m international fund to provide fresh weapons for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> and intended to be “low bureaucracy” has been plagued by delays</strong>, with only £200m allocated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/06/british-led-fund-to-provide-weapons-for-ukraine-plagued-by-delays">amid warnings</a> that the rest of the funding will not provide arms at the front “until the summer”.</p><p><strong>Most of Ukraine’s winter grain crops – winter wheat and barley – are in good condition and could produce a good harvest</strong>, Ukraine’s academy of agricultural science has been quoted as saying.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-377-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
