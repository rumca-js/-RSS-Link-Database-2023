  <p id="bnDXRX">A controversial tactic for slowing climate change is picking up steam in Texas: capturing carbon dioxide emissions from smokestacks. While that might reduce CO2 emissions heating up the planet, it could pose new problems for communities already saddled with industrial pollution. </p>
<p id="ERZmAu">Oil giant Occidental announced late last week that it leased 55,000 acres along the Gulf Coast of Texas to build out a hub for carbon capture technologies.

In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hIyPAt-xDA">a video uploaded to the Creator Insider channel</a>, the company says it reviewed the data on how the new rules were enforced and found that they “resulted in a stricter approach than we intended.” The update means that creators will still be able to make at least some money on videos, even if there’s mild swearing up front, though the restrictions remain confusing and don’t fully revert to the older rules.</p>

  <p id="0nsM3T">Niantic, the studio behind <em>Pokémon Go</em>, is releasing its next big game very soon. The developer announced that the virtual pet game <em>Peridot</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/13/23021722/peridot-niantic-ar-pet-game-iphone-android-pokemon-go">which was first announced last year</a>, will be available on both iOS and Android on May 9th. It’ll be a global launch.</p>

<p id="uCdp0c">I had the chance to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23171300/peridot-hands-on-preview-niantic">check out <em>Peridot </em>last summer</a>, and that early version was an adorable mash-up of <em>Pokémon Go</em>’s augmented reality aspects with a Tamagotchi-style pet sim. In a blog post today, David Hollin, <em>Peridot</em>’s creative director, went into more detail about how the game will work when it does launch:</p>
<blockquote>

  <p id="QFC2na">Sonos isn’t about to make the same mistake twice. In hindsight, its transition in 2020 to a major new software platform, <a href="https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/sonos-s2-compatibility">S2</a>, could’ve been communicated better and handled with more consideration for longtime customers. A few <em>very</em> old products <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075043/sonos-software-updates-ending-play-5-connect-zone-players">were left behind</a>, though only one speaker was affected: the first-generation Play:5. For those devices, Sonos has continued to maintain the old S1 controller app and deliver bug fixes / security patches. But the whole thing got messy and took some time for Sonos to straighten out.</p>

<p id="U2EntL">Those with access to the app can click the three-dots icon in a thread and hit “Draft reply” instead of typing out the response themselves. It’s still not clear how detailed these responses will get — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams">or if they might get a bit wonky at times</a>.

Devices like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527247/astrohaus-freewrite-traveler-word-processor-review">Freewrite</a> are very cool in practice but simply too finicky for me to use as anything more than a gimmick.

  <p id="i2T0WY">After over seven years and 43 software updates, Fairphone’s second-generation Android smartphone is finally reaching the end of its software support period. The company says today’s software update for Android 10 will be the phone’s last, capping off a remarkably long support period for a phone that originally ran Android 5 when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/21/10633928/fairphone-2-starts-shipping-repairable-phone">it started shipping in 2015</a>.

It aims to be “a rigorous portrait of Elon Musk,” said Zhang Xin, a producer for the film, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/elon-musk-documentary-alex-gibney-scientology-oscars-1235544410/">according to <em>Variety</em></a>.</p>

Other than the name and the general vibe that it’ll be taking a hard look at one of the world’s richest men and most famous tech CEOs, there currently aren’t a lot of details about the documentary.

  <p id="TBpMDH">China-based display maker BOE (Beijing Oriental Electronics) has a complicated relationship with Apple.

This latest report comes as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/10/23549429/microled-apple-watch-rumor-custom-design-samsung">Apple is allegedly working on its own display tech</a> — and trying to lessen reliance on its main display maker and rival, Samsung.</p>
<p id="F6VnAl">Things got off to a rough start with Apple in 2020 when some of BOE’s screens for the iPhone 12 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/12/boe-oled-panels-for-iphone-12-not-shipped/">reportedly failed quality tests</a>.
