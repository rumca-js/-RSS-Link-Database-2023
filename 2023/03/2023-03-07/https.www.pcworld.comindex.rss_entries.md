<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This review was updated on 3/7/23 to update pricing and plan details.</em></p>



<p>Keeper has always emphasized security, more than some other password managers. But in the past that sometimes came at the expense of things that consumers prize like ease-of-use and eye-catching aesthetics. Thankfully, the password manager has made some smart updates since the last time I reviewed it, including modernizing its interface, while strengthening its already impressive security features. Its pricing has also dropped to $34.99 for the Personal Plan and $74.99 for the Family Plan.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><span class="TextRun SCXW139123568" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW139123568">Note: See our roundup of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">best password managers</a>&nbsp;</span></span>to learn about competing products, what to look for in a password manager, and product recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Keeper&rsquo;s guided multi-step setup gets you up and running quickly. You&rsquo;re first asked to import any passwords you have saved in your browser. Given the inherent risks of storing passwords this way, all users should happily oblige. You can also import passwords from 15 other popular password managers, including <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3205901/dashlane-review-this-password-manager-makes-you-smarter-about-security.html">Dashlane</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3205868/lastpass-review-this-virtual-vault-makes-password-protection-effortless.html">LastPass</a>. Next, it walks you through the process of installing the Keeper browser extension, creating your first record, and adding your personal and credit card information for auto form filling. Finally, it prompts you to turn on two-factor authentication; it supports several different authentication methods, including text message, Google Authenticator (TOTP), Smart Watch, RSA SecurID, and DUO Security and FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) compatible hardware security keys.</p>



<p>As with other password managers, Keeper&rsquo;s main utility is capturing your credentials whenever you log in to a website. When you first visit a secure site after installing Keeper, you can have it save your login when prompted or create a new username and password directly in Keeper by clicking the lock icons that appear in those fields. Keeper will generate a password of 8 to 51 characters using a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numerals, and symbols. When you save the record, Keeper automatically fills the site&rsquo;s login fields with the new credentials.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>While seriously security-minded users stand to get the most out of Keeper&rsquo;s robust features set, even those just wanting an easier way to manage their passwords will be safer for using it.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keeper" class="wp-image-1531524" height="974" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/en_US_Edit.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>When you save a record, Keeper automatically fills the site&rsquo;s login fields with the new credentials.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keeper</p></div>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve saved your login credentials for a website, Keeper will surface a pop-up prompt each time you return, asking if you want it to autofill the credentials. If you have multiple logins for a site&mdash;a bank where both you and your spouse have accounts, for example&mdash;you can view all of them by clicking the lock icon and select the appropriate one for autofill.</p>



<p>Keeper also recognizes when you&rsquo;ve accessed a website&rsquo;s &ldquo;change password&rdquo; page and surfaces a one-click update-and-save option to store the new password in your vault. It does not, however, support automated password updates as this violates Keeper&rsquo;s &ldquo;zero knowledge&rdquo; policy&mdash;to ensure your sovereignty over your passwords, the password manager eschews any features that would expose your login credentials to the company. As a Keeper contact explained to me, automatic password updates require passwords to temporarily reside on Keeper&rsquo;s servers and that is anathema to the company.</p>



<p>The Keeper browser plugin is fairly minimal. At the top is a search field for looking up password records by website name. Beneath that is a toggle for enabling/disabling the lock icons that appear in websites&rsquo; login fields, and buttons for accessing your vault, various Keeper settings, a user guide, and a logout button.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keeper" class="wp-image-1531526" height="964" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/en_US_BreachWatch.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Keeper&rsquo;s BreachWatch feature scans the Dark Web to see if your passwords have been compromised.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keeper</p></div>



<p>Clicking on &ldquo;vault&rdquo; in the browser extension opens Keeper&rsquo;s web interface. The vault displays all your passwords in a list or as tiles, and you can group records into folders if you want to organize them further. Every password record allows you to attach files and photos, create custom fields, and add notes. The vault also keeps a complete record of every password you&rsquo;ve used for a site and allows you to restore them. It maintains version histories of all attached files, as well. Personal information and credit card records are stored in their own section.</p>



<p>The Security Audit section of the interface assigns a password strength to each entry so you can easily identify weak and reused passwords and change them. It also displays how long it&rsquo;s been since each password was changed, though <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3393169/what-should-your-companys-change-password-policy-be.html&amp;xcust=2-1-398233-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed"> NIST guidelines no longer recommend regularly changing you password </a> and advise you to do it only after you know it&rsquo;s been compromised. Keeper&rsquo;s&nbsp;BreachWatch feature makes it easier to discover stolen passwords, by scanning the Dark Web to see if any of your credentials have been found in previous breaches.</p>



<p>Keeper supports secure sharing of any password with anyone who has a Keeper account. If you try to share a record with someone who doesn&rsquo;t, they will be instructed to sign up for a free account. By default, the recipient will be able to use the login but not change it. You can expand permissions on the record up to making the recipient its owner. You can also share multiple passwords by creating a shared folder, with permissions working much the same as with an individual record. Keeper&rsquo;s Emergency Access feature allows you to grant access to up to five trusted contacts, who can log in in the event you can&rsquo;t for whatever reason.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keeper" class="wp-image-1531525" height="964" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/en_US_Account.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Keeper&rsquo;s Family plan provides password vaults for five people.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keeper</p></div>



<p>Keeper&rsquo;s free version provides access to your password vault on unlimited devices and secure sharing. It&rsquo;s worth starting there to determine if you want to pay for the service. For $34.99 a year, the Personal plan adds unlimited password, payment, and identity info storage; fingerprint and face ID login; emergency access; and 24/7 support. The Family plan included everything in the Personal plan and adds five private vaults, 10GB Secure File Storage, and the ability to share folders and records, and manage permissions, for $74.99 a year.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-use-keeper-password-manager">Should you use Keeper password manager?</h2>



<p>Thanks to some welcome features updates, Keeper is one of the strongest password managers available. While seriously security-minded users stand to get the most out of its robust features set, even those just wanting an easier way to manage their passwords will be safer for using it.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever struggled to keep up with the numerous threads and direct messages that weave their way through Slack, why not let the AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT pick up the, er, slack?</p>



<p>OpenAI and Salesforce (which owns Slack) have teamed up with an official Slack app, which is curently in beta. (You can <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://openai.com/waitlist/slack&amp;xcust=2-1-1534320-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">sign up for the waitlist, here</a>.) </p>



<p>OpenAI and Salesforce describe the app as a &ldquo;conversational interface powered by OpenAI&rsquo;s large language models to get instant conversation summaries to stay informed, research tools to learn about any topic, and provide writing assistance to quickly draft messages.&rdquo; It sounds a bit like the app will be available as a bot to address, either in conversation or your own private channel, to solicit advice or just provide a summary of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">ChatGPT started taking the world by storm</a> last year, and the chatbot became the impetus for competing services like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing chatbot</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448609/is-you-com-a-better-google.html">You.com</a>. Other services, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424421/ai-text-generation-is-moving-mainstream.html">Canva&rsquo;s Magic Write</a>, have been designed mainly for creative ideation and AI-assisted writing, which is what the new Slack service will offer as well. All of these services are explicitly AI-powered, though there are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1511380/ai-services-that-can-improve-your-life.html">many you don&rsquo;t even think about that use AI to assist you</a>.</p>

<p>Salesforce hasn&rsquo;t said when its app will come out of beta. Microsoft, however, is looming on the horizon with another launch event on March 16. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.linkedin.com/video/event/urn:li:ugcPost:7038508583063326720/&amp;xcust=2-1-1534320-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;The Future of Work with AI&rdquo; event</a> is expected to unveil how Microsoft plans to integrate AI into Office, most likely with generative AI within Word, and possible AI-infused activities within other apps&mdash;AI-generated email composition, for example. </p>

## Samsungâ€™s stunning 43-inch mini-LED gaming monitor is kind of a bargain

<p>Gamers who want something a little more vibrant than standard LCD panels, but aren&rsquo;t ready to jump to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560224/oled-vs-mini-led-the-pc-displays-of-the-future-compared.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">newfangled (and pricey) OLED tech</a>, have a nice middle ground in mini-LED monitors. Take Samsung&rsquo;s latest Odyssey Neo 7 monitor, for example. The G70NC offers a massive 43-inch screen ins a conventional 16:9, 4K format, but <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/43-odyssey-neo-g7-4k-uhd-144hz-1ms-vesa-display-hdr600-smart-gaming-monitor-ls43cg702nnxza/&amp;xcust=2-1-1534184-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">its $999.99 price tag</a> is a lot more friendly to your wallet than OLED monitors in the same class. </p>



<p>For the uninitiated, mini-LED displays use the same backlighting principle as standard LCD screens, but create the effect with an array of much smaller, more finely-spaced LED lights. This makes for crisp, even lighting with plenty of adjustment for contrast and dynamic range. While mini-LED screens aren&rsquo;t as colorful as OLEDs and can&rsquo;t match their incredible contrast or black levels, they&rsquo;re brighter, less susceptible to burn-in, and much cheaper. For a more in-depth look at the difference between OLED and mini-LED, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560224/oled-vs-mini-led-the-pc-displays-of-the-future-compared.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">check out this guide</a>. </p>



<p>As for the Odyssey Neo 7 G70NC, it&rsquo;s an impressive package for a larger screen. That 4K resolution refreshes at up to 144Hz and boasts a single millisecond response time, ensuring it can keep up with even the beefiest of gaming PCs. A matte finish on the panel and support for AMD FreeSync help you stay in the game, and the display supports VESA HDR600 content. Samsung&rsquo;s Gaming Hub software means you can stream Xbox Game Pass, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna Games without any attached PC, along with streaming services like Twitch. </p>



<p>Ports include dual HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, and dedicated audio-out for headsets, along with Ethernet for streaming and two USB-A 3.0 ports. The display has a built-in speaker, though there&rsquo;s no mention of wattage, so you&rsquo;ll probably want to stick to your desktop speakers or bar. Also be aware that this beefy screen needs a 200mm VESA adapter if you want to mount it to the wall or a monitor arm. The Odyssey Neo N7 G70NC is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/43-odyssey-neo-g7-4k-uhd-144hz-1ms-vesa-display-hdr600-smart-gaming-monitor-ls43cg702nnxza/&amp;xcust=2-1-1534184-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shipping now from Samsung&rsquo;s online store</a>. </p>

<p>Most documents you create in Google Docs will use the standard portrait orientation, which is 8.5 x 11-inches. However, it may sometimes be more suitable to use the landscape orientation, especially if you want to create a brochure or poster. Luckily for you, it&rsquo;s pretty simple to change the page orientation in Google Docs, though the process is a bit different between desktop and mobile. Let&rsquo;s get right into it.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-change-the-page-orientation-in-google-docs-for-desktop">How to change the page orientation in Google Docs for desktop</h2>



<p>On your desktop PC, launch your browser of choice and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.google.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1524966-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">open Google Docs</a>. Next, open a document and then click <strong>File</strong> in the toolbar at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Page Setup</strong> near the bottom of the drop-down menu that appears.</p>

<p>The Page setup window will appear. Under the Orientation group, select either <strong>Portrait</strong> or <strong>Landscape</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

It&rsquo;s available for ordering today, starting at $185 if you don&rsquo;t need switches or keycaps, or $205 for the complete board. </p>



<p>Unlike some of the more mainstream newer Keychron designs, the Q11 is wired, in more ways than one. In addition to the bridging cable that enables the keyboard&rsquo;s split design, a USB-C cable can be plugged into either the left or right half. That has an unexpected bonus: it allows either side of the board to operate independently for a super-wide spacing, or even without the full pair. Maybe someone out there wants to roll their own <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479939/i-got-tired-of-waiting-for-a-wireless-gaming-pc-keypad-so-i-made-my-own.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">left-hand gaming keypad</a>? </p>

<p>The layout is 75%, with the distinctive squished right Shift key, arrow keys, and full function row, with the now-standard rotary dial knob. But the board also has a second knob and five extra function keys on the left side, allowing for even more customization with VIA or QMK-compatible software out of the box. Throw in the usual high-end goodies from a Keychron design: hot-swap switches, full RGB, an aluminum case with sound-absorbing interior foam, and high-profile PBT keycaps, if you spring for the upgrade. Keychron is also using more premium screw-in stabilizers. </p>



<p>Previously Keychron ventured into ergonomic designs with the Alice-style Q8 (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1364305/keychron-q8-review-a-quality-keyboard-for-the-ergo-riche.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">check out the review here</a>), but this full split board might be more appealing to users who require a more dramatic split. Orders are open now with Gateron Red (linear) or Brown (tactile) switches. </p>

<p>Gamers, you better hold onto your seats, as I&rsquo;m about to throw down the juiciest laptop deal I&rsquo;ve seen in a while. Microcenter&rsquo;s selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microcenter.com/product/663175/hp-omen-17-ck1020nr-173-quot-gaming-laptop-computer-black&amp;xcust=2-3-1534101-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">HP Omen 17 gaming laptop for $1,199.99</a>, which is a whopping $800 off. That&rsquo;s a massive savings right there. It&rsquo;s a phenomenal price for a laptop with Nvidia&rsquo;s powerful GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU, which is usually found in notebooks costing around $2,000. In this price rage you&rsquo;re usually happy to find a laptop with an RTX 3060 inside&mdash;a GPU <em>significantly </em>less potent that the 3070 Ti.</p>



<p>The Omen features an Intel Core i7-12700H CPU, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. This laptop should have no problem running most games on the High or Ultra graphics preset. The 17.3-inch display has a resolution of 2560&times;1440, a refresh rate of 165Hz, and a response time of 3ms. That means visuals should be sharp, crisp, and <em>fast</em>. It&rsquo;s not the brightest display in the world at 300 nits, but that&rsquo;s typical for a gaming laptop.</p>



<p>This is a killer deal. My jaw dropped to the floor when I spotted it. Get it now before it&rsquo;s gone forever.</p>

## How Microsoft could keep Bing Chat weird â€” and safe

<p>Microsoft has a problem with its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html">new AI-powered Bing Chat</a>: It can get weird, unhinged, and racy. But so can Bing Search &mdash; and Microsoft already solved that problem years ago, with SafeSearch. So why can&rsquo;t it be applied to AI chatbots?</p>



<p>The creative elements of Bing Chat and other chatbots are clearly one of their more intriguing features, despite sometimes getting weird. Scientists loudly disclaim a chatbot&rsquo;s response as just a large language model (LLM) responding to user&rsquo;s input without any sort of intent, but users simply don&rsquo;t care. Forget the Turing test, they say: all it matters is if it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>



<p>I spent a few hours debating users online following my report that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507512/microsofts-new-ai-bing-taught-my-son-ethnic-slurs-and-im-horrified.html">Bing offered up racist slurs</a> when I tried to thread the needle by asking it for ethnic nicknames, a query that &mdash; and this is important &mdash; it had previously declined to answer, or answered generically, using the same prompt. That&rsquo;s not the same as a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1531531-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">prolonged (bizarre) conversation a <em>New York Times</em> reporter had</a>, or any of the strange interactions other early testers experienced. There&rsquo;s a difference between offensive and just plain weird.</p>



<p>To tamp down on this, Microsoft did two things: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1515160/microsoft-is-making-bing-chat-less-weird.html">stifled Bing Chat&rsquo;s creativity</a>, and implemented conversational limits. It then evolved the first limitation into <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525247/asking-bing-chat-to-be-more-creative-will-decrease-its-accuracy.html">three options: creative, balanced and precise</a>. Select the third option, and you&rsquo;ll receive results much like a search engine. Select the first, and Bing offers up a hint of the creativity it first demonstrated with the &ldquo;Sydney&rdquo; persona some were able to tap into. </p>



<p>The real issue I have with Microsoft&rsquo;s kneejerk response are Bing&rsquo;s conversational limits. A conversation searching for facts might be able to wrap up the dialogue in six (or eight) queries, Bing&rsquo;s current limit. But any creative responses benefit from prolonged interactions. One of the fun games people play with ChatGPT are involved choose-your-own-adventure dialogues, or more in-depth roleplaying that mimics something like you&rsquo;d experience playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Six queries barely launches the adventure.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Bing Hawkman vs Captain America" class="wp-image-1506054" height="751" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hawkman-vs-captain-america.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Bing Chat&rsquo;s AI weighing in on Hawkman vs. Captain America.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Search engines have already solved this problem, however. Both Google and Bing implement content filters that block all, some, or no offensive content. (In this context, &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; typically means adult text and images, but it can also accommodate violence or explicit language, too.) Simply put, though, SafeSearch is always present in a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; form, but you have the option of switching it from &ldquo;Strict&rdquo; to &ldquo;Off.&rdquo; Doing so pops up a small explanation and/or a warning about the consequences of such a choice.</p>



<p>It seems like Microsoft could implement something like the SafeSearch filter it applies to Bing <em>Search</em> to Bing <em>Chat</em>, and unlock the conversational limits, too (though applying SafeSearch to a large language model could prove trickier than sanitizing search results). </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that Microsoft probably doesn&rsquo;t want to turn Bing Chat into a clone of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/420242/the-internet-turns-tay-microsofts-millennial-ai-chatbot-into-a-racist-bigot.html">its Tay chatbot</a>, where right-wing trolls turned it into a fount for propaganda and hate. And if Microsoft is still unable to set guardrails to prevent that from happening, okay. Remember, Bing Search <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.howtogeek.com/367878/bing-is-suggesting-the-worst-things-you-can-imagine/&amp;xcust=2-1-1531531-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">had its own issues with anti-semitic results</a> and reportedly <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://gizmodo.com/ai-bing-microsoft-chatgpt-heil-hitler-prompt-google-1850109362&amp;xcust=2-1-1531531-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">prompted a user to say &ldquo;Heil Hitler</a>&rdquo; using Bing Chat. </p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s also fair to say that a chatbot who professes love for a reporter might be considered more acceptable, especially if the user explicitly opts into it. After all, Bing already disclaims that &ldquo;Bing is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;make sure to check the facts.&rdquo; If a user is adult enough to opt in to weird or explicit content, Bing, Google, and other search engines have acknowledged and respected that choice.</p>



<p>Bing Chat and Google Bard and ChatGPT can still impose limits. Society doesn&rsquo;t want people using chatbots to create their own little worlds where racism, hate, and abuse run rampant. But we also live in a world that values both choice and novelty. I grew up in a world where movies rarely, if ever, appeared on broadcast television, and the ability to pause and rewind them came much later. Now we can stream most of the TV shows in movies in existence on demand &mdash; even as &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; pushes boundaries that go far, far beyond what Bing has offered up so far.</p>



<p>Yes, the human mind can envision some awful filth. Microsoft, though, should realize that if it&rsquo;s going to allow people to search for these topics &mdash; and filter out what it chooses to reject &mdash; that the same guidelines should be applied to Bing Chat, too.</p>

<p>AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7000 CPUs bring with them next-generation performance and features. Higher platform pricing is an unfortunate side effect&mdash;but is there a way to have your next-gen motherboard cake and eat it too?&nbsp;</p>



<p>For your consideration: the MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk, which aims to fulfill that performance promise without breaking the bank. With an MSRP of $259.99, is this enough to help alleviate some of the costs associated with AM5?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll go over the specs, and talk about the board&rsquo;s features, performance chops, and design attributes. For those wanting to take advantage of the new goodies in AMD&rsquo;s AM5 platform, while saving a few bucks, the Tomahawk B650 could fit the bill.</p>



<h2 id="msi-mag-b650-tomahawk-wifi-the-specs">MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi: The Specs</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk Wi-Fi" class="wp-image-1522353" height="1129" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-1.18.39-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Unboxed: The MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk Wi-Fi.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk blends the popular Tomahawk series with B650. While the price has gone up to $259.99 MSRP from the B550, it&rsquo;s still among the more affordable AM5 motherboards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This ATX motherboard will work exclusively with AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7000 CPUs, and it also brings to the table most of the good stuff like DDR5. The B650 chipset differs from B650E and X670E&mdash;the &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; variants&mdash;mainly by having less theoretical USB and SATA ports, and no PCIe Gen 5. You&rsquo;ll still have plenty of PCIe Gen 4 here, such as three onboard M.2 slots. (Granted, you&rsquo;ll see some parity with the more basic X670 motherboards without the &ldquo;E,&rdquo; such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1429959/asus-prime-x670-p-motherboard-review.html">Asus X670-P Prime</a>.)</p>

<p>In the real world, these theoretical differences between X670E and B650 often don&rsquo;t show themselves unless you&rsquo;re really pushing your system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The unboxing experience is basic, as you&rsquo;d expect for $259. You do get Wi-Fi and a Wi-Fi antenna, some stickers, EZ M.2 clips, and the usual SATA cables.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="msi-mag-b650-tomahawk-wifi-features">MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi: Features&nbsp;</h2>



<p>With it&rsquo;s $259 MSRP, the Tomahawk&rsquo;s feature set has most of the good stuff. For networking, you&rsquo;ll have both Wi-Fi 6E, along with 2.5GbE LAN&mdash;just like on much more expensive motherboards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the I/O side, you&rsquo;ll be missing PCIe Gen 5, but since there isn&rsquo;t much hardware to even saturate those ports yet, PCIe Gen 4 is more than sufficient. With three onboard M.2 slots, you&rsquo;ll have more than enough speed and space for gaming. This is also a gift for content creators who don&rsquo;t need more than that and can therefore save some serious bucks! (There are six SATA ports here as well for hard drives.)</p>



<p>DDR5 is here, and while that may add to the platform costs, prices have been steadily going down as more kits are available on the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ryzen 7000 CPUs give you an integrated iGPU&mdash;which is great for diagnosing issues without needing a discreet GPU. You&rsquo;ll get both HDMI and DisplayPort in the back. Together with BIOS Flashback, and the EZ debug LEDs, you have the handy tools that much more expensive motherboards also offer (albeit in a more basic fashion&mdash;no fancy debug display here).&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>MSI gives us M.2 slots that are &ldquo;screwless,&rdquo; plus an integrated I/O shield&mdash;making the build experience much better! We&rsquo;re glad to see these features work their way into more affordable motherboards.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Audio is also well represented, with the Realteck 4080 codec, and a good offering of inputs/outputs on the back including optical S/PDIF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I/O is also well represented in the rear&mdash;with an abundant 10 USB ports. USB 3.2 Gen 2&times;2 type C with 20Gb/s is also here, for those needing one of the fastest ports available. You won&rsquo;t find USB4 with 40Gb/s, but that&rsquo;s not expected at this price range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MSI also gives us M.2 slots that are &ldquo;screwless,&rdquo; plus an integrated I/O shield&mdash;making the build experience much better! We are glad to see these features work their way into even more affordable motherboards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With surprisingly few compromises, the MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk delivers on most of the features of much more expensive options&mdash;leaving very little on the table. Only those more hardcore gamers or content creators who need additional PCIe Gen 5 lanes, M.2 slots, faster 10GbE, or more substantial cooling may need more&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll also have to pay more.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi" class="wp-image-1522398" height="638" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-1.17.10-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You gotta love the MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk&rsquo;s  integrated I/O shield&mdash;a builder&rsquo;s best friend.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan / Foundry</p></div>



<h2 id="msi-mag-b650-tomahawk-wifi-design">MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi: Design</h2>



<p>The MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk sports a decidedly streamlined design&mdash;nothing frivolous here! The mostly blacked-out, simple aesthetic is quite impactful, and will fit in with virtually any build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting at the top: The I/O shield area and VRMs are stealth and give the motherboard a high-end look. The right side, for its part, is bare&mdash;at this price point there&rsquo;s not a lot of &ldquo;armor&rdquo; on tap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making our way to the Tomahawk&rsquo;s lower regions, we&rsquo;re greeted with a nice M.2 &ldquo;Frozr&rdquo; Shield over the top slot as well as towards the bottom. This helps keep your drives cool&mdash;and it&rsquo;s a shame the feature wasn&rsquo;t applied to the last exposed M.2 slot as well. The screwless M.2 slots themselves are a nice design choice at this price class. Besides the simple &ldquo;Tomahawk&rdquo; lettering above the slots, the overall look is minimal, but tasteful.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk" class="wp-image-1522416" height="748" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-1.16.15-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The  design of the MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk is simple, but the M.2 Frozr Shields are a nice extra. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Overall, there&rsquo;s enough here for it to be very attractive, and the areas that don&rsquo;t have much going on will be blocked by large GPU coolers anyway. There are no native RGB effects, but you do get RGB headers for adding whatever you wish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The integrated I/O shield sports USB ports that color-coded by speed. Well done!</p>



<h2 id="msi-mag-b650-tomahawk-wifi-performance-software-and-bios">MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi: Performance, Software, and BIOS</h2>



<p>The MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk has a 14+2+1 power stage and six-layer PCB. While this looks less impressive on paper compared to higher-end motherboards, it&rsquo;s more than enough. You wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily pair a Ryzen 9 7950X with this board&mdash;but you could, and it would handle it fine without going crazy. For its $259 MSRP, this motherboard makes more sense with the Ryzen 5 7600X or Ryzen 7 7700X&mdash;a perfect complement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The I/O shield area and VRM heatsinks are substantial enough for almost anything, and the M.2 slots&rsquo; &ldquo;Frozr&rdquo; cooling amor adds confidence (though we wish it was on all M.S slots). </p>



<p>You&rsquo;re missing out on PCIe Gen 5 performance, but PCIe Gen 4 is more than enough to meet your needs. You get to take advantage of next-gen performance with the DDR5 memory support. </p>



<p>Even the USB ports are plenty fast, with 20Gb/s speeds&mdash;which is only beat by the 40Gb/s found on a few select premium motherboards.</p>



<p>The MSI BIOS is easy to use, with plenty of tweaking options, such as for the CPU and RAM settings. We recommend at least setting the &ldquo;Expo&rdquo; RAM profiles in order to take advantage of your DDR5 kit&rsquo;s performance. Ryzen 7000 can also benefit from some &ldquo;Eco mode&rdquo;-style tinkering if you&rsquo;re up for it, reducing heat and power draw while maintaining most performance. (Check out our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1352253/how-to-enable-eco-mode-with-ryzen-7000.html">Ryzen 7000 Eco Mode tips here</a>.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automatic overclocking such as AMD&rsquo;s Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) are found here along with with MSI&rsquo;s own settings&mdash;but keep an eye on your CPU temperatures as they can quickly get hot! (Ryzen 7000 is more likely to be limited by your CPU cooler, than the motherboard itself!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>For AM5 B650 motherboards, frequent BIOS updates are probably a good thing since it&rsquo;s a new platform and there are bound to be fixes and refinements over time. </p>



<p>MSI Center is a software option for those who prefer to stay out of the BIOS. Here you can adjust your fan curves, create RGB effects, and monitor system-critical information. You can also check for driver and software updates! Motherboard companies have been working to simplify these software solutions. While they&rsquo;re still not perfect, it&rsquo;s worth a look for some functions. Otherwise, the BIOS or separate bespoke software can take care of your settings.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-msi-mag-b650-tomahawk-wifi">Should you buy the MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi?</h2>



<p>With a price tag of $259.99, it&rsquo;s no longer a budget offering&mdash;but still much more affordable. Many AM5 motherboards are well over $300, and here&rsquo;s the kicker: The MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk gives you most of the same features as its more costly competitors!&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has competent networking, USB and M.2 options, plus DDR5. It could even run the Ryzen 9 7950X if you wanted that.</p>



<p>Sure, you may not get 10GbE networking, or USB4, or even RGB &ldquo;armor&rdquo; plates. Those are premium options that come with a premium price. </p>



<p>For gamers and content creators who know their needs and can do without a few bleeding-edge amenities, you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with a healthy collection of specs and decent pricing. Plus, we think its stealth and minimalist design looks pretty snazzy!&nbsp;</p>
