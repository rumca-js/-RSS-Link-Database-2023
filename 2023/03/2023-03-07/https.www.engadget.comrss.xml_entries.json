The original policy, first introduced in November, would flag any video that used rude language in the first several seconds as ineligible for advertising, with little delineation between &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; swearing.

On Tuesday, Sohn said she recently asked President Biden to appoint someone else to the FCC. The Biden administration originally announced Sohn's nomination in October 2021, only for her to go on to face intense resistance from Republicans and moderate Democrats like Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.&nbsp;</p><p>Sohn's failure to win her confirmation is a major setback for the Biden administration and its bid to reshape US internet policy after a wave of deregulation under former President Donald Trump. The regulator has been mired in a two-to-two deadlock since the departure of former <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ajit-pai-stepping-down-fcc-chairman-replacement-what-happens-now-153024203.html\">Chairman Ajit Pai</a>, preventing current Chair Jessica Rosenworcel from moving forward on a host of policy issues, including the restoration of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-01-net-neutrality-faq-title-i-title-ii-2017.html\">Obama-era net neutrality protections</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;Unfortunately, the American people are the real losers here,&quot; Sohn said in a statement. &quot;The FCC deadlock, now over two years long, will remain so for a long time. As someone who has advocated for my entire career for affordable, accessible broadband for every American, it is ironic that the 2-2 FCC will remain sidelined at the most consequential opportunity for broadband in our lifetimes.&quot;</p><p>During her confirmation hearings, Republicans cast Sohn as an extreme partisan. She also faced resistance from industry players, including organizations like the <a href=\"https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DGA-Letter-2.1.2022.pdf\">Directors Guild of America</a>. Conservative groups spent large sums of money campaigning against her confirmation. One organization, the Center for a Free Economy, spent $200,000 on Facebook ads opposing the nomination. Sohn pointed to those campaigns in explaining her decision.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;When I accepted his nomination over sixteen months ago, I could not have imagined that legions of cable and media industry lobbyists, their bought-and-paid-for surrogates, and dark money political groups with bottomless pockets would distort my over 30-year history as a consumer advocate into an absurd caricature of blatant lies,&quot; she said.</p><p>It's possible Democrats could have advanced Sohn to the FCC despite opposition, but the likelihood of that happening significantly diminished after Senator Joe Manchin came out against her nomination. \u201cEspecially now, the FCC must remain above the toxic partisanship that Americans are sick and tired of, and Ms. Sohn has clearly shown she is not the person to do that,\u201d he said in a recent statement.

A House vote is expected later in March. That measure is more targeted and meant to prevent Americans' data from falling into the hands of the Chinese government. In December, a section of an omnibus spending bill <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-us-government-ban-devices-omnibus-bill-funding-nasa-234803320.html\">banned TikTok on federal government devices</a> following similar restrictions in multiple states.</p><p>In all cases, the concern remains the same. Critics are concerned the Chinese government might use TikTok to collect data on Americans and spread propaganda. TikTok has repeatedly denied cooperation with Chinese officials, and has tried to assuage fears by moving data and traffic to US-based servers. Oracle, which runs the US servers, has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oracle-tiktok-algorithms-content-moderation-review-171742979.html/\">reviewing TikTok's algorithms</a> and moderation systems.</p><p>There's no certainty the Senate will pass its bill and reconcile it with a House equivalent. The Commerce Secretary also isn't guaranteed to exercise the power if granted. However, the introduction of the bill adds pressure to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew as he <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-ceo-congress-shou-zi-chew-privacy-security-china-201928160.html\">testifies before the House</a> on March 23rd.

We've asked Apple for comment. For now, though, this gives Sonos an edge over competitors that might not offer Atmos music at any price point. Whether or not it fares well against Apple's own hardware is another matter. If you're looking for spatial audio support at the lowest price possible, the $299 HomePod is decidedly more affordable than the $450 Era 300.

We wouldn't be surprised if the EPA-estimated figure is more conservative, but that still hints a longer range than the 258 miles of the current model. You now get battery preconditioning to improve charging times and cold weather range, and vehicle-to-load support lets you power devices both inside and outside of the car. There's also new support for &quot;i-Pedal&quot; one-pedal driving. Just don't expect the speediest charging. The Kona doesn't have the 800V architecture of the Ioniq 5 or Kia EV6, so it will take 41 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 80 percent.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"5e7e6ce9c9d74e6aa879ec47aa54eb41\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Regardless of what motor system is inside your vehicle, you can expect a larger &quot;living space&quot; with more storage (17 cubic feet in the trunk), a front trunk and plenty of in-cabin tech. An optional heads-up display sadly isn't available in North America, but you will find dual 12.3-inch screens, over-the-air software updates and NFC-based <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-carkey-hyundai-genesis-cars-172130052.html\">digital car key</a> support. The driver aids are also supposedly more powerful than in other mini-SUVs in this class, such as an attention monitor (to make sure you don't doze off), a blind spot monitor and assistants for forward collision avoidance and safer highway driving.</p><p>Hyundai hasn't detailed US pricing, although it says the Kona will still be available in combustion-only and hybrid versions in addition to the EV. It should reach US customers in the third quarter of the year. If history is any indication, the Kona should cost less than the Ioniq 5. That could make it appealing if you want to go electric but can't justify the premium for the brand's most advanced offerings.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-revamped-kona-ev-offers-more-room-and-a-longer-range-151216854.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-revamped-kona-ev-offers-more-room-and-a-longer-range-151216854.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-07 15:12:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sonos is betting big on spatial audio with the $450 Era 300 speaker", "description": "<p>For the last few years <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL2hvbWUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY3ZTJiMmI2LTBlNzAtNDk2Ni1hNTI2LWE1ZGNlYjVkM2MzZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUBpz6hfTRZNzx4kCH9z0Q19-aOMxpwdPVD4PI9ns-_w&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fhome\">Sonos</a> has focused most of its efforts on two categories: <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-roam-review-130039811.html\">portable speakers</a>, like the Move and Roam; and home theater products like the affordable Ray and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html\">more extravagant, Atmos-capable Arc</a> soundbars. The company\u2019s main pair of music-focused speakers, the One and Five, still sound great but are getting a little long in the tooth.</p><p>That changes today with two new options: the Era 100 and Era 300. The $250 Era 100 is a totally redesigned replacement for the One with a number of improvements over its predecessor, while the $450 Era 300 is the first Sonos speaker capable of playing spatial audio. As with most Sonos speakers, you can use a pair of either of them in stereo or as rear surround speakers in a home theater setup. If you have the Sonos Arc or gen-2 Beam and Sub, adding a pair of Era 300s as your rear surrounds gives you a wild 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos experience. (If you\u2019re willing to spend roughly $2,600 for that setup, anyway).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Sonos Era 300 - home theater setup\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/6d044020-bc64-11ed-b5a7-6324e4b53c05\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sonos</div></figure><p>The Era 300 looks unlike any speaker Sonos has released before, though it still has the company\u2019s familiar clean design language. Its somewhat unusual knocked-over hourglass shape is largely functional: it allows for the upward-facing tweeter to fire at a slight but specific angle, which the company says will deliver more room-filling reflections for spatial audio. There are three more tweeters: one dead-center and forward-firing as well as two pointing left and right. Finally, a pair of woofers on either side of the speaker provide plenty of bass.</p><p>The Era 100, on the other hand, is more obviously a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-18-sonos-one-review.html\">tweak to the Sonos One</a>, itself acoustically identical to the Sonos Play:1 that was released all the way back in 2013. Put another way, an upgrade was long past due. The Era 100 features a pair of tweeters for left and right stereo channels in a single speaker, as well as a woofer that\u2019s 25 percent larger than the One\u2019s. It may not have the spatial audio capabilities of the Era 300, but it\u2019s still a significant update to its predecessor.</p><figure><img alt=\"The new Sonos Era 100 speaker.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/8577d281-bc63-11ed-8cb6-7026ced8288c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Despite the very different price points and capabilities, both of these speakers have a lot in common. Both feature USB-C ports that let you plug in a turntable or other audio equipment with an optional line-in adapter. More significantly, they both also include Bluetooth, the first time Sonos has put the feature in a non-portable speaker. They also have a redesigned set of touch controls on top \u2013 instead of taping on either side of the play / pause button to adjust volume, there\u2019s now a little ridge you can swipe your finger across as well as dedicated forward and back buttons. Sonos also included a physical switch to disconnect the microphones. This actually cuts the connection to the mic for additional security, rather than just muting it via software.</p><p>Both the Era 100 and Era 300 also can use those microphones for Trueplay tuning, which optimizes audio for where you place the speakers in your living space. Previously, Trueplay required an iOS device; its microphone was used to listen for optimizing the sound. If you used Android, you were unfortunately out of luck. But even though Sonos has been putting microphones in its speakers for years now, you couldn\u2019t use them for Trueplay. This new feature means a lot more people will likely take advantage of the feature \u2013 that\u2019s good news, because Trueplay does make a big difference.</p><figure><img alt=\"Sonos Era 100 with turntable\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/f2950f80-bc64-11ed-bb7b-ade7b513095a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sonos</div></figure><p>I got a chance to listen to both speakers in a variety of configurations at a Sonos press event last month, and they both unsurprisingly sounded great \u2013 but that was in a carefully arranged environment that Sonos had total control over. Obviously, we\u2019ll need to review these speakers to see how they perform in the real world, but I was impressed by the short demo I got. The Era 100 doesn\u2019t sound totally different from the One, but the larger woofer definitely gives it more bass presence. The two tweeters don\u2019t give it true stereo separation, since they\u2019re so close to each other, but they definitely provide more clarity in the high ranges than you hear in the One.</p><p>The Era 300, however, sounds quite a bit different. Sonos first showed us its chops playing back standard audio, and it has significantly more volume, bass and presence than the Era 100. Not a shock, considering it costs $200 more and has twice as many drivers. We then got to hear how the single speaker did at playing back spatial audio tracks. They didn\u2019t sound radically different, but did less like they were coming from a single point in a room; instead, the audio was more balanced and enveloping. Of the few songs we got to hear, \u201cA Concert Six Months From Now\u201d by Finneas was the most impressive. His multi-layered focals felt like they were coming at me from multiple angles, but it didn\u2019t feel like a gimmick \u2013 it was just a more immersive and more intimate presentation.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Sonos Era 300 speaker, with a focus on its redesigned touch control panel\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/2f442fb0-bc65-11ed-bd5e-5b1bb3c615e6\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sonos</div></figure><p>While it\u2019s easy enough to see how the Era 100 fits into the Sonos lineup, the Era 300\u2019s higher price tag and focus on spatial audio makes the speaker a big bet on an unproven market. For starters, the only spatial audio service it supports is Amazon Music Unlimited, which means the millions of people using Apple Music are out of luck. Apple has pushed spatial audio harder than just about anyone in the past few years, highlighting it both on its music streaming service and AirPod line of headphones. And with a new full-sized HomePod, Apple now has both speakers and headphones that can play back Atmos mixes. So, it might not be inclined to support competing Sonos hardware.</p><p>Regardless of the competition, Sonos clearly sees spatial audio as the future of music playback. The company said there\u2019s major interest in the format from artists and producers, and claimed that the Era 300 will be the best way to hear the details of spatial audio mixes without needing a room full of audio gear. Of course, there\u2019s only so much we can expect from a single speaker, no matter how advanced its driver array is. And while Amazon is the only service that\u2019s compatible with the Era 300 for spatial music, Spotify, YouTube Music and others will likely start offering spatial audio sooner than later \u2013 though again, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll necessarily work on Sonos hardware.</p><p>Of course, the Era 300 also is an extremely capable speaker even when playing back stereo mixes. As with the outstanding but expensive Sonos Five speaker, the Era 300 will probably be a more niche product in the company\u2019s lineup. But if the spatial audio wave is about to crest, it makes sense for Sonos to be ready for it rather than play catch-up.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sonos-is-betting-big-on-spatial-audio-with-the-450-era-300-speaker-140041530.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/sonos-is-betting-big-on-spatial-audio-with-the-450-era-300-speaker-140041530.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-07 14:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "TikTok's Series feature will allow creators to charge for 'premium' content", "description": "<p>TikTok has a <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-a-new-way-for-creators-to-share-premium-content-with-series\"><ins>new plan</ins></a> to challenge YouTube and help creators earn more on their platform.

First, the videos can be up to 20 minutes long, double the ten-minute limit for most other videos on the platform. And, unlike other TikTok content, series content will live behind a paywall, meaning the clips won\u2019t show up in the app\u2019s recommendations or be as easily shareable as typical TikTok videos. (Creators will, however, be able to link to their Series from other, non-paywalled videos.)&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Series creators have considerable flexibility in how much they charge, with one-time payment options ranging from $0.99 to $189.99 for access to video collections. In a blog post, the TikTok notes that creators are free to choose an amount \u201cthat best reflects the value of their exclusive content.\u201d</p><p>The feature could help creators earn substantially more from their videos than existing monetization features on the platform. Creators have long <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-stars-creator-fund-payouts-222006327.html\"><ins>criticized</ins></a> the company\u2019s creator fund, which they say isn\u2019t big enough to accommodate the app\u2019s growing ranks of prominent users. TikTok has apparently paid close attention to that criticism as it recently introduced a newer version of its creator fund, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-starts-rolling-out-another-creator-monetization-plan-in-the-us-182701698.html\"><ins>Creativity Program</ins></a>, meant to help creators earn more.</p><p>Interestingly, TikTok says that it\u2019s not planning on taking a cut of creators\u2019 revenue from Series, at least for now. A spokesperson for the company said that \u201cfor a limited time\u201d creators will receive \u201c100% of their earnings\u201d minus app store fees. That could potentially help TikTok make its new longform offerings more competitive with YouTube, which creators often favor for longer videos because of the increased revenue potential.</p><p>Of course, a lot will depend on how individual TikTokkers use the new paywall features, and if their fans are willing to fork over for more exclusive content. For now, only a handful of \u201cselect\u201d creators have access to Series, but the company says it will start accepting applications from more creators \u201cin the coming months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tiktoks-series-feature-will-allow-creators-to-charge-for-premium-content-140033561.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/tiktoks-series-feature-will-allow-creators-to-charge-for-premium-content-140033561.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-07 14:00:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "GM's Ultra Cruise system will debut on the Cadillac Celestiq later this year", "description": "<p>Even as it has radically expanded the hands-free driver assist capabilities of its current generation Super Cruise ADAS, General Motors has been hard at work on the system's successor, Ultra Cruise, since 2021.

Super Cruise currently works on around 400,000 miles of US and Canadian highways, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel when driving on a compatible highway or state route. It uses a mix of LiDAR, radar, GPS and cameras to know where the vehicle is on the road.</p><p>Ultra Cruise, builds off this with a new computing system, that will fuse the incoming data streams into a unified 360-degree view around the vehicle. &quot;They're not redundant, they're fused together to give us the most accurate picture of the vehicle surroundings,&quot; Dittman said. Ultra Cruise equipped vehicles will also use an interior-facing infrared driver attention monitor that will track the, &quot;driver\u2019s head position and/or eyes in relation to the road,&quot; according to Tuesday's announcement.</p><p>Ultra Cruise will work on more than 2 million miles of highway at launch. Over time, the company plans to further expand the number of roadways covered by the Ultra Cruise network to include 3.4 million miles of roadway encompassing, &quot;nearly every paved road, city street, suburban street, subdivision, and rural road in addition to the highways that today on the super cruise operates on,&quot; Dittman added.</p><p>Note that despite the larger number of roads the new system will work on, it still offers the same Level 2 driver assist capabilities as the rest of the auto industry,<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-first-certified-level-3-autonomy-car-company-us-201021118.html\"> save Mercedes</a>. That means, you will have to keep paying attention to the road you just won't have to keep your hands strictly on the wheel.</p><p>Unfortunately, current Super Cruise subscribers will not be able to upgrade to the new system once it arrives later this year. Ultra Cruise requires additional sensors and hardware to operate and GM doesn't currently have plans to offer a retrofit kit.

I\u2019m a fan of portable, distraction-reducing writing machines, and when my brain gets too cluttered, I go stand by my window with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-09-apple-ipad-keyboard-folio-irl.html\">keyboard-equipped iPad</a> in front of me. reMarkable\u2019s community has already found ways to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/j9g1d5/rm2_with_an_external_keyboard_accessory_port_usage/\">jerry-rig a keyboard</a> to the machine, but I\u2019d much prefer to get a finished package than something knocked together on the fly.</p><p>So I was excited to learn that the company is now launching its own keyboard, stand and cover accessory in the form of the <a href=\"https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/type-folio\">Type Folio</a>. It\u2019s the company\u2019s take on the cover-stand-keyboard unit offered for pretty much every other tablet on the market. But it\u2019s also blessed with its own quirks, designed to ensure that it won\u2019t ruin the skinny silhouette of the existing hardware.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>For the uninitiated, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-tablet-e-ink-hands-on-review-marker-writing-note-taking-130044070.html\">reMarkable 2</a> is an e-paper tablet promising paper-like responsiveness, letting you read, amend and write documents with a stylus. Its low weight, long battery life and the stripped-down nature of its offering has earned it plenty of plaudits from its hardcore fans. But while it makes many of its (intentional) limitations into virtues, it is still quite niche. As my beloved former colleague Chris Velazco said two years ago, \u201cThis is a device for people who care about writing and reading to the exclusion of just about everything else.\u201d</p><p>To get started with Type Folio, you just slide reMarkable 2 into it, connecting to a small chin on the slate\u2019s left hand side/bottom. Unfold the case and the stand will hold it upright to expose the keys underneath, and once it\u2019s clicked in, the tablet reorientates itself to landscape mode. Flip the tablet back down to cover the keys, and it\u2019ll jump back into portrait mode, in a way that feels natural, and seamless.</p><p>reMarkable opted to make the letter keys full size, sat over rubber dome switches with 1.3mm of travel. The number and other keys are compressed to fill space left over, but while I expected to need some adjustment time, it all came together fairly instantly. I was also delighted that the arrow keys (vital when moving the cursor around) were left in space to help your fingers find them.</p><p>In fact, I think I probably made just two more errors writing the first draft of this piece on the slate than I would on my regular keyboard. The lack of autocorrect and spell check could be an issue if you enjoy, or need, the assistance offered by most normal systems these days. If you use this for nothing more than first and second drafts, before finishing things on a different screen, then I can\u2019t imagine it being an issue.</p><p>And for people who need something a little more limited to help keep their minds focused, this is a delight. I could well imagine myself taking this, rather than my iPad, over to the window when I need to avoid the numerous temptations of the internet. I especially liked the ability to make live notes with the stylus when proofing the draft while sat eating lunch, too. It\u2019s as close to being able to print out and amend your work as I\u2019m likely to get until I finally give in and buy a printer again.</p><p>Type Folio comes in two faux-leather finishes, the Sepia Brown I tried and an Ink Black. It\u2019s slim and light enough that it doesn\u2019t feel like too much bulk has been added to the already pretty slender tablet. Given that you\u2019re now able to do a lot more with it than you could before, it feels like there\u2019s been very little trade off or sacrifice made here.</p><p>If there\u2019s one place I feel compelled to take points off, it\u2019s in the price, which fails the \u201cwould I spend my own money to buy this\u201d test. The slate itself is $299, and only really works if you buy a stylus priced at either $79, or $129 if you opt for the built-in \u201ceraser.\u201d So it\u2019s hard to swallow when the keyboard folio is <a href=\"https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/type-folio\">$199</a>, a full two-thirds of the price of the main hardware itself, as much as I think it\u2019s a beautiful and well-engineered piece of gear. I do imagine that, for most would-be reMarkable buyers, price is less of a consideration than it is for other gadgets. But, in aggregate, the sticker gets close to the point where you start asking questions about how much you\u2019d need this over, say, a 9th generation iPad and its own stylus and keyboard folio. By comparison, reMarkable remains a product that you\u2019ll need to fall in love with before you start forking over that much cash, but mercifully, it\u2019s also very easy to fall in love with.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-type-folio-keyboard-hands-on-130057978.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-type-folio-keyboard-hands-on-130057978.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-07 13:00:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google begins rolling out its new look for Docs and other Workspace apps", "description": "<p>Your Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and Drive might look quite different in the coming days.

You can hustle if you need a ride quickly, or take your time collecting your bags.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uber-reserve-133038929.html\">Uber Reserve</a> will also be more useful for scheduling your ground travel. The company now allows booking rides up to 90 days in advance instead of 30, making it easier to plan every step of your vacation. Reserve will also be available in many more North American cities (over 7,300), and New York City customers can book UberX, XL and Comfort rides in addition to Black and Black SUV. A Business Comfort tier, meanwhile, will provide a \"unique\" experience for work travellers.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The pickup directions are available at just over 30 airports around the world, including the NYC area's big three (JFK, LaGuardia and Newark) as well as hubs like Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta. More are due in the months ahead, Uber says. Walking ETAs will \"soon\" be available in over 400 airports. The Business Comfort option will be available sometime in the near future.</p><p>The motivation behind the upgrades is clear. Airport rides play a major role in Uber's business, and it's competing with Lyft, taxis and even car rental agencies.
