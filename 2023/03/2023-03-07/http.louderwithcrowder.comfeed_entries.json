But I digress. </p><p>The child in question is named Kirin, and their father appeared on a news network to explain how this all happened. He showed the news reporter photos of his child when they were younger, explaining, <em>\"Basically, at about 24 months, here's where she started grabbing the tutus and the dresses.\" </em></p><p>By 3.5 years old, the child had transitioned to a girl. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cThis father transitioned his son into a girl at 3 years old\\n\\n\\u201cMy daughter will never go through male puberty\\u201d\\u201d</div> \u2014 End Wokeness (@End Wokeness)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EndWokeness/status/1632863836603662337\">1678140050</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kirin, a third-grader at the time of the interview, is also apparently an athlete and competes on the girl's teams at school. The reporter asked the father about people who would say, <em>\"people who were born a boy and are living life as a girl are biologically different, so it places them at an unfair advantage.\"</em> (For the record, I am \"people.\" As are many of you, I'm guessing.)</p><p>Here's where it gets very grotesque. The father explained how his child will never go through male puberty. Like it's a <em>good</em> thing. \"<em>My kid's mental health is more important than your kid's trophy.\" </em></p><p>If that were truly the case - if the child's mental health was the father's main concern - he wouldn't have transitioned the child at <em>three years old.</em> For liking dresses. When I was little, I played a lot of sports and video games. But I was by no means a BOY. Children, especially at a young age, sometimes just like things that are typically associated with the opposite gender. It doesn't mean they <em>are</em> the opposite gender. They're just kids. And parents should know that, instead of setting them on an irreversible and incredibly damaging path that they cannot truly consent to. To do so is absolutely, 100% evil. </p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-child-indiana-kirin", "date_published": "2023-03-07 21:34:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "WATCH: Chuck Schumer Wants To Ban Tucker Carlson From Showing More Jan 6th Footage, For 'Democracy'", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33227384&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=130%2C0%2C70%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>Last night, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-january\" target=\"_blank\">Tucker Carlson released never-before-seen January 6th footage</a>. These videos proceeded to totally blow up the whole \"insurrection\" narrative. And now, the Dems are scaaaared. Especially our pal Chuck Schumer. <br /></p><p>Schumer took to the Senate floor today just to condemn Tucker Carlson and demand Rupert Murdoch prevent him from releasing any more tapes: <em>\"Rupert Murdoch has a special obligation to stop Tucker Carlson from going on tonight [and] from letting him go on again and again and again [because] our democracy depends on it.\"</em></p><p>He also said Carlson has <em>\"perverted and </em><em>slimed the truth.\"  </em>By playing footage.

And subsequently preventing any evidence to the contrary of said narrative from ever seeing the light of day. That's what the founders had in mind...right?</p><p>In case you missed it, the footage played by Tucker Carlson showed Officer Brian Sicknick walking around, perfectly healthy, after the time he was supposedly fatally clobbered by violent insurrectionists. Fatal clobberings typically yield different results. Perhaps Liz Cheney missed that part of biology class. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c\\ud83d\\udea8BREAKING: Never before seen January 6 footage shows Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick walking around the building after the time media outlets claimed he was killed by protesters.\\n\\nThe J6 Committee had access to this tape but refused to release it.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Greg Price (@Greg Price)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1632915940399624199\">1678152472</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another video showed a certain conspiracy-minded Shaman being escorted around the Capitol by police.

And the<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/undercover-police-january-6th\" target=\"_blank\"> police themselves felt they had been \"set up\" to fail that day. </a></p><p>I think we all know what this means.

Democrats love actors when they are out there repeating the talking points that were sent to their PR team. When it comes to political power and what will amount to a lifelong congressional seat, Democrats are the dirtiest players in the game. Just saying, older brother Fred was yeeted off of the <em>Wonder Years</em> reboot due to<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/fred-savage-misconduct-the-wonder-years-1235194998/\" target=\"_blank\"> \"misconduct toward several women on the production.\"</a> Not to mention he allegedly got handsy with the actress who played his mother during the original series.

Look at George Santos. Plus if Savage runs, I'm sure Danielle Fishel would hit the campaign trail with him.

And yes, speaking in generalities, kids who come from two-parent homes do better in school, are more well-adjusted and have more discipline than those who don't.</p><p>If you grew up with only one parent, neither Deion nor Shaq is talking to you personally. Though more importantly, they also don't care if your feelings are hurt.
