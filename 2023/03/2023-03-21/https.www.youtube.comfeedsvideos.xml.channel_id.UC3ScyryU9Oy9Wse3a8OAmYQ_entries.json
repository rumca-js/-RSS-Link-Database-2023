FRONTLINE and ProPublica investigated the relationship between the iconic tire company Firestone and the infamous Liberian warlord Charles Taylor. (Aired 2014)\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.

Christian Miller of ProPublica and Jonathan Jones to bring this story to light. Their investigation uncovered how, in exchange for being able to operate, Firestone made a deal with Taylor and, in Taylor\u2019s own words, served as \u201cat that particular time our most significant principal source of foreign exchange\u201d \u2014 and how Taylor turned the Firestone plantation into a rebel base that he used to wage war.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bDo I think they have blood on their hands? Yes. I believe they facilitated a warlord in his insurrection and in the atrocities that he created,\u201d Gerald S. Rose, Dpty. Chief of Mission, Liberia, 1991-93, told FRONTLINE and ProPublica in the 2014 documentary.\n\nFirestone said it was powerless to prevent Taylor from occupying the plantation and that at no time did the company have a collaborative relationship with him. \u201cFirestone\u2019s decision to remain in Liberia was very costly for the company. Firestone was able to preserve an important economic asset for Liberia, and we are proud of that,\u201d Firestone and its parent company, Bridgestone, told FRONTLINE and ProPublica at the time.\n\n\u201cFirestone and the Warlord\u201d raised provocative questions about corporate responsibility, accountability, and the ethical ramifications of doing business in conflict zones.\n\nExplore additional reporting on \"Firestone and the Warlord\" on our website:\nhttps://to.pbs.org/3TmkFi4\n\n\u201cFirestone and the Warlord\u201d is a FRONTLINE production with Rain Media in partnership with ProPublica.
