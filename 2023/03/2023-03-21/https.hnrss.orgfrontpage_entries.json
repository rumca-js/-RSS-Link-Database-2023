around Germany, hectically navigating public transportation, and getting lost all the time. I noticed that every station had i platforms, each used lists of n buses (trains, whatever) arriving, each has their list of m destinations. That means I would be scanning i x n x m items just to see if I was at the correct stop. As I was nervous, for every bus that arrived, I would rescan the list of stops to double check. I began thinking how I could make a better system.<p>Linked is a very shoddy mockup of how bloom filters could be used to allow passengers O(1) lookup time for which platform+bus is the correct one. I believe it's likely for public transportation to grow increasingly more complex in the future, as population grows, and under the current list-based system, this will make the signage ever more complex. I think some bloom filter mechanism could reduce that complexity.<p>So, here is my fantasy, my day dream. What do you think?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35248912\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35248912</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://github.com/jsvan/BusStopBloomfilter", "date_published": "2023-03-21 16:50:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Watermelon \u2013 GPT-powered code contextualizer", "description": "<p>Hey there HN! We're Esteban and Esteban and we are looking to get feedback for the new version of our GPT-powered, open-source code contextualizer.<p>We're starting with a VS Code extension that indexes information from git (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket integrations available), Slack and Jira to explain the context around a file or block of code. Finally, we summarize such aggregated context using the power of GPT.<p>As devs we know that it's very annoying to look at a new codebase and start understanding all the nuances, particularly when the person who wrote the code already left the company. With this problem in mind, we decided to build this solution. You'll be able to get into \"the ghost\" of the person who left the company.<p>Soon, we will also be building a GitHub Action that does the same thing as the VS Code extension but at the time of creating a PR: Index the most relevant information related to this new PR, and add it as a comment. This way we will provide context at one more moment, and also, we will be making the IDE extension better.<p>Here's our open source repo if you also want to check it out: <a href=\"https://github.com/watermelontools/watermelon-extension\">https://github.com/watermelontools/watermelon-extension</a><p>Please give us your feedback!

And I read most of the stories about the technology itself. But please, for the love of $deity, can we outlaw the completely pointless <i>\"I asked AI to create...\"</i> type submissions?<p>Every day there are dozens of them; <i>\"I asked AI to write me a haiku...\", \"I asked AI to paint me a picture...\", \"I asked AI to help me learn coding...\", \"I asked AI to write me a blog post...\", \"I asked AI to tell me a joke...\", \"I asked AI to write a poem...\", \"I asked AI to write a short story...\", \"I asked AI to design a new trouser press...\"</i> etc etc et-<i>bloody</i>-cetera.<p>And, almost without exception, these submissions are of no interest whatsoever to anyone outside of the person who typed some crap into ChatGPT [or other AI] and was so proud of the outcome they decided to share it with the wider world... whether or not the wider world could give a shit or not.<p>Yes, we all know you can type almost any kind of prompt into an AI chatbot and get some \"interesting\" text or imagery in response. But after the 1000th such submission it's about as interesting as hearing that someone sent an email or installed a new app on their phone. It really is the adult equivalent of running excitedly home from primary school, clutching the crappy drawing you did in class and insisitng it get stuck to the fridge door.<p>Please. If you want to play with your AI chatbot, just do it quietly in the corner.

Here\u2019s a demo video: <a href=\"https://frigade.com/video/demo.mp4\">https://frigade.com/video/demo.mp4</a>. Also, the \u201cFrigade demo checklist\u201d on our home page (<a href=\"https://frigade.com/#demo\">https://frigade.com/#demo</a>) was built using Frigade itself, if you want to give it a spin.<p>Onboarding is a critical first experience for software products. It makes a big difference for customer activation and retention. However, onboarding experiences often do not get the attention they deserve because, without good tooling, they\u2019re a pain to build. At a previous startup, Christian and I were surprised at how hard it was to get right. It took a ton of time that would otherwise have gone to our core product. We also knew that much better tooling was possible because we had experienced it in the internal tooling at LinkedIn, where we worked at a previous job.<p>Established software companies such as LinkedIn, Uber, Vanta, and many others invest in internal developer platforms to give their team unfair advantages, like the ability to quickly build great onboarding experiences. But these platforms only get built at scale. With Frigade, our goal is to develop the platform that every growth engineering team would love to have, but can\u2019t afford to build themselves.<p>There are no-code tools for onboarding (e.g. Pendo, Appcues, Intercom), but they\u2019re rigid and clumsy. They\u2019re built for marketers and managers rather than developers, so they sit on top of your product instead of feeling native. They\u2019re not defined in your codebase, frequently break without teams noticing, and there are limits to what you can build with them. Unlike these tools, Frigade uses native SDKs and provides an API for developers to build new onboardings in code.<p>How to use Frigade in your product: first install our SDK (React for now); choose a production-ready Frigade UI component or go headless; create a \u201cFrigade Flow\u201d in our admin panel and hook it up to the SDK (Flows are where you set the logic, targeting, content, and more); publish your flow to go live.<p>Frigade automatically tracks users\u2019 progress through your Flows. Your team can sign in to our admin panel to see which customers have completed what steps or input data, and you can use our API to sync tracking events to your analytics platform, send drip campaign (emails that guide users through setup), or show product reminders (e.g. \u201cFinish connecting your data\u201d banners). Frigade leverages server-driven UI, so once a Flow is live, you can easily update content (e.g. change copy, add another step) and logic (e.g. who should see it and when) in real-time without new code deploys.<p>We\u2019ve spent most of our time building out the platform with early customers so far, but our self-serve flow is (ironically) coming soon. In the meantime, our demo video gives you the basic picture: <a href=\"https://frigade.com/video/demo.mp4\">https://frigade.com/video/demo.mp4</a>. Please let us know if you\u2019re interested in trying Frigade, we\u2019d love to get your feedback on what we\u2019ve built so far! We work mostly with web-based B2B companies today, and our pricing is competitive with other tools on the market.<p>What has been your experience with product onboarding? We\u2019d love to hear more about examples of what\u2019s worked well and what\u2019s been a pain in the ass\u2014as well as anything else you\u2019d like to share.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35246292\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35246292</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35246292", "date_published": "2023-03-21 14:06:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Google Bard enters open beta", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://bard.google.com/\">https://bard.google.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35246260\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35246260</a></p>\n<p>Points: 33</p>\n<p># Comments: 15</p>", "link": "https://bard.google.com/", "date_published": "2023-03-21 14:04:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Google Releases Bard, Its Competitor in the Race to Create A.I.
