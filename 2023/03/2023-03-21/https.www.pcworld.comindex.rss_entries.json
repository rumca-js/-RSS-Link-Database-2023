[{"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Google Bard\u2019s AI search launch was, well, boring", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Already months behind, Google is slowly rolling out its AI-powered chatbot, Bard, today. But Google&mdash;once a powerhouse in search&mdash;looks like it&rsquo;s taking an extremely conservative approach to its new chatbot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is Bard? Google describes it as a &ldquo;complementary experience to Google Search,&rdquo; in its <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/technology/ai/try-bard/&amp;xcust=2-1-1666669-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a> Tuesday. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504572/google-announces-bard-ai.html\">Google announced the Bard chatbot</a> in February, noting that it uses a different language model, called LaMDA (or Language Model for Dialogue Applications), which it will use to power the chatbot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&rsquo;re wondering if Google is taking a mighty swing at chat-powered search? No, not right now. In fact, its blog post seems quite muted, as if it&rsquo;s simply trying to stand at the plate and not strike out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one, there&rsquo;s simply the approach: Complementing Google Search sounds rather conservative&mdash;since Google already controls roughly 90 percent of the search market, it&rsquo;s clearly not willing to swing for the fences quite yet. Bard looks like the first instances of Bing&rsquo;s AI chat: simple answers, idea generation, that sort of thing. We don&rsquo;t know, for example, how long answers can be, and whether Bard will allow for creative responses like Bing and ChatGPT generate.  It will, however, allow you to select from various &ldquo;drafts&rdquo; of the response, where you can actually see a sentence or two. Um, cool?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Google Bard drafts\" class=\"wp-image-1666694\" height=\"673\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Google-Bard-drafts.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Right now, Google Bard&rsquo;s differentiating feature appears to be a &ldquo;drafts&rdquo; view.</figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/technology/ai/try-bard/&amp;xcust=2-1-1666669-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you search within Bard, you&rsquo;ll have the option to &ldquo;Google It&rdquo; to receive even more responses&mdash;but without any attribution for you to see where Bard is pulling its answer from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bard is also limiting responses. Early versions of Bing Chat tended to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/marvinvonhagen/status/1625852323753762816&amp;xcust=2-1-1666669-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">get weird</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507512/microsofts-new-ai-bing-taught-my-son-ethnic-slurs-and-im-horrified.html\">or worse</a>, when users engaged in long conversations with Bing. Bard isn&rsquo;t risking the same sort of interaction, either, and will limit responses as well. That&rsquo;s designed to keep responses on topic, according to Google.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Google Bard incorrect\" class=\"wp-image-1666695\" height=\"1181\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bard-incorrect.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption>Google Bard also makes it clear that it can get it wrong.</figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/technology/ai/try-bard/&amp;xcust=2-1-1666669-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Google seems very conscious of the fact that its first demonstration of Bard included a well-publicized factual error by misidentifying the James Webb Space Telescope as the first to take pictures of a planet outside of the solar system. In an example today, Google even highlighted a search result where Bard got it wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on a day when Microsoft added <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666493/hands-on-with-bing-image-creator-bing-chats-ai-art-tool.html\">AI image generation to its Bing Chat</a>, and shortly after <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1665235/ai-already-turns-text-prompts-into-stunning-art-next-up-video.html\">Runway debuted AI text-to-video</a>, you can forgive the world for just shrugging its shoulders at Bard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google, in fact, doesn&rsquo;t even characterize Bard as a product, but as an &ldquo;experiment.&rdquo; It all leaves one with the distinct impression that Google, once the home-run king of search, may be more of a minor leaguer among a number of new AI star players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666669/google-bards-ai-search-launch-was-well-boring.html", "date_published": "2023-03-21 18:46:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Hands-on with Microsoft\u2019s Dall-E 2-based Bing Image Creator: It\u2019s good!", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Microsoft begins integrating AI art into its AI-powered Bing Chat chatbot with Bing Image Creator&hellip;and it&rsquo;s surprisingly good. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft began <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1358985/this-is-what-microsofts-new-ai-art-generator-will-look-like.html\">previewing Image Creator</a> last fall in select markets, and its generative AI art later became the foundation for <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419066/microsoft-designer-is-almost-a-masterpiece-already.html\">Microsoft Designer, the excellent design application</a> that also uses AI art to help create templates, flyers, and simple greeting cards. Today, Bing Image Creator will begin integrating with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html\">Bing Chat&rsquo;s textual chatbot</a>, but also generate images at its own site, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bing.com/create&amp;xcust=2-1-1666493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bing.com/create</a> .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put another way, that means that you&rsquo;ll be able to ask Bing&rsquo;s chatbot to create your own images from an integrated text prompt within Bing Chat, or else use the dedicated site. There&rsquo;s a third option, too: Use the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1656353/microsoft-edge-copilot-adds-ai-content-creation-to-your-browser.html\">new Edge Copilot sidebar</a> within Microsoft Edge, which has been used for textual generation via AI. Microsoft now says that you&rsquo;ll see a small image icon within the sidebar&mdash;or you will, when it rolls out. Image generation will be integrated within preview versions of Microsoft Edge, the company <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/21/create-images-with-your-words-bing-image-creator-comes-to-the-new-bing/&amp;xcust=2-1-1666493-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">said in a blog post</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though PCWorld has access to Bing Chat, image generation doesn&rsquo;t seem to be part of the chatbot&rsquo;s capabilities at the moment. That&rsquo;s coming shortly, however: &ldquo;Bing Image Creator integrated into Bing Chat will begin to roll out to Bing preview users on both desktop and mobile starting today,&rdquo; Microsoft said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bing Image Creator is what you should be interested in, and for good reason. Here&rsquo;s how Bing Image Creator works.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-bing-image-creator\">How to use Bing Image Creator</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bing Image Creator is well-designed, if basic. You&rsquo;ll need a Microsoft account to log in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bing Image Creator works like other AI image-generation algorithms: Type in a prompt, and Bing&rsquo;s AI will generate for you. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346579/microsoft-will-bring-ai-art-to-windows-edge.html\">Microsoft is using Dall-E 2&rsquo;s AI model</a>, as the company said last year, which goes  far beyond <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338403/the-grandfather-of-ai-art-dall-e-is-now-free-for-you-to-try.html\">the original Dall-E, which you can use</a> and compare for free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bing Image Creator powered by Dall-E 2 is very, very good. Images are detailed, and the prompts are responsive; images take about 15 seconds or so to generate. (You&rsquo;ll still see some of the traditional problems with AI art, however, such as issues rendering fingers and hands. Each time you enter a prompt, you&rsquo;ll receive four 1024&times;1024 square images. Right now, however, there are no advanced options: You can&rsquo;t specify the dimensions of the image, and there are no options to tweak, such as how closely the images will match your prompt. Inpainting, where you can adjust portions of the image, aren&rsquo;t there either, though you could import the image into another service for that task.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"Bing Image Creator\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1272\" id=\"1666614\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/snowman-1.png\" width=\"2270\" /><img alt=\"Bing Image Creator hands\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1243\" id=\"1666619\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bing-Image-Creator-hands.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2268\" /></div><figcaption>Generated images are detailed, but you can still see some problems with how Bing Image Creator generates hands.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t addressed the issue of copyright. Instead, it dances around it by adding a small watermark to the corner of each generated image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At press time, Bing Image Creator gives you 25 image &ldquo;boosts,&rdquo; which appears to be Microsoft&rsquo;s version of the &ldquo;fast&rdquo; image creation used by sites like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/820518/midjourneys-ai-art-goes-live-for-everyone.html\">Midjourney</a>. While Microsoft seems to be offering unlimited image generation, once your boosts expire, the time to generate an image will be slower. It&rsquo;s not clear right now how quickly boosts regenerate, or if they do; other sites offer the ability to &ldquo;rank&rdquo; images for quality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens if you run out of Bing Image Creator boosts? Microsoft will use <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/416083/microsoft-rewards-is-how-microsoft-will-pay-you-to-use-edge-bing-and-more.html\">Microsoft Rewards</a> as a carrot, essentially &ldquo;paying&rdquo; you to use Microsoft&rsquo;s services. Microsoft Rewards is a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393308/how-to-use-microsoft-rewards-to-get-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-and-more-for-free.html\">handy way to earn credits for Microsoft&rsquo;s Game Pass Ultimate</a>, for example. &ldquo;If you run out of boosts, you have the option to use Microsoft Rewards to redeem for additional boosts and enjoy faster processing times,&rdquo; Microsoft says. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Bing Image Creator\" class=\"wp-image-1666611\" height=\"847\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Content-warning.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>If you generate a prompt that Microsoft deems unsafe, Bing will block it.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t had a chance to test out Bing Image Creator within Bing Chat, but remember that you can combine the two: You could always ask Bing Chat for an interesting prompt, and it will make its own suggestions. You&rsquo;ll find it first within Bing Chat&rsquo;s Creative mode, the company says, then later in the other modes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft has put content controls in place &ldquo;to limit the generation of harmful or unsafe images,&rdquo; the company says. If you prompt an &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; image, Bing Image Creator will shut the prompt down and refer you its content policy, <em>and</em> warn that repeated violations could cut you off entirely. (When we tried a prompt that asked for an image of &ldquo;Donald Trump and Matt Damon playing tennis,&rdquo; the prompt was flagged.)</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Bing Image Creator Bing CHat\" class=\"wp-image-1666626\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bing-Image-Creator-within-Bing-Chat.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Here&rsquo;s how Bing Image Creator will look in Bing Chat.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that Microsoft has frequently updated Bing Chat, we&rsquo;d expect the Bing Image Creator experience to evolve and receive updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Microsoft is also enhancing the basic search experience with what it calls Knowledge Cards 2.0 and Visual Stories, which are AI-powered summaries of your search topic. Basically, Bing Search now offers several ways of learning more about your search topic: traditional search results, a Chat summary of what it finds, as well as Knowledge Cards and Visual Stories, which will sum up information in infographics. Google&rsquo;s Bard AI search, which entered waitlist status today, clearly has some work to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666493/hands-on-with-bing-image-creator-bing-chats-ai-art-tool.html", "date_published": "2023-03-21 17:48:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "How to adjust the brightness on your laptop", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Staring at a bright computer screen can cause eye strain and tension headaches.

Serious MMO/MOBA gamers are still likely to see the big performance payoffs that the more versatile Razer Naga V2 Pro will undoubtedly bring them.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/452384/best-gaming-mice.html\">best gaming mice</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a gaming mouse, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"razer-naga-v2-pro-design\">Razer Naga V2 Pro design</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Making a checklist of V2 Pro&rsquo;s features shows it&rsquo;s definitely the quintessential MOBA/MMO gaming mouse of its time.

One good reason is that Razer has splashed out on a host of upgrades that make the Naga V2 Pro the more versatile and powerful mouse, and the one I&rsquo;d definitely choose if forced to decide between them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, it sports a revamped six-button plate in a two-line configuration, which replaces the seven-button plate and circular button configuration we saw in the Trinity. This looks a lot neater, is easier to navigate and leaves ample space for your thumb below, where Razer has added some grip.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Naga V2 Pro\" class=\"wp-image-1654811\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Razer-Naga-V2-Pro-with-Button-plates.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Razer Naga V2 Pro features three swappable button plates.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Razer has also added an upgraded Focus 30,000 DPI Optical Sensor, new Razer Gen 3 Optical Switches, and wireless connectivity options&mdash;low-latency 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless connectivity to be precise&mdash;so you can connect to a much greater selection of devices. The battery life is also very decent; you get up to 150 hours for Wi-Fi and 300 hours for Bluetooth on a single charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, the V2 Pro sports a four-directional Razer HyperScroll Wheel with six customizable scroll modes and haptic feedback to elevate the MMO/MOBA experience even further.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The V2 Pro handled quickly and accurately in each game, proving it has the muscle to perform across different genres.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While these upgrades are very nice to have, they do mean a few compromises have been made, most notably to the V2 Pro&rsquo;s size and weight. How much bigger is it? It measures 4.7 x 2.97 x 1.72 inches, which admittedly doesn&rsquo;t blow out the Trinity&rsquo;s 4.69 x 2.93 x 1.69 dimensions by any great amount, but does mean it&rsquo;s wider and thicker than rivals like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/701156/steelseries-aerox-9-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html\">SteelSeries Aerox 9 Wireless </a>(5.08 x 2.76 x 1.67 inches).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Naga V2 Pro\" class=\"wp-image-1654838\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Naga-V2-Pro-038_12buttons_R1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Razer</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The V2 Pro&rsquo;s weight, though, is kind of a bigger deal.

To that end, I tried it out in three different games: the MMO <em>Gloria Victis</em>, the battle royale <em>Fortnite</em> <em>Battle Royale</em>, and first-person shooter <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em>, swapping down plates from 12 to 6 and then 2, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected, the V2 Pro handled quickly and accurately in each game, proving it has the muscle to perform across different genres. The mouse&rsquo;s design was fairly comfortable, and the sensor tracked movement perfectly with no detectable lag and a smoothness that felt polished and premium. The buttons, by contrast, felt a little bit stiff at first. But once I&rsquo;d worn them in with a few hours gaming, they soon loosened up and were impressively fast. They&rsquo;re rated for a life of up to 90 million clicks.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Naga V2 Pro\" class=\"wp-image-1654817\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Razer-Naga-V2-Pro-underside_edited-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Razer Naga V2 Pro is well decked-out with PTFE glides on its underside.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried an MMO/MOBA mouse with a swappable plate system, it&rsquo;s something I can truly recommend. For example, once I&rsquo;d swapped out plates, I could more easily find my core commands, and it helped prevent unwanted miss clicks in games with fewer commands. One thing to note, however, is that you&rsquo;re better off keeping your 12-button plate in place in low-light conditions, since it&rsquo;s the only one with RGB, so it&rsquo;ll give you that added visibility when you need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As to the mouse&rsquo;s weight, it was quite noticeable in MMO and battle royale games, but was no hindrance. I actually liked the weightiness for sword duals in <em>Gloria Victis</em> where I may as well have been wielding a real sword in my hand, it felt so full and substantial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the first-person shooter, the extra weight proved a little less useful, making top-line completive movements a little sluggish. That&rsquo;s not to say it won&rsquo;t keep you competitive, but for complicated maneuverers, you&rsquo;ll want to consider something much lighter&mdash;like the 59-gram (2.08 ounce) <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/792405/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html\">HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is no surprise really. It&rsquo;s a long stretch to think such a heavy mouse could compete with much lighter FPS gaming mice and most players won&rsquo;t expect it to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"razer-naga-v2-pro-software\">Razer Naga V2 Pro software</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having those swappable plates to set up requires software that can do them justice. Thankfully, Razer&rsquo;s Synapse app is more than up to the task. It lets you assign buttons using interactive diagrams that are split up to represent the V2 Pro&rsquo;s different button regions&mdash;there&rsquo;s one for on top and then one for each of the three button plates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also super simple to change settings like the DPI sensitivity, scroll-wheel mode, the brightness of the RGB lighting, and the polling rate. In Synapse these functions are set out very clearly and the sub-menus are not difficult to find. I really liked how easy it was to import old profiles I&rsquo;d made previously and link them to games in my library&mdash;something I achieved with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Naga V2 Pro\" class=\"wp-image-1654812\" height=\"689\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Razer-Naga-V2-Pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Razer Synapse helps you visualize the Naga V2 Pro&rsquo;s various scrolling modes with helpful graphs. &nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"should-i-buy-the-razer-naga-v2-pro\">Should I buy the Razer Naga V2 Pro?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re an MMO/MOBA gamer, the Razer Naga V2 is going to be just your thing, especially if you like the convenience of swappable button plates but also want the latest and greatest high-end Razer hardware on offer to optimize your performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although, the Naga V2 Pro is a little heavier than its predecessor, it&rsquo;s very quick and accurate in MMO/MOBA games and brings an authenticity to weapon play that&rsquo;s just sublime.

One forum poster said that the fake drive&rsquo;s poor performance, about 50-60 percent of the 7000 MB/s write speed of the genuine 980 Pro, is what tipped them off. With the branding sticker removed, the cheaper components were on display: 3D NAND memory (instead of V-NAND) and an off-brand memory controller. These combined to drop the speed down to 4800 MB/s. Crucially, that&rsquo;s slow enough to make it unsuitable as <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1389767/expand-your-ps5-storage-with-big-black-friday-sales-on-compatible-ssds.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expanded storage for the PlayStation 5</a>, a popular application for this model of M.2 drive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterfeit storage is proving a persistent problem in consumer electronics, because it&rsquo;s an easy thing to fake.

The laptop is available in 14-inch and 16-inch flavors, both coming in an eye-catching &ldquo;iridescent&rdquo; paint job. The finish subtly changes colors depending on the angle at which you view it, aping the bombastic effect of some custom car paint jobs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The off-white is a somewhat muted white overall, but subtle shades of purple, green, and gold shine through depending on the lighting conditions. The design also stands out with a thin chassis (0.63 inches/16 mm for both models) that still manages a full-sized fold-out USB-A port, and an &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; haptic trackpad that blends seamlessly into the palm rest. Other notable features include OLED screens standard on all models, a MicroSD card slot, and MIL-STD 810H compliance for added toughness. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"LG Gram Style from the front\" class=\"wp-image-1666108\" height=\"797\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DZ-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">LG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14-inch model starts at a fairly hefty $1500, though that much dough gets you a 13th-gen Core i7-1360p processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, 1TB of PCIe Gen 4 storage, and a high-res 2880&times;1800 screen at 120Hz.

That&rsquo;s a whole lot of hertz, but Alienware charges a whole lot of money. Is it a worthy investment?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html\">best gaming monitors</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a gaming monitor, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"alienware-aw2524h-specs-and-features\">Alienware AW2524H: Specs and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware AW2524H is a 24.5-inch IPS LCD gaming monitor with 1080p resolution.

That will stop many gamers from pressing the buy button. If you&rsquo;re into top-tier competitive play, however, the price won&rsquo;t be hard to justify.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"alienware-aw2524h-design\">Alienware AW2524H: Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alienware&rsquo;s Legend 2.0 design language is evident in the AW2524H&rsquo;s charcoal &ldquo;Dark Side of the Moon&rdquo; chassis, which has a swooping, sci-fi look. Several AlienFX LED lighting elements provide a bit of spice and can be customized either through the monitor or Alienware software. It looks unique and aggressive but stops short of gaudy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build quality is excellent, with great material quality and a durable feel. Alienware&rsquo;s plastics feel thick, well-textured, and are free of glossy surfaces that will readily show wear over time. The only weak spot is the built-in headphone hanger on the upper left-hand flank. It&rsquo;s spring loaded, bursting out when pressed, but wobbles slightly when handling a heavy headset.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Alienware AW2524H headphone hanger\" class=\"wp-image-1665372\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alienwareaw2524h-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>A spring-loaded arm on the Alienware AW2524H&rsquo;s left bezel pops out to hold your headphones when not in use.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew Smith / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The AW2524H opts for a compact stand that&rsquo;s perfect for gamers with limited desk space and those who prefer a clean and uncluttered desktop. Most gaming monitors have a larger stand that takes up unnecessary space (though I should mention that the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/articles/gaming-monitors/rog-swift-pro-pg248qp-intro/&amp;xcust=2-1-1446541-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446541/face-melting-500hz-monitors-are-a-thing-now-my-body-is-ready.html\">Asus ROG Swift Pro PG248QP</a>, the only competing 500Hz monitor revealed so far, will also have a compact stand).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware&rsquo;s stand supports height, tilt, and swivel adjustments. It can also pivot 90 degrees into portrait orientation. A 100x100mm VESA mount is available for gamers who prefer a third-party monitor stand or arm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"alienware-aw2524h-features-and-menus\">Alienware AW2524H: Features and menus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware AW2425H offers a mixed bag of connectivity and features. While the inclusion of two HDMI 2.1 ports is a plus, they are limited to a maximum refresh rate of 240Hz. The monitor&rsquo;s full 500Hz can only be reached over the lone DisplayPort 1.4 input. This isn&rsquo;t a shocker, given the limitations of HDMI, but still important to know if you plan to use the monitor with more than one PC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>USB hub functionality is provided with support for four USB-A ports, but the lack of USB-C input feels outdated compared to other premium gaming monitors such as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1528866/aoc-agon-pro-ag274qzm-monitor-review.html\">AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM</a>.

Six-axis color adjustment is available but limited to a few specific preset modes. That&rsquo;s disappointing. The monitor is focused on gaming and makes zero concessions for content creators or basic home office productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has a few gaming-specific features including a dark stabilizer (which increases the brightness of shadows to make foes visible), timer, and frame rate counter. Alienware doesn&rsquo;t include a built-in crosshair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speakers are missing, as well. This is typical of Alienware monitors: The company expects gamers will rely on a headset, which is probably true for most gamers interested in the AW2524H. The monitor has two audio line-out ports, so it can pass through audio to both a headset and external speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"alienware-aw2524h-sdr-image-quality\">Alienware AW2524H SDR: Image quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware AW2524H is HDR capable, but focused on SDR image quality. This makes a lot of sense: Most games that have a professional competitive scene don&rsquo;t even provide HDR support, and competitive players generally choose to play with HDR off because it provides fewer opportunities for image customization. So, how does the AW2524H&rsquo;s SDR image hold up?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Alienware AW2524H is a motion clarity monster. It&rsquo;s so good, in fact, that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine future monitors somehow improving on this. </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Alienware AW2524H brightness graph\" class=\"wp-image-1665337\" height=\"838\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alienware-aw2524h-brightness.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew Smith / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>SDR brightness comes in at a strong 426 nits, which, while not record-setting, is bright enough for use in nearly any situation. The monitor also has a low-gloss finish that minimizes direct glare. A hardcore gaming monitor such as the AW2524H is likely to be used in a room with plenty of light control, so I think most owners will end up using a mere fraction of its maximum brightness.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Alienware AW2524H contrast graph\" class=\"wp-image-1665339\" height=\"847\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alienware-aw2524h-contrast.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew Smith / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast comes in at a ratio of 1130:1, which is towards the high end of competing monitors. The Alienware has a small but significant advantage over some recent high-refresh monitors, most notably the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1478644/acer-predator-xb273u-f-monitor-review.html\">Acer XB273U F</a> and Asus PG27AQN, a pair of 27-inch 1440p monitors with a 360Hz refresh rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, monitors with newer display technology <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1450209/the-year-of-the-oled-monitor-has-finally-arrived.html\">such as OLED and Mini-LED </a>will smash all the monitors in this competitive set. Monitors with those technologies are currently limited to lower fresh rates, however, and not a great choice for highly competitive gamers.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Alienware AW2524H color gamut graph\" class=\"wp-image-1665342\" height=\"842\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alienware-aw2524h-color-gamut.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew Smith / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware serves up a color gamut that spans 100 percent of sRGB and 89 percent of DCI-P3. This isn&rsquo;t enough to be considered &ldquo;wide gamut,&rdquo; in my opinion, but also an improvement over older gaming monitors. The Alienware AW2521H, for example, could only display 74 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamers will likely find the Alienware attractive and vivid in real-world use. It doesn&rsquo;t have the hyper-saturated look of some alternatives, like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/700448/gigabyte-m27q-x-review-lush-color-in-a-240hz-monitor.html\">Gigabyte M27Q X</a>, but remains attractive in real-world gaming.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Alienware AW2521H color accuracy graph\" class=\"wp-image-1665347\" height=\"911\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alienware-aw2524h-color-accuracy.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew Smith / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Color accuracy came in towards the high end of the competitive set. This level of color accuracy is fine for gaming, and I doubt any gamer will see reason to complain. The monitor&rsquo;s image appeared realistic and lifelike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware AW2524H delivered a default gamma curve of 2.3. This is slightly off the target of 2.2, and indicates an image that looks a tad darker than it should, but the variance is tight enough that it&rsquo;s difficult to notice. Color temperature came in at 6800K, which is slightly cooler and more blue than the target of 6500K. I found this to be noticeable, but only in very bright scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a 24.5-inch, 1080p monitor with a pixel density of 90 pixels per inch. That&rsquo;s not impressive, and it leads to noticeable aliasing and pixelation around fine fonts. Sharp edges and small objects in 3D games are displayed with significant shimmer and stair-stepping in motion, so the use of effective anti-aliasing in 3D games is important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, your opinion of the AW2524H&rsquo;s image quality will depend on your perspective. The AW2524H falls short of the AOC Agon Pro AG274QZM, which is just a tad more expensive. It doesn&rsquo;t even hold up to the Gigabyte M27Q X, which is sold for roughly half the price.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"a-cheaper-alternative\">\n\t\t\t\t\tA cheaper alternative\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"gigabyte-m27q-x\">Gigabyte M27Q X</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Gigabyte M27Q X\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/gigabyte-m27-q-x-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/700448/gigabyte-m27q-x-review-lush-color-in-a-240hz-monitor.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VH8B1XW?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1665236-5-700450-9975&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$538.73 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>When compared to other extreme high-refresh monitors, however, the AW2524H competes well. It&rsquo;s bright, has a good contrast ratio, and provides vivid color. Gamers looking to hit 500Hz are giving up some image quality for the experience, but it&rsquo;s a modest compromise I think most competitive players will accept.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"alienware-aw2524h-hdr-image-quality\">Alienware AW2524H HDR: Image quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware AW2524H is VESA DisplayHDR 400 Certified and, in my testing, was able to sustain a maximum HDR brightness of 465 nits (about 40 nits higher than its SDR brightness). That&rsquo;s not terrible, but it&rsquo;s also not great, and won&rsquo;t provide the luminance needed to lift detail in bright areas of a scene. The monitor also has shortcomings in its contrast ratio and color gamut that hold it back. A dynamic backlight mode is included, but the monitor is edge-lit, so it can&rsquo;t light small areas of the display independent of others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This adds up to an underwhelming HDR experience. HDR games look a bit brighter than in SDR but lack an added sense of dimensionality and depth, and colors seem no more vivid or vibrant than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not all bad news. The Windows 11 desktop experience is fairly good in HDR and the monitor provides good luminance uniformity in HDR scenes. The monitor doesn&rsquo;t need time to ramp or adjust brightness in transitions from dark to bright or vice-versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, I expect most owners won&rsquo;t gain much from the monitor&rsquo;s HDR mode. Using HDR doesn&rsquo;t provide a major leap in image quality and locks down brightness control, so I expect most people will prefer to stick with SDR.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"alienware-aw2524h-motion-performance\">Alienware AW2524H: Motion performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we get to the meat of the Alienware AW2524H: the refresh rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AW2524H has a native refresh rate of 480Hz, and can be overclocked to 500Hz. The difference between the standard and overclocked mode is trivial, and I&rsquo;m not sure turning on the overclock is worth the trouble. This isn&rsquo;t a criticism of the monitor. As refresh rates increase, the gains provided by a higher refresh rate get smaller with each rate increase. The step up from 60Hz to 80Hz is a 33 percent improvement, but stepping up from 480Hz to 500Hz is a gain of just 4 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whichever mode you choose, the monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate delivers on its promise of extreme motion clarity. I&rsquo;ve witnessed some very, very clear monitors in recent months, and the Alienware AW2524H thumps them all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motion clarity is close to flawless. Scrolling across the map in <em>League of Legends</em> reveals that nearly all details are preserved. Character names are easy to read, heath bars are crystal-clear, and character silhouettes are easy to identify. Compared to a 360Hz monitor, such as the Acer Predator XB273U F, the Alienware AW2524H is superior in text clarity and in preserving very fine details, like the tick marks in a character&rsquo;s health bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clarity is also excellent in 3D games. Zipping around <em>Borderlands 2</em>, one of the few games that can reliably hit 500 frames per second, I noticed almost zero motion blur while flipping between enemies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motion is so clear that I want to call it perfect. Technically, I know this isn&rsquo;t true&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve never seen a monitor with a 1,000Hz refresh rate (because it doesn&rsquo;t exist!), so I have no way to compare the experience. What I can say is that when I lean back and just <em>play</em>, my eyes and brain fail to interpret any motion blur at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alienware adds in three response times modes: Fast (the default), Super Fast, and Extreme. The Super Fast and Extreme modes <em>maybe</em> make the image look a hair sharper, but the motion clarity is already excellent and makes an improvement rather difficult to pinpoint. I did notice some slight overshoot in Extreme, which appeared as an over-sharpened, shimmering look around high-contrast edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I have plenty of praise for the AW2524H&rsquo;s refresh rate, I must pair it with a note of caution. You&rsquo;ll only see the full effect in games that can actually hit 500 frames per second&mdash;and many can&rsquo;t, either because of performance (the game is too demanding to hit 500 frames per second even on the best hardware available today) or because of hard-coded caps (the game engine does not allow a frame rate of up to 500 frames per second). Competitive players should double-check the maximum supported frame rate of their favorite games before buying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware AW2524H is a motion clarity monster. It&rsquo;s so good, in fact, that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine future monitors somehow improving on this. To be clear, I&rsquo;m not declaring this the end of the refresh rate wars. If you had asked me in 2018 if I thought the difference between 144Hz and 240Hz was meaningful, I likely would have said no&mdash;a take that time has proven incorrect. Still, the AW2524H&rsquo;s clarity is a step beyond anything available before it and worth the price of entry for gamers who want the absolute best clarity available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-alienware-aw2524h\">Should you buy the Alienware AW2524H?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware AW2524H is a cutting-edge monitor that pushes motion clarity to new heights, though its high price and modest image quality will be barriers for all but the most dedicated competitive gamers. If motion clarity is your number one priority, however, the AW2524H delivers&mdash;and it&rsquo;s likely to retain its lead for some time, as competing 500Hz monitors aren&rsquo;t slated to arrive until fall of this year.</p>\n\nGaming, Monitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1665236/alienware-aw2524h-monitor-review.html", "date_published": "2023-03-21 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Windows 11\u2019s tabbed File Explorer is profoundly disappointing", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft spent several years tinkering with a tabbed interface for the Windows File Explorer, but plans to add the feature to Windows 10 fizzled. It wasn&rsquo;t until late 2022 that Explorer tabs <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430331/use-the-new-tabbed-file-explorer-to-simplify-your-life.html\">finally arrived in Windows 11</a>. You would think after years in development that the feature would be fleshed out and intuitive, but alas, Microsoft delivered only the most basic of functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are hints that Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1478585/tabbed-notepad-joins-improved-settings-spotlight-in-windows-betas.html\">may add tabs to more built-in Windows apps</a>, but it really ought to take another look at how people use tabs before doing that. Luckily, it needs to look no further than web browsers. Like, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394959/why-switch-google-chrome-microsoft-edge.html\">one Microsoft itself makes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"more-tabs-more-problems\">More tabs, more problems</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the entire history of Windows until late 2022, the File Explorer only showed one directory per window. Microsoft toyed with tabbed interface for Explorer in the Windows 10 era, but the feature was not fully realized until an after-the-fact patch for the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1487513/windows-11-yearly-update-comes-to-your-pc-5-new-features-to-try.html\">big Windows 11 2022 Update</a>. Now, you can click the &ldquo;plus&rdquo; button or hit Ctrl+T to open a new tab in File Explorer. While that part is the same as any modern web browser, that&rsquo;s where the similarities end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bizarrely, Microsoft still treats tabbed Explorer windows as separate entities. If you open a new directory in Windows 11, it will open in a new window. Surely you can simply drag one tab over to the other to merge them, right? Nope. How about dragging tabs out of a Window to split them? Also no. Nor can you drag folders or shortcuts up to the bar to open them as a new tab. What about dragging tabs to rearrange them? You can! But the mechanics are awkward, forcing you to move the cursor all the way to the other side of a tab before Explorer keeps the new order. If you don&rsquo;t experiment with this, you might not realize rearranging is supported at all.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 File Explorer tabs\" class=\"wp-image-1663503\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Right-click.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Ryan Whitwam/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to open a specific directory inside an existing window is to find it and right-click to access the context menu. There, you&rsquo;ll find an option to open in a new tab. However, Microsoft has worked to optimize for touch in Windows 11&mdash;scarcely a single update goes by without Microsoft crowing about its more finger-friendly design.&nbsp; However, digging around in context menus is terrible for touchscreen usability. Dragging and gestures, which don&rsquo;t work in the Windows File Explorer, are much better for touchscreen interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve given up on dragging anything into the tab bar after a few frustrating interactions, but that&rsquo;s what makes the way Windows 11 handles files in the tabbed explorer all the stranger. You <em>can</em> drag files and folders into the tab bar to copy or move them to another open directory, but it&rsquo;s such a usability outlier as to be borderline undiscoverable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach limits the effectiveness of the tabbed Explorer UI&mdash;it&rsquo;s better than not having tabs, but it&rsquo;s almost like the new Explorer was designed by someone who&rsquo;s never used a computer before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-browser-standard\">The browser standard</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of inventing a new and more clunky way of managing tabs in Windows 11&rsquo;s File Explorer, Microsoft should have turned to the software that taught everyone how tabs should work: the web browser. Technically, a file explorer isn&rsquo;t a web browser, so there&rsquo;s no rule that says the tabs must operate the same way. However, if the goal is to create a good user experience, there&rsquo;s really no alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the internet has become a larger part of daily life, we live more of our computing lives inside web browsers. Not only does the internet grant access to all the wealth of human knowledge, there are web apps that replace many of the dedicated programs we used to install on computers. Some of the most popular computers on Earth are <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html\">Chromebooks</a>, which are built entirely around an almost universal browser experience. Imagine if every time you clicked on a web link, it opened in a new browser window. You&rsquo;d be understandably annoyed, but that&rsquo;s the default behavior for the Windows 11 File Explorer.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 File Explorer tabs\" class=\"wp-image-1663505\" height=\"708\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tab-no-drag.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>How does Windows 11&rsquo;s File Explorer not let you drag tabs to rearrange them?</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Ryan Whitwam/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the tabbed Explorer wouldn&rsquo;t seem so strange if browsers didn&rsquo;t exist, but they do, and now even novice computer users are familiar with how those tabbed interfaces work. This is the user experience touchstone that Microsoft should have used as a model. Instead, it rolled out the tabbed Explorer with all the aforementioned oddities. Maybe none of this should come as a surprise. Microsoft has stumbled with File Explorer redesigns more than once. Remember the ribbon UI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a mystery how Microsoft got all the way to release with the tabbed Explorer in such a state when the company also makes a web browser. Like all other modern browsers, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394959/why-switch-google-chrome-microsoft-edge.html\">Chromium-based Edge</a> has a tabbed interface that works in the standard way, letting you drag content and rearrange tabs effortlessly. Even before switching to the Chromium underpinnings, Microsoft&rsquo;s custom Edge browser worked the same way. There&rsquo;s just no reason for the File Explorer to ignore these established user experience principles. Before it adds tabs to more apps, Microsoft should decide if it <em>really </em>wants people to learn two different ways of managing them. Like it or not, browsers have set the standard, and it&rsquo;s a waste to fight that.</p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1663502/windows-1s-long-awaited-file-explorer-tabs-disappoint.html", "date_published": "2023-03-21 10:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Run Windows software on Mac and more with CrossOver+", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://software.pcworld.com/p43292-windows_10_home\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Windows</a>&nbsp;user, you never know when you might need Windows to run a certain software.
