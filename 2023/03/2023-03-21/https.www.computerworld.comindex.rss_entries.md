<p>Search and hyperscale computing giant Google said today that it has opened up access to Bard, a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-the-evolution-of-artificial-intelligence.html">generative AI</a> chatbot meant to compete with similar services offered by Microsoft and OpenAI, among others.</p><p>Bard, like similar advanced chatbots, is powered by a large language model. LLMs are essentially advanced <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3397142/what-is-deep-learning-algorithms-that-mimic-the-human-brain.html">deep learning</a> algorithms, with a range of abilities that include translation, summarization and more, powered by huge amounts of text. The LLM used by Bard is a lightweight variant of LaMDA, Google’s main natural-language processing model.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3691112/google-opens-sign-ups-for-its-bard-ai-chatbot.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Reality? What reality?</p><p>Soon, apparently, everything from brand assets to corporate videos to illustrations will be created differently using Adobe’s creative and enterprise apps and its <a href="https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">generative AI tool Firefly</a>. You’ll literally be able to speak to paint (or make video).</p><h2><strong>If you can say it, you can draw it</strong></h2>
<p>At Adobe Summit, the company also announced <a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2023/Adobe-Express-for-Enterprise-Empowers-Anyone-at-Any-Business-to-Create-and-Deliver-On-Brand-Content/default.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Adobe Express for Enterprise</a>, a new tool to create, share, and collaborate on high-quality brand content such as multimedia assets, social posts and more. It’s about to introduce generative AI tools within Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro, and its customer experience tools. And it rolled out a new content creation tool for enterprise users.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3691134/adobe-enters-the-age-of-generative-ai-with-creative-and-enterprise-apps.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>One reason artificial intelligence-based chatbots have taken the world by storm in recent months is because they can generate or finesse text for a variety of purposes, whether it’s to create an ad campaign or write a resume.</p><p>These chatbots are powered by large language model (LLM) algorithms, which can mimic human intelligence and create textual content as well as audio, video, images, and computer code. LLMs are a type of artificial intelligence trained on a massive trove of articles, books, or internet-based resouerces and other input to produce human-like responses to natural language inputs.</p><p>A growing number of tech firms have unveiled generative AI tools based on LLMs for business use to automate application tasks. For example, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3691109/microsoft-365-copilot-chatbot-is-the-ai-based-future-of-work.html">Microsoft last week rolled out</a> to a limited number of users a chatbot based on OpenAI’s ChatGPT; it's embedded in Microsoft 365 and can automate CRM and ERP application functions.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3691253/how-to-train-your-chatbot-through-prompt-engineering.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
