As 1-0 defeats go this was the vaguely encouraging kind for Arsenal, who even in defeat will leave Germany with the knowledge that progress remains within their grasp. Lea Sch\u00fcller\u2019s towering header was the difference between the sides here, but over the 90 minutes Arsenal created enough chances to offer plenty of hope for the second leg at the Emirates Stadium.<br /><br />The burning question, of course, is whether Arsenal will manage to take any of them. Twenty-five shots came and went for them, seven of them to the luckless Stina Blackstenius. But Bayern really did need to be at their resilient best in a pulsating second half, as an injury-depleted Arsenal managed to exert some serious pressure against a team that has conceded just four league goals all season. Caitlin Foord was probably Arsenal\u2019s most dangerous player, cutting in off the left flank and creating all kinds of problems.</p><p>And the Allianz Arena was an imposing sight at kick-off, with its rolling waves of noise, its futuristic red lighting scheme, the smell of bratwurst wafting across a crowd that numbered a very healthy 20,000. Tactically and tonally there has always been a certain extra frisson to these big Champions League games, a sense of stepping into the unknown. This was the first time Bayern and Arsenal had ever met in a competitive game, and as well as they knew each other individually there was also a certain edginess to both sides at times that manifested itself in some scruffy touches and slightly frantic defending.<br /><br />It was a pleasingly open game too, with little of the caution you often expect in a first leg. Schuller\u2019s goal towards the end of the first half came from her fourth shot, as Bayern sought time and again to spring the Arsenal offside trap and set her free down the channels. In midfield Georgia Stanway and Sarah Zadrazil grappled for supremacy with Lia W\u00e4lti and Kim Little: sometimes figuratively, often literally. For Bayern, Glodis Vigg\u00f3sd\u00f3ttir was titanic in defence, particularly as Arsenal stepped up their assault in the second half.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/21/bayern-munich-arsenal-womens-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/21/bayern-munich-arsenal-womens-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report", "date_published": "2023-03-21 20:07:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Apocalyptic road trip story wins the Waterstones children\u2019s book prize", "description": "<p>The Cats We Meet Along the Way by Nadia Mikail \u2013 about a family\u2019s trip across Malaysia during the impending end of the world \u2013 wins the older readers category, the overall prize and \u00a35,000</p><p>A \u201cphenomenal and tender debut\u201d novel about a family who embark on a road trip across Malaysia before the world ends has won the Waterstones children\u2019s book prize.</p><p>The Cats We Meet Along the Way by Nadia Mikail won the older readers category as well as being named the overall winner.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/21/waterstones-childrens-book-prize-winner\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/21/waterstones-childrens-book-prize-winner", "date_published": "2023-03-21 20:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Roma v Barcelona: Women\u2019s Champions League quarter-final \u2013 live", "description": "<ul><li>Champions League updates on the quarter-final, first leg</li><li>Any comments?

After 30 years of service, I feel a deep sense of injustice knowing that police leaders have been unable or unwilling to face up to problems that have been staring them in the face for decades.<br /><br />The head of the Met, Sir Mark Rowley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/21/rishi-sunak-fails-to-say-if-his-daughters-could-trust-met-police-in-wake-of-shocking-report\">says he feels \u201cembarrassed</a>\u201d and fully accepts Lady Casey\u2019s findings.

At a critical moment to show humility and understanding, the Met is returning to old patterns of insularity and defensiveness. This is the very culture highlighted by Casey that needs rooting out. Rowley\u2019s inconsistency should raise serious question marks over his willingness or ability to clean up the force. After all, how can you change a culture that you refuse to see?<br /><br />The sheer scale of the issues highlighted in the review struck me profoundly. The 363-page report details story after story of disturbing abuses at the hands of police officers. Stories of bullying, sexual violence, discrimination and intimidation perpetrated by those who are tasked with keeping us safe; of recrimination for those brave enough to whistleblow. My heart breaks for my colleagues for what they have endured, and for all those who have never been able to share what has happened to them.<br /><br />There is a weariness and exhaustion in knowing this fight must continue, because, of course, there have been landmark reviews before. Both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/26/scarman-report-into-brixton-riots-published-archive-1981\">Scarman report in 1981 </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">1999 Macpherson inquiry</a> exposed institutional racism within the Met. But none have been quite so damning, comprehensive and well-evidenced as Casey\u2019s review. It should now be simply impossible for police leaders and politicians to ignore her findings.<br /><br />But whether there is the political will and the staying power to fix what is broken is another question. A political leadership that cares passionately about reforming the force will be a critical factor in whether Casey\u2019s review can produce the change it argues for with such conviction.<br /><br />To restore public confidence in policing, the Met must challenge the systems, processes and beliefs that form its very identity. For too long, predominantly male police officers have been given the benefit of the doubt \u2013 serious offences written off as a lapse or a bad day \u2013 while victims, from fellow officers to members of the public, continue to be routinely dismissed, marginalised and ignored.</p><p>Sue Fish is a former police officer who served as Nottinghamshire\u2019s chief constable from 2016 to 2017</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/21/met-police-rotten-culture-failings\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/21/met-police-rotten-culture-failings", "date_published": "2023-03-21 17:48:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Man accused of Olivia Pratt-Korbel murder tells court he was friends with man who was shot", "description": "<p>Thomas Cashman tells Manchester crown court he \u2018never ever had any problems\u2019 with Joseph Nee and denies planning attack on him</p><p>A man accused of murdering nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel has told a court he was friends with the alleged target of the shooting and denied \u201cscoping out\u201d an attack.</p><p>Thomas Cashman, 34, is accused of fatally shooting Olivia when he allegedly chased a convicted burglar, Joseph Nee, into her family home and opened fire last August.

Johnson, who last told the truth during the Reagan administration \u2013 and then only accidentally \u2013 has somehow got the government to fund state-of-the-art lawyers to prove he wasn\u2019t aware of parties happening in his own house, attended by his own self, against his own rules, and in at least one case against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/apr/14/boris-johnson-broke-law-will-partygate-fines-be-undoing-podcast\">his own laws</a>, having gone on telly every single night to tell people that compliance to the letter of said rules and laws was a matter of life and death. Please bear this in mind if you tune in to his appearance tomorrow afternoon, along with the question: does our country have a path to dignity?

You might have thought that his world had faded but the truth is that between 1924 and 1941 Coward wrote five comedies \u2013 Hay Fever, Private Lives, Design for Living, Present Laughter and Blithe Spirit \u2013 that are regularly revived. They may look like escapist diversions but their structural symmetry, verbal precision and opportunities for actors mean that they are bankers which have achieved the status of minor classics.</p><p>But, rather than dwell on the famous five, I think it is worth asking whether there is more to Coward than a mastery of quilted fun and whether we should range more widely through his 50 or so plays.

Sheridan Morley, Coward\u2019s first biographer, called his book A Talent to Amuse. But, while Coward liked to present himself to the world as a message-free entertainer, he was a finger-wagging preacher and occasionally scathing satirist.

I like it when I have a hangover; Mr Z likes it on everything; my friend likes it but has rheumatoid arthritis and doesn\u2019t live anywhere near a Korean supermarket. The logic seemed to me almost inexorable: if everyone likes this thing, I bet I could make it myself.</p><p>So, newsflash everyone: your average kimchi is not vegetarian. It has a load of fish sauce in it, which yes, you can substitute with vegan fish sauce, except there is also fermented shrimp, and it really can\u2019t be overstated how not-vegetarian that is. There is a point in the fermentation lifecycle of a shrimp that it goes beyond even crustacea \u2013 in stench and intensity, it\u2019s basically reindeer. It\u2019s impossible to know what to do with this information: do I assume that the shop-bought stuff <em>is </em>veggie, which is fair, as I cannot read the ingredients (too small, also in Korean)? Do I cut the vegetarians out of my homemade experiment, or just pretend to forget there is shrimp in it, which will take some doing, given that my hands, my face and all my clothes still smell very strongly of the controlled rotting of something that was once alive?</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/21/i-learned-a-lot-from-making-kimchi-about-fermented-shrimp-and-about-myself\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/21/i-learned-a-lot-from-making-kimchi-about-fermented-shrimp-and-about-myself", "date_published": "2023-03-21 07:00:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "I\u2019m a dietitian.
