A friend of ours across the street has a small front garden, but since
we're in Boston, their house faces north, and it's three stories tall
the garden gets almost no direct sun. [1] Could we fix this with a mirror?

If I put a static mirror on the front of our house, even on an angled
mount, it would only send light to the garden for a short period each
day. To be actually useful, the mirror would need to be dynamic,
tracking the sun: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliostat">heliostat</a>. Since
the movement of the sun is well understood you can do this without
any sensors, just calibration.

With a bit of looking I found <a href="https://www.espaciel.com/en/reflectors/56-garden-reflector.html">two</a>
<a href="https://lm.solar/heliostats/">companies</a> selling
heliostats, though I think the main residential use is bringing more
light in through windows and not gardening.  Possibly building
something would be fun, but I'd be nervous about wind loads and
breakage filling our own front garden with shards.  Has anyone done a similar
project?

[1] Boston's latitude is 42&#176;, so the peak height of the sun on the
equinox is 48&#176; (90&#176;-42&#176;).  The solstices are &#177;
23&#176; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt">axial
tilt</a>) so at solar noon on the summer solstice it gets up to
71&#176;.  The house is ~40ft tall so its shadow is always &gt; ~13ft
(40/tan(71&#176;)).
