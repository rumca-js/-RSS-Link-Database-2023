We\u2019ll be moving in chronological order, not in order of release, which means Code Veronica, RE 0, and both the Revelations games will also be included in this elaborate recap. However, please note that we won\u2019t be talking about the fourth game since we don\u2019t want to spoil it for someone who will be playing the upcoming remake. Besides that, we have included everything that is important to the series.\n\nAlso, do keep in mind that this is a compilation of several story recap videos we have done for Resident Evil games in recent years, though some parts of it have been updated to bring it up to date, while at the very end, we have also added a huge new and thorough recap of Resident Evil Village and its DLC.\n \nSo, strap in and join us on this journey, because it\u2019s going to be a long, winding, and hopefully entertaining ride.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcPbSoSa1GI", "date_published": "2023-03-21 15:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
