Disney’s original Lion King movie from 1994 is one of the most beloved animated kids movies of all time. It made so much money that Disney is making it again! This time in “live-action” which essentially means very good CGI. Although the original is a classic and characters like Simba, Nala, Mufasa, Zazu, Scar and more are iconic now -- the movie isn’t without its questionable moments. Like what’s up with Scar controlling the weather? Why is the brother-sister romance so… romanticized? Why are lions even kings? To answer all these questions and more, step inside the pitch meeting that led to The Lion King. It’s super easy, barely an inconvenience.
