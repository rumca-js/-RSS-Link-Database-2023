<p>Jean-Michel Aulas took Lyon from the second tier and helped them win seven Ligue 1 titles. But that success feels very distant</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/_adam_white_?lang=en">Adam White</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>“Everyone disappointed me. It felt like the ball was burning my players’ feet,” said Lyon coach Laurent Blanc after his team’s drab 1-1 home draw with Nantes this weekend. Blanc also accused his team of “playing backwards” – disappointment and going backwards have become a theme at Lyon of late – with the team who were once PSG’s closest challengers now sitting in mid-table, without direction or impetus. Everyone connected with the club must take some blame, from the fans to the president. While their women’s side remains as strong as ever, their men’s team is floundering.</p><p>Picturesque Lyon is not a typical hotbed of footballing talent but Lyon’s first team has become defined by a prolific youth system – their nickname, Les Gones, means “The Kids” in the local dialect. Former alumni include Karim Benzema, Hatem Ben Arfa, Sidney Govou, Nabil Fekir, Corentin Tolisso and Alexandre Lacazette. Other academies in France have advantages – Le Havre are under far less pressure to achieve senior results, the centralised Clairefontaine has broad scope and appeal, and PSG have direct access to perhaps the deepest pool of local talent outside Brazil – but Lyon’s youth system has thrived thanks to good management, elite coaching and intelligent scouting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/21/lyon-best-run-club-france-old-fashioned-jean-michel-aulas-ligue-1">Continue reading...</a>
