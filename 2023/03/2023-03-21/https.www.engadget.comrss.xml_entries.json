First, there\u2019s the price. LG is asking $1,300 for the 49GR85DC-B. In 2023, that\u2019s a lot for an LCD. Additionally, in my experience, VA panels are never as fast as manufacturers say they are, so don\u2019t be surprised if LG\u2019s latest doesn\u2019t live up to the 1ms response time the company has listed. It's also worth mentioning few games support 32:9 resolutions.</p><p>The 49GR85DC-B is available to preorder starting today through LG\u2019s website.

But there are a few key differences between Google's and Microsoft's offerings.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>With Bing AI, you'll have to either hit Chat or scroll up from search results to get to the conversation page, whereas you don't have to do that for the Bard website. Microsoft has a broom icon to the left of the input bar to clear the slate and start a new topic, while Google has a column on the left with options for &quot;Reset chat,&quot; &quot;Bard Activity,&quot; &quot;FAQ and &quot;Help &amp; Support.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>It's also worth noting the language Google painstakingly uses here. Once I navigated to the website, I was greeted with an alert reminding me that &quot;Bard is an experiment.&quot; It asks users to remember two things: &quot;Bard will not always get it right,&quot; and that &quot;Bard will get better with your feedback.&quot;</p><p>Even after you click &quot;Got it&quot; and that reminder goes away, there's a line of fine print below the input field that states &quot;Bard may display inaccurate or offensive information that doesn't represent Google's views.&quot; After the embarrassing blunders Bard has already made so far, it's understandable (and mildly funny) to see all these disclaimers.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot showing Google's Bard AI chatbot, with a small window on top of the page saying \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/522b3e60-c809-11ed-bfd6-d7ede94b739f\" style=\"height: 1328; width: 2767;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Screenshot</div></figure><p>That's all fairly unobtrusive, though, and doesn't really affect my experience with Bard. There <em>are</em>, however, a few functional differences here compared to Bing AI. For one thing, Bing AI on desktop doesn't offer speech-to-text in its input bar (though the app does), while Bard can tap your laptop's microphone for you to dictate your queries. I have a tendency to ramble when speaking so I prefer to type, but I did use this tool to read out some questions to Bard and can verify it worked.</p><p>Probably the biggest difference between Bard and Bing AI so far is the fact that Google includes an easy way to see alternative responses within the conversation. You can click the dropdown arrow next to &quot;View other drafts&quot; at the top left of each chat bubble and see some other suggestions.</p><p>I asked Bard to create a 30-minute workout plan for the core and abs that excludes sit-ups, which is something I had asked Bing AI at Microsoft's suggestion before. I appreciate that Bard was able to give me a somewhat sound routine to do that did target those areas and leave out sit-ups, but was more impressed by the two other options I could look at.&nbsp;</p><p>Draft 1 suggested three sets of 10 to 12 reps of plank, side plank, Russian twists and mountain climbers, along with light instructions on how to do each. But its guidance for the planks and side planks was too simplistic. For both of those, it gave tips on form, followed by &quot;Hold this position for as long as you can.&quot; That is very different from person to person and can really affect the duration of the supposed 30-minute workout. It's also unclear if Bard is saying you should hold planks for as long as you can for 10 to 12 times for three sets, either.</p><p>Unlike Bing, Google's chatbot doesn't always cite its sources, so it wasn't easy for me to get clarification on these suggestions. Draft 2, for example, did list two sources, though it didn't have inline references for specific parts of the proposed workout. The second option did have some better instructions, though. It came up with four exercises to be performed in a circuit (i.e. one after another instead of finishing three sets of each exercise before moving on to the next one). These were plank, Russian twists, side plank, bicycle crunches and hip raises.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot showing Google's Bard AI chatbot responding to a query saying \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/c762a9b0-c80f-11ed-bb63-ce2f3f0859c9\" style=\"height: 1457; width: 2849;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Screenshot</div></figure><p>The instructions for plank were still as simplistic, but at least for side plank, this time Bard said to hold your body in place for 30 seconds before switching sides. Finally, the third draft was given in a very different manner. Instead of telling you to do four or five specific exercises for a few sets of a number of reps, this time, Bard offered a list of &quot;plank variations&quot; followed by guidance on how to do &quot;crunches and leg raises&quot; and some cooldown stretches. At the top of this plan, after 5 minutes of warmup activities, the chatbot simply said &quot;do 10 minutes of plank variations, 10 minutes of crunches and leg raises, then 5 minutes of cooldown stretches.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><em>This story is developing, please refresh for updates.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-21 17:09:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "NVIDIA unveils AI Foundations, its customizable Gen-AI cloud service", "description": "<p>The age of enterprise AI has come crashing down upon us in recent months.

Both flavors of NeMo are still in early access and Picasso remains in private preview despite Tuesday's news, so it'll be a minute before any of them are released to the wider public. NeMo and Picasso both operate on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-gtc-ai-dgx-cloud-161517378.html\">NVIDIA's new DGX Cloud platform</a> and will eventually be accessible through an online portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These enterprise-facing cloud-based services function as blank templates that companies can pour their own databases into to train on specifically. So while something like Google\u2019s Bard AI is trained on (and will pull from) data from all over the internet to provide a generated response, NVIDIA\u2019s AIs will allow companies to tailor a similarly-styled LLM to their own specific needs using their own proprietary data \u2014 think of ChatGPT but solely for one Pharma company's research division. The models can be trained with anywhere from 8 billion to 530 billion parameters, which is more than triple the 185 billion parameters GPT-3.5 provided.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/getty-images-sues-the-maker-of-ai-art-generator-stable-diffusion-over-data-scraping-allegations-184502897.html\">Imagine StableDiffusion, but trained on Getty Images with Getty\u2019s actual permission</a>.

Per Tuesday\u2019s release, Bio NeMo, \u201cenables researchers to fine-tune generative AI applications on their own proprietary data, and to run AI model inference directly in a web browser or through new cloud APIs that easily integrate into existing applications.&quot;</p><p>&quot;BioNeMo is dramatically accelerating our approach to biologics discovery,&quot; Peter Grandsard, executive director of Biologics Therapeutic Discovery at Amgen said in a statement. &quot;With it, we can pre-train large language models for molecular biology on Amgen\u2019s proprietary data, enabling us to explore and develop therapeutic proteins for the next generation of medicine that will help patients.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Six models will be available at launch including DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold2, Meta AI\u2019s ESM2 and ESMFold predictive models ProtGPT-2, DiffDock and MoFlow. According to the companies, incorporating AI-based predictive models helped reduce the time to train \u201cfive custom models for molecule screening and optimization\u201d using Amgen\u2019s proprietary data on antibodies from the usual three months down to four <em>weeks</em>.</p><p>NVIDIA announced a similar partnership with Shutterstock as well. The photography site will use Picasso to generate 3D objects from text prompts as a new feature within Creative Flow, with plans to offer it on Turbosquid.com and NVIDIA\u2019s forthcoming Omniverse platform.</p><p>\u201cOur generative 3D partnership with NVIDIA will power the next generation of 3D contributor tools, greatly reducing the time it takes to create beautifully textured and structured 3D models,\u201d Shutterstock CEO Paul Hennessy, said in the release. \u201cThis first of its kind partnership furthers our strategy of leveraging Shutterstock\u2019s massive pool of metadata to bring new products, tools, and content to market. By combining our 3D content with NVIDIA\u2019s foundation models, and utilizing our respective marketing and distribution platforms, we can capitalize on an extraordinarily large market opportunity.\u201d</p><p>NVIDIA is also partnering with Adobe as part of the latter\u2019s Content Authenticity Initiative, which seeks to enhance transparency and accountability within the generative AI training process. The CAI\u2019s proposals include a \u201cdo not train\u201d list, similar to robot.txt but for images and multimodal content, and persistent origination tags that will detail whether a piece is AI generated and from where.

But this year, following the hype around <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html\">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html\">Microsoft's revamped Bing </a>and a slew of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-is-opening-up-access-to-its-bard-ai-chatbot-today-140047434.html\">other competitors</a>, NVIDIA's AI push finally seems to be leading somewhere.</p><p>The company's GTC (GPU Technology Conference) has always been a platform to promote its hardware for the AI world\u2014now it's practically a celebration of how well-positioned NVIDIA is to take advantage of this moment.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;We are at the iPhone moment for AI,&quot; Huang said during his GTC keynote this morning. He was quick to point out NVIDIA's role at the start of this AI wave: he personally brought a DGX AI supercomputer to OpenAI in 2016, hardware that was ultimately used to build ChatGPT. We've seen the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-gtc-2020-ai-health-covid-19-130031390.html\">DGX systems evolve</a> over the years, but it's remained out of reach for many companies (the DGX A100 sold for $200,000 in 2020, which was half the price of its predecessor!). So what about everyone else?</p><p>That's where NVIDIA's new DGX Cloud comes in, an (obviously) online way to tap into the power of its AI supercomputers. Starting at a <em>mere</em> $36,999<em>&nbsp;</em>a month for a single node, its meant to be a more flexible way for companies to scale up their AI needs. DGX Cloud can also work together with on-site DGX devices, since they're all controlled with NVIDIA's Base Command software.</p><p>NVIDIA says every DGX Cloud instance is powered by eight of its H100 or A100 systems with 60GB of VRAM, bringing the total amount of memory to 640GB across the node. There's high-performance storage, as you'd expect, as well as low-latency fabric that connects the systems together. That amount of power may make the cloud solution more tempting for existing DGX customers\u2014why spend another $200,000 on a box, when you can do so much more for a lower monthly fee? DGX Cloud will be powered by Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure to start, but NVIDIA says it will expand to Microsoft Azure next quarter, as well as Google Cloud and other providers &quot;soon.&quot;</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-gtc-ai-dgx-cloud-161517378.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-gtc-ai-dgx-cloud-161517378.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-21 15:42:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Microsoft brings DALL-E's AI image generation to Bing and Edge", "description": "<p>Microsoft's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-begins-making-bing-chat-ai-searches-available-to-everyone-102506412.html\">Bing AI chat</a> can already be helpful for finding answers, but now it can help you produce fanciful pictures.

Not only can you sell phones from a number of manufacturers, including Apple, Samsung and Google, but the site also takes lots of physical media, including CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays, video games and books. For devices, you'll be asked for a general assessment of its condition, and given a quote immediately. Once you complete your order the site will send you a free shipping label. Decluttr also will accept handsets as old as the iPhone 6S, though it'll offer you only $7 for a 16GB model in good condition.</p><h3>uSell</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.usell.com/\">uSell</a> operates as a broker, searching other sites for their best offers on a given device and taking care of the rest. Like most buyback sites, it's big on iPhones, but you can still sell off other manufacturers' devices; it really depends on who's buying them at that point. The selection is a bit of a grab bag \u2014 newer phones like the Galaxy S21 aren't listed, though you can get a quote for the iPhone 11 ($210 for an unlocked, \u201cflawless\u201d 64GB model). Once you complete your order the site will send you a free shipping kit to send out your phone, and you can get paid for the item via PayPal, Venmo or an old fashioned check.</p><h3>ecoATM</h3><p>If you don't want to have to worry about packaging up your old device and mailing it off, or would like to receive your payout right away, there's always <a href=\"https://www.ecoatm.com/\">ecoATM</a>. It's literally there in the name: an automated machine that you place your device into and it examines the handset and pays you on the spot. It accepts the biggest brands (i.e., Apple, Google and Samsung), along with devices from a wide variety of manufacturers, including LG, Motorola and ZTE. If the machine determines that your device isn't worth anything at all, you can still use ecoATM to responsibly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-21-how-to-recycle-gadgets-electronics-earth-day.html\">recycle your old gadget</a>.

It\u2019s not great if you want cash, but if you\u2019re looking to upgrade an Amazon device this option is your best bet, as trading in an older one also nets you a 25 percent discount in addition to the store credit.

You can trade in iPhones, iPads, Macs and even Apple Watches. That\u2019s notable as wearables are a category you don\u2019t often see on trade-in sites. Apple will even take your old Android phone if you were thinking of making the switch. The trade-in values are on par with other sites, but you can get a smaller payout in the form of a gift card instead if you\u2019d rather wait before making a new purchase, want to put it toward media purchases or even just use it in an Apple Store.

You\u2019ll answer a few standard questions about your device\u2019s condition and whether you still have the original box \u2014 obviously, the more you\u2019ve kept from the original packaging, the better. You\u2019ll then get a ballpark estimate of its worth and a prepaid shipping label to print out. Once your device is received you\u2019ll generally get the assessment and payment via check, PayPal, Venmo or Zelle within two to three business days.</p><h3>BuyBackWorld</h3><p>The appeal of <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXliYWNrd29ybGQuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGVhNzQyMjQtMzFhMS0zYWUwLWI4OGQtYTVjNjM1N2JhNGVhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVwEk0WzIwX--hztWeg_xZeAKgP3iahEchhzSaqUU790&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buybackworld.com%2F\">BuyBackWorld</a> is that device assessment is a streamlined process: Instead of having to answer a barrage of detailed questions for your device you give it a general assessment and let the site handle the rest. Just like with It\u2019sWorthMore, BuyBackWorld will provide a printable shipping label in your confirmation email but, if you don\u2019t have a printer or boxes to pack your device up, you can always have the site send you a free shipping kit, which can handle everything the site takes except desktop computers.</p><h3>GadgetGone</h3><p>If you\u2019ve read through the other site descriptions, <a href=\"https://www.gadgetgone.com/\">GadgetGone\u2019s</a> modus operandi should be familiar: To sell a product, you\u2019ll have to answer a few questions about what type of device you have and what condition it\u2019s in, after which the site will generate a prepaid shipping label. At least here you can find brands like OnePlus included among the options, and you can also sell MacBooks and Mac Minis here.

You fill out the form online and bring that to customer service. It's easy, but there's one big downside: You can get your payout only via a Best Buy gift card. This is great if you spend a lot of money with them anyway, but less good if you really need cash.</p><h3>GameStop</h3><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZmUxMDZhZi04MjQ4LTRhZjMtOTA5OC1hMmQ0ZmQ2Mzc3NjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXN0b3AuY29tL3RyYWRlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZWE3NDIyNC0zMWExLTNhZTAtYjg4ZC1hNWM2MzU3YmE0ZWEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWONBQxiJwQZWOqsgNOaZr1TENQnsEshh4kidAZstcte&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Ftrade\">GameStop</a> is infamous for buying games back at ridiculously low prices and flipping them at near retail, but don't let that stop you from making some easy cash when you need to quickly clear your closet of old electronics and games. And yes, I said cash: GameStop offers store credit, a Visa prepaid card or actual money if you want to take your bounty elsewhere. For example, you can trade in Animal Crossing for the Switch and get $22 in store credit or $18 cash, which isn't bad when new copies are going for $48 on Amazon. GameStop also accepts phones, tablets and Apple Watches, though the prices aren't going to match what you'd get from an online trade-in site.</p><h2>Consumer to consumer</h2><figure><img alt=\"eBay Introduces Boxing Weekend On Dec. 26 and 27 At Eight Westfield Malls Across The Country, Making It Even Easier For Consumer\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dimse/5845cadfecd996e0372f/b478a6efcc8984ec8d666bf7963a8e145bfbd8d7/cmVzaXplPTIwMDAlMkMyMDAwJTJDc2hyaW5rJmltYWdlX3VyaT1odHRwJTNBJTJGJTJGby5hb2xjZG4uY29tJTJGaHNzJTJGc3RvcmFnZSUyRm1pZGFzJTJGYTUzM2RjZjc5MjAzNTFhNTk5Y2Y1MDkwYWMzYWRkNWMlMkYyMDM0MzUxODAlMkY1MDI1NjI0MzIuanBnJmNsaWVudD1hMWFjYWMzZTFiMzI5MDkxN2Q5MiZzaWduYXR1cmU9Zjk0M2M5ZjNmYjBjODllODUwNTMwYjk3MTQxZjE3ZmY2ZjI4YThhMg==\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes you prefer to cut out the middleman and get a bit more personal \u2014 a transaction where you're selling your device directly to another person instead of letting a faceless site flip it for you as a \"refurbished\" unit. In those cases, you want a site that's more user-to-user, though a few will still automate certain bits to make your sale as smooth as possible.</p><h3>Swappa</h3><p><a href=\"https://swappa.com/\">Swappa</a> is a marketplace site, which means sellers can set their own price. So if you're getting rid of a newer phone, this is probably the best way to go \u2014 the iPhone 13 fetches around $515, for example. That's a huge improvement over what you'd get selling through a site like Decluttr, which is offering only $422 for a 128GB unit.</p><h3>Amazon</h3><p>When shopping on <a href=\"https://sellercentral.amazon.com/\">Amazon</a>, you've probably been tempted by some of those marketplace deals in the past and, chances are, if you list an item on there, someone will give your old device a look. Since almost everyone on earth seems to have an Amazon account, your potential customer base is huge, and it costs only $0.99, plus a percentage based on category, to sell an item through the site. The downsides are that Amazon isn't really optimized for individual sales; you'll be competing with wholesale companies and even bots that will tweak the price of a product automatically in response to the competition.</p><h3>eBay</h3><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5a36d98f-e3c9-4ccc-96f8-f261b8484c73&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=eBay&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1YTM2ZDk4Zi1lM2M5LTRjY2MtOTZmOC1mMjYxYjg0ODRjNzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWJheS5jb20vPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGVhNzQyMjQtMzFhMS0zYWUwLWI4OGQtYTVjNjM1N2JhNGVhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfX3pHCwt6Ve_5xIT92CdPihNIKZUkLzFdv3_3o8b49d&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2F%3F\">eBay</a> is sort of the Wild West of sales sites, but the biggest advantage is that you can sell anything there and hopefully find a buyer, regardless of how old a product is. Even so, the site has come a long way in the past decade or so, adding structured categories that can help lead customers to your product. For phones, you can search by network, color or storage capacity, and even filter for features like 4K video or fingerprint sensors.</p><p>In the end, it still works as it always did: You list a product and set an end date for the listing with a minimum price, or just set a \"Buy It Now\" price if you don't want to wait to see how an auction turns out. Chances are you already have an eBay account with a feedback score, so there's no extra setup required on your part. Your first 250 listings are free every month, and you'll pay up to 15 percent of the purchase price only if an item sells. The biggest downside is that you're competing with a lot more sellers, and chances are there's always someone willing to undercut you on price.</p><h2>Cash-back comparison</h2><p>Ultimately, the site you go with should be whatever's most useful and convenient, but if you just care about how much money you'll end up with, we've priced out a few recent flagship handsets just to give you an idea of what each site offers. We've also thrown in the Nintendo Switch, because it might be time to sell yours off and finally upgrade to an OLED model.</p><p>All phone prices are for the lowest storage capacity, usually 128GB. The prices are for the unlocked models when available, or the carrier where it's being traded. These prices were valid the day this post was written, but they fluctuate daily or, in the case of sites like Amazon and eBay, hourly.</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><th><p>Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max</p></th><th><p>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra</p></th><th><p>Google Pixel 6</p></th><th><p>Nintendo Switch</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>Declutter</p></th><td><p>$432</p></td><td><p>$226</p></td><td><p>$135</p></td><td><p>$125</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>uSell</p></th><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>ecoATM</p></th><td><p>$280</p></td><td><p>$155</p></td><td><p>$40</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>Sprint</p></th><td><p>$230</p></td><td><p>$115</p></td><td><p>$45</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>Verizon</p></th><td><p>$282</p></td><td><p>$220</p></td><td><p>$15</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>T-Mobile</p></th><td><p>$230</p></td><td><p>$115</p></td><td><p>$45</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>AT&amp;T</p></th><td><p>$280</p></td><td><p>$230</p></td><td><p>$130</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>Best Buy</p></th><td><p>$330</p></td><td><p>$150</p></td><td><p>$105</p></td><td><p>$50</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>GameStop</p></th><td><p>$291 cash / $364 credit</p></td><td><p>$131 cash / $164 credit</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>$80 cash / $100 credit</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>Swappa</p></th><td><p>$455</p></td><td><p>$224</p></td><td><p>$124</p></td><td><p>$238</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>Amazon</p></th><td><p>$401</p></td><td><p>$275</p></td><td><p>$190</p></td><td><p>$75</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>eBay</p></th><td><p>$405</p></td><td><p>$368</p></td><td><p>$200</p></td><td><p>$131</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>BuyBackWorld</p></th><td><p>$415</p></td><td><p>$230</p></td><td><p>$140</p></td><td><p>$110</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>It'sWorthMore</p></th><td><p>$442</p></td><td><p>$273</p></td><td><p>$153</p></td><td><p>$100</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>GadgetGone</p></th><td><p>$465</p></td><td><p>$271</p></td><td><p>$141</p></td><td><p>$41</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you were looking to sell some games, we've also got a shorter list, because not every site accepts trade-ins.

The most important, when disposing of a phone or laptop or any other device containing personal data, is to do a full factory reset. That also means turning off \"Find My iPhone\" and the activation lock on iOS devices. See if you can unlock the phone, too; you'll actually get more money selling it carrier-free. And finally, make sure you've backed up any important data you may have, like contact info, game saves and, of course, photos. Cash is great, but it won't save your memories.</p><p>Images: Mike Blake / Reuters (ecoATM); Alamy (Gamestop); Getty Images for eBay (eBay)</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/where-to-sell-used-electronics.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/where-to-sell-used-electronics.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-21 15:15:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Ford unveils an electric Explorer crossover built for Europe's narrow streets", "description": "<p>Ford has finally shown the medium-sized electric crossover it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ford-europe-ev-launches-2024-164136546.html\">teased last year</a>, and it might not be what you expect. The company has <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2023/03/21/new-all-electric-explorer-engineered-and-built-in-europe.html\">unveiled</a> an electric Explorer that's &quot;designed for Europe&quot; and as suited to tight city streets as it is weekend jaunts. It's relatively compact (under 14.8ft long versus 16.6ft for the gas SUV) and offers creature comforts like &quot;sporty&quot; seats. Notably, it also includes a few technology features you won't even find in higher-end Ford EVs like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fords-mach-e-is-a-stylish-and-capable-ev-but-its-no-mustang-153044259.html\">Mustang Mach-E</a>.</p><p>The 15-inch vertical touchscreen will seem familiar, but it slides up and down \u2014 you won't have to settle for an awkward position. You also won't find the physical knob from earlier Ford EVs. The automaker also takes advantage of the electrified design to provide a massive amount of console storage space (enough for a 15-inch laptop) and a private &quot;locker&quot; for valuables. Wireless phone charging is standard, as is wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The five cameras and three radar sensors provide Ford's usual range of driver aids, although this is the first time Europeans will have access to features like Assisted Lane Change (which changes lanes through a stalk press).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"1ca96bda61c84b1991be37351b55ee3d\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Most performance specs aren't yet available, including range. However, Ford claims you can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in a relatively quick 25 minutes.</p><p>The company is taking reservations for base Explorer and higher-end Explorer Premium trims now ahead of a release later this year. While final pricing will have to wait, Ford expects the line to start below \u20ac45,000 (about $48,500). Don't expect a launch elsewhere, unfortunately. Ford tells Engadget there are &quot;no plans&quot; to bring the Explorer EV to North America, and that the conventional Explorer will still be on sale worldwide.</p><p>The Explorer is part of a larger strategy to introduce seven EVs to Europe by 2024, including the compact Puma and the Transit van. Ford ultimately hopes to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ford-will-only-sell-electrified-vehicles-in-europe-by-2030-113015462.html\">completely electrify its passenger cars</a> in Europe by 2030. This new model may be key to that transition. On top of being more practical for European streets, it's considerably more affordable than the roughly \u20ac62,000 Mach-E. This is the mainstream (if still pricey) people-hauler that might reach a wider audience.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ford-unveils-an-electric-explorer-crossover-built-for-europes-narrow-streets-144516934.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ford-unveils-an-electric-explorer-crossover-built-for-europes-narrow-streets-144516934.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-21 14:45:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best mobile microphones for 2023", "description": "<p>If you consider yourself a mobile creator and you\u2019re <em>not</em> using some sort of dedicated microphone, you might be holding yourself back. We\u2019re not judging, but your audience likely is. Audio, especially dialog, is often overlooked, but nothing screams amateur more than subpar sound. There are many, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/advanced-podcast-buyers-guide-part-1-143053492.html\">many options</a> for the home or office/studio, but there are a surprising amount of mobile-specific (or at least, mobile-friendly) solutions out there to elevate your on-the-go recordings be that for social, a jam session, making movies, podcasting and beyond.</p><p>What \u201cthe best mic for your iPhone or Android\u201d is will vary depending on the task you need it for. If you want to record a TikTok or a Podcast or even a jam session, all have slightly different needs but the selection below covers most bases (and maybe even a few you didn\u2019t think of yet) for recording high-quality sound with little more than a mobile phone.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>The gear</h2><p>This guide is all about recording on the go, free from the constraints of a studio or office, but also far away from luxuries like power outlets, acoustically friendly rooms and a full-size PC. As such there are two styles of microphone that really shine here: Lavalier (lapel) and shotgun. We\u2019ll be covering a few other types, too, but between those, most tasks are covered.</p><p>We\u2019ll also show you how you can use the USB mics you may already have with your phone and even ways to connect heavy-duty studio classics (XLR) to your humble handset, but all that will be through accessories. For now, let\u2019s start with the classic clip mics.</p><figure><img alt=\"Pictured are the Sennheiser XS and Rode Lavalier II microphones.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/99565600-a076-11ec-bf7f-a5450f59bc2e\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Lavalier mics</h2><p>The obvious benefit of a lapel mic is size. Their small profile makes them perfect for presenting to the camera with the flexibility to move around while maintaining consistent audio quality. If you\u2019re a budding TikTok or YouTube creator it\u2019s definitely worth having one of these in your bag.</p><p>The main trade-off, however, is that they\u2019re only good for recording the person they\u2019re attached to. If you have two people talking and only one is wearing the mic, you\u2019ll only get good audio for one half of the conversation, so for multi-person recordings you\u2019ll need a mic for each guest and a way to record them at the same time, so costs can go up quickly.</p><p>Fortunately, lapel mics have become a very competitive market with good, viable options costing as little as $14.95. For an absolute bargain with a long cord and some connectivity accessories, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3tcvdUe\">Boya BY M1</a> is hard to argue with. But, while these budget choices are great value, if you want something that should either last longer, is more versatile or just sounds better it\u2019s worth paying a little bit more.</p><h2>Best 3.5mm mic: Rode Lavalier II</h2><p></p><p><a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e54dc56f-69db-417f-9610-572a1a179058&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sweetwater+Sound&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlNTRkYzU2Zi02OWRiLTQxN2YtOTYxMC01NzJhMWExNzkwNTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dlZXR3YXRlci5jb20vc3RvcmUvZGV0YWlsL0xhdmFsaWVySUktLXJvZGUtbGF2YWxpZXItaWktYmxhY2siLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA3Yzk0NjdmLThmYTAtNGIzMi05NjMzLTM5OWM4NDE3MTNlNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfnJ3HjL80ZkWe1qn1bLLOhgrVOdtf_20cmcWezrazao&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FLavalierII--rode-lavalier-ii-black\">Rode\u2019s Lavalier II</a> is a slick-looking low-profile lavalier that sounds great.

For even more flexibility you can pair this with Rode\u2019s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3HpE9uu\">AI Micro interface</a> ($79) which provides easy connection to an iPhone or Android (or even PCs) and adds support for a second mic \u2013 perfect for recording podcasts or interviews.</p><h2>Best USB-C mic: Sennheiser XS</h2><p></p><p>At $60, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZW5uaGVpc2VyLVByby1BdWRpby1NaWNyb3Bob25lLTUwOTI2MS9kcC9CMDhZUzJHNEZCP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlqLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwN2M5NDY3Zi04ZmEwLTRiMzItOTYzMy0zOTljODQxNzEzZTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYiW1C1uqKb5MtItKC2R53dxmtOKnROX-ON4gil8xrNn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSennheiser-Pro-Audio-Microphone-509261%2Fdp%2FB08YS2G4FB\">Sennheiser\u2019s XS</a> (USB-C) lav mic is fairly affordable, sounds great and plugs right into your phone (or laptop) without needing an adapter.

One of the first things you might bump up against when dealing with mobile audio accessories is TRRS vs TRS connectors. Simply put, 3.5mm TRS is what you might know as the age-old classic headphone connector while TRRS became common for its support for headsets and inline mics. You can easily tell them apart as TRS connectors have two black bands on them while a TRRS has three.</p><p>For you, the budding creator, it can be a bit of an annoyance as many 3.5mm lavaliers are going to be TRS and won\u2019t work when plugged into your phone\u2019s headphone adapter.

It\u2019s the style of microphone most often found atop a DSLR or mirrorless camera, but they make great companions for other portable devices too, your cell phone included.</p><p>The benefit of a shotgun is that they tend to be highly directional, which makes them perfect for podcasts, recording instruments, foley sounds and much, much more.</p><p>For us mobile recordists, another benefit is that they tend to be light and portable, perfect for slipping into a backpack or even a laptop bag. Even better, there are some great mobile-specific options.</p><h2>Best shotgun mic for video/music: Sennheiser MKE 400 (2nd gen)</h2><p></p><p>You shouldn\u2019t buy a mic just because of how it looks, but the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo+Video&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTYyOTY0Mi1SRUcvc2VubmhlaXNlcl81MDg4OThfbWtlXzQwMF9jYW1lcmFfbW91bnRfc2hvdGd1bi5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwN2M5NDY3Zi04ZmEwLTRiMzItOTYzMy0zOTljODQxNzEzZTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb5-N6Q4pIL5g5JMPanLFIwBKn9Z9uKAx6KcjX9Z--5i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1629642-REG%2Fsennheiser_508898_mke_400_camera_mount_shotgun.html\">MKE 400 from Sennheiser</a> ($200) definitely makes its rivals look wimpy. More important than aesthetics, though, is how it sounds and the MKE 400 records very cleanly without obvious coloration to the audio. What\u2019s more, the battery-powered mic won\u2019t steal power from your phone or camera, and with three gain levels to choose from you can boost things when needed, or avoid clipping on louder subjects. The MKE 400 also comes with both TRS and TRRS cables for compatibility with a variety of devices.</p><p>The MKE 400\u2019s physical gain controls and high pass filter (unlike the other two below that are updated via an app) take the stress out of worrying if your audio source moves or changes volume as you can adjust that on the fly. If you\u2019re a musician looking to record loud drums and then softer vocals on the move, for example, these tactile gain settings are a massive plus.</p><h2>Best budget shotgun mic: Rode VideoMic GO II</h2><p></p><p>When we tested the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rode-video-mic-go-ii-230059221.html\">VideoMic GO II</a> we were surprised at just how good it sounded right out of the box.

While it looks like a regular handheld mic, it's actually deceivingly small, making it very light and portable. It also comes with cables to directly connect it to iPhones and Android handsets \u2014 no adapters needed. Don't let the small size deceive you though, the HypeMic has a big trick up its sleeve: a built-in analog compressor for professional-sounding vocals. Whether you record podcasts, vocals or instruments there's a setting on the HypeMic just for you.

In general, Android makes this simpler, but also, thanks to the wide range of manufacturers and software versions you can\u2019t always guarantee things will work smoothly.</p><p>The iPhone is a whole other situation. USB microphones have a good chance of working via the USB camera kit we mentioned earlier, but that\u2019s still inelegant sometimes. Frustratingly, some USB-C to Lightning cables will play nice with microphones, but sadly most will not \u2013 including Apple\u2019s own. One confirmed option is <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802357977363.html\">this cable</a> from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html\">Fiio</a> or this <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhXUTFMWTVEP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWlqLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwN2M5NDY3Zi04ZmEwLTRiMzItOTYzMy0zOTljODQxNzEzZTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAViJDqX1ZHuUB-rW5BFy3TwpbRNhnCU1XNBLI-eYVpMj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08WQ1LY5D\">generic alternative</a>.

More recently, we've seen the company add generative AI features to practically its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-is-shoving-generative-ai-into-gmail-docs-sheets-meet-chat-and-slides-161711903.html\">entire suite</a> of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-is-working-on-ai-for-ultrasound-diagnosis-and-cancer-therapy-150023911.html\">services</a>, while access to the Bard chatbot remained exclusive to a few. We saw <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/03/20/google-bard-pixel-superfans/\">some Pixel users receive invites</a> to test out Google's bot yesterday, and today, the company said it's &quot;starting to open access to Bard.&quot;</p><p>In a blog post that &quot;Bard did help us write,&quot; vice president of product Sissie Hsiao and vice president of research Eli Collins invited folks to sign up at <a href=\"https://bard.google.com/\">bard.google.com</a>. The company said it will begin rolling out access to those in the US and the UK today, and that it's &quot;expanding over time to more countries and languages.&quot; Opening up access to more people is &quot;the next critical step in improving it,&quot; the pair said, noting that getting feedback from a wider tester base is crucial.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Much like you can with ChatGPT or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html\">Microsoft's Bing AI</a>, you'll be able to talk to Bard like you would a friend, using natural language instead of a stilted series of keywords. &quot;You might ask Bard to give you tips to reach your goal of reading more books this year, explain quantum physics in simple terms or spark your creativity by outlining a blog post,&quot; Hsiao and Collins wrote.</p><p>The pair also said &quot;Bard is a direct interface to an LLM, and we think of it as a complementary experience to Google Search.&quot; Based on screenshots included in the announcement, Bard's interface looks fairly similar to Bing AI, with a few key differences. At the bottom of each response, Google's version offers four buttons: thumbs up, thumbs down, a refresh arrow and a button saying &quot;Google it.&quot; There's also an option at the top right of the response that says &quot;View other drafts.&quot; Bing AI doesn't have these, instead using the space below each response as an area for source citations.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-confirms-bing-runs-on-the-new-gpt-4-model-184121316.html\">Bing AI runs on OpenAI's GPT-4</a>, Bard is powered by &quot;a lightweight and optimized version&quot; of Google's LaMDA, and the company said it &quot;will be updated with newer, more capable models over time.&quot; At <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2022/\">its last I/O developer conference</a>, Google <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-test-kitchen-lamda-2-experiments-180212404.html\">showed off an AI Test Kitchen app</a> for people to interact with LaMDA 2, which it also unveiled then.</p><p>The input bar at the bottom of the screen also has a couple of differences. Bard has a microphone symbol at the end, indicating speech-to-text might be supported, while Bing doesn't. Meanwhile, Microsoft's offering has a broom icon on the left of the text input bar to clean the slate when you want to start on a new topic. Google's doesn't. It's also worth noting that below Bard's text field is a line of fine print that reads &quot;Bard may display inaccurate or offensive information that doesn't represent Google's views.&quot;</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot showing Google's Bard AI chatbot responding to the query \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/9b66bbe0-c791-11ed-b79e-fc3f9c0d076f\" style=\"height: 2362; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Google</div></figure><p>In its announcement, Google was careful to acknowledge that large language models (LLMs) like LaMDA aren't perfect and that mistakes happen. &quot;For instance, because they learn from a wide range of information that reflects real-world biases and stereotypes, those sometimes show up in their outputs,&quot; Hsiao and Collins wrote.</p><p>They even shared an example of where Bard has gone wrong before. &quot;When asked to share a couple suggestions for easy indoor plants, Bard convincingly presented ideas\u2026but it got some things wrong, like the scientific name for the ZZ plant.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Google said that it's important to know such challenges exist, and noted that quality and safety are significant issues to consider. &quot;We've also built in guardrails, like capping the number of exchanges in a dialogue, to try to keep interactions helpful and on topic,&quot; Hsiao and Collins wrote. It's not yet clear what the limit on the number of exchanges in a dialogue is, though, and we've asked Google for clarification and will update this post when we hear back.</p><p>In spite of all its potential limits and possibility for error, Google still believes Bard is worth the work, adding that it will &quot;continue to improve Bard and add capabilities, including coding, more languages and multimodal experiences.&quot; Hsiao and Collins said that Bard's help in writing the announcement post involved creating an outline and suggesting edits. &quot;It didn\u2019t always get things right,&quot; they said. &quot;But even then, it made us laugh.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-is-opening-up-access-to-its-bard-ai-chatbot-today-140047434.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-is-opening-up-access-to-its-bard-ai-chatbot-today-140047434.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-21 14:00:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "'Attack on Titan' publisher Kodansha is launching its own Manga app", "description": "<p>Reading some of your favorite Manga series may be getting a little easier soon: Kodansha, the publisher behind hit titles like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-25-netflix-original-anime-perfect-bones.html\"><em>Attack on Titan</em></a> and <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, has announced that it's launching a new digital reading platform in May.

But at what cost? Cutting the cord typically means you don\u2019t get to watch local channels, live sports or certain \u201ccable only\u201d networks. If you want to get back some of what cable has to offer \u2013 without the contract or quite so much padding \u2013 a live TV streaming service may be what you need. There are a handful of options out there and nearly all of them are worth considering. We tested out six, comparing the features, prices and usability of each to come up with recommendations for different types of TV lovers.</p><h2>What to look for in a live TV streaming service</h2><h3><strong>What you need to stream live TV</strong></h3><p>Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html\">streaming device</a> and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on your device.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h3><strong>Price</strong></h3><p>When I started my research, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-video-streaming-services-133000093.html\">standard streaming app</a> like Netflix or Peacock. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, many live TV services hit around the $70 mark and can go higher than $100 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. I also learned that when it comes to base plans, higher prices are mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks \u2013 particularly sports and local stations.</p><h3><strong>Local channels</strong></h3><p>Only two of the services we tried don\u2019t include full local channel coverage and one of those makes no effort at carrying sports. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it\u2019s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations, and only in larger markets, but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.</p><p>When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you\u2019ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area\u2019s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UVi1BbnRlbm5hLUluZG9vci1Cb29zdGVyLVNpZ25hbC9kcC9CMEJGOU04RFZIP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXAyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdNjSFySHUB5LvTxXF-PeO0y_Q2BikkE25wwz5DoNvP8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTV-Antenna-Indoor-Booster-Signal%2Fdp%2FB0BF9M8DVH\">HD antenna</a>, you\u2019ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.</p><h3><strong>Sports</strong></h3><p>One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. Google makes it a little easier by listing out <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0931b986-736e-47bb-80b9-5f6f8f4ef5ae&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Google&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwOTMxYjk4Ni03MzZlLTQ3YmItODBiOS01ZjZmOGY0ZWY1YWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zZWFyY2g_cT11cGNvbWluZytuYmErZ2FtZXMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUwZWIzNGRiLWMwZmMtNGJmYi1hYjQxLTFjYmU5N2ZhZmZkOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAesTVaWGoJAGC8HeWPR-hONFNNDQi_RYK1Xsn7p9P7eQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dupcoming%2Bnba%2Bgames\">upcoming games</a>: if you click on one, the \u201cTV &amp; streaming\u201d button will tell you which network is covering the event.</p><p>That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries that network. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don\u2019t have certain channels. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/south-park-warner-bros-discovery-paramount-lawsuit-211615299.html\">streaming rights negotiations</a>, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.</p><figure><img alt=\"A TV displaying the logos for Philo, Sling, Hulu, DirecTV stream, fuboTV, and YouTube TV apps. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/3cbec0e0-c42d-11ed-bfbe-961d0e86297a\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><h3><strong>Traditional cable networks</strong></h3><p>Dozens of networks were once only available with cable, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, HBO Max and Netflix, you won\u2019t have access to any of those. All the options we tested deliver sizable lists of cable networks, though only DirecTV gives you all of the top 36 channels ranked <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/126-cable-channels-ranked-2022-183059118.html\">by Nielsen</a> as the most watched in 2022.</p><p>Media conglomerates continue to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-discovery-plus-214335645.html\">merge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/epix-relaunch-mgm-plus-140538789.html\">rebrand</a> or reenter the streaming market, which means you can find many cable networks on traditional streaming platforms like Peacock. Other channels like AMC+ have their own stand-alone apps. If you\u2019re just interested in live TV for cable-only shows, there are cheaper alternatives. I was particularly delighted by the 20 ad-free channels you get on the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e3296106-c693-4525-ba0e-6b65767ea99e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Discovery%2B&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlMzI5NjEwNi1jNjkzLTQ1MjUtYmEwZS02YjY1NzY3ZWE5OWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzY292ZXJ5cGx1cy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATxGz2ytnj6015YElXRvBTyedZd22GCfa43yqWiVYBRl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.discoveryplus.com%2F\">Discovery+</a> app for $7 per month.

You\u2019ll either get an unlimited amount of recordings that expire after nine months or a year, or you\u2019ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later.</p><p>Aside from being able to watch whenever it\u2019s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can\u2019t skip them on live TV or video-on-demand (VOD).</p><p>Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of VOD content including movies and shows that are currently airing on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn\u2019t cover live events, local shows and news programming. But it does let you watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like <em>Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives</em> or BET\u2019s <em>Sistas</em>. Just search for the program, pick an episode and hit play.</p><h3><strong>Tiers, packages and add-ons</strong></h3><p>Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I\u2026 made three. The base plans range from $25 to $75 per month. From there, you can add on packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international. Those cost an extra $5 to $20 per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your base-level live TV.</p><p>Then there are more premium VOD add-ons, such as HBO Max, AMC+, Starz or Showtime. You may already have these through standalone apps. If you don\u2019t, or if you prefer a combined bill and one access point for your streaming, many live TV subscriptions let you add them.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><p>When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For this space, just six services dominate, so I tried them all. After getting them set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of last year's <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/126-cable-channels-ranked-2022-183059118.html\">top cable networks</a> were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.</p><p>I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app\u2019s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of <em>Home Town</em>.</p><p>I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.</p><p>Here\u2019s the full list of everything we tried:</p><ul><li><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b250d7a0-0e4e-4332-bc87-bf6e669b0564&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Philo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMjUwZDdhMC0wZTRlLTQzMzItYmM4Ny1iZjZlNjY5YjA1NjQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGhpbG8uY29tL2xvZ2luL3N1YnNjcmliZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAabIVZR19dFPFnrkXwC-HZhqdthhzjQEXtk-uUzjcKrv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philo.com%2Flogin%2Fsubscribe\">Philo</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34c77505-6db4-4664-9320-2c38b4122d5e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sling+TV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGM3NzUwNS02ZGI0LTQ2NjQtOTMyMC0yYzM4YjQxMjJkNWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2xpbmcuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQuX1x-8Li1Y3BleLw5tlSNrUlv0th9PPvhRuDrLsSQD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2F\">Sling</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/\">YouTube TV</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ca19dea0-e7ad-4f54-beed-6302bce56589&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hulu&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYTE5ZGVhMC1lN2FkLTRmNTQtYmVlZC02MzAyYmNlNTY1ODkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVsdS5jb20vbGl2ZS10diIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAASOsz4gSX7PSfobz14RykoXuU9OPnxuKEPPXAKT0mdHs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Flive-tv\">Hulu + Live TV</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=fd7207b2-1b6a-4385-aa15-2f04784de078&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DIRECTV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmZDcyMDdiMi0xYjZhLTQzODUtYWExNS0yZjA0Nzg0ZGUwNzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlyZWN0di5jb20vc3RyZWFtLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZCwHkjcdTHbgJbx0h8bZZ50xk2YCKyUPzrRoo-1iCLq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.directv.com%2Fstream%2F\">DirecTV Stream</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a941868-c063-4b44-9207-896f1fb5891e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=FuboTV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5YTk0MTg2OC1jMDYzLTRiNDQtOTIwNy04OTZmMWZiNTg5MWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL3d3dy5mdWJvLnR2L3dlbGNvbWU_aXJhZD0zNDM3NDcmaXJtcD0yNTM2MjE3JnBhcnRuZXJwcm9wZXJ0eWlkPTMxNDI4MjMmc3ViSWQzPXhpZDpmcjE2NzQyNTQ5ODIwMDhiaGIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUwZWIzNGRiLWMwZmMtNGJmYi1hYjQxLTFjYmU5N2ZhZmZkOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbfV5QVpXnp6Zv4vvSRE-0I6_ukuICBOH21I_DjeUyw3&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fwelcome%3Firad%3D343747%26irmp%3D2536217%26partnerpropertyid%3D3142823%26subId3%3Dxid%3Afr1674254982008bhb\">FuboTV</a></p></li></ul><h2>Most well-rounded: YouTube TV</h2><p></p><p>Google\u2019s live TV streaming service has a lot of strengths. Compared to our top pick for sports, <a href=\"https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/\">YouTube TV</a> covers major and minor teams, regional games and national matchups almost as well. It gives you clear navigation, a great search function, unlimited DVR and broad network coverage. It's not quite as affordable as it once was, as YouTube recently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-raises-prices-to-an-outrageous-73-per-month-182517379.html\">raised the price</a> to $73 per month \u2013 and it's even more financially precarious if you're not great at resisting temptation.</p><p>Upon signup, you\u2019re presented with nearly 50 different add-ons, including 4K resolution, premium channels and themed packages. Even if you fight the urge to roll HBO Max, Shudder and AcornTV into the mix at signup, the enticement remains as it\u2019s dangerously easy to add more to your subscription. If you search for a program on a network you don\u2019t have, you\u2019re prompted to add it. And of course, you can also rent or buy movies that aren\u2019t currently showing on any channels, just like you can via YouTube. While it\u2019s convenient to be able to order up anything you might want on a whim, I imagine this pushes many users\u2019 bills far above Google\u2019s listed $73 per month.</p><p>Still, it\u2019s nice to have all your entertainment in one place. And if you <em>only</em> want the add-ons, you can actually subscribe to most of the standalone networks without paying for the base plan. Either way, you get a familiar user experience, with navigation you\u2019ll recognize if you\u2019ve spent any time on regular ol\u2019 YouTube. Unsurprisingly, Google\u2019s search function was the best of the bunch, finding the shows and games I searched for quickly and giving me clear choices for how to watch and record.</p><p>At signup, you\u2019ll also pick the shows, networks and teams you like, which are added to your library. YouTube TV then automatically records them. You get unlimited cloud DVR space (though recordings expire after nine months) and it\u2019s dead simple to add programming to your library. Like a real cable experience, YouTube TV autoplays your last-watched program upon startup by default, but it was the only service that allowed me to turn that feature off by heading to the settings.</p><p>Searching for and recording an upcoming game was easy. Once the game was recorded, I had to hunt a little to find it in my library (turns out single games are listed under the Events heading, not Sports). But after that, playback was simple and included a fascinating extra feature: You can either play a recorded game from the beginning or hit Watch Key Plays. The latter gives you between 12 and 20 highlight snippets, each about 10 seconds long. It focuses on the most impressive shots in an NBA bout and includes every goal in an MLS matchup. The feature was available for NCAA basketball and in-season major American leagues (hockey, soccer and basketball at the time of testing). Foreign and more minor games didn\u2019t have the feature.</p><p>YouTube TV also gives you the most in-app settings. You can add parental controls to a profile or pull up a stats menu that shows your buffer health and connection speeds. You can lower playback resolution for slow connections and even send feedback to YouTube. It was also the best at integrating VOD and live programming. For example, if you search for a show that happens to be playing live, a red badge in the corner of the show\u2019s image lets you know it\u2019s on right now. Other services didn\u2019t display this info as clearly.</p><p>Now that YouTube TV is $73 per month, it's no longer cheaper than <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ca19dea0-e7ad-4f54-beed-6302bce56589&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hulu&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYTE5ZGVhMC1lN2FkLTRmNTQtYmVlZC02MzAyYmNlNTY1ODkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHVsdS5jb20vbGl2ZS10diIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4In0&amp;signature=AQAAASOsz4gSX7PSfobz14RykoXuU9OPnxuKEPPXAKT0mdHs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Flive-tv\">Hulu + Live TV</a>, which is $70. And if you already subscribe the regular Hulu app, this is definitely the better better choice. Hulu's option gives you live TV streaming, plus all of Hulu\u2019s content, some of which you can't get elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Hulu + Live TV carries your local affiliates and 32 of the top 36 cable channels, which is the same number as YouTube TV. For sports, you get all available ESPN iterations plus FS1, FS2, TBS, USA, TNT, NBC Golf and the NFL Network. You can also add on premium VOD channels like HBO Max and Showtime, and it\u2019s the only provider that includes Disney+ at no extra cost.</p><p>Navigation on Hulu + Live TV isn\u2019t as smooth as most of the other options \u2013 it felt like the live component had been shoehorned into the standard Hulu app. But if you\u2019re already comfortable with (and paying for) Hulu, upgrading to the live TV bundle might be worthwhile.</p><p><strong>YouTube TV</strong></p><ul><li><p>Base plan: $73/mo</p></li><li><p>Local channels: Yes</p></li><li><p>Top cable channels: 32 of 36</p></li><li><p>DVR limits: Unlimited, 9-month expiration</p></li><li><p>Profiles per account: 6</p></li><li><p>Simultaneous at-home streams: 3 (unlimited with upgrade)</p></li><li><p>Picture in picture mode: Yes</p></li></ul><p><strong>Hulu + Live TV</strong></p><ul><li><p>Base plan: $70/mo</p></li><li><p>Local channels: Yes</p></li><li><p>Top cable channels: 32 of 36</p></li><li><p>DVR limits: Unlimited, 9-month expiration</p></li><li><p>Profiles per account:  6</p></li><li><p>Simultaneous at-home streams: 2 (unlimited with upgrade)</p></li><li><p>Picture in picture mode: No</p></li></ul><h2>Best cable without a contract: DirecTV Stream</h2><p></p><p>Canceling cable is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/brooklynninenine/comments/cgt6nq/i_need_you_to_cancel_my_cable/\">no joke</a> \u2013 those contracts are <em>binding</em>. But if you enjoy the serendipity of flipping from one channel to the next and having access to as many networks as possible, <a href=\"https://streamtv.directv.com/\">DirecTV Stream</a> will give you a very similar experience to cable without shackling you to a contract. Like cable, it allows you to jump to the \u201cnext\u201d sequential channel (yes, DirecTV Stream numbers its channels) with a single button press, transforming the left and right d-pad buttons of a smart TV remote into the rocker on a standard clicker.</p><p>It carries all the top 36 cable networks (though Game Show Network and Animal Planet are only available at the second tier and above) and lets you add multiple packages and premiums like Showtime, Starz, AMC+ and Discovery+. You can also add HBO Max, just like on YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, but DirecTV is the only one we tried that lets you add Peacock. Of course, you can always add those apps separately to your smart TV, but for anyone who prefers the all-in-one convenience of cable, it\u2019s a nice perk.</p><p>When you fire up DirecTV Stream, whichever network you last watched automatically starts playing. It continues when you switch over to the guide or other menu pages. If you\u2019re used to the quieter experience of traditional streaming apps (after you turn off <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-06-netflix-autoplay-preview-settings.html\">autoplay</a>), you might find that a little distracting.</p><p>The navigation didn\u2019t feel intuitive, partly because the menu options overlay the currently playing show and because there are so many ways to browse, access and control live, recorded and on-demand entertainment. The search function was the least integrated of the services I tested. Instead of live-suggesting as you type, it forces you to enter your full search term on a separate keyboard interface. Even with that limitation, it found the shows and movies I searched for and accurately presented the upcoming games I wanted just from typing in one of the teams.</p><p>You can\u2019t add new channels or packages through the app, which might be a relief to anyone worried about succumbing to subscription overload. Everyone else may just find it annoying.</p><ul><li><p>Base plan: $75/mo</p></li><li><p>Local channels: Yes</p></li><li><p>Top cable channels: 36 of 36</p></li><li><p>DVR limits: Unlimited, 9-month expiration (maximum of 30 episodes per series)</p></li><li><p>Profiles per account: 1</p></li><li><p>Simultaneous at-home streams: Unlimited</p></li><li><p>Picture in picture mode: No</p></li></ul><h2>Best for live sports: FuboTV</h2><p></p><p>When you first sign up for <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a941868-c063-4b44-9207-896f1fb5891e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=FuboTV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5YTk0MTg2OC1jMDYzLTRiNDQtOTIwNy04OTZmMWZiNTg5MWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnViby50di93ZWxjb21lIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd2jf7G-Y7GYxiqagnhDJbE-y7bjBQ2o8NrishZ2kMs7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fwelcome\">FuboTV</a>, it asks what teams you follow across all kinds of sports. Pick teams from in-season leagues and you\u2019ll quickly have DVR content to watch. That\u2019s because Fubo records every game your teams play as long as it\u2019s aired on a supported channel \u2013 and its sports coverage is vast.</p><p>I tested out a premium subscription and the guide said there were 118 sports networks to choose from. In addition to the usual suspects from ESPN, Fox, NBC and CBS, you can watch motorsports, international leagues, adventure sports and even poker. Add-ons give you NBA TV, NHL Network, NFL Red Zone and MLB Network. And if you need access to all one thousand games the NBA plays in a season, you can add the NBA League Pass to your lineup for $15 per month. FuboTV even has its <em>own</em> sports channels.</p><p>Yes, the coverage is comprehensive, but FuboTV also made finding and recording specific games very easy. Searching for an upcoming game was simple, as was sifting through the ample amount of recorded games I ended up with. I particularly liked FanView for live games, which inserts the video into a smaller window and surrounds that window with continually updating stats plus a clickable list of other games currently airing.</p><p>FuboTV has made an obvious effort to win at sports, but recently it\u2019s tried to deliver on the live TV experience as well. Based on what I've seen so far, it's certainly made strides. The guide was impressive in the number of ways it let you organize live TV, yet everything felt clean and uncluttered. The Home, Sports, Shows and Movies pages were filled with recommendations and many iterations of categories, with almost all suggestions being live TV.</p><p>Where FuboTV falls short is in VOD access and DVR playback. It wasn\u2019t the best at finding the shows I searched for, and navigating available VOD content wasn\u2019t as breezy as browsing through live programming. The lack of a pop-up preview window as you fast forward or rewind through recordings makes it tough to gauge where you are in a show. As for price, FuboTV ties with DirecTV Stream for the most expensive base package at $75. But if you need <em>all</em> the sports \u2013 and want some nicely organized live TV during the few moments when there\u2019s not a game on \u2013 this is the way to go.</p><ul><li><p>Base plan: $75/mo</p></li><li><p>Local channels: Yes</p></li><li><p>Top cable channels: 29 of 36</p></li><li><p>DVR limits: 1000 hours, no expiration</p></li><li><p>Profiles per account: 6</p></li><li><p>Simultaneous at-home streams: 10</p></li><li><p>Picture in picture mode: Yes (Apple TV only)</p></li></ul><h2>Most customizable: Sling TV</h2><p></p><p>To me, the idea of spending time fine-tuning channel choices sounds exhausting.

It breaks its base plan into two packages, Blue and Orange, with different channels on each. Blue, which costs $45 a month, carries a larger number of networks, while Orange seems to have spent its lineup dollars on ESPN and ESPN 2. But at $40 monthly, Sling Orange is the cheapest way to get those two sports outlets.</p><p>After picking a plan, you can choose from a stable of add-on packages, with monthly prices ranging from $6 to $11. These include blocks of sports or lifestyle channels, kid-friendly fare, the Discovery+ bundle and a news package. There are 46 individual premium offerings, including Showtime, Starz, MGM+, Shudder and Acorn, which go for between $2 and $10 per month. Sling has pay-per-view movies, too.</p><p>As far as local coverage, Sling Blue grants access to ABC, Fox and NBC local affiliates in about 20 of the larger US markets including Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, NYC, Miami and DC. ABC coverage began in March 2023, but unfortunately, that raised the price of Sling Blue in supported markets from $40 to $45. For people not in those areas (or who opt for Orange) Sling is currently running a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34c77505-6db4-4664-9320-2c38b4122d5e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sling+TV&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNGM3NzUwNS02ZGI0LTQ2NjQtOTMyMC0yYzM4YjQxMjJkNWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2xpbmcuY29tL3Byb2dyYW1taW5nL2xvY2FsLWNoYW5uZWxzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MGViMzRkYi1jMGZjLTRiZmItYWI0MS0xY2JlOTdmYWZmZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe_a43827fNAzxdGbME6_g1Hxe1vYDxKcViw1EF1Ygsr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fprogramming%2Flocal-channels\">promotion</a> for a free HD antenna to catch local stations.</p><p>Navigation is speedy and the interface is nicely organized, putting an emphasis on what you like to watch, with recommendations that are pretty accurate. The UI also makes the add-ons you\u2019ve chosen easy to find. In my tests, though, the app froze a number of times as I navigated. While most services froze once or twice, it happened enough times with Sling to frustrate me. I had to force quit or back out of the app and start over five or six times during the three weeks of testing. Compared to others, Sling\u2019s DVR allowance is on the stingy side, only giving you 50 hours of recordings, though they won't expire. You can pay for more DVR storage, but that will increase your overall costs.</p><p>I tried not to wander too far off-path during testing, but I feel it\u2019s my duty to inform you that Sling has an Elvis channel, a Bob Ross channel and ALF TV (yes, an entire station devoted to the \u201880s sitcom starring a puppet).

The biggest caveat is that you won\u2019t find any local stations or sports programming on it. If that\u2019s not an issue, Philo is great, with a clean, streamlined interface and generous DVR limits.</p><p>I\u2019m a fan of minimalist design, so I appreciated the way Philo presented its menus and guide. There are just four top navigation headings: Home, Guide, Saved and Search. And instead of the usual guide layout that stretches out or shortens a show\u2019s listing to represent its air time, Philo\u2019s guide features monospaced squares in chronological order with the duration of the program inside the square. Another nice touch is when you navigate to a square, it fills with a live video of the show or movie.</p><p>Philo doesn\u2019t limit the amount of programming you can DVR and lets you keep recordings for a full year, which is more than the nine months other providers allow. Like all live TV streamers, Philo won\u2019t let you fast forward VOD programming. If skipping commercials is important to you, I recommend taking advantage of that unlimited DVR policy and hitting \u201cSave\u201d on any show or movie you think you may want to watch, then fast forwarding it on playback (you can do this with all the services we tried).</p><p>As far as channels, Philo covers 23 of the top 36 cable networks, with notable exceptions including Fox News, CNN, ESPN and MSNBC. Anyone looking for great news coverage should look elsewhere anyway, but the lack of a few must-have entertainment outlets like Bravo and Freeform was a little disappointing.</p><ul><li><p>Base plan: $25/mo.</p></li><li><p>Local channels: No</p></li><li><p>Top cable channels: 23 of 36</p></li><li><p>DVR limits: Unlimited, one year expiration</p></li><li><p>Profiles per account: 10</p></li><li><p>Simultaneous streams: 3</p></li><li><p>Picture in picture mode: Yes (browser only)</p></li></ul>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-21 13:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Where to recycle your used and unwanted gadgets", "description": "<p>For decades now we\u2019ve become accustomed to tossing all sorts of things into the recycling bin, like glass bottles, aluminum cans and cardboard.

Over a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/17/2022-global-smartphone-shipments-were-the-lowest-in-nearly-a-decade/\">billion phones were purchased in 2022</a>, and that\u2019s just <em>one</em> type of gadget. All that electronic waste can have real consequences for the planet, so it\u2019s something you should have on your mind next time you clean out that closet.</p><p>Sure, you can try parting with your stuff for cash, but it can be tough, if not impossible, to find someone who wants a 12-year-old printer or a busted CRT. Few places have curbside pickup \u2014 in fact, some localities make it illegal to leave electronics for the garbage collectors \u2014 so you're going to have to find a reputable center to take it.

You just need to take it to the customer service counter. They'll issue you a receipt too, but keep in mind that you can't claim the drop-off as a deduction on your taxes because Best Buy isn't a charity.</p><p>You can even recycle televisions and monitors, though you'll be charged a fee of $30 per item to cover the higher costs of transporting and disassembling them. (Consumers in California are not charged the $30 fee, while locations in Connecticut and Pennsylvania will not accept televisions or monitors at all.) If you're turning in a printer, you\u2019ll get up to a $50 voucher toward the purchase of a new HP or Epson printer (select models only).</p><p>Also be aware that Best Buy limits you to three items per household per day, including up to two televisions.</p><h3>Staples</h3><p>Recycling your stuff at <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=04b4d26c-bf67-4d60-b2c9-080fa90b8c81&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Staples&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwNGI0ZDI2Yy1iZjY3LTRkNjAtYjJjOS0wODBmYTkwYjhjODEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RhcGxlcy5jb20vZGVhbHMvaXQtcy1yZWN5Y2xpbmctZGF5LWV2ZXJ5LWRheS9CSTMwMDA1OTIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI5ODVkNjg2LWRmZjQtM2M2ZS1hZTU1LTVkNjU2MzU3MDgwZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeqvRkH4-VlfM-tTGnMA5rMIrg7BGfQrN0WMZpqRTZLN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fdeals%2Fit-s-recycling-day-every-day%2FBI3000592\">Staples</a> is similar to Best Buy \u2014 just bring your products to the customer-service counter. But it\u2019s more limited in that you can only bring in seven items a day, and the store won\u2019t accept televisions at all (monitors are allowed).

Ink and toner cartridges can be returned by mail; the company will mail you an envelope that can hold between 3 and 8 ink cartridges and can be dropped off in a mailbox or at the post office. For toner and large quantities of ink cartridges, you can print out a label and use your own box, or request a box be sent directly to you, which you\u2019ll fill with items and drop off at a UPS location.</p><h3>Other manufacturers</h3><p>Many other companies use outside recyclers to dispose of their products, and you'll often see the same names popping up again and again across different manufacturers. This should simplify things in some cases \u2014 you should be able to send in products from multiple sources in one package. You just need to fill in the make and model to generate a prepaid shipping label. However, different states have different rules on what you can return, so the drop-downs for selecting your product may vary by area.</p><p>Two major recycling companies you'll notice a lot are <a href=\"https://rev-log.com/us/\">RLG</a>, which covers Acer, Canon, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft and Motorola, and <a href=\"http://www.mrmrecycling.com/\">MRM</a>, which recycles products for Alcatel, BlackBerry, Barnes &amp; Noble (nook), TCL and Toshiba.</p><h2>Phones</h2><figure><img alt=\"Electronics Recycling\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dimse/5845cadfecd996e0372f/90b679d944c70e394a522f5c24eadeb1dfe6b8a5/cmVzaXplPTIwMDAlMkMyMDAwJTJDc2hyaW5rJmltYWdlX3VyaT1odHRwJTNBJTJGJTJGby5hb2xjZG4uY29tJTJGaHNzJTJGc3RvcmFnZSUyRm1pZGFzJTJGODZlZDY4ZDMwYzFhNmM4NGZhZGJlZTcwMzgzMDFkZjUlMkYyMDYwMjE5NjMlMkZlbGVjdHJvbmljcy1yZWN5Y2xpbmctcGljdHVyZS1pZDYzNjY1NTAwNCZjbGllbnQ9YTFhY2FjM2UxYjMyOTA5MTdkOTImc2lnbmF0dXJlPTg3Y2IyYjYyMzEwMGVjMTBhYTFlNGY4ZTdiOTNjNDZiOTM1NWE1MzE=\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Cell phones are the easiest gadget to recycle \u2014 if you haven't already decided to sell yours off on eBay or via sites like <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=095df20e-ca48-43fe-a821-c8ca385b8c19&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Decluttr&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwOTVkZjIwZS1jYTQ4LTQzZmUtYTgyMS1jOGNhMzg1YjhjMTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVjbHV0dHIuY29tLz8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI5ODVkNjg2LWRmZjQtM2M2ZS1hZTU1LTVkNjU2MzU3MDgwZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbBRiIKEOaR92gQLP0_jwwSwO5DkXr7I2jCOdXTfnyr5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2F%3F\">Decluttr</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ecoatm.com/\">ecoATM</a>.

You'll still get active noise cancellation (ANC), multipoint connectivity and quick pairing for Android and Windows, just with a few slightly toned-down capabilities.</p><p>To start, the Elite 4 offers IP55 dust and water resistance. That's slightly less resilient than the Elite 4 Active's IP57 rating, but should still be good enough for rain or a little sweat. You can expect 5.5 hours of listening versus seven for the Active (22 hours with the case versus 28), and there's no mention of the higher-end model's transparency mode. You'll still find four microphones, though, and aptX support should wring more audio quality out of Bluetooth's limited bandwidth.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Elite 4 is available now. The buds sit in an unusual middle ground between the Elite 4 Active and the truly budget-oriented Elite 3 (normally $80) \u2014 there's only $20 between each model. This is the brand's most affordable true wireless option with ANC, however, and it won't be surprising if sales make this new model more enticing.</p><p>The new entry is arguably a better value than some of the competition. You can't get ANC from Apple without spending much more on the (admittedly very capable) <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html\">AirPods Pro</a>, while Google's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-review-170044941.html\">Pixel Buds Pro</a> are still relatively expensive.

On Tuesday, Adobe revealed its next generation of AI features, a family of generative models the company has collectively dubbed, Firefly \u2014 the first of which will generate both images and font effects.</p><p>\u201cGenerative AI is the next evolution of AI-driven creativity and productivity, transforming the conversation between creator and computer into something more natural, intuitive and powerful,\u201d said David Wadhwani, president, Adobe\u2019s Digital Media Business, said in Tuesday\u2019s release. \u201cWith Firefly, Adobe will bring generative AI-powered \u2018creative ingredients\u2019 directly into customers\u2019 workflows, increasing productivity and creative confidence for all creators from high-end creative professionals to the long tail of the creator economy.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>With it, would-be digital artists are no longer limited by their sub-par dexterity or sheer lack of artistic talent \u2014 they will be able to speak into existence professional-quality illustrations using only the power of their words. And it's not just text-to-image \u2014 Firefly\u2019s multimodal nature means that audio, video, illustrations and 3D models can all be generated via the system and enough verbal gymnastics.&nbsp;</p><p>The first model of the Firefly family is, according to the company, trained on &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; of images from Adobe's Stock photo catalog, openly licensed content and stuff from the public domain, virtually guaranteeing the model won't result in lawsuits as StableDiffusion did with the Getty unpleasantness. It also helps ensure that Stock photographers and artists will be compensated for the use of their works in training these AIs.</p><p>Engadget was afforded a brief preview of the system ahead of Tuesday\u2019s announcement. The input screen, where users will enter their text-based prompt to the system, features a curated selection of generated pieces as well as the prompts that instigated them. These serve to highlight the models generative capabilities and inspire other users to explore the bounds of their machine-assisted creativity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once the user inputs their text prompt (in this case, Adobe\u2019s PR used an adult standing on a beach with a double exposure effect using images derived from Adobe\u2019s Stock photo database), the system will return around a half dozen or so initial image suggestions. From there, the user can select between popular image styles and effects, dictate their own edits to the prompt, collaborate with the AI and generally fiddle with the highly-steerable process until the system spits out what they\u2019re looking for. The resulting image quality was nearly photorealistic, though none of the images from the demo features hands so we weren't able to count fingers for accuracy.</p><p>Initially, the trained image database will be Adobe's own licensed Stock library though the company is looking into allowing individual users to incorporate their own portfolios as well. This should allow photographers with their own established styles to recreate those aesthetics within the model so that what it generates fits in with the user's existing motif. The company did not provide a timeline for when that might happen.</p><p>The first model also has a sibling feature that can create customized font effects and generate wireframe logos based on scanned doodles and sketches. It\u2019s all very cool but could potentially put just an unconscionable number of digital artists out of work if it were to be misappropriated. Adobe\u2019s Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) seeks to prevent that from happening.</p><p>The CAI is Adobe\u2019s attempt to establish some form of ground rules in this new Wild West industry of Silicon Valley. It is a set of proposed industry operating standards that would establish and govern ethical behaviors and transparency in the AI training process. For example, the CAI would create a \u201cdo not train\u201d tag that works in same basic idea as robots.txt does. That tag would be persistent, remaining with the art as it moves through the internet, alerting any who came across it that it was made by a machine. So far around 900 entities worldwide, &quot;including media and tech companies, NGOs, academics and others,&quot; per the release, have signed on to the plan.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/adobe-is-bringing-generative-ai-features-to-photoshop-after-effects-and-premiere-pro-130034491.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/adobe-is-bringing-generative-ai-features-to-photoshop-after-effects-and-premiere-pro-130034491.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-21 13:00:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "ChatGPT briefly went offline after a bug revealed user chat histories", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html\">ChatGPT</a> went offline and temporarily became inaccessible on Monday after some users discovered that they could see the titles of other people's chat histories.

Apple redesigned its entry-level tablet to give it thinner bezels, a bigger display and USB-C charging. It\u2019s also the first iPad to include a landscape-oriented front-facing camera, a feature that makes the tablet more useful for video chatting. The 2022 model\u2019s A14 Bionic processor is also a highlight. Other notable features include USB-C charging and a keyboard folio with function keys.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The main downsides revolve around the price, as this tablet is a full $120 more expensive than its 9th-generation predecessor, the keyboard folio is also expensive and it only supports the first-generation Apple Pencil.

As a bonus, Oppo also brought back a periscopic telephoto camera \u2014 a missing feature since the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-06-oppo-find-x2-pro-hands-on.html\">Find X2 Pro</a> from 2020 \u2014 to make full use of its photopgrahy partnership with Hasselblad, as well as its very own MariSilicon X imaging neural processor.</p><p>The Find X6 Pro features what's arguably the largest external redesign since the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-x3-pro-cameras-122009466.html\">Find X3 Pro</a>, with the three rear cameras \u2014 all with a 50-megapixel resolution plus optical stabilization \u2014 residing within a large circular island. The glass-covered upper part houses the main camera (23mm equivalent), the ultra-wide camera (15mm equivalent), the LED flash and Hasselblad's logo, while the lower part features the periscopic camera with 3x optical zoom (65mm equivalent) or 6x \"in-sensor\" zoom \u2014 we'll get to that later. As for video recording, you can get up to 4K at 60fps, though the 32-megapixel punch-hole selfie camera (21mm equivalent) on the other side is limited to 1080p at 30fps.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Oppo Find X6 Pro\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/ca6cebd0-c7b4-11ed-a739-4394da01eeeb\" style=\"height: 1000; width: 1600;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>While the 3x optical zoom on this new periscopic camera may sound less exciting than the 5x counterpart on the Find X2 Pro, it does offer a 6x \"in-sensor\" zoom. This is thanks to the relatively large Sony IMX890 sensor (1/1.56-inch), which still offers a good amount of pixels even when cropped natively. With a pre-release firmware, I was able to capture impressively clean and sharp shots even at 6x. Of course, any other 10x optical zoom camera would beat this hybrid solution, but this is still a viable alternative, especially given how handy the 3x optical zoom comes in for food photography and the new Hasselblad Portrait Mode \u2014 the latter claiming to simulate \"the colors and depth of field of Hasselblad\u2019s classic XCD30 and XCD80 lenses.\"</p><p>As for the ultra-wide camera, it also uses an IMX890 sensor, which is apparently the largest offering to date in this category. Like before, this camera packs a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-x3-pro-cameras-122009466.html\">freeform surface lens</a> to minimize distortion, along with a relatively large f/2.2 aperture.</p><p>Of course, there are plenty other non-photography goodies on the Find X6 Pro. The 5,000mAh battery is now paired with a new 100W SuperVOOC fast charging, which goes from zero to 100-percent charge in just 28 minutes. Or you can go with 50W AirVOOC wireless charging, which takes 52 minutes to reach a full charge. Oppo also claims to double the battery lifespan with its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oppo-150w-supervooc-oneplus-140004546.html\">Battery Health Engine</a> from last year.</p><p>In addition to the usual stereo speakers, Oppo implemented a design dubbed \"Active Privacy Protection for Voice Calls\" to the earpiece, which is apparently \"capable of improving sound insulation by up to a factor of 3.5 to reduce audio leakage.\" In other words, people stood around you are less likely to eavesdrop on your calls.</p><p>Last but not least, while not all flagship phones come with an infrared remote control, some may still appreciate this feature on the Oppo Find X6 Pro to control things like TVs, air conditioners and lights.</p><figure><img alt=\"Oppo Find X6 Pro\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/aede2c30-c7b4-11ed-bdb7-3dc8b5affb06\" style=\"height: 1000; width: 1600;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Oppo Find X6 Pro will be available in China from March 24th, with design options including a dual-tone brown (glass plus vegan leather), black (glass) and green (glass). Prices range from 5,999 yuan or about $873 (12GB RAM with 256GB storage) to 6,999 yuan or about $1,018 (16GB RAM with 512GB storage).</p><p>There's also a similar-looking but more affordable <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcHBvLmNvbS9jbi9zbWFydHBob25lcy9zZXJpZXMtZmluZC14L2ZpbmQteDYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0M2Y2OGQxZi1mNzRjLTQzODQtYmFiMy00ODIxNzUzMzQzYTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAerDKOR_sMPjlFeR9M05DDbQ5TrtwAYSx7cUIPMlIeVq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oppo.com%2Fcn%2Fsmartphones%2Fseries-find-x%2Ffind-x6%2F\">Find X6</a>, which swaps out the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip with MediaTek's Dimensity 9200. Also, its main camera uses an IMX890 instead of the 1-inch IMX989, whereas its ultra-wide camera uses a Samsung JN1 sensor and, sadly, lacks a freeform lens. That said, this phone still packs a generous 4,800mAh battery with 80W fast charging, and it comes with an IP64 ruggedness rating. It'll be offered in green, gold and black, with prices going from 4,499 yuan or around $654 (12GB RAM with 256GB storage) to 4,999 yuan or about $727 (16GB RAM with 512GB storage).</p><p>We'll be keeping an eye out for international availability, even though it'll likely be limited to Europe for the west.
