Hello and welcome to, TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news! Today we've got some exciting news and something a little special! A full impressions and test of the newest full body tracking solution, STONX! An IMU based tracking system that can provide FBT to any VR headset connected to a PC! BUT, that's not all... HTC Vive just announced the single device that will likely completely change Full Body tracking in the future! THE FIRST INSIDE OUT CAMERA BASED FULL BODY TRACKER! Confirmed to be able to work on all headsets, Quest 2, Vive XR Elite, Pico4, standalone OR SteamVR. Also! We have some pretty interesting news from Pico!
