Alex Jones made a guest appearance in third chair and he did not disappoint. As per usual. </p><p>The big story of the day was Lindsey Graham and other \"conservatives\" salivating at the thought of World War III. That's right, Lindsey Graham actually wants the United States to get further involved in Ukraine. Graham said Vladimir Putin should be in jail, and that the Ukrainians should have F16s. Crowder pointed out that Lockheed Martin, the maker of F16s, is one of the top donors to Lindsey Graham. Woopsies. </p><p>Crowder then went through some more of Lindsey Graham's claims as he tried to justify America's involvement in Ukraine. As you can guess, his claims involved a lot of invoking \"democracy.\" Because as we all know, Ukraine is an absolute bastion of democracy. Crowder also explained that he is not a fan of either Russia or Ukraine, and the war is essentially \"two bags of crap fighting each other,\" and that's why we shouldn't be sending over tons of American dollars.</p><p>Gerald Morgan Jr. also pointed out that the biggest issue is how the war is dragging on so long, and pushed China into the arms of Russia, even though they were previously enemies. And if there were ever a time to take Taiwan, it would be now. Crowder then pointed out how, if you're looking for a solution to the conflict, Gov. DeSantis is your guy, since he recently said becoming further entangled in Ukraine is not one of the United States's vital national interests. Which sparked <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/whitmer-desantis-kremlin\" target=\"_blank\">mass outrage</a>. Of course. </p><p>Apart from the Ukraine drama, Crowder also covered <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-eloise-concerns\" target=\"_blank\">Dylan Mulvaney's</a> role-playing as a six-year-old girl and a trans person identifying as Hitler. Plus of course, some funny sketches sprinkled throughout.

Another source swears it happened before, adding, \u201cthere is someone who is either sh*tting in the aisle, or surreptitiously dumping defecation that they smuggled into the theater.\u201d</p><p>Neither Clinton could be reached for comment.

I hope some of you are sitting home and taking notes. This isn't only happening in his school district. The \"director of equity\" isn't the only one in cahoots with the school board in attempting to silence parents from speaking out. Parents are being encouraged to speak out. They are taking charge at the local level where change happens.</p><p>Every day, more and more parents are becoming leaders in their community. The elites hate it when parents (i.e. voters) do that and are doing everything in their power to silence dissent. It's on ALL OF US to stop them from doing so and amplify the voices who have the stones to speak out.</p><p>If the past few years gace taught us anything, it's that it's us vs. them.
