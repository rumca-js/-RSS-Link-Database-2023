[1] Could we fix this with a mirror?\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nIf I put a static mirror on the front of our house, even on an angled\nmount, it would only send light to the garden for a short period each\nday. To be actually useful, the mirror would need to be dynamic,\ntracking the sun: a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliostat\">heliostat</a>. Since\nthe movement of the sun is well understood you can do this without\nany sensors, just calibration.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWith a bit of looking I found <a href=\"https://www.espaciel.com/en/reflectors/56-garden-reflector.html\">two</a>\n<a href=\"https://lm.solar/heliostats/\">companies</a> selling\nheliostats, though I think the main residential use is bringing more\nlight in through windows and not gardening.  Possibly building\nsomething would be fun, but I'd be nervous about wind loads and\nbreakage filling our own front garden with shards.  Has anyone done a similar\nproject?\n\n</p>\n\n<p> <br />\n\n[1] Boston's latitude is 42&#176;, so the peak height of the sun on the\nequinox is 48&#176; (90&#176;-42&#176;).  The solstices are &#177;\n23&#176; (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt\">axial\ntilt</a>) so at solar noon on the summer solstice it gets up to\n71&#176;.  The house is ~40ft tall so its shadow is always &gt; ~13ft\n(40/tan(71&#176;)).\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02z8SnG7d3W95CxThVksjSqWAkHoQMfvUtoHgEHu1SRRTjwsUHvqDUiAkdGsHF83qvl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/AW6SLqhdJsxy9dHfS\">lesswrong</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/sun-following-garden-mirrors", "date_published": "2023-03-21 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
