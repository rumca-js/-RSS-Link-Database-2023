## Ubisoft Is Using An AI Tool For Writing In Its Games

<p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has developed an AI tool to help narrative designers write barks, according to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxQoN3PFiKA&amp;ab_channel=WormGirl">video presentation</a>. Barks are lines spoken by NPCs after a trigger--such as a change in the environment or character interaction--that help bring the game's world to life. Ubisoft's Ghostwriter AI tool aims to lessen the tedium of writing these quips by providing the narrative team with a first draft of barks.</p><p dir="ltr">How Ghostwriter works is writers create a character and then input "an event or situation" for the character to experience. The tool then generates different variations of a bark, depending on the mode selected. Writers can edit further, and Ghostwriter also learns from each selected line that the writer accepts.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">"Ghostwriter was created hand-in-hand with narrative teams to help them complete a repetitive task more quickly and effectively, giving them more time and freedom to work on games' narrative, characters, and cutscenes," Ubisoft says in its Ghostwriter introduction video.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-using-an-ai-tool-for-writing-in-its-games/1100-6512552/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Mass Effect Andromeda Entered A New Galaxy Only To Revisit Old Conflicts

<p><em>Mass Effect Andromeda is celebrating its 5-year anniversary today, March 21, 2023. Below, we take a look at how the sequel grappled with the complicated legacy of the trilogy that preceded it.<br /></em></p><p dir="ltr">Following up Mass Effect 3's widely derided ending is a bit like trying to write a Star Wars movie that canonically takes place after The Rise of Skywalker. What the hell are you actually supposed to do? Both these franchises seemed to simply avoid the question for a while--BioWare followed ME3 with post-launch DLC and then eventually made a sequel, Mass Effect: Andromeda, and Disney has been working on several Star Wars movies these past few years, some of which are reportedly taking place after the events of Episode 9. Star Wars has the benefit of only exploring a few planets in the movies that exist, leaving plenty of room for these upcoming movies to explore unseen corners of the galaxy after The Rise of Skywalker. Mass Effect, however, isn't as lucky--most of the Milky Way has been seen and explored by the events of Mass Effect 3. As such, Mass Effect: Andromeda went to a different galaxy entirely in its exploration of Mass Effect's future. In theory, this change in setting opens the franchise up to new horizons, but in practice Andromeda feels simultaneously burdened with and ashamed of its past.</p><p dir="ltr">Mass Effect: Andromeda begins sometime in between Mass Effect 2 and 3, with the Andromeda Initiative launching ships to the distant galaxy of the same name. The game then picks up 600 years later, where--upon waking from cryosleep--protagonist Ryder finds that the verdant alien worlds the initiative was supposed to colonize have come under threat during the centuries-long journey. An environmental terror called the Scourge has rendered them inhospitable and a hostile alien race called the Kett has made attempts to find and colonize other planets difficult. As one of several Pathfinders, it is Ryder's job to find a new home for these wayward colonists and discover the galaxy's secrets.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-andromeda-entered-a-new-galaxy-only-to-revisit-old-conflicts/1100-6512548/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Diablo 4 - Rogue Build Guide

<p>The Rogue is one of the most celebrated classes in all of Diablo, and the class has returned for the fourth iteration of the famed ARPG series. Classified as a sneaky and agile character, the Rogue can wield both a melee and ranged weapon in addition to specializing in shadow damage. Because of the Rogue's versatility in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a>, many players are puzzled as to how to properly build out their character.</p><p>In this guide, we will be going over our recommended build guide for the Rogue in Diablo 4 so players can rest easy when they're faced with picking a new skill.</p><h2>Diablo 4 Rogue build guide</h2><p>As mentioned, the Rogue has a few different branches of skills that focus on both melee and ranged weapons. Players can be a close-quarters character that strikes from the shadows and inflicts poison or shadow damage. However, the other route players can take is a long-range character that deals damage with arrows. While you can experiment with either of these specific builds, we feel that the best Rogue in Diablo 4 makes use of skills from both forms of combat.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-rogue-build-guide/1100-6512551/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Last Of Us' Bloater Was Created In Part By Gollum Designer

<p>As it turns out, HBO's The Last of Us TV series is connected--in a way--to the popular The Lord of the Rings series. The connection doesn't stem from an in-game Easter egg or anything like that. But it's come to light that one of the main designers of Gollum from The Lord of the Rings, <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Gino_Acevedo">Gino Acevedo</a>, designed the Bloater from The Last of Us. <strong>This story contains spoilers for The Last of Us.</strong></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/the-last-of-us-gollum-designer-gino-acevedo-bloater-design/">Comicbook.com</a>, Weta FX supervisor Simon Jung said Acevedo was "heavily involved" in bringing the Bloater to life. "He figured out all the proportions and some of the growths," Jung said.</p><p>Acevedo worked off reference materials from the video game and elements from the prosthetic suit that the actor who played the Bloater was wearing.

## Diablo 4 Wants You To Take A Closer Look At Evil

<p dir="ltr">The dungeon crawler genre that Diablo helped to trailblaze is not known for getting up close and personal with its characters. The overhead perspective and point-and-click control scheme have lent us a role as dispassionate observers, watching a diorama of mankind's struggle against the hordes of Hell. Diablo IV is different. It pulls you in close and demands you take a front-row seat, and it makes a massive difference in how the game feels and plays.</p><p dir="ltr">This is most immediately apparent in one of the earliest cutscenes featuring your hero. After doing the heroic thing and clearing out a dungeon full of demons, you return to a small village that asks to celebrate with a good drink. The camera pulls in close to watch as your created character, looking just as well-crafted as any of the NPCs, grows dizzy and passes out. The crowd murmurs and quiets itself, another villager comes prepared with a stretcher, and you quickly get the sense that this was always the plan.</p><p dir="ltr">The opening twist helps to illustrate something core about this story: More than other Diablo games, humanity itself is a central threat. From the very first scene, Lillith represents unchecked temptation. From a scholar who reluctantly agrees to fulfill a summoning ritual to a group of bloodthirsty villagers caving in the skull of their local priest, the villain in this game has a way of turning people toward their worst impulses and excesses. This doesn't appear to be the story of humanity heroically rising up against demonic hordes with you as their avatar. Humans are greedy, violent, selfish creatures, and that relatable element drives the horror home that much more. The closer camera angles in the cutscenes featuring your created character help serve as the connective tissue to the other cinematic scenes featuring Lillith.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-wants-you-to-take-a-closer-look-at-evil/1100-6512547/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">For the first time since the release of Lightfall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Iron Banner mode is live. This limited-time PvP mode brings with it some adjustments to how it's worked in the past, but it's by and large the standard Iron Banner experience, complete with familiar rewards and reputation gains. Here's what to expect from now until March 28, when the mode leaves with the weekly reset.</p><p dir="ltr">One key thing to know: An issue is currently causing the mode's weekly challenge to not appear. Normally, completing a certain number of Iron Banner matches will contribute toward earning a Pinnacle reward (a critical part of increasing your Power level past 1800), but Bungie has <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1638234609275248640">acknowledged</a> the associated challenge is not showing up in-game. As such, you may want to hold off before investing too much time in Iron Banner.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Iron Banner game mode</h2><p dir="ltr">For this first of three Iron Banner events during Season of Defiance, the game mode is Iron Banner Control. Eruption will follow during Week 6 (which is now just two weeks away--this first event was delayed due to the invisible player bug), while Fortress will be available during Week 9. Bungie says future seasons may introduce other new Iron Banner mode variations, but none of those will pop up this season. Iron Banner Control plays out much like the standard Control mode, except that capturing all three zones temporarily locks them down and allows you to earn bonus points for hunting down the enemy team.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-iron-banner-is-live-rewards-challenges-and-how-to-maximize-reputation/1100-6512545/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## WoW: Dragonflight's Turbulent Timeways Event Is An Easy Way To Score Some Great Loot

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a>: Dragonflight is taking players back to the past with its Turbulent Timeways event, and Blizzard is sweetening the timewalking pot with higher-than-normal-item level rewards to boot.</p><p dir="ltr">Timewalking events have been a core part of WoW's event schedule for years. Normally, every two weeks, dungeons from an old expansion are featured alongside a weekly quest to complete five scaled-up timewalking dungeons. That quest usually grants a raid-quality item, making it an easy way to gear up. Players also earn loot from the dungeons themselves, alongside timewarped badges, which can then be exchanged at certain vendors for unique mounts, toys, and transmog items.</p><p dir="ltr">Turbulent Timeways, however, is upping the ante. In addition to having a timewalking event active every week for six weeks in a row, the weekly quest reward will grant a Heroic raid-quality item between item levels 402-411. That will make running the weekly event every week extremely lucrative, especially for players who have alternate characters that might not be as geared out as their main.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-turbulent-timeways-event-is-an-easy-way-to-score-some-great-loot/1100-6512541/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Last Of Us Part 1 Gets More PC Features

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us Part 1</a> developer Naughty Dog has detailed several other features that the game will have on PC. For those of you with a high-end gaming setup, you'll be able to play the game with an unlocked frame rate, but if your PC isn't up to the task, there'll be support for AMD FSR 2 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-redfall-and-forza-horizon-5-are-getting-nvidia-dlss-3-support/1100-6512397/">Nvidia DLSS</a>. This will help you get as much mileage as possible from your graphics card, as these two upscaling technologies can produce sharp image quality and boost frame rates in supported games.</p><div>          </div><p>If you're looking for a challenge, you'll be able to increase the tension with permadeath and speedrun modes. Permadeath does what it says on the box, as one wrong move can lead to you starting the game all over again, losing all the progress that you'd made up to that point. In the PlayStation version of the remake, Permadeath mode could be customized so that the whole game will reset on death, to the beginning of an act--around two to three hours of game time on average--and the more forgiving option of resetting the beginning of the chapter on death.</p><p>For speedrunners, the new mode will test just how quickly you can complete the game. So far the fastest time posted is <a href="https://youtu.be/0ab-EmTuhGA">under three hours</a>, which was achieved eight months ago by AnthonyCaliber.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1-gets-more-pc-features/1100-6512536/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Additionally, their online services will shut down on December 8.</p><p>"While these titles hold a special place in our heart, we’re now looking forward to creating new memories alongside you as we shift our focus towards our current and future Battlefield experiences," reads a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/legacy-sunset">statement on EA's website</a>. "And while not a Battlefield title, many of us who work on Battlefield have also been part of the development of Mirror’s Edge. We look back fondly on Faith as an iconic character, and her parkour-style gameplay."</p><p>While these games will soon no longer be able to be purchased, offline features such as single-player campaigns will still be playable for Bad Company 1 &amp; 2 and Mirror's Edge after December 8. Battlefield 1943 is an online-only multiplayer game, so after the date has passed, it will be unplayable.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-is-delisting-mirrors-edge-and-several-battlefield-games-in-april-servers-shutting-down/1100-6512537/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Ciaran Hinds Didn't Like All The Sex In Game Of Thrones, Wanted More Politics

<p>Actor Cirian Hinds, who played Mance Rayder in HBO's hit fantasy series Game of Thrones, has commented that he felt "put off" by how much sex was in the show. Speaking to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/ciaran-hinds-interview-dry-daughter-aoife-b2301440.html">The Independent</a>, Hinds said all lovemaking took away from what he believed makes the show great: politics.</p><p>"I was rather put off by the amount of sexuality that was going on in it, because it was taking away from the actual political storytelling," Hinds said (<a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/ciaran-hinds-hates-game-of-thrones-sex-scenes-1235560310/">via Variety</a>). "But that's business, I guess, from their perspective."</p><p>Hinds is joining another mega-popular fantasy series, as he recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rings-of-power-adds-game-of-thrones-star-wars-and-james-bond-actors-for-season-2/1100-6512497/">signed on to appear in The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.</a></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ciaran-hinds-didnt-like-all-the-sex-in-game-of-thrones-wanted-more-politics/1100-6512534/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## How To Not Suck With Fortnite's Kinetic Blade

<p>Fortnite Chapter 4 began by introducing the beloved Shockwave Hammer in Season 1, and now Season 2 has swapped that blunt instrument for a more elegant weapon: the Kinetic Blade katana. This thing is incredible, and, like the hammer before it, will very often be the deciding factor between victory and defeat this season.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a big difference between being just decent with the Kinetic Blade and being great with it. Anybody can spam the yeet attack and get lucky sometimes, but once you actually know what you're doing with the katana--meaning you know not just <em>how</em> to use it but also <em>when</em>--then you'll be slashing and throwing your foes all over the place in no time. Fortunately, you don't have to do this on your own. Below you'll find a complete breakdown of this weapon, from our full explanation of the mechanics down to the combat scenarios in which you'll need to pull it out.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How exactly the Kinetic Blade works</h2><p dir="ltr">The Kinetic Blade fills the same niche that the hammer did, as a tool for quick movement that also has some serious combat capabilities when used correctly and in the right situations. But in more literal terms, the Kinetic Blade is a whole new gameplay mechanic that doesn't work like the hammer did at all, really. So we're all starting fresh with this thing, which requires a bit more finesse than the hammer did.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-not-suck-with-fortnites-kinetic-blade/1100-6512469/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Developer Tindalos Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/aliens-dark-descent/">Aliens: Dark Descent</a> will officially launch on June 20 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aliens-dark-descent-announced-at-summer-game-fest-coming-2023/1100-6504355/">Revealed last year at Summer Game Fest Live</a>, Aliens: Dark Descent is a real-time tactical action game that features an original story set in the Alien universe. You can see more in the gameplay trailer below, via <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/aliens-dark-descent-exclusive-gameplay-release-date-trailer">IGN</a>.</p><div>          </div><p>As the commander of a squad of Colonial Marines, you'll be tasked with investigating a colony that has gone dark after a sinister uprising broke out. Now crawling with Xenomorphs, rebels, and dangerous levels of ceiling saliva, you'll have to direct your soldiers in battle using a "fluid" control system, according to Tindalos.</p><p>With your squad moving as one unit, any command issued is carried out by the marine best equipped for the task. When in combat, time can be slowed down to a crawl and gives you just enough time to issue orders quickly and precisely. You'll still want to tread carefully, as Dark Descent features its own permadeath system and there's no shortage of danger in each level. Outside of battle, you'll be able to level up your troopers with perks and gear, customize their loadouts, and equip your marines with signature weapons from the Alien films.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aliens-dark-descent-launches-june-20-on-console-and-pc/1100-6512533/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Blizzard Boss Explains And Defends Diablo 4 Server Queues

<p>Diablo IV players experienced server queues during the recent early access beta, and Blizzard boss Rod Fergusson has explained why they happened and why they are sometimes necessary. For context, server queues on the first day of the Diablo IV early access beta could be upwards of two hours, but by the end of the first weekend, server queues were practically nonexistent. </p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beta-has-become-a-twisted-word-blizzard-responds-to-diablo-4-early-access-feedback">Speaking to Eurogamer</a>, Fergusson said it would be ideal if there were no server queues whatsoever, but that is not always possible nor may it always be in the best interest of the game. Fergusson explained that sometimes server queues are due to high demand, but other times, queues are put in place even when a game's servers are not at capacity to help with specific subsets of a game.</p><p>"Sometimes you'll put a queue in place just so that if there's one particular service--like writing to the database--that you're trying to not overwhelm, you'll add to the queue to say, 'Hey let's just slow down a little bit while we fix this or look at it,'" Fergusson said. "So it's not always just availability of space. Sometimes something's being investigated, or you're trying to manage pressure on one particular thing until you can reinforce it."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-boss-explains-and-defends-diablo-4-server-queues/1100-6512532/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Microsoft's Response To CMA Questions Details Potential Remedies And More

<p dir="ltr">Over the past few weeks, Microsoft and other parties have filed documents with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority as the regulator determines its ruling on the proposed Microsoft-Activision Blizzard merger. On March 21, Microsoft <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6418811b8fa8f547c1112371/Microsoft_s_supplemental_response_to_the_notice_of_possible_remedies.pdf">filed</a> supplemental answers to the regulator's questions, which include potential remedies based around the Call of Duty series--a key part of the proceedings. The CMA recently moved its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/microsoft-offers-eu-remedies-seeking-ok-activision-deal-2023-03-17/">deadline</a> to make its final decision on the deal from April 25 to May 22.</p><p dir="ltr">The document begins with Microsoft reiterating that it does not want to make Call of Duty exclusive to the Xbox platform. Microsoft proposes two possible remedies to the CMA's concerns: a publishing agreement between Sony and Microsoft that would keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years, and a cloud gaming deal that would give worldwide licenses to consumers and cloud gaming providers to stream Activision PC games that they own. The filing notes that major cloud gaming company Nvidia supports this deal.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the details of Microsoft and Sony's proposed deals are redacted from the public document. However, the filing does state that Microsoft would apply <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-worries-microsoft-could-make-call-of-duty-exclusive-to-game-pass/1100-6512402/">this remedy</a> to the PS4, PS5, and any "successor consoles." Microsoft further states that it has "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-absolutely-no-financial-incentive-to-remove-call-of-duty-from-playstation/1100-6512420/">no incentive</a>, or indeed ability, to take Call of Duty exclusive." The Xbox owner also says that the remedy will give PlayStation parity on release date, in terms of "content, features, upgrades, quality, and playability."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-response-to-cma-questions-details-potential-remedies-and-more/1100-6512531/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns director Jake Solomon is planning to form a new studio, but don't expect it to make strategy games like Firaxis did. Speaking on Simon Parkin's <a href="https://linktr.ee/myperfectconsole">My Perfect Console podcast</a> this week (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xcoms-jake-solomon-is-forming-a-new-studio-and-likely-wont-make-a-turn-based-game/">VGC</a>), Solomon said that he doesn't feel like he has "anything more to say" when it comes to turn-based strategy and is instead excited by the prospect of working in a different genre.</p><p>"I found that I wasn’t that excited about doing another turn-based strategy game, not because the genre isn’t amazing--it's where I’ve spent my life--but I felt like I didn't have anything more to say in that area," Solomon said. "So I started thinking, what would I do if I wasn’t making this? If I wasn’t making another turn-based strategy game at Firaxis? And I started to get excited. There are other things that excite me as a designer, and the idea of starting something new was really exciting to me."</p><p>Solomon said that he would like to make a simulation title, one that will have a "systems-based" design as those elements are important to him. "System design is important to me, so I want to make a systems-based game," Solomon explained. "I think it won't be turn-based strategy. I want to make something that's more of a life simulator or a simulation-style game. That’s the plan."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xcom-director-jake-solomon-plans-to-form-a-new-studio-first-game-likely-wont-be-a-strategy-title/1100-6512530/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">A Canadian judge has dismissed a plaintiff's claim that the loot boxes in EA games are a form of illegal gambling. However, Judge Justice Fleming will allow the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-is-being-sued-in-canada-over-loot-boxes/1100-6483575/">class-action suit</a> to continue under the accusation that the loot boxes are a form of "deceptive acts or practices."</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/canada-judge-rejects-unlawful-gambling-accusation-in-ea-loot-box-lawsuit">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, plaintiff Mark Sutherland accused Electronic Arts of engaging in gambling, which is illegal in British Columbia. However, Judge Justice Fleming ruled that loot boxes are not a form of gaming because they cannot be sold or exchanged for real-world value by a consumer. Based on this fact, the judge then struck that claim from the suit, ruling that it had no reasonable chance of success.</p><p dir="ltr">"Consequently, there is no prospect of gaining, or losing, anything with a real-world value through the defendants’ in-house auctions," the judge said. "Unlike a casino chip, virtual currency and virtual items in loot boxes can never be 'cashed out' to gain money."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/canadian-judge-dismisses-ea-loot-box-gambling-claim-but-suit-will-continue/1100-6512529/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
