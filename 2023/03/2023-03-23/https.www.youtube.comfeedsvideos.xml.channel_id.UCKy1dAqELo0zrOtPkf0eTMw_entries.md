## The Mandalorian Chapter 20: How Grogu’s Order 66 Rescuer Came From a Kids’ Game Show | Star Wars Can

The Mandalorian Chapter 20 surprised viewers by finally revealing the Jedi master who saved baby Grogu from Darth Vader’s attack on the Jedi Temple in Revenge of the Sith – Jedi Master Kelleran Beq, played by Jar Jar Binks actor Ahmed Best. Kelleran Beq first appeared in the Star Wars kids’ game show Jedi Temple Challenge and appears in a Grogu Order 66 flashback showing how Beq fought fiercely to get the child to safety. So how did Kelleran Beq go from kids’ game show host on Star Wars Jedi Temple Challenge to the rescuer of the literal future of Star Wars? Join IGN host Max Scoville for the full breakdown on Star Wars Canon Fodder. 

Ahmed Best is perhaps best known for his role as Jar Jar Binks in the Star Wars prequel films, but he gets a major chance at redemption in his return as Kelleran Beq. So if you’re wondering who is Kelleran Beq, he’s the Jedi who rescued Grogu from Order 66. And if you’re also wondering is Jedi Temple Challenge canon, the answer is…kind of. The Star Wars game show uses a canon character (Kelleran Beq) to tell the non-canon stories in the series. 

Star Wars has shown us many angles of Order 66 at this point, and this time Kelleran Beq Mandalorian is the next Ahmed Best Star Wars and Ahmed Best Mandalorian character you need to know about. Also don’t forget Bo Katan Kryze and her whole Mythosaur situation. We’ve got the Easter Eggs and Star Wars explained.

Twelve Years after the doors of the 3DS and Wii U eShop opened, they are sadly closing for good. Nintendo has announced that on March 27th, 2023, it will no longer be possible to purchase games digitally from that generation of video game consoles. But for months now, it’s been impossible to buy anything ever since they revoked the ability to directly add funds to your account, so we shouldn’t care about this announcement, right? Well, turns out there’s a completely valid way Nintendo has allowed for you to still add funds to your account, and it’s super simple to do. So here is how you can still buy Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Wii U games before they are gone forever–plus some game recommendations in case you don’t know what to get.

The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners – Chapter 2: Retribution reviewed by Gabriel Moss on PS VR2, also available on PC and Meta Quest 2.

It sucks that this sequel's PlayStation VR2 rerelease is still unacceptably janky despite major performance and graphical improvements, but when its bugs aren’t driving you to quit in anger, its moment-to-moment action is undeniably improved over the stealth-oriented original. Moreover, the PS VR2’s impressive detail, haptic feedback, and all-new dynamic lighting systems mixed with the low black point of the headset’s OLED panels give way to a spooky atmosphere that transports you directly into the zombie apocalypse, making it well worth the hassle.

## Did The Rock Block a Shazam Cameo in Black Adam? Zachary Levi Responds - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

It seems like The Rock might’ve been responsible for the Black Adam, Shazam crossover never happening. And Shazam star Zachary Levi might’ve just confirmed it to be true. According to The Wrap, Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson apparently vetoed a Black Adam post-credit scene that would’ve featured Shazam. And he went even further by denying access to Black Adam’s Justice Society from appearing in Shazam! Fury of the Gods in a post-credits scene the filmmakers had intended. This was all supposedly going to lead up to Black Adam and Shazam eventually clashing and going up against each other. Which makes sense, because the two characters have long been linked to one another in the DC Universe, with Black Adam serving as the villain to Captain Marvel AKA Shazam. Peter Safran and James Gunn have other plans for the #DCU, so we’ll see what becomes of Shazam after #Shazam2. The Netflix Gears of War movie has found a writer, and The Flash movie gets a rather surprising yet predictable rating.

On today's Daily Fix:
Valve made a surprise announcement this morning, revealing Counter-Strike 2 with a release window of this summer. The game will be available for free as an update to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and yes, all your items from that game will carry over to CS 2. In other shooter news, the always online requirement for Redfall may not be thing if the devs can come up with a fix. The game's director has listened to feedback and assured players that a fix is coming, but it may not make it in time for the game's release. And finally, Ubisoft has unveiled an AI tool to help developers handle smaller writing duties. It's been met with side-eyed skepticism online. What do you think? Let us know in the comments!
