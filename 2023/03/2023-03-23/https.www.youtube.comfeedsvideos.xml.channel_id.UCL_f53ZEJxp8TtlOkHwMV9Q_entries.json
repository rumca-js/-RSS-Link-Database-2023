Peterson and Sara Stockton explore her past as a clinician in the field of Transgender care, how she helped co-author the processes by which gender-dysphoric children are assessed for medical intervention, and why she wholeheartedly regrets it now.\n\nSara Stockton is a licensed marriage and family therapist, lecturer, researcher, presenter, and clinical supervisor of a psychotherapy group practice in Central New York. In 2012, she co-authored and published one of the first mental health assessments utilized to assess youth's readiness to begin medical treatment for gender transition. She spent the first part of her career as a clinician treating and advocating on behalf of youth and families surrounding issues with gender. Furthermore, she spent time traveling to teach medical facilities, physicians, and schools how to provide what we now refer to as \u201cgender-confirming\u201d care. Treating well over one hundred families, she also wrote many of the first letters that were used to approve gender transition surgeries on minors. However, due to many concerns with the treatment outcomes and how this ideology was being presented to children, she shifted her focus away from working primarily with this population. More recently, Sara Stockton was interviewed for a documentary to discuss some of the implications of what is happening developmentally to our children. Since appearing in that documentary, Sara Stockton receives constant emails and calls from medical professionals across the globe sharing their fears about speaking out and the lack of conversation around this serious topic.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsor -\n\nGenucel: Use code \"JORDAN\" at checkout for additional savings on your entire purchase! https://genucel.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Sara Stockton:\n\nOn Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrsSaraStockton \n\nAisling Therapy: https://www.aislingtherapy.com/ \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:50) Intro\n(3:24) Sara\u2019s background\n(6:09) Transgender teams \n(9:48) Two factors in gender-dysphoria\n(11:28) Lack of teaching\n(12:50) Body integrity disorder\n(14:50) Simplistic assumptions\n(15:52) Ken Zucker, clear outcomes\n(17:30) First assessments, future expectations\n(21:40) The snake pit, multi-dimensional analysis\n(23:32) Three sessions are all it takes\n(26:30) Chloe Cole: fantasy and lies\n(31:05) Four steps, no treatment\n(32:40) Meeting her first De-Transitioner\n(33:45) Tehran, bizarre ethics\n(34:50) A shallow surgical fix\n(37:28) Trans-Age, deadnaming\n(40:34) Why Sara speaks out\n(45:32) Disorienting our children\n(47:45) Misgendering considered bullying?\n(51:00) Standards of care, five senses\n(57:03) Subjective identity by the day\n(59:29) When your child dresses up to play\n(1:03:55) \u201cValid long-term studies\u201d\n(1:07:00) Hysteria and cultural redefinition\n(1:09:44) Psychogenic epidemics\n(1:13:13) Counterclaims on variability\n(1:15:13) Intense body modification\n(1:19:40) The kind of people attracted to this industry\n(1:22:30) Munchausen by proxy\n(1:26:27) Oedipal narcissism\n(1:27:33) Desantis, Disney, the \u201cLGBT agenda\u201d\n(1:30:53) A mostly white problem\n(1:31:47) Radical freedom of choice\n(1:33:34) Furries and human sacrifice\n(1:36:30) Words of caution to therapists \n(1:39:05) Why we need to stand up now\n\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCH-bUFR3WM", "date_published": "2023-03-23 15:00:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
