However, if you\u2019ve never experienced the game and you have access to an Xbox but not a PC, this version of Valheim is definitely worth checking out. It has feature and content parity with the PC version, crossplay support, and the unparalleled sense of adventure and discovery that the original game has. \n\nBoth versions are also still in Early Access, so they will benefit from ongoing updates, improvements, and expansions. If you\u2019re also an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, Valheim is available through that subscription on console just as it is on PC, which makes it a no-brainer for users of that service.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T67HWjOT3A", "date_published": "2023-03-23 13:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
