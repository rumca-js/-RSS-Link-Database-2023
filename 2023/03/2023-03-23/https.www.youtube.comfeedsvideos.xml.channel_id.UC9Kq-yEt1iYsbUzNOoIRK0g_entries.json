But before that kicks into gear, there are still a few projects that need to be released\u2026 since they were already made. One of those is Shazam! Fury of the Gods! A movie that exists and that has bombed at the box office (Maybe because James Gunn indirectly told people that it doesn\u2019t really matter? Or maybe because Dwayne Johnson stole away its main antagonist? Who knows!)\n\nShazam! Fury of the Gods definitely raises some questions. Like why isn\u2019t Black Adam in this thing? Why did that 6,000 year old fall in love with a high school kid? How much did Skittles pay for that product placement? Can Wonder Woman resurrect people now?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Shazam! Fury of the Gods.\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nVelma Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4K_sxI5Ui8\n\nShazam!
