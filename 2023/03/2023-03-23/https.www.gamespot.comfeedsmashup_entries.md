<p>Two former Nintendo employees have shared their thoughts on why they believe Nintendo is unlikely to ever release an HD version of the popular mascot brawler Super Smash Bros. Melee. Krysta Yang and Kit Ellis left Nintendo in 2022 after numerous years with the company, later establishing a podcast where they discuss a variety of video game industry topics.</p><p>On their latest episode, Ellis said a hypothetical Melee HD "makes a lot of sense," but also remarked that "it's never going to happen." Yang added, "It's absolutely 100% never going to happen."</p><div>          </div><p>Yang went on to say that Melee is surrounded by "negative things" that she believes Nintendo would not want to go anywhere near, like black market emulation and "all this other stuff that Nintendo does not like."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-these-ex-nintendo-employees-think-super-smash-bros-melee-hd-will-never-happen/1100-6512664/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Egerton told <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/taron-egerton-interview-james-bond-tetris-dieting/">The Telegraph</a> (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/taron-egerton-weight-james-bond-1235356897/">via The Hollywood Reporter</a>), "I don't think I'm the right choice for it," due in part to the demand on the actor to be physically fit for a long time.</p><p>"You have to be consistently statuesque to be that guy. And that's something that I am still striving for. I've always struggled with my weight," he said.</p><p>Egerton said when is considering offers for a new role, he factors in how much gym time would be required and makes his decision based in part on that. Playing James Bond is more than just playing the character, it's like "being a brand ambassador as well as being an actor," he said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-actor-taron-egerton-explains-why-it-wont-be-him/1100-6512661/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">With April approaching, Prime Video is preparing to reveal an exciting lineup of fresh content. Fans can look forward to new TV shows and movies, with specific titles scheduled to premiere as early as April 1, while others will become available later in the month.</p><p dir="ltr">The final season of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel comes to Prime Video on April 14. The show takes us back to the late 1950s, where Miriam "Midge" Maisel seemingly has it all--a happy marriage, children, and a beautiful apartment on the Upper West Side. But when she discovers her natural talent for stand-up comedy, her picture-perfect life takes an unexpected turn. In the previous season, Midge struggled to revive her career and faced numerous obstacles, including a Daily News critic, a jealous rival, and the police raiding the strip club where she was working. But with the help of Lenny Bruce, she is poised to make a comeback in Season 5.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr"><span>On April 7, Jury Duty comes to Prime Video. The docu-style comedy series, as its name suggests, is about an American jury trial from the perspective of one particular juror, Ronald Gladden. Unbeknownst to Gladden, the entire case is fake and everyone except him is an actor. The series is executive produced by a team of producers, including David Bernad, Lee Eisenberg, Ruben Fleischer, Cody Heller, and Gene Stupnitsky, with Eisenberg and Stupnitsky co-creating the series and Heller serving as showrunner. James Marsden stars alongside a cast of comedic actors.</span></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-prime-video-in-april-2023-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-season-5-jury-duty/1100-6512662/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Have you been roaming the corridors of a dungeon in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-guides-hub/1100-6512481/">Diablo 4 beta</a> and suddenly been attacked by a giant, hulking enemy that smashed you to pieces within a few seconds? If so, then you were likely just graced by the presence of <strong>The Butcher</strong>, an infamous enemy in the Diablo universe. The Butcher first made an appearance in the original Diablo game as the main boss in a quest simply titled "The Butcher." Fans instantly loved to hate The Butcher due to its giant cleaver that could instantly deplete anyone's health bar and its enormous amount of HP.</p><p>Since the first Diablo, The Butcher has appeared in Diablo 3 as a part of an Anniversary Dungeon and now in Diablo 4 as a deadly encounter. If you want to learn how to find and beat The Butcher in Diablo 4, check out the guide below.</p><h2>Finding The Butcher</h2><p>At the time of writing, there's not much known about The Butcher's mechanics in Diablo 4, as we're still only in the beta. However, from what we can gather, The Butcher appears to be a random encounter in dungeons throughout Fractured Peaks. You will know when you have been graced by The Butcher if you see a giant enemy running at you yelling the phrase, "Fresh meat!"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-butcher-spawn-locations/1100-6512663/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The countdown to the Resident Evil 4 remake continues with a third episode of the lovely and genius Resident Evil anime, created as promo for the game's launch.</p><p dir="ltr">In episode three, Leon and Ashley continue their peaceful adventures in the village--but this time it gets a little surreal. They ask a kind old man to build them a vehicle, and then while waiting, a bunch of villagers and monsters kill them. Leon and Ashley's souls ascend to heaven, and the old man, who has apparently built a helicopter, crashes into their spirits--resulting in an explosion and the familiar "You are dead" screen.</p><p dir="ltr">The helicopter is really amazing, since it can apparently touch the souls of the deceased. But also this specific sequence of events does not happen in the game--though perhaps the episode is a nod to the long-running joke about helicopters' high death rate in Resident Evil games.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-animes-third-episode-continues-to-celebrate-ways-of-achieving-you-are-dead/1100-6512658/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2: Lightfall Update Nerfs Those Deadly Cabal Threshers

<p>This week's update for Destiny 2 addresses a number of issues in the game, from raid and dungeon bugs to armor mods not activating correctly, but the biggest fix here is a nerf to the deadly Cabal Threshers, according to the patch notes. Those heavily armed Cabal gunships have been a terror in the Terminal Overload activity since Lightfall began, as they're able to unleash a barrage of missiles that can wipe a Guardian out almost instantly, making them deadlier than an angry Tormentor on Legend difficulty.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-2-hotfix-7-0-0-6">Bungie's update</a> simply mentions that Cabal Threshers were doing more damage than intended, dealing with one of those hovering death machines should be more balanced now. For raid players, the Root of Nightmares activity has had several fixes applied to it. Locked red border chests, issues with Focused Light and Focused Darkness not triggering during the Zo'aurc encounter, and raid mods being equippable without being earned have all been fixed.</p><p>Unfortunately, fans of The Colony Exotic grenade launcher will also discover that their robot spider minions will no longer slip through the shields of Sunblight enemies. "Those clever little spiders have been reprimanded one more time," Bungie added.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-update-nerfs-those-deadly-cabal-threshers/1100-6512656/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">We don't know a lot about the as yet untitled Star Wars FPS game that Respawn is working on, but it's apparently going to take cues from the classics. New job listings on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/11z9fb4/respawns_untitled_star_wars_fps_game_could_be/">LinkedIn</a> outright state that the FPS will be "inspired by classic titles like Dark Forces and Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2."</p><p dir="ltr">The Dark Forces games (which later evolved into the Jedi Knight series) are generally regarded as some of the stronger titles in the wider world of Star Wars video games. The original title, Star Wars: Dark Forces, released in 1995, and shares many qualities in common with the original Doom. Its sequel, Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight, brought Quake-esque 3D graphics to the mix, as well as a lightsaber. The last entry in the Jedi Knight series, Jedi Academy, came out in 2003 to wide acclaim. The original Dark Forces was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-dark-forces-gets-fan-made-4k-remaster/1100-6510182/">remade</a> by one fan to be more easily playable on modern computers.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a large number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/1100-6499936/">Star Wars games</a> currently in the works, as Disney reportedly looks to release two new games every fiscal year. In addition to this unnamed FPS, Respawn is also working on the highly anticipated Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the follow-up to Fallen Order, one of the best Star Wars games in years. Detroit: Become Human developer Quantic Dream is working on a project called Star Wars Eclipse, and Bit Reactor is making a Star Wars strategy game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawns-star-wars-fps-is-inspired-by-classic-dark-forces-series/1100-6512654/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

It's also not tied to a specific console like Kinect; Nex just needs to be plugged into your TV to work.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://playground.nex.inc/">Nex Playground</a> is not out yet, and a preorder date will be announced in June 2023. Nex plans to ship the first units during holiday 2023, so at the very earliest, people won't be able to get their hands on the device until late this year.</p><p dir="ltr">30 games will also accompany the device's launch, as well as an Active Pass--a subscription that will give users access to all the games. From a glance at Nex's product page, some of the games are Peppa Pig Jump and Giggle, a juggling game (Juglr), and Party Fowl. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=team.nex.party&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Party Fowl</a> and a few other games for Nex Playground already exist as mobile games developed by Nex.

<p>A new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is in development, but don't expect this return of the half-shell heroes to be a light-hearted adventure. Speaking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23645176/tmnt-last-ronin-video-game-graphic-novel-ninja-turtles">Polygon</a>, Paramount Global games and emerging media senior-VP Doug Rosen revealed that the IDW TMNT comic book series The Last Ronin is being adapted, and is partly inspired by Sony's recent God of War games.</p><p>The Last Ronin is a grim TMNT story, one that takes place in a future where Michelangelo is the last remaining turtle brother, and now fights the Foot Clan while wielding the weapons of his fallen siblings. Master Splinter has also died, New York is ruled by a Foot Clan led by Shredder's grandson, and the planet is in a bad state thanks to years of global pollution. It's not exactly the kind of storyline you'd see on a Saturday morning cartoon.</p><figure style="width: 928px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4116055-last-ronin-2.jpg"><img alt="The Last Ronin" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4116055-last-ronin-2.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The Last Ronin</figcaption></figure><p>Rosen added that The Last Ronin will be primarily a single-character game, although other characters could be playable in flashback sequences. The Last Ronin was published back in 2020 and ran for five issues, and was followed up by another limited series in 2022 titled The Lost Years.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-last-ronin-becoming-a-game-inspired-by-god-of-war/1100-6512649/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Developer Gunfire Games has shared a brand-new look at Remnant 2 in a 9-minute gameplay video, which explores a new environment and several class Archetypes.</p><p>The pre-alpha gameplay features Yaesha, a swampy jungle-like area and one of many environments the player will explore in Remnant 2. In the first segment, the footage shows the player in The Forbidden Grove while using the Handler class, which allows the player a dog companion that can be directed to take down enemies. The canine also has a health bar and can supply the player with perks through three combat modes, such as Guard Dog for drawing enemy attention, Support Dog for AOE healing, and Attack Dog for increased DPS.</p><p>The Challenger Archetype appears to be a much more tank-like class that comes equipped with powerful damage-dealing weapons like a grenade launcher, as well as a revolver and greatsword. The gameplay shows the player swiftly switching from each weapon while exploring what looks to be a dungeon in an area called The Lament filled with different enemy types, like close-range brawlers and ones that cast spells from a distance.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-remnant-2-gameplay-explores-expanded-archetype-system/1100-6512650/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Diablo IV's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-class-guides-hub/1100-6512461/">open beta</a> is almost here, but if you're itching to play it first thing, you might have to hurry up and wait. In a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/expectations-for-the-diablo-iv-open-beta-march-24-26/6276">post</a> on the Blizzard forums from community manager Adam Fletcher, the company says that players should expect "lengthy queue times" for the beta, especially on Friday, March 24, which is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-open-beta-dates-queues-early-access-and-how-to-get-into-beta/1100-6511672/">day it launches</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we open the gates again this Friday to absolutely everyone, we are expecting a lot of people," the post reads in part. "There will be lengthy queue times, particularly on Friday when we first launch and during peak regional windows. This past weekend helped us to forecast the capacity we expect this weekend, and we will be using that capacity to intentionally stress our systems in preparation for launch. In summary, while we know it can be frustrating, we need queues to properly stress test our services and we are designing to ensure we have them some of the time."</p><p dir="ltr">Fletcher also notes that the game may be taken offline at times in order to push out fixes or "infrastructure adjustments." The post concludes by calling for players to report any bugs they encounter, in addition to giving general feedback about the game as a whole.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-warns-of-lengthy-queue-times-for-diablo-4-open-beta/1100-6512648/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Super Mario Manga Suggests That 1-Up Mushrooms Are Grown From Bodies Of Dead Marios

<p>A 1-Up mushroom is an essential part of any Mario game, a literal pick-me-up in a fungal form that guarantees you an extra chance to complete a level. Green mushrooms that add a touch of resurrection to a Mario Bros. run, these power-ups are iconic and might harbor a dark secret that could rock Nintendo's mega-popular franchise to its very core.</p><p>As noted by the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/MarioBrothBlog">Super Mario Broth</a>, a page from the Super Mario 64 manga all the way back in 1996 suggested that Mario was trapped in a grim cycle of eco-friendly life and death. Every Mario who died in the Mushroom Kingdom would eventually become one with the dirt, their bodies feeding the soil and producing 1-Up mushrooms that the next Mario could consume. This <em>probably </em>explains why a single 1-Up in Super Mario 64 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-64-speedrunner-collects-impossible-1-up-27-years-after-launch/1100-6512292/">was almost impossible to collect</a>.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">A 1996 Super Mario 64 manga suggests that 1-Up Mushrooms grow from the bodies of dead Marios, perpetuating the cycle of life and death. <a href="https://t.co/KjGsnig3hB">pic.twitter.com/KjGsnig3hB</a></p>  — Supper Mario Broth (@MarioBrothBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1638916218257125376?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">March 23, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Before an existential crisis about the state of Mario takes root, it's worth noting that this is just an interesting idea from the manga authors. "Please note that these mangas are filled with jokes and eccentric theories such as this," <a href="https://twitter.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1638920857388199936">Super Mario Broth added</a>.

Tost added that although storytelling is a strength for CD Projekt Red, it is also an obstacle, saying, "We pride ourselves on being storytellers, and we didn’t want to stop a player’s lack of foresight from enjoying the narrative," Tost said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-could-learn-from-dishonored-dev-says/1100-6512645/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

This announcement was made at the Game Developers Conference.</p><p>Path tracing is also known as "full ray tracing," which is used to simulate how light acts in scenes and environments. It traces the way light bounces off of objects in different ways in a way that makes those scenes and environments hyper-realistic.</p><p>"This not only gives better visuals to the players but also has the promise to revolutionize the entire pipeline of how games are being created," said Nvidia senior technology developer engineer Pawel Kozlowski in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/22/cyberpunk-2077-path-traced-visuals-gdc/">statement</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-receives-path-tracing-in-april/1100-6512644/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney believes Apple is the only thing stopping the full potential of Epic's metaverse vision.</p><p>During GDC 2023, Epic Games finally released their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-creative-2-0-and-uefn-everything-you-need-to-know/1100-6512614/">Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)</a>, which allows players to create their own games and experiences for free within Fortnite Creative mode.

## Sony Is Metacritic's Highest-Rated Publisher Of 2022

<p>Sony has been crowned the top publisher of 2022 according to Metacritic, GameSpot's sister site, in its 13th annual Game Publisher Rankings list. <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/pictures/2023-game-publisher-rankings/1">Metacritic's criteria</a> for its list was based on average Metascore, a percentage of games with good review scores of 75 and above, a percentage of games with bad review scores of 49% and below, and the number of "great" games that managed to earn a Metascore of 90 or higher last year.</p><p>PlayStation released well-received games such as God of War Ragnarok, Horizon Forbidden West, and various PC ports of popular titles from its library, throughout 2022. This propelled Sony to first place, dethroning Microsoft which held the top spot in the 2021 rankings. Interestingly, Microsoft isn't even on the list due to the company failing to meet one of the other criteria parameters. "Only publishers with five or more distinct titles released last year are included in our rankings," Metacritic explained, hence the complete absence of Microsoft here.</p><p>2022 wasn't a good year for Xbox when it came to exclusives, as Starfield and Redfall were delayed into 2023, and Obsidian's Pentiment was the only game released last year that was internally developed. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-xbox-needs-steady-release-of-great-games-didnt-do-that-in-2022/1100-6510959/">acknowledged Microsoft's poor output in 2022</a>, and added that 2023 would be a better year for the company.

<p>Developer Arkane has commented on what changed with its vampire game Redfall after Microsoft bought studio owner ZeniMax. Speaking to <a href="https://fr.ign.com/redfall/64224/news/oui-redfall-etait-initialement-prevu-sur-ps5">IGN France</a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-scrapped-a-ps5-version-of-redfall-says-arkane-director">via IGN</a>), director Harvey Smith said there was a "huge sea change" for Redfall after Microsoft bought the company, and this included a decision to not bring the game to PlayStation 5.</p><p>"They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox, and PC,'" Smith said.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-acquires-skyrim-fallout-and-doom-dev-bethesda/1100-6482406/">announced its intent to buy ZeniMax in September 2020</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-now-officially-owns-bethesda-in-7-5-billion-purchase/1100-6488574/">completed the buyout in March 2021</a>. Some are suggesting that Arkane was working on a PS5 edition of Redfall and canceled it after the buyout, but Smith did not say this outright. GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details on the situation.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-said-no-ps5-after-buying-redfall-studio-dev-says/1100-6512629/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## City Agrees To $5 Million Settlement In Deadly Call Of Duty Swatting

<p dir="ltr">The city of Wichita, KS has reached a $5 million settlement with the family of a man who was killed by police after a swatting hoax that resulted from a Call of Duty match that he wasn't even involved in. The settlement comes from a civil lawsuit filed by the victim's family after local officials declined to prosecute the cop who reportedly pulled the trigger.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-duty-swatting-police-killing-finch-barriss-lawsuit-1850253901">Kotaku</a> and the <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article272560679.html">Wichita Eagle</a>, the swatting incident occurred in December 28 and led to the violent death of Andrew Finch, a 28-year-old man. Two Call of Duty: WWII players, Casey Viner and Shane Gaskill, got into a verbal altercation after betting $1.50 on a match. Viner then enlisted Tyler Barriss, who had a long history of calling in hoaxes, to swat Gaskill. Gaskill provided the wrong address to Barriss and challenged him to "try some shit," which led to the police surrounding Finch's house.</p><p dir="ltr">Finch was fatally shot by Officer Justin Rapp, who said that he believed that Finch reached for a weapon shortly after the victim opened his own front door. The incident resulted in jail time for Barriss and Viner, who were sentenced to 20 years and 15 months respectively. Gaskill agreed to deferred prosecution, while Rapp was never charged. The Wichita Eagle later reported that Rapp was promoted in 2022, and a later <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/local/article259423154.html">investigation</a> said that officers within the city's police department made jokes about killing people and traded racist memes.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/city-agrees-to-5-million-settlement-in-deadly-call-of-duty-swatting/1100-6512632/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is almost here. The film still has a week until its nationwide release, but audiences have been treated to special sneak screenings over the past month, and have likened the movie to the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Paramount dropped the final trailer today for that last bit of anticipation and it sprinkles in a handful of good blurbs along the way.</p><p>The last trailer doesn't give more context clues to the larger story but plays to the strengths of Edgin's (Chris Pine) comedic timing and some of the fantastical creatures that the Forgotten Realms has roaming about. Check it out below.</p><div>          </div><p>Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves spent almost a decade in pre-production as the film went through various phases in development since 2013. Directed and written by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, mostly known as the co-writers for Spider-Man: Homecoming, along with up-and-comer Michael Gilio, the script uses elements from the previous attempt by director Chris McKay and Gilio.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-dungeons-and-dragons-trailer-promises-you-a-good-time/1100-6512630/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Lego and 2K are working on a driving game called Lego 2K Drive, and the "AAA driving adventure game" is set for release on May 19, 2023. It even includes a car called the Hamburghini. Really.</p><p>Developed by NBA 2K studio Visual Concepts, Lego 2K Drive is in development for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Described as an open-world driving game, Lego 2K Drive has single-player and multiplayer, and it allows players to make their own cars out of Lego pieces with more than 1,000 options (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-2k-drive-is-an-open-world-aaa-racing-game-coming-this-may">via IGN</a>).</p><div>          </div><p>Lego 2K Drive will have different biomes, a number of race types to compete in, minigames, collectibles, and a story that weaves everything together.

## Elden Ring Gets Ray Tracing In New Update, But At A Cost

<p>A new patch for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring</a> has added ray tracing support to the game on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, but with a big catch. According to Bandai Namco, enabling ray tracing can have an effect on frame rate and resolution, impacting the overall performance of the game. This isn't unusual, seeing as how ray tracing is a fairly resource-intensive function. "Please note that performance--such as frame rate and resolution--may be impacted while playing with ray tracing on," Bandai Namco's patch notes read.</p><p>For PC players, you can find the recommended requirements below to get Elden Ring's ray tracing working on your system:</p><p><strong>Elden Ring ray tracing minimum settings</strong></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-gets-ray-tracing-in-new-update-but-at-a-cost/1100-6512627/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Lego 2K Drive Is The Mario Kart, Burnout Paradise, Lego Mashup I Never Knew I Wanted

<p dir="ltr">Lego video games have seen a resurgence recently. After years of being associated most closely with successful but often very similar platformers from TT Games, the last few years have given us the minimalist Lego: A Builder's Journey, the clever physics puzzler Lego Bricktales, and the ambitious Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. It's in that environment that we're getting Lego 2K Drive, a striking combination of influences as diverse as Mario Kart and Burnout Paradise that uses the Lego license to add both humor and smart gameplay applications. Best of all, it's an absolute blast to play.</p><p dir="ltr">The structure of Lego 2K Drive unfolds in layers that help to illustrate just how multifaceted the game really is. The core story mode takes place in a wide open-world environment composed of a handful of different biomes. I tried the tutorial area, Turbo Acres, as well as a large Arizona-like area called Big Butte, and the world map showed at least three more to explore. Each of these is littered with garages to act as fast-travel points, races, stunt jumps, and other activities. Most of these are integrated right into the open world, so you can simply pass through a gate to start a quick event--say, a challenge to jump over several barns. The open worlds in Lego 2K Drive reminded me of the best moments of Burnout Paradise or Forza Horizon, roaming the landscape and looking for fun activities, jumping into one, and then driving around to look for the next. The vehicles themselves have a solid weight to them, gripping the road in a way that even some more traditional racing games don't quite nail.</p><p dir="ltr">Your vehicles aren't limited to traditional cars. The landscapes often have large water structures as well as off-road grounds. Since your vehicle is made of Lego, it instantly reconstitutes itself to match the type of terrain it's on. You can freely roam around the streets in a hot rod, and the moment you go off-road, a satisfying click-clack of Lego bricks rebuilds around you to make an ATV. Score a big jump off a cliff into a nearby river and, click-clack, you're driving a boat. It feels frictionless, like the whole world is your playground and nowhere is off-limits. As you explore and unlock new vehicles, each with their own stats, you can make separate loadouts with different combinations of roadsters, off-road vehicles, and boats that will swap in automatically as you play.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-2k-drive-is-the-mario-kart-burnout-paradise-lego-mashup-i-never-knew-i-wanted/1100-6512597/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Immortal SMG And Target Lock Perk Are Destiny 2's Hottest Combination Right Now

<p>There's a good chance that a recent run in the Crucible or Trials of Osiris has resulted in your Guardian being eliminated by an opponent wielding The Immortal, a submachine gun that has been racking up impressive kill-counts in Destiny 2. It's not uncommon for certain weapons to be fashionable in PvP, but The Immortal is one gun that has the potential to roll with some of the best perks in the game.</p><p>The god roll version of The Immortal is one that includes Target Lock, a perk that increases damage the longer you have your weapon trained on an enemy. Throw in other perks such as Ricochet Rounds and Rangefinder to increase optimal range without worrying about damage fall-off, and this SMG becomes an absolute beast in PvP. So what makes Target Lock such a desired perk in particular?</p><p>As YouTuber Fallout Plays noted, Target Lock doesn't increase your optimal time-to-kill numbers, but the perk does help you reach that threshold more quickly and is very forgiving should you miss any shots.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-immortal-smg-and-target-lock-perk-are-destiny-2-hottest-combination-right-now/1100-6512625/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2's Trials Of Osiris Could Be More Forgiving Later This Season

<p>Big changes are on the horizon for Destiny 2's PvP, including its weekend mode Trials of Osiris. After several changes were made to the multiplayer offering throughout 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-outlines-upcoming-trials-of-osiris-iron-banner-changes/1100-6512432/">Bungie plans to improve Trials</a> with updates to its matchmaking, an update to Passages that will potentially make it easier to unlock a Flawless run, and the introduction of an experimental game mode later in Season 20.</p><p>Passages, which log how many rounds and matches you've won, will receive two updates, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/lightfall-crucible-update">according to Bungie</a>. Wealth Passages will reward extra Trials rank on every win, and the amount rewarded will increase as your major rank goes up. Mercy Passages will now forgive two losses if you have not been Flawless for the week, and reverts back to its old behavior of forgiving a single loss once you go Flawless. This will potentially make Trials more forgiving and give players a better chance to earn some of the best loot in the game, including Adept-class weapons.</p><p>For matchmaking, Bungie aims to allow players to play with friends without worrying about whether they have gone Flawless, remove the motivation to reset cards in order to farm or carry players, and better protect players who are struggling to find success in the playlist. Season 20 has seen the introduction of Fireteam matchmaking, which heavily prioritizes matching like-sized teams against each other, and after the mid-season patch, Bungie will use its experimental Trials Labs mode to gather feedback on a new Trials matchmaking system which will remove the Flawless pool and ticket-based matchmaking in favor of something different.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-trials-of-osiris-could-be-more-forgiving-later-this-season/1100-6512624/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2's PvP Mode Is Getting Overhauled Later This Season

<p>Lightfall and Season of Defiance have introduced a number of PvE changes to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>, and after several weeks of fine-tuning that experience, Bungie is looking to update the PvP side of the game. In a new <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/lightfall-crucible-update">blog post</a>, Bungie explained that it plans to introduce "meaningful" changes to activities and their reward structures, including updates to matchmaking, adjustments to the Competitive Division, and introducing new game modes.</p><p>Several updates to map and game mode weighting are already live, and a mid-season update will see new connection-based matchmaking and a Crucible rotator added. Crucible Relentless Rotator will see Clash, Rift, and Zone Control rotated into play on a weekly basis, while Crucible Party Rotator will offer Mayhem, Scorched, and Momentum Control modes for players to switch between every week. As for the maps that these modes will be available on, expect to spend more time on Javelin-4, The Burnout, Rusted Lands, Midtown, and Wormhaven, as these arenas will be favored more in playlists.</p><p>As for fireteam matchmaking, Bungie says that for Control and Iron Banner, FTMM will be addressed in the mid-season patch to find more suitable matches while also improving the wait time during matchmaking. In the Competitive Division, Bungie plans to have more rewards for dedicated PvP players to chase, and after the mid-season patch, those prizes will include a new emblem for you if you are Ascendant III or higher and a stat tracker that allows you to put your current Competitive Division rank number on PvP emblems.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-pvp-mode-is-getting-overhauled-later-this-season/1100-6512623/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
