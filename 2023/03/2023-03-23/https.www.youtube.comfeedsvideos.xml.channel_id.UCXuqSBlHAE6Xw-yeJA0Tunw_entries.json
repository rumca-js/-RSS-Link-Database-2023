Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology\u2014a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\n\nEthereum is a platform powered by blockchain technology that is best known for its native cryptocurrency\u2014called Ether or ETH or simply Ethereum. The distributed nature of blockchain technology is what makes the Ethereum platform secure, and that security enables ETH to accrue value.\n\nThe Ethereum platform supports Ether in addition to a network of decentralized apps, otherwise known as \"dApps.\" Smart contracts, which originated on the Ethereum platform, are a central component of how the platform operates. Many decentralized finance (DeFi) and other applications use smart contracts in conjunction with blockchain technology.\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries\n\n#elonmusk #bitcoin #ethereum #crypto #eth #btc #invest", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWW0r6_X0xk", "date_published": "2023-03-23 10:49:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw", "title": "OpenAI GPT-4: The Game-Changing AI Technology", "description": "Unlocking the Power of AI: Everything You Need to Know About OpenAI and ChatGPT - The Revolutionary Chatbot Changing the Game!\"\n\nIn this video, we dive deep into the world of AI with OpenAI and their game-changing ChatGPT.
