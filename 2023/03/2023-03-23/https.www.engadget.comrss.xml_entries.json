But lawmakers on the committee were skeptical of the plan, which TikTok officials have said would do more to protect users than an outright ban.</p><p>Chew repeated multiple times that US user data would be inaccessible to employees in other countries \u201cafter Project Texas\u201d is completed later this year. Still, committee members were skeptical of the plan, which has been in the works for more than a year. Rodgers called it a \u201cmarketing scheme,\u201d Representative Frank Pallone said \"Project Texas is simply not acceptable,\" and Representative Angie Craig said the plan \u201cdoesn\u2019t pass the smell test.\u201d</p><p>The more than five-hour showdown between Chew and lawmakers, who have found suspicion of TikTok to be a rare source of bipartisan agreement, comes as US officials have told the company it could <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-us-government-is-trying-to-force-bytedance-to-sell-tiktok-005751763.html\">ban the app</a> if it doesn\u2019t separate itself from ByteDance.</p><p>As with previous hearings with social media executives, lawmakers pressed Chew for yes or no answers to complex questions, and grew frustrated when he declined to give one. In one exchange, Representative Tony Cardenas asked Chew whether ByteDance was a Chinese company. He would only admit that it was a \u201cglobal\u201d firm with a Chinese founder. In another, Representative Debbie Lesko asked if he would agree with a statement that the Chinese government persecutes the Uighur population in China. He would only say that \"it's deeply concerning to hear about all the kinds of human rights abuse\" and tried to pivot to saying those statements are allowed on TikTok.</p><p>And Chew dodged other questions about the inner workings of ByteDance and its China-based employees. He was sharply criticized for his response to a question about whether ByteDance employees had spied on American journalists. \u201cI don\u2019t think \u2018spying\u2019 is the right way to describe it,\u201d Chew said. \u201cThis is ultimately an internal investigation.\u201d (TikTok was quick to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TikTokComms/status/1638978285307588617\">point out</a> Chew denied \u2018spying\u2019 had happened at the direction of the Chinese Communist Party.)</p><p>The hearing was also notably different than previous hearings with other social media company CEOs because the vast majority of lawmakers are not active on TikTok. Not all of their questions were nuanced, though. At one point, Representative Richard Hudson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/1638917878324817923\">demanded to</a> know whether TikTok can \u201caccess the home WiFi network.\u201d And multiple lawmakers asked why TikTok\u2019s moderation practices are different from the aggressive censorship of its Chinese counterpart, Douyin.</p><p>Beyond national security concerns, several lawmakers also raised the issue of teen safety, including TikTok\u2019s content moderation practices and how it deals with viral \u201cchallenges.\u201d Chew often pointed to recent updates like TikTok\u2019d addition of a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-now-offers-a-feed-dedicated-to-science-and-tech-150120046.html\">STEM-themed</a> feed, new<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-will-automatically-limit-screen-time-for-teens-110056722.html\"> screentime settings</a> and algorithm tweaks  <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-for-you-feed-refresh-130028273.html\">to limit </a>\u201crepetitive patterns\u201d of potentially harmful content.</p><p>But, after more than five hours of questioning, it seemed his testimony hadn\u2019t done much to persuade the members of the committee that Project Texas will be able to address their concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, TikTok\u2019s future is uncertain, and even Chew seemed unwilling to speculate.

Daedalic has revealed that its stealth action take on JRR Tolkien's fantasy world will be available May 25th on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. A Switch version is due later in the year. While the mechanics of the game are by now familiar, this still promises to be a fresh take if you weren't enthused with the hack-and-slash of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-08-middle-earth-shadow-of-war-gameplay-demo-wb.html\">Monolith's Middle-earth games</a>.</p><p>You play Gollum in a previously unrecorded story of his search for (what else?) the Precious during the first few chapters of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>. He's clearly not a brawler, so he has to sneak and climb to survive. And crucially, the battle inside his corrupted mind plays a key role. You have to choose between giving into Gollum's darker impulses or hanging on to the shreds of kindness from Smeagol. While this is an original tale based on the books, you'll run into familiar characters and navigate a world heavily inspired by Peter Jackson's <em>Lord of the Rings</em> movies.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To say <em>Gollum</em> has taken a while to finish would be an understatement. It was originally unveiled in 2019, and even then wasn't expected to arrive until 2021. That year came and went (the pandemic didn't help speed development), and even a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lord-of-the-rings-gollum-release-date-september-1-140046416.html\">tentative September 2022 release</a> didn't happen after a delay that was only supposed to last &quot;a few months&quot; as Daedalic took extra time to polish the title.</p><p>The timing might work in the game's favor. In 2019, Amazon's <em>Lord of the Rings</em> TV series was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-12-amazon-lord-of-the-rings-details.html\">still in its infancy</a>, and the last big Tolkien game (<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of War</em>) was old news. Flash forward to 2023 and it's another story. Amazon's <em>The Rings of Power</em> show is a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-was-amazon-primes-most-watched-debut-ever-075410830.html\">major success</a>, and movie effects house Weta Workshop is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lord-of-the-rings-game-weta-workshop-private-division-middle-earth-143616832.html\">making its own game</a> set in the franchise.

The companies plan to open the flight path between downtown and O\u2019Hare International Airport in 2025.</p><p>Besides being United\u2019s headquarters and largest hub, Chicago's airport commute makes it an ideal testbed for flying taxis. For example, the drive to or from O\u2019Hare, in the western suburb of Rosemont, can take anywhere from 35 minutes to over an hour, depending on traffic; even in one of the city\u2019s elevated trains, it can take around 45 minutes. But Archer estimates a flight in one of its air taxis will only take 10 minutes to travel from O\u2019Hare to its destination at a downtown helipad. The program will initially be limited to the mainline O\u2019Hare / downtown route, but the companies eventually plan to add smaller paths to surrounding communities.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Archer describes the upcoming route as \u201ccost competitive\u201d for passengers without going into specifics. But even if it\u2019s initially limited to deep-pocketed business travelers, the program should be good for the environment. Archer\u2019s air taxis use electric motors and batteries and don\u2019t produce emissions. \u201cThis exciting new technology will further decarbonize our means of transportation, taking us another step forward in our fight against climate change,\u201d said Mayor Lori Lightfoot. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that Chicago residents will be among the first in the nation to experience this innovative, convenient form of travel.\u201d</p><p>The partnership is the latest in United\u2019s aggressive investments in flying taxis. Last year, the airline <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/united-airlines-flying-taxi-eve-air-mobility-embrarer-162205301.html\">ordered at least 200</a> electric flying taxis from Eve Air Mobility; that followed a $10 million deposit it placed with Archer the month prior.</p><p>In addition to Chicago\u2019s (ground-based) taxis and ride shares, the city has a robust public transportation system built around elevated trains and buses, the latter of which the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has committed to converting to electric by 2040. (The CTA already deploys 23 electric buses.) If all goes according to plan, the flight path will help decrease emissions and traffic congestion, something most Chi-town residents can get behind.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/united-and-archer-will-open-an-air-taxi-route-to-chicagos-ohare-airport-in-2025-191352804.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/united-and-archer-will-open-an-air-taxi-route-to-chicagos-ohare-airport-in-2025-191352804.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-23 19:13:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "ChatGPT's new plugins will deliver real-time stats", "description": "<p>Following the release the new GPT-4 engine and Whisper API in March, <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins\">OpenAI announced Thursday</a> that it has begun introducing plugins for ChatGPT.

The two-year-old game joins <em>Minecraf</em>t, <em>Portal</em> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-06-nvidia-quake-ii-rtx-path-tracing-demo-steam.html\"><em>Quake II</em></a> \u2014 titles with relatively primitive graphics \u2014 in supporting the technology. In addition, Nvidia announced the availability of a developer kit to pave the way for the next generation of bleeding-edge graphics.</p><p>While ray tracing follows a single beam of light across a virtual scene, path tracing follows the light as it bounces around an environment, more realistically mimicking how it works in the physical world. It determines how nearby surfaces reflect or absorb the light, producing physically accurate soft shadows that more easily convince our brains that we\u2019re viewing a natural, real-life scene. And humans perceiving graphics as more realistic is (naturally) an advancement the gaming industry will pursue without hesitation. Hollywood has used path tracing for decades, but it was a slow and expensive process that couldn\u2019t work on consumer gear or in anything close to real-time.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>However, we need to keep our expectations in check for the moment: You\u2019ll need the most powerful Nvidia RTX 40-series GPUs to enjoy <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>\u2019s path tracing (and those who do may run into performance issues). Still, Nvidia is eager to nudge the industry toward what will be increasingly possible for consumer graphics in the coming years.</p><p>Nvidia says two of its technologies were vital in producing this milestone: DLSS 3 (AI-based image upscaling without performance loss) and Shader Execution Reordering (more efficient ray tracing without losing quality). \u201cDLSS allows games to render 1/8th of the pixels, then uses AI and GeForce RTX Tensor Cores to reconstruct the rest, dramatically multiplying frame rates, while delivering crisp, high-quality images that rival native resolution,\u201d Nvidia explained in its announcement.</p><p>Although we\u2019ll probably have to wait a while before this technology becomes widely accessible, Nvidia launched a <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/path-tracing\">new SDK</a> this week to let developers prepare.

Technology moves on, or the manufacturer stops being able, or willing, to support users who have already bought a machine. The most infamous example must be the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-11-alienware-area-51m-review-gaming-laptop.html\">A51M</a>, which had swappable GPU modules designed to keep it close to the cutting edge. But Dell killed off the plan to produce new modules for that machine <em>the very next year</em>. It\u2019s this arena, littered with high expectations and broken promises that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-review-150001399.html\">Framework</a> is entering with its first gaming notebook. It\u2019s called the Framework Laptop 16 and it could be the standard bearer for a new paradigm in portable computing. No pressure.</p><p>The Framework Laptop 16 is the company\u2019s second product after its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/framework-12th-generation-upgrade-video-160007303.html\">perpetually-upgraded 13-inch</a> notebook. That has earned it plaudits from across the industry, and has given it the confidence to turn its sights toward a far harder group to win over; gamers, creatives and power users. But despite the beefier internals, the machine retains the promise of being an entirely modular, fully-repairable laptop. \u201cIt\u2019s all of the repairability and upgradeability that exists in the Framework Laptop 13, in a larger, higher-performance form factor,\u201d said company founder Nirav Patel. He told me he believes that Framework is now \u201cdelivering on the holy grail in high-performance notebooks, which is the ability to upgrade the GPU independently of the rest of the system.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>At first blush, it\u2019s clear that the Framework 16 doesn\u2019t try to disguise the modular nature of its construction like its smaller sibling. That\u2019s both a function of the sheer level of customization on hand, and an intentional choice to be loud and proud about what this machine is. Patel said that while the default build is fairly discreet (I\u2019d be tempted to disagree), \u201cthere\u2019s so much you can reconfigure and customize that you can build something totally insane\u201d so expect the models seen in the wild to be \u201cimmediately eye-catching.\u201d And, if you had to sum up its aesthetics in a single word, I\u2019d be tempted to coin the phrase<em> legopunk.</em></p><p>What we don\u2019t have today, and won\u2019t learn for a little while longer, is what specs are going to be found inside this chassis. Today\u2019s announcements are essentially just preparing the ground for a fuller media blitz closer to when pre-orders open later this Spring. More importantly, it\u2019s to get the ever-growing community of Framework developers and hobbyists attuned to what\u2019s coming, and the tools that they\u2019ll be given free-reign to play with to help customize and tweak their own machines. Patel believes that there\u2019s plenty of potential toys for people to want to fiddle with, both inside the machine, and on the top of its deck. As part of this push, a slew of open source data, from mechanical drawings to electrical reference designs has been uploaded to GitHub.</p><p>Much of our discussion focused on the big question that will likely hang over this machine for at least the next year or so. Plenty of companies have made gaming laptops with the promise of a future roadmap to upgrades, and none of them could deliver on that year-after-year. \u201cIt\u2019s been tried in the past, it\u2019s failed horribly, so much so that there\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.pcinvasion.com/dell-alienware-area-51-m-upgrade-lawsuit/\">class action lawsuit</a>,\u201d admitted Patel. \u201cWhat they did wrong, we learned all of [their] lessons so what we\u2019re building is an expansion bay system. Rather than constrain components to a single size and hope that they can conform to those requirements forever, the laptop itself will grow (or shrink) as required.</p><p>Framework has made room in the chassis to support both a current generation GPU module as well as future ones. \u201cInstead of getting stuck where we can\u2019t support new generations\u201d he said, \u201cwe have that flexibility within that expansion bay to reconfigure any internal \u2013 or external \u2013 aspect of it to make sure it works.\u201d This even stretches to the external dimensions of the laptop itself, and you can swap out the standard deck case for one with a longer rear vent, a common feature on many high-performance machines. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed ourselves a way where we have pretty much complete flexibility to support changes when it comes to GPUs,\u201d said Patel.</p><p>Internally, the 16\u2019s mainboard is set up in such a way as to allow a connection over PCIe x8, which Patel says offers enough \u201chigh power and display support in both directions\u201d for a laptop of this intended size and class. When asked if that connection was enough, he said that the machine still has to behave like a gaming laptop, rather than trying to bolt on overpowered desktop-class modules. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t make sense to put a 300 watt GPU into such a fairly thin form factor,\u201d especially given the thermal constraints any laptop has, let alone a gaming one.</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of the Framework Laptop 16 with the expansion bay cover attached to rear.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/45eba4d0-c96e-11ed-8fdf-b6a3cd5bcaad\" style=\"height: 1920; width: 2880;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Framework</div></figure><p>It should be easy enough to make changes, with Patel explaining that those who need integrated graphics can just add a default thermal module into the bay. But when the person\u2019s needs change, they can \u201cfly in a graphics module\u201d to get that higher level of performance. But the expansion card bay isn\u2019t just designed for an annual cadence of new GPUs, but instead will be offered up for a variety of purposes.</p><p>The bay, and its connection, will be opened up to Framework\u2019s developer community enabling them to build their own modules. The company has already built a dual M.2 SSD that uses the bay, offering up to 16TB of additional storage. But Patel envisions a wide variety of other tools that could be plugged in, like a video capture card, streaming hardware, dedicated AI modules or even a software-defined radio transmitter.</p><p>As well as the unprecedented level of internal customization, the 16 also offers hot-swappable keyboard, mousepad and anything-else-on-the-top-deck modules. Patel said, based on market research, there\u2019s a clean 50-50 split between people who love, and those who hate, numpads. \u201cSo, we thought, why not let people choose?\u201d Consequently, the whole top deck of the 16 is user reconfigurable. Patel added that owners can \u201cactually remove the keyboard, remove the numpad, slide the keyboard into the center and add input modules to the left and right\u201d all while the machine is running.</p><p>Much like the expansion cards, Framework says it is opening these tools up to developers as well. Patel said that the company has already developed a secondary display, haptic slider and an LED matrix display. Framework is also developing regular backlit keyboards as well as, since this is a <em>gaming laptop</em> after all, an RGB-backlit version. Many of the modules are built on QMK keyboard software based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller, and the company is releasing open-source firmware to help enable the developer community to build their own projects. In its release, the company said it was hoping to see fans building their own \u201cjog wheels, sliders, touchscreen displays, e-ink notepads, smart card readers and more.\u201d</p><p>Another holdover from the older Framework Laptop is the expansion cards: USB-connected peripherals which let you choose which integral ports your laptop has, and where you put them. The bigger chassis size means that the 16 has three ports on either side, compared to the two on its smaller sibling. But one of those, depending on how you feel about having a dedicated headphone jack, might already be reserved. \u201cThe gaming audience is either using wireless or USB headsets,\u201d said Patel, who paused and smiled to himself before adding that the company has had the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-07-courage-is-not-how-you-sell-iphones.html\"><em>courage</em></a>\u201d to remove the dedicated 3.5mm port from the bigger machine. \u201cBut we\u2019ll introduce an audio expansion card [to replace it]\u201d giving users the choice of having the port, or not, and to pick which side of the chassis they want that wire running to.</p><p>If there\u2019s one thing that will hopefully ensure that Framework doesn\u2019t fall into the same trap as the A51M, it\u2019s going to be its ties with component manufacturers. The company already makes its own mainboards with Compal and Patel said Framework was already plugged into the ecosystem necessary to build its own graphics cards. He added that, much like initiatives to tackle mainboard and battery waste, Framework would also work to ensure that legacy GPU modules, the ones that get swapped out from this machine a few years down the line, will also get a second life. \u201cYou can take the graphics module out of a Framework Laptop 16 and install it in an external enclosure to use as an eGPU,\u201d said Patel. The company\u2019s booth at the Game Developers Conference will be demonstrating a proof of concept for this, which will likely evolve into a purchasable product when the need arises.</p><p>Patel notes that Framework now has a solid track record of supporting a model for several generations which should help quell any unease for would-be buyers. \u201cWe think, with the Framework Laptop 13 having shown this third generation of products all launching within the same form factor, all continuing support all the way back to the first laptop we ever shipped, it shows we are in this for the long haul.\u201d He added that \u201cwhen we say we\u2019re building things for longevity, we\u2019re gonna keep delivering upgrades, that is something we\u2019re going to deliver on.\u201d And that by open-sourcing many of its components, and offering comprehensive documentation, it enables third parties to \u201cjust jump in\u201d with their own projects.</p><p>Further details about the Framework Laptop 16 will be made available when pre-orders open toward the end of Spring. Patel said that there\u2019s no word on pricing, but that you should use Framework\u2019s existing cost structure to compare against the market as it stands. Shipments are expected to begin towards the end of the year, but the real test of this machine isn\u2019t so much in its first launch, but what happens 12 and 24 months down the line. Then again, it\u2019s a challenge Patel knows all too well, and believes that users are craving \u201cstability\u201d and a machine that \u201cworks well for them as long as they want to.\u201d It\u2019s wild to think that, in this day and age, those are considered to be<em> lofty</em> promises.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/frameworks-laptop-16-is-a-modular-upgradable-gaming-laptop-170021876.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/frameworks-laptop-16-is-a-modular-upgradable-gaming-laptop-170021876.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-23 17:00:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Framework brings updated Intel and AMD chips to its modular laptop", "description": "<p>If there was a question hovering over Framework\u2019s much-lauded modular laptop, it was for how long the company would keep supporting it. After all, companies talk a good game about being green and sustainable at launch, only to abandon those plans a year or two later. Now, we\u2019re three chip generations deep, and today we\u2019re getting new mainboards carrying Intel\u2019s 13th generation Core CPUs. Even better, users will soon have the option to ditch Intel in favor of AMD\u2019s rival products, both for new machines and to upgrade in all of the models already shipped. It\u2019s a remarkable sign of confidence in its platform, and a signal to users that Framework is in this business, with this chassis, for the long haul.</p><p>Intel\u2019s 13th generation Core CPUs were <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/intels-13th-gen-laptop-cpu-24-cores-140050825.html\">first announced at CES</a> in January and Framework is rolling them out along with a number of other updates to its laptop. Since it sells (or sold) only one model of laptop, these changes will appear in the product from now on. And these annual updates are designed to address the criticisms that some users have had with the hardware thus far. That includes a new hinge that\u2019s been redesigned to be more rigid compared to the ones found in units up until now. And, more importantly, a new, bigger 61Wh battery with a slew of firmware updates that should increase the laptop\u2019s runtime by between 20 and 30 percent depending on how intense your workload is.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The focus on addressing user complaints stretches to the display cover, which will now be matte as opposed to glossy. Similarly, Framework will now incorporate the 80dB <a href=\"https://frame.work/gb/en/products/speaker-kit?v=FRANBX0001\">louder speakers</a> it offered in its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/framework-modular-repairable-chromebook-review-173035156.html\">Chromebook</a> to some of its mainline laptops. All of these innovations will, as per Framework\u2019s usual commitment to supporting its existing users, will also be able to buy as standalone parts. And, as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/framework-12th-generation-upgrade-video-160007303.html\">I outlined last year</a>, even someone with next-to-no aptitude for upgrading computer parts can make these fixes with relatively little fuss. Customers can now select their display bezel color and keyboard options at the buying stage, saving them from having to double purchase.</p><p>The other change that we\u2019ll need to address is that this machine has been rechristened as the Framework Laptop <em>13</em>. That\u2019s because it\u2019s now sitting alongside the company\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/frameworks-laptop-16-is-a-modular-upgradable-gaming-laptop-170021876.html\">16-inch gaming machine</a>, which was announced today.</p><p>I asked founder Nirav Patel if there wasn\u2019t a temptation, since we\u2019re now three generations in, to start messing with the chassis. \u201cWe plan to stick with it, we haven\u2019t seen anything that makes us want to change it,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s really just being able to upgrade those modules.\u201d He said that one of the key pillars of feedback he\u2019s received is that users \u201cactually just want stability\u201d in their purchases rather than a constant stream of new hardware. He added that Framework\u2019s pledge to keep supporting the same laptop chassis for so long is a good signal to would-be buyers that they\u2019re investing in a \u201cstable ecosystem.\u201d</p><p>Framework has promised price parity between Intel and AMD\u2019s mainboards, which will offer a Ryzen 7040 in either a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 flavor. Pre-orders will open at the same time for both, although it\u2019s thought that the AMD version might ship a little later. Framework will open pre-orders to users looking for a new machine and just the new mainboards at the same time. Those in the latter camp, who want to ditch Intel in their existing Framework 13 for AMD, will also need to buy new RAM and a new WiFi card. The one other downside for would-be switchers is that, as Patel explains, \u201cthe port configuration is different in terms of what the expansion cards actually support.\u201d This is because the Intel boards universally support Thunderbolt 4, while the AMD model offers two USB 4.0, one USB 3.2 plus DisplayPort, and one vanilla USB 3.2 port.</p><p>There will be some changes and tweaks depending on which model you opt for, since the different chip options mean different default builds. For instance, the new Intel models will get the louder speakers, while the AMD units do not, although those quieter speakers have been tuned for better performance. Similarly, the base models with Core i5 and Ryzen 5 will keep the older 55Wh battery, while the i7 and Ryzen 7 options will get the newer 61Wh option. As such, you might want to examine the pre-order pages in more detail to make sure you know what you\u2019re getting.</p><p>As users upgrade their existing laptops with new mainboards, Framework is acutely aware there will be a raft of functional boards potentially left unused. Rather than create a new stream of e-waste, the company has so far worked to support 3D-printed cases and hobby projects. \u201cWe released these open-source design files where people could 3D-print their own case,\u201d said Patel, \u201cbut most people don\u2019t have 3D printers.\u201d Which is why Framework has teamed up with PC case maker CoolerMaster to produce the first official standalone case for its mainboards.</p><p>The case is a similar thickness to the laptop deck at present, and is designed so a user can \u201ctake that mainboard, drop it in, and [they] now have this nice simple little second PC,\u201d said Patel. It will also accommodate the same expansion cards as the Framework Laptop 13, and all the user needs to provide is a USB-C power supply of 45W or higher. It includes both its own stand and the option to VESA mount the machine, tucking it neatly behind whatever display you choose to connect it to. It\u2019ll be affordable, too, as it\u2019ll cost just $39 when it launches later in Spring.</p><p>Patel also expects plenty of Framework owners to upgrade their batteries for the new and improved model. He explained that the company is demonstrating \u201ca proof of concept that turns the [first-generation Framework laptop] battery into a USB-C power bank that can power any device, including a laptop.\u201dAnd you might expect that this, too, will get refined and polished by Framework\u2019s committed community into something that plenty of people can experiment with.</p><p>On that subject, the company is also announcing support for Fedora 38 and Ubuntu 22.04 Linux, both of which will work \u201cfantastically out of the box\u201d for both AMD and Intel models. Manjaro XFCE 22.0 and Mint 21.1 are also at an advanced stage of support, and the company says both are \u201cworking great\u201d on the new hardware.</p><p>The pre-built base model configurations of both Intel and AMD versions of the Framework Laptop 13 (2023) with Windows 11 will cost $1,049 before build-to-order upgrades. All units can be pre-ordered from today for the usual $100 deposit, with shipments for both expected to start at some point in May. In addition, Framework also announced that it would begin shipping to Belgium, Italy, Spain and Taiwan later in the year.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/framework-brings-updated-intel-and-amd-chips-to-its-modular-laptop-170003842.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/framework-brings-updated-intel-and-amd-chips-to-its-modular-laptop-170003842.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-23 17:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Atari buys the game studio behind the 'System Shock' remake", "description": "<p>Atari is betting that an acquisition will bolster its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/atari-50-the-anniversary-collection-announced-161306163.html\">classic game library</a>.

One potential source of confusion is figuring out how to take a screenshot, since the keyboards built into most Chromebooks contain keys you won\u2019t see on a MacBook or Windows laptop. If you\u2019re stuck, don\u2019t worry: Capturing your screen is still easy on Chrome OS, and there are multiple ways to do it. Let\u2019s break it down.</p><p>In most cases, the fastest way to take a screenshot on a Chromebook is to press the Control (Ctrl) and Show Windows keys at the same time. This grabs a shot of your entire screen. The Show Windows key, which is unique to Chromebooks, looks like a rectangle with two lines next to it.

This presents a menu with options to capture all of your screen, a specific portion or a single open window. You can also take a video recording of part or all of your screen from here.</p><p>Alternatively, you can get to these tools through your Chromebook\u2019s Quick Settings menu. To access this, click the clock in the lower right corner of the taskbar \u2013 or \u201cshelf,\u201d in ChromeOS terms \u2013 then click the Screen Capture icon that appears in the resulting menu.</p><p>Note that some Chromebooks have a dedicated Screenshot key, marked by a little camera icon. If you have that, you can just press that button instead of using the shortcuts mentioned above.</p><figure><img alt=\"A photo of the Acer Chromebook Spin 713's keyboard, with arrows highlighting the location of the Shift, Ctrl, Show Windows and Screenshot keys.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/4b86d260-c42e-11ed-bfed-8fc266dc8b0d\" style=\"height: 583; width: 875;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you\u2019re using an external keyboard without a Show Windows or Screenshot key, you can press Ctrl + F5 to take a full-screen capture, or Ctrl + Shift + F5 to pull up the Screen Capture menu and/or grab a partial screenshot. And if you have a ChromeOS <em>tablet</em>, you can take a screenshot by hitting the power and volume down buttons simultaneously.</p><p>Once you take a screenshot or recording, Chrome OS will automatically copy it to your clipboard. You\u2019ll then see it appear in a small window in the bottom corner of the display, from which you can edit or delete the capture. Recent screenshots will appear in a holding area on your taskbar/shelf called <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-keeps-important-files-at-your-fingertips/\">the Tote</a>, while all of your captures will go to the Downloads folder in the Files app by default.

It\u2019s true that most refurbished items were previously owned, and many are a result of the growing trend of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-store-trade-141517620.html\">trading in</a> your old device when you upgrade. But others were hardly used at all and are one of the <a href=\"https://cdn.nrf.com/sites/default/files/2022-01/Customer%20Returns%20in%20the%20Retail%20Industry%202021.pdf\">millions</a> of <a href=\"https://www.bbcearth.com/news/your-brand-new-returns-end-up-in-landfill\">returns</a> generated each year. Either way, a properly refurbished item has undergone testing to verify that it works, along with cleaning, repairs and parts replacement as needed.</p><p>Since there are no government regulations for renewed items, it\u2019s up to the sellers to define what steps they take to ready a device for sale. And it\u2019s up to the buyer to find out what those steps are before taking the plunge.

They also all provide a one-year warranty.</p><h3><strong>Warranties and returns</strong></h3><p>A refurbished device should perform as well as its new counterpart, but the only way to guarantee that\u2019s the case is to make sure it comes with a warranty. All of the sites we recommend below include a warranty with the products they sell. If you see something labeled as refurbished, but doesn\u2019t include some sort of guarantee as to its reliability \u2013 shop elsewhere.</p><p>Also, a good return policy will let you send the item back (preferably with the same free shipping a new item gets) for any reason \u2014 including that you just changed your mind. That way if a refurbished product doesn\u2019t look as good as you thought it would, you can send it back without having to prove there\u2019s something wrong with it.</p><h3><strong>Sanitation</strong></h3><p>Most refurbished tech was used before it made its way back on the market. And while renewed items are cleaned, you\u2019ll still need to consider your comfort with sanitation issues when buying things like headphones and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-clean-airpods-earbuds-150023325.html\">earbuds</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"Laptop and smartphone on round wooden table in cozy interior.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/47ede810-b794-11ed-bf3c-9f9744cc21f9\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Polina Lebed via Getty Images</div></figure><h2>Where to buy refurbished tech</h2><p>We recommend going directly to the manufacturer whenever possible, especially for more technical items like smartphones and laptops. If you need a new MacBook, check out Apple\u2019s refurbished stock first; if you want a new Galaxy phone, hit up Samsung before anyone else. Repairs will be handled using genuine parts and you\u2019re far more likely to get items that were properly unpaired from the original owner and all data wiped.</p><p>Retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy are decent options if you\u2019re on a tighter budget or if you\u2019re looking for gadgets from a manufacturer that may not have its own refurbished outlet. Refurbished marketplaces like <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=095df20e-ca48-43fe-a821-c8ca385b8c19&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Decluttr&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwOTVkZjIwZS1jYTQ4LTQzZmUtYTgyMS1jOGNhMzg1YjhjMTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVjbHV0dHIuY29tL3VzL3N0b3JlLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmNmZDAyNmItZmRiMi00ZGQ0LWEwZjUtM2Q0MWU2YjE2ZTI3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAfI_6Y5O87vM5l3oSGRdNGuXPjVw5Tk9ku43UJI6Wk8_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2F\">Decluttr</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a9a1be1f-e2dd-40b6-bafb-18c590cf281b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Back+Market&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhOWExYmUxZi1lMmRkLTQwYjYtYmFmYi0xOGM1OTBjZjI4MWIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmFja21hcmtldC5jb20vZW4tdXMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjJjZmQwMjZiLWZkYjItNGRkNC1hMGY1LTNkNDFlNmIxNmUyNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVfApr-m0ZebMWLLtvOtmJuIF_AyQw3kwF17BA1LbKlh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backmarket.com%2Fen-us\">BackMarket</a> can be useful if you\u2019re looking for older, more specific items, or if price is the number one factor for your purchase.</p><h3><strong>Apple</strong></h3><p>They may offer <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-now-offering-less-for-some-iphone-trade-ins-231530059.html\">less</a> than they once did for trade-ins but <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3Nob3AvcmVmdXJiaXNoZWQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjJjZmQwMjZiLWZkYjItNGRkNC1hMGY1LTNkNDFlNmIxNmUyNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAd5tahcLe_qd3gydebgOhsARulkDwNkaODagOOLeevr1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished\">Apple</a> is still pulling in a decent inventory of refurbished MacBooks, iPads and other devices. Each refurbished piece undergoes an inspection and repairs using original Apple parts, with refurbished iPhones and iPads getting new batteries and outer shells. In addition to phones and tablets, Apple sells refurbished MacBooks, Watches, Apple TVs and accessories like the Apple Pencil. Everything is shipped in a new box with whatever cables, accessories and operating systems a new item would get. Items get the same one-year warranty and 14-day returns window that Apple offers on new products as well.</p><a class=\"athena-button rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=shopnow-button&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3Nob3AvcmVmdXJiaXNoZWQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjJjZmQwMjZiLWZkYjItNGRkNC1hMGY1LTNkNDFlNmIxNmUyNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAd5tahcLe_qd3gydebgOhsARulkDwNkaODagOOLeevr1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished\" id=\"37204b6352d948fca7df9657d27541ce\">Shop Apple Refurbished</a><h3><strong>Samsung</strong></h3><p>While they accept just about <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvdHJhZGUtaW4vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyY2ZkMDI2Yi1mZGIyLTRkZDQtYTBmNS0zZDQxZTZiMTZlMjcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVMDC69EEdghopdol9ePWwO0LIKH6bp1-VYCiIZvqYFi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftrade-in%2F\">any device</a> as a trade-in, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc21hcnRwaG9uZXMvY2VydGlmaWVkLXJlLW5ld2VkLXBob25lcy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjJjZmQwMjZiLWZkYjItNGRkNC1hMGY1LTNkNDFlNmIxNmUyNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfyRg_Z_-ix_36cN3Kxdr2PMWbZVetpCfDlD5Li_hZvG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fcertified-re-newed-phones%2F\">Samsung</a> only regularly offers refurbished smartphones on its site \u2013 you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere for a renewed Samsung tablet or smartwatch.

But now the company is back to introduce some fresh budget-friendly fare as part of its new  \u201cvalue-oriented\u201d LOQ line. Though they aren\u2019t quite as powerful as their more expensive siblings, after checking them out, I like how these new devices don\u2019t feel cheap despite their lower prices.</p><p>At launch, the LOQ family (pronounced \u201clock\u201d) will consist of either a 15 or 16-inch laptop and a 17L desktop PC. The LOQ 15 and 15i will be the least expensive of the bunch starting at $900 for either an AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS or Intel Core i7-13700 chip, while the LOQ 16 and 16i (the \u201ci\u201d denotes an Intel-based config) will go for just a bit more at $960 and $1,150, respectively. Finally, for people who don\u2019t need to move their gaming rig around, the LOQ tower will be priced at a reasonable $980.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"One difference on the LOQ family compared to the more premium Legion line is that you only get white or four-zone lighting instead of a full per-key RGB setup. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/497fccb0-c8ed-11ed-93fd-2c696ab97439\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>But more importantly, while Lenovo is trying to keep costs down, it doesn\u2019t feel like it cut too many corners with its new machines. Not only do they have similar styling to the Legion line, they also have solid specs with the laptops offering support for up to NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPUs. And like the premium Legion line, you also get rear IO to help keep wires from getting too cluttered.</p><p>The main differences between Lenovo\u2019s LOQ and Legion gaming notebooks are that instead of an aluminum chassis, the LOQ line features a plastic body, with either a white or a four-zone RGB backlit keyboard (instead of per-key). The new machines also carry slightly smaller batteries (either 60 or 80Whr depending on the model). And while the LOQ line doesn\u2019t support super fast 240Hz refresh rates, you can still get 165Hz displays going up to 2,560 x 1,600 with variable refresh rate support (both G-Sync and FreeSync), as well as 350 nits of brightness. All told that\u2019s not too shabby, especially when you consider that Lenovo\u2019s cheapest Legion Pro laptop currently starts at just over $1,600.</p><figure><img alt=\"To help keep clutter to a minimum, the LOQ 15 and 16 rely primarily on rear IO with only a couple of ports on the sides for easy access. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/cd5af240-c8ec-11ed-b53e-b42eb414fa77\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Now, in person, the smaller LOQ 15 came off a bit chunky, and I swear it felt heavier than Lenovo\u2019s 5.3-pound listed weight, while the LOQ 16 is even heftier at 5.7 pounds. However, I appreciate that even on Lenovo\u2019s budget gaming laptops, the company still included a full HD webcam and an electronic shutter switch to disable it.</p><p>Alternatively, if you\u2019re looking for something a bit more powerful that\u2019s still easy to carry around, today Lenovo also announced two additions to the Legion family in the Slim 7/7i and the Slim 5/5i.</p><p>At just 0.78 inches thick and weighing 4.4 pounds, the Legion Slim 7 and 7i are the more portable of the two. It also packs Intel Core i9-13900H or Ryzen 9 79040HS chips, up to NVIDIA RTX 4070 graphics and up to a 3.2K 165Hz display or a 2,560 x 1,600 240Hz screen. You can also get optional per-key RGB lighting and a big 99.9 WHr battery, along with an aluminum frame in either storm gray or glacier white. So while I like the price of the new LOQ line, the Legion 7 Slim laptops would make me think long and hard about shelling out some extra cash for the sleeker design.</p><figure><img alt=\"While similar in design to the more affordable LOQ line, the Legion Slim 5 and Slim offer slightly more powerful specs in a more premium aluminum chassis. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/93e74e00-c8ec-11ed-bfbf-d57c8e4db139\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, the Legion 5 Slim models still feature solid specs, including the same CPUs and a slightly wider range of graphics options (RTX 4050 up to RTX 4070 depending on the specific config). And unlike the 7 Slim which is only available as a 16-inch model, the 5 Slim will come in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes.</p><p>The new LOQ 15i is slated to go on sale first sometime in April, followed by LOQ 15 and the larger LOQ 16i in May. The AMD-based LOQ 16 will arrive in June. Meanwhile,  the Legion Slim 5i and 7i are expected to go on sale in April starting at $1,350 and $1,770, with the Slim 5 and Slim 7 arriving later in May starting at $1,200 and $1,770, respectively.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-loq15-gaming-laptop-hands-on-affordable-but-not-cheap-130050043.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-loq15-gaming-laptop-hands-on-affordable-but-not-cheap-130050043.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-23 13:00:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "\u2018Star Trek: Picard\u2019 thinks the kids aren\u2019t alright", "description": "<p><em>The following article discusses Star Trek: Picard, Season Three, Episode Six, \u201cThe Bounty.\u201d</em></p><p>When the <em>Original Series</em> cast made their swansong, they left Star Trek in the rudest health it had ever been in. <em>The Next Generation</em> had reached its creative peak, <em>Deep Space Nine</em> was a year away from starting, and the movie series was making good money. <em>The Undiscovered Country</em> gave fans one last adventure with Kirk and co. that gently highlighted why it was time to move on. By comparison, <em>Nemesis\u2019</em> soft box office meant there would be no grand finale for the <em>TNG</em> crew. <em>DS9</em> and <em>Voyager</em> were done, and it wouldn\u2019t be long before pre-Kirk prequel-series <em>Enterprise</em> would leave our screens. There was quite literally nobody to pick up from where Picard and co. left off as \u201ccurrent day\u201d Trek went into enforced stasis. Now, it feels like 2002 all over again, with the only \u201ccurrent\u201d Trek series, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-ending-season-5-next-year-070320271.html\"><em>Discovery, canceled</em></a> and the only other live-action Trek show yet again being a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-110-a-quality-of-mercy-review-130037849.html\">pre-Kirk era prequel</a>. They <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm\">say</a> that history repeats itself, the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>This sense of unease about the future permeates \u201cThe Bounty,\u201d as <em>Star Trek: Picard </em>hints that the next (next) generation aren\u2019t up to scratch. Picard, Riker and LaForge are all fathers struggling to deal with the gifts and curses they handed down to their children. The show keeps implying that there\u2019s less hope in these kids because they\u2019ve spent so long in their parents\u2019 shadow. Sidney LaForge isn\u2019t speaking to her father, who grouses to Picard how hard it was to raise her. The show has already hamfistedly tried to cover Riker\u2019s grief over Thaddeus, while Picard has given his son a terminal case of Irumodic Syndrome. When Jack gets the idea of stealing the Bounty\u2019s cloaking device, he and Sydney can\u2019t get it working without Geordie\u2019s resentful help. Come on kids, get out of the way while dad, once again, picks up your mess and fixes the things you can\u2019t cope with. The subtext is one of disappointment, of darn kids with their <em>avocado lattes and oat milk toast</em> who can\u2019t do anything as well as their baby boomer forebears.</p><p>It\u2019s an interesting perspective from a franchise that has always worried about its own coolness, fretting that it\u2019s too thoughtful, too <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2016/06/24/star-trek-insurrection-age-hollywood/\"><em>middle-aged</em></a>. Chekov joined <em>The Original Series</em> cast because producers wanted to woo a younger crowd with a Davy Jones-type mop-topped pretty boy. This anxiety is most visible in the <em>Next Generation</em> movies, which are constantly battling each other in attitudes around age, aging and relevance. <em>Generations</em> leaves Picard at peace with his own age, but everything that follows repudiates that position, mostly as Patrick Stewart\u2019s behind the scenes power grew, so did his desire to remake the character in his own image. The vest-clad man of action in <em>First Contact,</em> the romantic lead of <em>Insurrection</em> and the off-roading petrolhead in <em>Nemesis</em> all stem from this desire. Rather than a desire to become the wise, elder statesman of the Star Trek universe, Picard raged against the dying of his own light. And rather than lay the table for his successors, he judged them all and found them unworthy.</p><p>This mistrust of youth goes hand-in-hand with a fetishization of the past that goes beyond nostalgia and into paraphilia. \u201cThe Bounty\u201d has not one, but <em>two</em> trips to space museums so that the fans can gawk at objects of desire, stripped of their context, there for nothing but fan service. Riker, Worf and Raffi beam onto Daystrom Station, home of Starfleet\u2019s \u201cmost off the books tech, experimental weapons, alien contraband,\u201d which when you think about it is really daft. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t think the US Navy stores secret chemical weapons at MIT, which is, or was, the best point of comparison for a civilian robotics research institute. Along the corridor, there\u2019s the Genesis Device! (Why? It was blown up when the Reliant combusted and turned into the Genesis Planet, its existence makes no sense) A Tribble! And James Kirk\u2019s Corpse!... Wait, that seems weird, why do that? That seems weirdly perverse, why would you store a decorated officer\u2019s dead body in a site for military weapons when there\u2019s nothing special about his physiology in this timeline? Oh, that\u2019s why, because our heroes don\u2019t get to gracefully die in Star Trek any more, they just become objects of fetishization.</p><p>We get a brief cameo from Daniel Davis\u2019 Moriarty as part of Daystrom\u2019s not-quite security system before we hit the big reveal of the episode: Data!. Or, something else, a Soong-type android with the brains of Soong, Lore, B-4 and Data all mashed up in one body. (Why B-4 and Lore? Why would you put the unworkable prototype and the psychotic brains in there with the two functional ones? Because we\u2019ll need an inevitable betrayal two or three episodes down the line, not because it makes sense.) And then we\u2019re off to the fleet museum for a brief interlude of spaceship porn and, wouldn\u2019t you know, the ships deemed worthy of preserving are almost all hero vessels from the Star Trek franchise. I mean, look, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-motion-picture-4k-2022-directors-edition-150018799.html\">I\u2019m a starship porn type of  guy,</a> and any loving shot of Andrew Probert and Richard Taylor\u2019s Enterprise model will always have my heart soaring. But it just feels all so soulless, like the characters in Star Trek are now behaving like Star Trek fans.</p><p>The conclusion of the episode reveals the changelings stole Picard\u2019s corpse from Daystrom Station for reasons as-yet unknown. Meanwhile, Riker has been captured by Vadic and taken to the Shrike, where he\u2019s shown that the baddies have also captured Deanna. But not before the 70-year-old Riker is given a dose of good old <em>24</em>-style face punching, to match the rest of the series\u2019 Bush-era politics.</p><p>The biggest problem with this sort of all-the-characters-grew-up-watching-Star Trek nostalgia, of course, is that it collapses the size of your narrative universe. Star Trek is big and broad enough to sustain a massive trans-media ecosystem covering every corner of its fictional universe. But <em>Star Trek: Picard</em> makes out that Starfleet is made up of five ships not called Enterprise, none of which are worth remarking upon. The notion that the Enterprise is just one of hundreds, or thousands, of starships having wild and crazy adventures on the frontiers of space is beyond comprehension. In a way, I\u2019m glad nobody in TV-land is familiar with Star Trek: <a href=\"https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_New_Frontier\"><em>New Frontier</em></a>, lest it turned out that someone at Daystrom has collected Mackenzie Calhoun\u2019s eyeballs on a shelf for the lolz.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-3-6-the-bounty-review-130030243.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-3-6-the-bounty-review-130030243.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-23 13:00:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Samsung SSDs and memory cards are up to 54 percent off at Amazon", "description": "<p>You can grab Samsung SSDs and microSDs at a discount right now from Amazon if you're looking to expand the storage space of your computers, consoles or mobile devices.

WhatsApp says it will increase these limits further to allow for even larger calls in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to announcing the new client's improved calling features, it also touched upon some of its other recent upgrades. The messenger updated its multi-device capabilities to make it easier and faster to link new devices to user accounts. WhatApp also enabled better syncing so that people can simultaneously access their chats on up to four linked devices.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The service launched <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-phone-multi-device-end-to-end-encryption-192123565.html\">true multi-device syncing</a> in 2021, allowing people to access their accounts even if their phone is offline or nowhere nearby. After that, WhatsApp must have recognized the need for better apps on different platforms for users to be able to enjoy using the messenger on multiple devices. WhatsApp first released a native app for Windows 10 in 2022, and back in January, it made the beta version of its native app <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/whatsapps-native-mac-app-beta-is-now-available-to-all-113517461.html\">for Mac available to all users</a>.

Its latest is the Watch Ultimate, a super-premium wearable for extreme sports types who want a statement piece on their wrist. In the style of a Submariner or Seamaster, the Ultimate has a top right-mounted rotating crown and two pushers, one top left, the other bottom right. Available in blue and black, the cases are clad in an \u201cinnovative zirconium-based liquid metal material,\u201d which sounds a lot like the LiquidMetal-brand alloy found in a number of modern Omega watches.</p><p>You\u2019ll get a different strap choice depending on which watch face you opt for, with the more premium blue option getting a titanium alloy band. Select black, and you\u2019ll get both a standard length HNBR (rubber) band and a long-length one to wear while scuba diving. It\u2019s for this purpose that Huawei is really pushing the Watch Ultimate, saying that it\u2019ll last for up to 24 hours at depths of 110 meters. Huawei added a number of extra software features for technical divers, but it\u2019s not clear how many deep-diving pros would trade in their mechanical watch for a digital alternative.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Nestled inside the case is a 1.5-inch LTPO AMOLED display with a 466 x 466 resolution and a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits underneath a 2.3mm sapphire glass crystal. It\u2019s running Harmony OS, with the same sort of features found in the existing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/huawei-watch-gt-3-pro-2022-123011253.html\">Watch GT</a> series of wearables, with the only major changes being a China-exclusive Golf mode and the aforementioned diving specific features.</p><p>Another much-ballyhooed feature is the battery life, with Huawei promising that you\u2019ll get 14 days battery life if you\u2019re not using it too much. More realistically, you should expect to get closer to eight days out of the thing with what I\u2019d consider more normal use. The company didn\u2019t disclose how long you\u2019d last if, say, you did a long run with GPS enabled but we\u2019d expect that 530mAh cell to last long enough for most folks to complete a marathon, for instance.&nbsp;</p><p>As well as integrations with Strava and Runtastic, there\u2019s the usual raft of Huawei-branded fitness tracking features. That includes its TruSeen 5.0 heart-rate monitoring, TruSleep 3.0 sleep tracking plus a built-in ECG and continuous SpO2 monitoring. There\u2019s a new Expedition Mode, too, which harnesses the dual-band GPS to ensure you know where you are no matter how far you stray from the path. Huawei says that you\u2019ll get the battery from flat to full in 60 minutes and you\u2019ll get a 25 percent charge in just 10 minutes.</p><p>In terms of pricing, Huawei won\u2019t be announcing that until April 2nd, the day before it becomes available in the UK and Europe. We do know, however, that there\u2019ll be no LTE-enabled model and no emergency calling options, it\u2019ll be strictly Bluetooth only.

It's a completely different division from Oculus Studios, which is the company's label for first-party games. Oculus Publishing will instead support partner developers with conceptualization, funding, technological help, as well as promotion and merchandising. While the name is new, the division itself isn't. It had previously funded and supported over 300 titles, including <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-showcase-nfl-vr-game-moss-book-2-among-us-172621081.html\"><em>Among Us VR</em></a>, <em>Bonelab</em> and <em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em>.</p><p>The company has also revealed that Oculus Publishing has over 150 titles currently in development, which bodes well for the Quest 3 that's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-2023-233025187.html\">expected to arrive this year</a>. Previous reports suggested that the next-gen Quest will be thinner and more powerful than its predecessor and will have mixed reality capabilities. That could mean that some of these new titles \u2014 Meta unfortunately didn't name any of them in its announcement \u2014 may have features that weren't possible for older games.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>At the moment, users still have more than 500 titles to choose from in the Meta Quest Store, and they seem to be doing well. Last year, the company said the games and apps on the store had surpassed $1.5 billion in revenue, with 40 titles grossing over $10 million. In addition, the number of titles that had reached $20 million in revenue had doubled year-over-year.</p><div id=\"7200a6646f4e4537abb992f85f3a9d32\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/metas-vr-game-publisher-is-now-called-oculus-publishing-080138830.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/metas-vr-game-publisher-is-now-called-oculus-publishing-080138830.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-23 08:01:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Ableton's Live 11 music production software is 20 percent off", "description": "<p>Digital audio workstations (DAWs) are the key to making music or other productions on a computer, and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-11-daw-hands-on-review-upgrades-explained-160047192.html\">Ableton's Live 11</a> is one of the most popular apps around.

If those tokens sound familiar even to non-hardcore crypto enthusiasts, it's because several celebrities had promoted them on social media \u2014 and now they're also being charged by the agency. According to the SEC, eight celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, Soulja Boy, Ne-Yo and Akon, illegally promoted the tokens online without disclosing that they were paid to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;...Sun paid celebrities with millions of social media followers to tout the unregistered offerings, while specifically directing that they not disclose their compensation. This is the very conduct that the federal securities laws were designed to protect against regardless of the labels Sun and others used,&quot; Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>All celebrities charged, with the exception of Soulja Boy and musician Austin Mahone, have agreed to pay a collective amount of $400,000 in penalties to settle the charges. It's not the first time the SEC went after celebrities shilling crypto on social media \u2014 it previously charged Kim Kardashian and NBA Hall of Famer Paul Pierce for posting about EthereumMax's EMAX tokens without revealing that they had been paid for the promotion. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kim-kardashian-sec-charges-crypto-instagram-stories-142300194.html\">Kardashian paid $1.26 million</a> to settle the charges against her, while <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nba-legend-paul-pierce-settles-with-sec-over-allegedly-false-crypto-statements-192355116.html\">Pierce paid $1.4 million</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As for Sun himself, the SEC accused him of violating antifraud and market manipulation provisions of the federal securities laws. The agency said he offered the tokens as investments through unregistered bounty programs that prompted participants to promote the tokens on social media and to recruit others. In addition, the SEC also accused Sun of directing employees to artificially inflate the value of Tronix by simultaneously selling and purchasing the token to make it appear actively traded.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;As alleged in the complaint,&quot; Grewal said, &quot;Sun and others used an age-old playbook to mislead and harm investors by first offering securities without complying with registration and disclosure requirements and then manipulating the market for those very securities.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sec-charges-lindsay-lohan-and-other-celebrities-for-illegally-touting-crypto-045711820.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/sec-charges-lindsay-lohan-and-other-celebrities-for-illegally-touting-crypto-045711820.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-23 04:57:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
