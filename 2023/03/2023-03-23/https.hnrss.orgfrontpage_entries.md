## Launch HN: Helicone.ai (YC W23) – Open-source logging for OpenAI

<p>Hi HN - Justin, Scott, and Barak here. We're excited to introduce Helicone (<a href="https://www.helicone.ai">https://www.helicone.ai</a>) an open-source logging solution for OpenAi applications. Helicone's one-line integration logs the prompts, completions, latencies, and costs of your OpenAI requests. It currently works with GPT, and can be integrated with one line of code. There’s a demo at <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/video">https://www.helicone.ai/video</a>.<p>Helicone's core technology is a proxy that routes all your OpenAI requests through our edge-deployed Cloudflare Workers. These workers are incredibly reliable and cause no discernible latency impact in production environments. As a proxy, we offer more than just observability: we provide caching and prompt formatting, and we'll soon add user rate limiting and model provider back off to make sure your app is still up when OpenAI is down.<p>Our web application then provides insights into key metrics, such as which users are disproportionately driving costs and what is the token usage broken down by prompts. You can filter this data based on custom logic and export it to other destinations.<p>Getting started with Helicone is quick and easy, regardless of the OpenAI SDK you use. Our proxy-based solution does not require a third party package—simply change your request's base URL from <a href="https://api.openai.com/v1" rel="nofollow">https://api.openai.com/v1</a> to <a href="https://oai.hconeai.com/v1" rel="nofollow">https://oai.hconeai.com/v1</a>. Helicone can be integrated with LangChain, LLama Index, and all other OpenAI native libraries. (<a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/quickstart/integrate-in-one-line-of-code">https://docs.helicone.ai/quickstart/integrate-in-one-line-of...</a>)<p>We have exciting new features coming up, one of which is an API to log user feedback. For instance, if you're developing a tool like GitHub Copilot, you can log when a user accepted or rejected a suggestion. Helicone will then aggregate your result quality into metrics and make finetuning suggestions for when you can save costs or improve performance.<p>Before launching Helicone, we developed several projects with GPT-3, including airapbattle.com, tabletalk.ai, and dreamsubmarine.com. For each project, we used a beta version of Helicone which gave us instant visibility into user engagement and result quality issues. As we talked to more builders and companies, we realized they were spending too much time building in-house solutions like this and that existing analytics products were not tailored to inference endpoints like GPT-3.<p>Helicone is developed under the Common Clause V1.0 w/ Apache 2.0 license so that you can use Helicone within your own infrastructure. If you do not want to self-host, we provide a hosted solution with 1k requests free per month to try our product. If you exceed that we offer a paid subscription as well, and you can view our pricing at <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/pricing">https://www.helicone.ai/pricing</a>.<p>We're thrilled to introduce Helicone to the HackerNews community and would love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and experiences related to LLM logging and analytics. We're eager to engage in meaningful discussions, so please don't hesitate to share your insights and feedback with us!</p>

## Retool (YC W17) is hiring hackers to combine visual programming with AI

<p>Hi HN,<p>We’re Retool (<a href="https://retool.com" rel="nofollow">https://retool.com</a>), a visual programming environment for building internal tools. Here’s a 3 minute demo video: <a href="https://d3399nw8s4ngfo.cloudfront.net/videos/intro-to-retool.mp4" rel="nofollow">https://d3399nw8s4ngfo.cloudfront.net/videos/intro-to-retool...</a>.<p>You can think of Retool as something like Visual Basic, but in the cloud. The idea is that there are lots of internal applications that businesses need, and today, build from scratch (probably via React). But while React is great for many things (our landing page is built in React, our product is built in React, etc.), it’s possible that it might be overkill for building a simple form that POSTs data back to your API. (Who _wants_ to worry about debouncing the submit button, handling errors from the backend, and authenticating and authorizing the users?)<p>We launched on HN around five years ago (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17725966" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17725966</a>). Since then, we’ve launched three new products – a native mobile product (<a href="https://retool.com/products/mobile" rel="nofollow">https://retool.com/products/mobile</a>), an automation product for developers (<a href="https://retool.com/products/workflows/" rel="nofollow">https://retool.com/products/workflows/</a>), and a database product (<a href="https://retool.com/products/database/" rel="nofollow">https://retool.com/products/database/</a>). We’ve hired and grown the team to over 350, and are proud to have businesses like Doordash, NBC Universal, Mercedes Benz, and the NFL using Retool.<p>The network at Retool is also fairly strong — our lead investors in the Series B were Sequoia, along with Elad Gil, Nat Friedman, as well as John and Patrick Collison. Other investors include the founders of Github, Gusto, Segment, PagerDuty, Plaid, etc.<p>This year, while other companies are downsizing, we’re doubling down. (Literally.) We’re attempting to double our engineering, product, and design orgs this year. We think the opportunity to invent the future of programming is enormous, and we’re looking for more hackers to join our team.<p>We think that AI is going to change the way people build software. We think that there is tremendous potential in building interfaces that help humans and AI collaborate together to build software. We want to build a world where humans can quickly assemble full applications by just providing high level directions to AI.<p>We believe we’re set up especially well to do just that – we have all the building blocks for creating software (frontends, backend compute, data storage) as well as a live interactive builder environment. Why entangle yourself with messy things like Webpack, Docker, and Kubernetes when you can directly manipulate a live app, running right in front of you?<p>We also think that the world. as a whole, is under-utilizing AI. Businesses are broadly interested in generative AI and LLMs, but don’t know how yet to leverage and use them. It should be simple for businesses to quickly set up flows to have AI automatically triage bug reports, summarize customer feedback, and enrich datasets.<p>We’ve shared a sneak peak of what we think some of this could look like (<a href="https://retool.com/blog/gpt4-in-retool/" rel="nofollow">https://retool.com/blog/gpt4-in-retool/</a>), and there’s a bunch more coming up that we’re really excited to talk about soon.<p>If you’re interested in working with AIs and LLMs to change the way companies build software, we’d love to hear from you. We've made multiple hires from HN in the past, so we’re posting here. But if you know any friends who are interested, feel free to tell them to reach out as well.<p>Please email me at david AT retool with “HN” in the subject line.<p>Thanks!</p>

## Show HN: Datapane – A new way to build reports, dashboards, and apps in Python
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35274788](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35274788)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage

<p>Hello HN! We’re Leo and Mandeep, founders of Datapane (<a href="https://datapane.com" rel="nofollow">https://datapane.com</a>).<p>We're building a way to create reports, dashboards, and web apps from your existing data using Python. Think of it as a combination of React and htmx, specifically designed for the Python data stack.<p>Our GitHub is <a href="https://github.com/datapane/datapane">https://github.com/datapane/datapane</a> and you can try building a report or app in ~2 minutes on Codespaces: <a href="https://try.datapane.com" rel="nofollow">https://try.datapane.com</a><p>We started building Datapane at our previous start-up, where we struggled to deliver ML model results to clients. Much to our surprise, the data science took less time than repeatedly creating reports by copying and pasting plots into PowerPoint decks.<p>It seemed absurd that we had to switch to PowerPoint or legacy BI tools like Tableau to share, and our initial goal was to programmatically generate reports using the datasets and plots we had in Python. To enable this, we started hacking on a Python-based UI framework for constructing HTML views from data-centric blocks – like plots, data tables, and layout components.<p>You can export these to standalone HTML files, or host them as a web app on somewhere like GitHub Pages or Fly.io. We recently also added the ability to connect Python functions to forms and front-end events so you can build web apps which run backend code. We handle the entire network and RPC layer, so you only need to write plain Python functions that take parameters and return other blocks.<p>You can check out an example of the code to create a simple app: <a href="https://github.com/datapane/examples/blob/main/apps/iris-plotter/app.py">https://github.com/datapane/examples/blob/main/apps/iris-plo...</a><p>Datapane’s philosophy is pretty different from other products in the space.<p>We wanted to keep things simple, but avoid the footguns our users faced with frameworks like Streamlit, where the reactive/network-aware model was hard to move beyond an MVP or POC. For backend interactivity, we believe the original web got a lot right, and unlike reactive models which rely on websockets, Datapane is unashamedly request/response. This takes inspiration from HTTP and our own experiences with htmx, which offers an elegant way to add interactivity to HTML. Under the hood, we actually compile down to a (gasp!) XML-based hypermedia format, akin to HTML, but tailored specifically for constructing data UIs.<p>The result is that not every change in your app requires a server round trip, as much of it can be pre rendered and most interactivity happens on the client-side. In addition to improving performance, this also makes running in production become 10x simpler.<p>This separation between the view and backend compute also makes Datapane modular. If our app server isn’t a good fit for your use-case, serve Datapane views from the web-framework of your choice (we’ve been hacking on serving views from Django). Want to compute blocks from inside Airflow or generate them on a schedule or from a webhook? Computation can happen out of band of the UI. You can even build and host apps from inside of Jupyter, where you can preview blocks live and convert notebook cells to blocks in your view.<p>We currently offer a hosting platform on <a href="https://datapane.com" rel="nofollow">https://datapane.com</a> for sharing reports publicly (free) or with your team (paid), and will be adding serverless app hosting support to it in the next few weeks.<p>Our ultimate goal is to create an open-source toolkit for building data products across the entire stack – from reports, to dashboards, to full-stack apps – all using 100% Python. You can see a few we’ve built already in our gallery: <a href="https://datapane.com/gallery" rel="nofollow">https://datapane.com/gallery</a><p>We’d love to hear your feedback.<p>Thanks!</p>
