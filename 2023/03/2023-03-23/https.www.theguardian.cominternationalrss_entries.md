<p>The 2023 season reads three losses from three but Tim Sheens has something dangerous bubbling behind the scenes</p><p>Out at Wests Tigers HQ there’s not much doing. No players running drills. No fans waiting for selfies. No camera crews hovering. It’s just me, a skinny Burmese cat and New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet slinking around (the latter “just passing by”). These are the chilly winds which greet a side that loses three straight to start the season and hasn’t played finals since 2011.</p><p>Turns out the turf, much like the team, is under renovation so the Tigers are training in an adjacent park that, in 1793, was once the old Longbottom convict stockade - a barracks, refuge and home base for a long line of rebels, escapees and enforcers. Together as a gang, these exiles worked the lands of what is today the industrial hub of Tigerland, sharing every season of boom and bust and, when deemed ‘men of good character’, winning freedom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/24/hope-springs-eternal-as-wests-tigers-work-to-get-off-the-nrls-ground-floor">Continue reading...</a>

I’m grateful for the support and thankful for the people who have stood firm with me.

<p>The official narrative in China is that the US responds to problems militarily, while China uses dialogue, and there are signs this narrative is catching on</p><p>As Xi Jinping returns to Beijing after his first trip to Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine, the contradictory forces that dominate the Chinese leader’s relationship with Moscow are no closer to being resolved. Xi wants to be a strong ally to Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, and a global peacemaker. Both cannot be true.</p><p>The red carpet and more – a brass band, Siberian salmon – was rolled out for Xi’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/putins-two-day-charm-offensive-with-xi-underlines-whos-boss">two-day visit</a> to Moscow. Xi and Putin raised a glass to the “deepening of the Russian-Chinese partnership”. As well as shared political and economic interests, the relationship is also characterised to an unusual degree by the personal bond between Xi and Putin. Xi has described the Russian president as his “best friend” and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/10-years-strengthening-ties-between-putin-xi-china-russia">has said</a> that their characters are alike.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/xi-jinping-trip-moscow-didnt-impress-west-but-his-most-important-audience-is-at-home-china">Continue reading...</a>
