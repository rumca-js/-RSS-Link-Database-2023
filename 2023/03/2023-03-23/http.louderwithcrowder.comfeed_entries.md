This teacher opened the video by saying, <em>"If you're someone who doesn't agree with, like, kids learning about transgender people, please just scroll and keep your negativity to myself."  </em>To which I say, no. I will not keep scrolling. I <em>will</em> keep my negativity to myself, but I won't keep basic biological and Biblical truths to myself.

<p>The teacher explained how the class was comparing the Civil Rights Movement to civil rights that are being fought for today. Which naturally led to the transgender discussion. Which, naturally, 7-year-olds did not understand. So this teacher explained in an, ahem, <em>"age appropriate" </em>way. </p><p><em>"I simply said that a transgender person is born in a boy or girl body and then in their heart they know that that doesn't match who they are, and so, they might then identify by a different gender. It might be a boy who identifies as a girl, a girl who identifies as a boy [...] or someone who feels like neither." </em></p><p><em>"Why I felt okay sharing this was because they know that I identify as neither. I go by Mx and not Mr or Miss. Also, I told them about the trans teacher that teaches third grade."</em></p><p>Wonderful. Just wonderful. Who would've thought that, in the year of our Lord 2023, the Civil Rights Movement would be used to indoctrinate 2nd-graders with radical gender theory? Wokeism never fails to surprise me. </p>

## Domestic violence charges that got "Rick and Morty" co-creator canceled have been DROPPED and he's speaking out

News broke he was charged with domestic violence. Roiland denied the charges, but you know how it goes. </p><p>Those charges were just DROPPED and Roiland is speaking out. He says in a statement, "I have always known that these claims were false—and I never had any doubt that this day would come. I'm thankful that this case has been dismissed but, at the same time, I'm still deeply shaken by the horrible lies that were reported about me during this process."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">justice <a href="https://t.co/1q9M4GA6MV">pic.twitter.com/1q9M4GA6MV</a><br />— Justin Roiland (@JustinRoiland) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1638629789258100737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Roiland will now work on rebuilding his reputation, and says of his wrongful termination, "I'm disappointed that so many people were so quick to judge without knowing the facts, based solely on the word of an embittered ex trying to bypass due process and have me 'canceled.'"</p><p>The alleged incident happened in January of 2020. Roiland pleaded not guilty in October 2020, and a hearing was set for April 2023. But news leaked in January 2023 of what Roiland was alleged to have done, so of course Roiland had to get fired on the grounds of he was accused of doing something. After all, bloggers and Twitter randos might get upset if he wasn't.</p><p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/justin-roiland-charges-dropped-rcna76236" target="_blank">Those charges were dropped yesterday</a> when "significant additional information came to light" that led to the DAs office to  "dismiss the charges because there was insufficient evidence to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt." It's unclear what that significant information was. It could be that "Jane Doe" was caught lying. Or, something else.</p><p>Admittedly, I never watched the cartoon before. I fell off with Adult Swim after <em>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</em>. But this clip always cracks me up.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Playoffs time!

Republican lawmakers are calling to ban the app since it's a horrific national security concern. Democrats are calling to not ban it, due to its, er, "fun" features. What's a little espionage when you have endless videos of teenage girls lip-syncing the latest pop songs?</p><p>Crowder also explained the current onslaught of propaganda trying to convince Americans to support <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-ceo-hearing-show-notes" target="_blank">TikTok</a>. For the fun, of course. He also highlighted recent comments by Senator Josh Hawley on just how far the dangers of TikTok go. Crowder honed in on several shaky answers from Chew, including claims about sharing user information overseas, the ownership of TikTok, and selective enforcement of rules about inciting violence. </p><p>A major highlight of the testimony was Rep. Kat Cammack's scathing questioning of Mr. Chew. Cammack left him speechless when she shared a video from TikTok promoting violence against the ongoing committee:<em> "This video was posted before this hearing was publicly noticed [...] But more concerning is the fact that it names this chairwoman by name. Your own community guidelines state that you have a firm stance against enabling violence on or off TikTok [...] This video has been up for 41 days.

And of course it's <a href="https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1638684311124844545?s=20" target="_blank">because of racism</a>. What else.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Rep. Jamaal Bowman blasts efforts to ban TikTok as ‘racist’ <a href="https://t.co/zez8mVX4Sc">https://t.co/zez8mVX4Sc</a> <a href="https://t.co/i2O1C2Xm43">pic.twitter.com/i2O1C2Xm43</a><br />— New York Post (@nypost) <a href="https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1638684311124844545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>This whole argument began because Biden signed legislation that bans government agencies from using <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-ceo-hearing-show-notes" target="_blank">TikTok</a> on their federal devices. Y'know, to prevent the Chines Communist Party from spying on us. No biggie.  But <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jamaal-bowman-midterms-civil-war" target="_blank">Rep. Jamaal Bowman</a> apparently doesn't mind a little spying, since he asked Congress and the public to <em>“not be racist towards China and express our xenophobia when it comes to TikTok.”</em><br /></p><p><em>"As we know, Republicans in particular, have been sounding the alarm, creating the red scare around China."</em></p><p>Yeeeaaah, I don't think this has anything to do with Americans not liking Chinese people. It's definitely the extreme lack of security of the app. TikTok's parent company <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2022/10/20/tiktok-bytedance-surveillance-american-user-data/?sh=2658728d6c2d" target="_blank">literally</a> wanted to use the app to monitor the location of specific American citizens. And it can apparently track you <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/dont-use-tiktok-china-owned-social-network-still-your-data" target="_blank">even if you've never used the app before</a>. </p><p>According to the cybersecurity company Feroot, TikTok has trackers in it called pixels that can show up on any website that has a TikTok video embedded in it. These pixels can track usernames, passwords, credit cards, banking information, and details about personal health. So I sincerely apologize for the TikToks I have embedded on this website. I just wanted to share the laughs with y'all, but the CCP has other plans. </p><p>But don't fret - Bowman also said TikTok is no less secure than Facebook and Twitter. So either he's lying, or we have a bigger problem with Big Tech. And his real zinger of an argument came when he claimed Republicans just want to ban the Chinese Communist app because they, and I quote, "don't have swag".</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Rep.

It's not the rampant national security concerns from one of America's biggest geopolitical foes. Mitch McConnell is just jealous of TikTok's plethora of swaggy dancing 13-year-olds. Nailed it.<br /></p>

## Watch: Based chick perfectly explains coming 'fifth wave' of feminism, but it's not what you think

But this beautiful lady explained it so perfectly, I just had to share. @Billieraebrandt on TikTok posted this video explaining the "5th wave" of feminism, which she thinks will actually undo the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/whatever-podcast-feminism-equality" target="_blank">previous four waves</a>. We can only hope. </p><p><em>"My prediction? This is going to be a counter-movement to the fourth wave [of feminism]. Where women start embracing their femininity instead of tearing down masculinity."</em></p><p><em>"Now [women have] realized that they've lost sight of the things that actually make them strong women. Like their warmth, their love, and their ability to nurture the people in their lives."</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Just from anecdotal experience, this does seem to be the case. I think many women feel like, in order to get ahead in the workplace, they basically have to act like men. And it does work - but it comes at the cost of natural femininity. </p><p><em>"They're realizing that they're now in debt to sexual liberation and hookup culture. It ruined them [...] Feminism destroyed the traditional family, and the natural dynamics between men and women." </em></p><p>The whole "sexual liberation"  movement coupled with the birth control pill has always boggled my mind. It's one of the biggest psy-ops in modern history. Feminists managed to convince entire generations of women that giving men sex with no commitment, eliminating any possibility of consequences (such as a child to help care for), and expecting nothing from him in return is somehow "female empowerment". I'm sure men are quaking in their boots. </p><p>Brandt concluded her prediction, <em>"We're going to see a fifth wave. And the women that lead it will be the ones that recognize masculinity maintains society, while femininity maintains life."  </em>A girl can dream. </p>

She'll pull his car out of the garage and play an annoying song and high volume! That will learn the old man!</p><p>Except there's only one person in this video who is taught a valuable lesson.

</p><p>But there's one thing that annoys me most about this video. Pat doesn't tell us what the sexist movie is.</p><p>Are we talking classic sex comedies like <em>Animal House</em> or <em>Porky's</em>? Was it a James Bond movie? Is Pat one of those fourth-wave feminists and is upset Grandpa was watching <em>She's All That </em>because she saw it listed in a Buzzfeed article as a top 10 sexist movie?</p><p>The least Pat could have done was tell us WHAT movie. You should always give your audience all the necessary information so that they can make an informed decision before mocking you.</p>

Basically, if you are a traditional feminist but you disagree with the radical left's political opinion <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tampons-confused" target="_blank">that men can be women</a>, or that if a man decides they're a woman <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fallon-fox-brags-terf" target="_blank">their wants and needs take precedence</a> over women who have always been women, you are now a TERF. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-trans-author" target="_blank">Think JK Rowling</a>.</p><p>Senator McKim has a new name.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Australia is so woke that members of parliament are now describing any woman who opposes trans ideology as a “TERD.” <a href="https://t.co/QzDEeGppi1">pic.twitter.com/QzDEeGppi1</a><br />— Catch Up (@CatchUpNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpNetwork/status/1638845315926343680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>"We need to call their ilk what they actually are. And that is Trans Exclusionary Right-Wing Dropkics. T-E-R-D-S. They're not TERFS, they are TERDS."</p><p>Really, dude?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Those aren't even good bars. "Dropkicks?" If he went with "dickheads" or "douchebags," it would at least be a slightly better than MID insult. He couldn't even be bothered to do that. He wanted to call women poop. He thought he was the first person to ever think "TERF" sounds a lot like "TERD." "Dropkicks" was the first word that came to mind.</p><p>Only a white, angry, nincompoop, kitten, eagle, reject would think that is witty. Or a WANKER for short.</p><p>It's remarkable that in 2023, believing in things like a woman's rights to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out" target="_blank">not have opportunities stolen from them</a> by people who have penises or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gen-z-womens-prisons" target="_blank">be allowed to be incarcerated</a> without the fear of being raped, are considered right-wing opinions.</p><p>God save the Patriarchy! Amirite?</p>
