## Inside Taiwan: Standing Up to China review – a gripping analysis of potential nuclear Armageddon

<p>This documentary showcases Taiwanese citizens paying to train at private military camps, national service surging and the island stockpiling weapons. Will China really spark war?</p><p>The knife-maker of Kinmen island, Wu Tseng-dong, has an unusual business model. When he was a boy, in the 1950s, he witnessed explosive shells – launched from the Chinese mainland two miles away – falling on his birthplace. As he explains: “479,000 rounds were fired in 44 days. We lived in fear.” Little did Wu Tseng-dong know then, but the People’s Liberation Army was supplying him with the raw material for his future livelihood: today he makes knives from those shells to sell to tourists from the mainland.</p><p>Reporter Jane Corbin’s gripping analysis of rising tensions between the People’s Republic of China (capital: Beijing; leader: Xi Jinping; population: 1.4 billion) and the Republic of China (capital: Taipei; current leader: Tsai Ing-wen; population: 23 million) examines the possibility of history not just repeating itself, but of tensions escalating so far as to cause the return to geopolitical discourse of that quaint old term, nuclear Armageddon. In this scenario, Beijing bombards not just the little island of Kinmen (slightly bigger than Bute), but Taiwan itself (roughly the size of Switzerland), in order to reunify China. But it thereby embroils the US, provoking a worldwide conflict that would, so far as I understand it, depress global economic growth predictions even more than the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/23/inside-taiwan-standing-up-to-china-review-a-gripping-analysis-of-potential-nuclear-armageddon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was a night when a Harry Kane penalty conversion positively overflowed with narrative drama. It was his first attempt for England since his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/05/harry-kane-world-cup-penalty-miss-haunt-him-rest-of-life-england">notorious miss in the World Cup quarter-final exit against France</a> last December and so goodness knows what was going through his mind as he shaped to take it, after the VAR had spotted a Giovanni Di Lorenzo handball on a corner.</p><p>When he scored, it took him clear of Wayne Rooney as England men’s all-time leading scorer with 54 goals. What a moment for the captain. It put his side 2-0 up and to describe them as rampant at that point late in the first half would have been no exaggeration. Declan Rice had scored the first and the Euro 2024 qualifying campaign looked set to begin with a bang.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/23/italy-england-euro-2024-qualifying-group-c-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Her final first minister’s questions was a sad moment for the outgoing SNP leader but was business as usual for the Scottish Tories</p><p>Some rage against the dying of the light. Boris Johnson is howling into the wind. Crying out for meaning, begging for attention. Anything but be forgotten. But his time is up. All that remains for him is life as another old curiosity on the after-dinner speaking circuit. A job he hates almost as much as he hates himself for doing it. He despises the people – the little people – to whom he is obliged to talk. Most of whom only listen with one ear open at best. He is the <em>amuse-bouche</em> entertainer who has backed himself into a narcissistic cul-de-sac.</p><p>Others, though, leave the political stage at a time of their own choosing. On their own terms. Just over a month ago, Nicola Sturgeon surprised even her closest allies by announcing she was standing down as leader of the SNP. Some bits of her resignation statement didn’t quite make sense. She claimed her party was in good health and never nearer to achieving independence. In which case why walk away now? But the other, more personal stuff, felt real. She had had enough. Her entire adult life devoted to frontline politics. She just wasn’t feeling it so much any more. She wanted more Nicola time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/23/and-its-goodbye-from-her-an-emotional-nicola-sturgeon-quits-the-stage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A tense, state-of-the-nation drama set in Covid-era India successfully exposes how the caste system underpins much of the country’s division and strife </p><p>‘No one ever plans for the poor,” says a young police officer in this tense, painful pandemic drama from India. Shot in black and white, it’s set at the start of the government-imposed lockdown in May 2020 that led to the exodus of 10 million migrant workers from India’s cities. The police officer has been put in charge of a rural roadblock to stop poor workers returning to their families and villages – preventing the spread of the virus. But realising that no help is arriving, the crowd, feeling hungry and abandoned, get angry. The results are explosive, exposing the fault lines of caste prejudice and class conflict.</p><p>The officer Surya (Rajkummar Rao), is himself from a lower-caste family, but he’s climbing the ladder; he is a competent, decent cop who refuses kickbacks or bribes (just what a modern police force needs). Still, his boss never lets him forget his place, and we see how Surya has internalised prejudice too. All of society turns up at his checkpoint. A rich upper-caste woman (Dia Mirza) waltzes over accompanied by her driver, fully expecting to sail through. A young woman who worked as a maid in the city risks her life to get her alcoholic father home to their village. There’s an elderly security guard travelling on a bus; then a film crew arrives from a TV news channel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/23/bheed-review-lockdown-thriller-cuts-across-indias-class-conflict">Continue reading...</a>

But the possibility of eventual justice grew somewhat brighter with the international criminal court’s decision last week to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/vladimir-putin-arrest-warrant-ukraine-war-crimes" title="">issue an arrest warrant</a> for overseeing the abduction of Ukrainian children.</p><p>The compelling evidence of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/18/how-ukraine-kidnapped-children-led-to-vladimir-putins-arrest-warrant-russia" title="">the forced transfer of thousands of children</a> for adoption or to “re-education camps” is appalling. But this is only one of many horrors that Mr Putin has unleashed on Ukraine. There is growing support for <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c26678cb-042c-4b84-bb26-88047046601a" title="">prosecuting him for the invasion itself</a>, which would require the creation of a special tribunal as the crime of aggression is not within the ICC’s scope. These calls are made in part because it is usually hard, if not impossible, for war crimes investigators to prove that those at the top sanctioned atrocities on the ground. Mr Putin can, however, be clearly linked to the abductions. Last month, the children’s rights commissioner, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, indicted alongside the president, appeared on television thanking him for her “adoption” of a 15-year-old boy from Mariupol. This is the beginning of the case against Mr Putin, not necessarily the end.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/23/the-guardian-view-on-ukraine-and-war-crimes-the-start-of-a-case-against-putin">Continue reading...</a>

The first is that the prime minister and those around him think his tax returns are a public relations embarrassment. Many months after promising to do so, Mr Sunak finally slipped the details into the public realm at the very time when the political world was almost wholly focused on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-a-pernicious-influence-on-politics" title="">Boris Johnson’s confrontation</a> with the Commons privileges committee.

But this was not the act of a leader who is comfortable accounting for his wealth. The release also stopped well short of complete transparency.

There is a good reason why he is spending his 59th birthday talking to the Guardian and it is because the WRU faces a binary choice.

Should the WRU not obtain the necessary 75% majority at this weekend’s emergency general meeting, the dinosaurs will inherit the earth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/23/rugby-union-wales-wru-ieuan-evans">Continue reading...</a>

I have some sympathy with his point, but it is one that could have been made anytime in the past two decades, during which there has never been less than 25 tune-and-toe shows in the commercial sector. What is curious is Hare’s timing, since right now three London theatres traditionally associated with straight plays happen to be housing quite exceptional musicals.</p><p>Hare seizes on <a href="https://www.oklahomawestend.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8e-gBhD0ARIsAJiDsaWtGYh_VQG_1xSIrJS4ujkrnwUN4B6GQOsAFYBPkv2CWA874bcIWnIaAv32EALw_wcB">Oklahoma!</a>’s occupation of the beautiful Wyndham’s theatre. Director Daniel Fish, however, has done precisely what the best directors of classic plays have been doing for ages: he gives us a fresh perspective on a familiar work without (well, almost without) altering the text. Instead of the usual gung-ho hymn to rural America, we get a dark, disturbing study of the victimisation of the outsider – in this case Jud Fry – by a small, self-regarding community.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/23/musicals-plays-theatre-stages-london">Continue reading...</a>

Campaigning journalist and lecturer who won the Bar Council legal reporting award for her coverage of joint enterprise law<p>The outstanding characteristic of the journalist, writer, and lecturer Melanie McFadyean, who has died of cancer aged 72, was fearlessness. To this was added a wild sense of humour, a generosity of spirit and, most of all perhaps, an empathy with the dispossessed. She was a campaigner with an eye only for the subject, and never for her byline. It was this that made her effective in the world.</p><p>She wrote of her mother, Marion Guttman, a refugee from Nazi Germany, in <a href="https://granta.com/five-houses/" title="">Five Houses</a>, an effortlessly elegant 2006 essay in Granta magazine. Marion, she said, “lost her identity, her nationality, and a large fortune. In her the shock has engendered pragmatism rather than nostalgia”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/23/melanie-mcfadyean-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

## The people of Northern Ireland want their assembly back. The DUP must not be allowed to block that | Simon Jenkins

<p>A health and cost of living crisis is causing real problems that must be addressed. Democracy cannot be hamstrung any longer</p><p>Nothing in Boris Johnson’s post-Downing Street antics has been more cynical than his dodging from the privileges committee hearing on Wednesday to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/22/tory-mps-rebel-as-rishi-sunak-northern-ireland-brexit-plan-passes">vote against</a> Rishi Sunak’s Windsor framework. That reform was a hard-won attempt to rescue and reorder Johnson’s own hard-Brexit shambles. The least he could do was say thank you and shut up.</p><p>Fleeing to Northern Ireland’s extremist wilderness has long appealed to Britain’s political rejects.

If Uxbridge now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/16/boris-johnson-reselected-as-tory-candidate-in-uxbridge">drops Johnson</a> as its MP, Antrim will doubtless make him an offer, from whose cliffs he can rant and conspire against colleagues to his heart’s content. But the damage done by Brexit to the vexed politics of Northern Ireland does not end there. As its trade protocol sinks below the horizon, Churchill’s “dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone” are emerging once more in its place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/23/northern-ireland-assembly-dup-democracy">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC, Xbox; Whitethorn Games</strong><br />This brief, raw and unsettling reimagining of a celebrated environmentalist’s campaign against pesticides presents a sickly vision of nature contaminated by humans</p><p>Video games are often getaways to ravishing natural worlds. The Forest Cathedral transports you to one whose beauty is a little <em>too</em> intense, mixing the showroom gloss of stock graphics with the awful vividness of Sylvia Plath’s hospital tulips. It’s a first-person puzzle game based on the work of Rachel Carson, whose 1962 book Silent Spring documented the impact of chemical pest control on ecosystems, including the widely banned insecticide DDT. The game offers a compressed, spacey abstraction of Carson’s life, including her romance with Dorothy Freeman, clashes with the chemical industry and her death from cancer soon after Silent Spring’s publication.</p><p>Carson appears in the game as a fresh-faced researcher, monitoring the animals on a small island. Over a couple of hours you explore using an augmented-reality lens, which reveals glowing contaminants in organisms and the cables snaking beneath the soil and trees. These cables lead to trunk-mounted terminals, where you play a punishing Metroid-style platformer, its spiky dungeons roamed by two-dimensional cousins of the bugs and fish in Carson’s charge. Completing levels of this game-within-the-game activates machines in the 3D world, but there are eerier outcomes, too: sometimes, things occur in the background in your peripheral vision while you’re concentrating on a terminal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/23/the-forest-cathedral-review-an-unnaturally-intense-ecological-puzzle-game">Continue reading...</a>

Between March 2020 and March 2021, the UK had <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/timeline-lockdown-web.pdf">three national lockdowns</a>.

At the time, the government was unenthusiastic about lockdown and many Tories opposed it. Lord Sumption, for example, insisted that if it weren’t for lockdown, people could have “<a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/jonathan-sumption-you-cannot-imprison-an-entire-population-/">a perfectly normal life</a>.”</p><p>Now a new chorus of lockdown sceptics includes people who position themselves on the left, such as the historian <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2022/03/06/book-review-the-covid-consensus-the-new-politics-of-global-inequality-by-toby-green/">Toby Green</a> and his colleague <a href="https://unherd.com/2023/02/the-questions-the-covid-inquiry-must-ask/">Thomas Fazi</a>.

Less than seven years, to be precise, a clock that started ticking when Mr Roy and his assistant Ray Lewington, in lieu of scouting Euro 2016 opponents Iceland, booked themselves tickets for a leisure cruise along the Seine. Oh Mr Roy! Aiiee Mr Ray! How could you?!</p><p>One memory of Mesut Özil (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/22/football-daily-mesut-ozil-retires">yesterday’s Football Daily</a>). Before a Germany match, he was presented with a bouquet of flowers (for being German player of the tournament in winning the 2014 World Cup, if I remember correctly) and was cheered to the rafters. In the second half, he was hoiked off during an insipid team performance and booed to whatever the booing equivalent of the rafters is. Some players divide opinion, but seldom so dramatically among the same bunch of people within one hour” – Bernard Clark.</p><p>Sad to read that Mesut Özil is retiring, though not entirely surprised. His performances in Turkey have followed a long, slow decline, with each appearance less impressive than the two before it. I think it’s known as his Fenerbahce sequence” – Simon Mazier.</p><p>With Sky decommissioning Soccer AM, what’s to happen with The Bull, Jimmy Bullard, and You Know The Drill? Presumably I’m not the only one of Football Daily’s 1,056 readers who will miss his antics? My only gripe is he visited Bristol City when Lee Johnson was at the helm. Big Nige and Alex Scott would give him a bath.

<p><strong>(Bru Zane, eight CDs) <br /></strong>This illuminating and beautifully presented collection features works by 21 of France’s female composers, with over 160 pieces spanning 130 years</p><p>Twenty-one composers, with dates of birth ranging from 1764 to 1893, are represented in this always fascinating and sometimes revelatory collection of more than 160 pieces, from which only a handful of the names will be familiar to even assiduous concert goers and record collectors on this side of the Channel. There are works here by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/30/clairieres-songs-by-lili-and-nadia-boulanger-review-nichlas-phan-myra-huang-avie">Nadia Boulanger</a>, perhaps the most influential composition teacher of the 20th century, and her hugely talented sister <a href="https://www.musicbywomen.org/composer/lili-boulanger/">Lili</a>, who died at the age of 24, as well as by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/feb/24/classicalmusicandopera">Pauline Viardot</a>, best remembered as one of the greatest of 19th-century singers, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jan/26/books.guardianreview2">Cécile Chaminade</a>, whose songs crop up occasionally in recitals. The music of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/jun/24/symphony-guide-louise-farrenc-third-symphony-tom-service">Louise Farrenc</a>, <a href="https://www.rcm.ac.uk/research/archivedprojects/augustaholmes/">Augusta Holmès</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/26/helene-de-montgeroult-cd-review-edna-stern-forgotten-orchid-classics">Hélène de Montgeroult</a> (the earliest composer in the set) has become much better known in recent years too, while <a href="https://www.classicalmusicdaily.com/articles/s/c/charlotte-sohy.htm">Charlotte Sohy</a> was featured in a CD collection just last year. But the remaining 13 composers are much less well known, and until recently many of them were hardly ever performed and recorded.</p><p>Much of the repertoire included here is generally small-scale – chamber works, piano music and a lot of songs – and the quality of some of these pieces, the songs especially, can be uneven. Yet each of the eight discs includes at least one large-scale orchestral score and they are shared between the French national orchestras from Paris, Toulouse and Metz, and the period-instruments of Les Siècles. There is the third and last of Farrenc’s symphonies, and Sohy’s Symphony in C sharp minor, which was never performed in her lifetime and only heard for the first time in 2019. We have Chaminade’s Concertino for Flute and a rather pallid suite from her ballet Callirhoë, Holmés’s symphonic poem Andromède, with its hints of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/nov/28/a-to-z-of-wagner-v-is-for-valkyrie">Wagner’s Valkyries</a>, and Nadia Boulanger’s cantata La Sirène, with which she won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1908.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/23/compositrices-new-light-on-french-romantic-women-composers-review-treasure-trove-of-the-overlooked">Continue reading...</a>

## Is Blockbuster video about to make a comeback?

<p>The mysterious reactivation of the long-moribund brand’s site, accompanied by a cryptic message, has fans asking if a mighty return is on the cards</p><p>A few days ago, something strange happened in a forgotten corner of the internet. <a href="https://www.blockbuster.com/">The website for Blockbuster</a>, the long-dormant obsolete VHS rental chain, twitched back into life. It doesn’t always work – there’s more than a fighting chance that you’ll be taken to an error page – but if the winds are blowing in just the right direction, you’ll see a brand new landing page, accompanied by the text “We are working on rewinding your movie”. To all intents and purposes, it seems to be a sign that the universe isn’t quite done with Blockbuster yet.</p><p>Which is fairly preposterous, of course, because the universe is absolutely done with Blockbuster and has been for some time. A world-conquering behemoth in its day, a juggernaut that crushed the necks of smaller independent video stores, Blockbuster took over the world in the 90s and early 2000s. But its glory was short-lived. Netflix came, first in its DVD-by-post guise and then as an unstoppable streamer, and custom disintegrated overnight. If Blockbuster exists in any form now it’s as a punchline, a reference to anything too bloated and arrogant to notice the looming shadow of imminent catastrophe. Which raises the question: what is this new website, exactly?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/23/is-blockbuster-video-about-to-make-a-comeback">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC, Xbox, PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch; Black Salt Games/Team17<br /></strong>Plumbing the depths of our fear of the ocean, this clever and compelling video game will suck you in for hours at a time</p><p>Heading out as the sun rises in a battered old fishing boat, everything seems peaceful. The vessel can’t go far, but there are mackerel and cod within easy reach of the port and its lighthouse; I’m warned not to stay out after dark as the rocks can be treacherous, looming suddenly out of the dark and crashing against the hull. After a couple of days, though, I catch something that’s … wrong, a mess of scales curled around a repulsively enormous single eye. The fishmonger’s face betrays a disturbing glee when I hand it over to him, then falls as he holds the oceanic aberration to his ear to hear its whispers. He shoves me from his shop before barring the door.</p><p>Dredge plumbs the depths of our instinctive fear of the ocean and the unseen things that waft around down there in the dark. It’s a clever, compelling fishing adventure game with an eldritch twist; you upgrade your boat, nets and rods, venture out further to catch different fish and encounter creatures in the night that make you want to drop the controller in disgust. Sometimes the overarching horror story feels barely there, as you go about your business selling your catch and saving for a hull expansion; other times, when you’re caught out in the dark miles from a dock and starting to see things, it feels oppressively present.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/23/dredge-review-horrors-lurk-in-the-deep-in-this-eldritch-fishing-game">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new collaboration between 2K Games and Lego takes the form of an open-world racing game with buildable, breakable cars</p><p>Classic video games never really die. While they’re still remembered by designers and producers, their influence lives on and they can crop up in the most unexpected places. 2K Games has announced a new agreement with Lego, which will begin with Lego 2K Drive, an open-world racing game created by veteran studio Visual Concepts. It combines the explorable world and discoverable challenges of Forza Horizon with the fun handling, weapons and power-ups of Mario Kart – but its origins lie in a completely different set of car games.</p><p>Executive producer Mark Pierce started his games career at Atari in the late 1980s, working on the company’s classic racers RoadBlasters, Road Riot and San Francisco Rush, and was around while another team was crafting the legendary 3D racing sim Hard Drivin’. “I was so fortunate because a lot of the original Atari guys were still there,” he recalls. “David Sheppard, who was the second software engineer hired and Peter Takaichi’s group who did all the mechanical design. I knew Jed Margolin, one of the guys who invented force feedback steering. It was incredible, the culture was just so strong, so creative … A lot of us at Visual Concepts South have a heritage in making arcade racing games. We really wanted to make an arcade-style game that would be easy to learn, but hard to master.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/23/the-spirit-of-80s-racing-games-lives-on-in-lego-2k-drive">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three years on, amid rising lockdown scepticism, the public wants to move on from the trauma. But this is too important to forget</p><p>Three years to the day from when Britain went into formal lockdown, it’s worth reflecting on the historical moment we all lived through: a once-in-a-century kind of pandemic that swept the world over. As analysis and inquiries begin to make sense of what we lived through, it’s clear that different political factions are attempting to rewrite what happened and why. Some are questioning, driven in part by the Telegraph’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/02/matt-hancock-covid-era-messages-pandemic-reminder">lockdown files</a>, whether the Covid-19 pandemic was really that bad. Was the response by government proportionate?</p><p>In these debates, there’s a clear survival bias. Those who can ask these questions were affected by restrictions and are likely to have had Covid-19 once, if not several times, and survived. Those who died – an estimated <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths">220,437 people</a> in the UK – don’t have a chance to weigh in on whether government intervention was sufficient, or whether their deaths were preventable. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/06/more-than-1m-people-report-long-covid-in-uk-a-year-after-infection">More than a million people suffering from long Covid</a> still face scepticism over their condition and an uphill battle to have it recognised and addressed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/23/covid-britain-locked-down-three-years-trauma">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Peggy) <br /></strong>New York’s Jpegmafia and Detroit’s Danny Brown transmit from hip-hop’s hinterland, in a bacchanal of inspired noise and topical chat that’s the definition of ‘not for everybody’</p><p>There are umpteen ways to promote your forthcoming album, but the route taken by Danny Brown feels unique. This week, before the release of his joint album with Jpegmafia, a fellow dweller on hip-hop’s left field and self-styled spokesperson for “eccentric Black people … who grew up in the projects but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/29/joy-division-rap-danny-brown-odd-future-vince-staples">listen to Throbbing Gristle</a>”, Brown invited his collaborator to join his set at Austin’s SXSW festival and then announced that he himself was entering rehab: “Honestly, my dumb ass is supposed to have been gone, but I’m broke so I gotta do shows to take my ass in.” He also apologised to the audience for having written “so many songs about doing drugs” – a category in which you could presumably include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YgxQlS2054&amp;list=PLEKzG4X6BUaPthdiQoB8fmKxDGFqe9qRp">Scaring the Hoes</a>’ Fentanyl Tester and Where Ya Get Ya Coke From – and told them to enjoy partying at the festival, but added the caveat that, if they did, “shit could get dark”.</p><p>You could have taken this as a joke: just scan Scaring the Hoes’ tracklisting, where you’ll find songs called Steppa Pig and Jack Harlo Combo Meal. But it didn’t sound like one – Brown also said something similar on his podcast – and it certainly makes sense when you listen to the album itself. There are plenty of exceptionally funny lyrics (the opening line, delivered by Jpegmafia, is impossibly winning: “First, fuck off, Elon Musk”). But it’s hard to get around the fact that it sounds like music made by minds at the end of their tether.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/23/jpegmafia-x-danny-brown-scaring-the-hoes-review-take-a-deep-breath-and-press-play">Continue reading...</a>

As he turns 81, we rate his finest films</p><p>An early, and relatively minor, Haneke showing 71 “fragments” – or glimpses of apparently unrelated scenes and people – set in present-day Vienna. These involve a security guard, a troubled young man, a depressed retiree and a Romanian illegal immigrant. So what’s tying them all together? The answer is partially given at the beginning and fully at the end, and the movie gives us Haneke’s keynote themes: the nature of violence, urban alienation, the abolition of compassion and community in capitalism and western hypocrisy in primly looking away from injustice and desolation in other parts of the world. But the backstory twist ending – similar to the one Krzysztof Kieślowski in effect gave us the same year in Three Colours Red – is a bit pat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/23/michael-haneke-films-ranked">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Show should have ditched the Soccerettes earlier but it was huge fun, from sword fighting with Leboeuf to Ginola swearing</p><p>My first vivid memory of Soccer AM was in a hungover stupor sprawled across a sofa at a mate’s student house in Birmingham in the late 90s. There was a man on television doing keepy-uppies with a giant cuddly toy sheep, there were lots of goals – then two people started wrestling in leotards by the Hammersmith flyover. It was charming and silly and kind of hazily endless – no matter what you did on a Saturday morning, it would still be on when you got in.</p><p>Around a decade later, it’s 16 August 2008, and I’ve spent the night staring at the ceiling. I am terrified. Soccer AM starts at 9. I’ve never hosted a TV show before. There was no audition, no screen test. My whole career has led to this point and I’d rather be anywhere else. I just about get my opening words out. The show happens around me. And to be honest, it does for months. Had social media been the force it is now I wouldn’t have lasted. But very slowly I vaguely learned what I was doing – I was lucky to be next to a brilliant broadcaster in Helen Chamberlain. Those enjoyable seven seasons are often referred to as The Glory Years ’08-’15.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/23/soccer-am-was-not-just-laddish-banter-it-changed-my-life-and-gave-soul-to-saturdays">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With cash-strapped fans eager for epic setlists, Swift isn’t the only artist doing extra-long gigs – but performers and fans alike will need to toughen up</p><p>Get ready to double the babysitter’s shift: pop concerts are getting longer. Taylor Swift’s current Eras tour of the US finds the American superstar singing and playing for more than three hours every night, but she’s not the only one: veteran British goth giants the Cure, already fond of long gigs, performed 88 songs over three nights at Wembley Arena <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/05/the-cure-review-still-top-of-the-goths-robert-smith-ovo-hydro-glasgow">last December</a>, averaging just under three hours every show. Other acts putting in unusually long stints on stage lately include K-pop stars Ateez (two and a half hours) and Aussie psych-rockers King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard, who will play a three-hour marathon at Los Angeles Hollywood Bowl in June.</p><p>Lengthy shows aren’t new. The Grateful Dead played five-hour sets in the 1970s and Bruce Springsteen’s live epics are legendary (the longest, in Helsinki in 2012, lasted four hours and six minutes). The Boss’s current tour – <a href="https://brucespringsteen.net/tour/page/2/">arriving in the UK later this year</a> – is averaging just under three hours. But newer artists have also shifted towards longer shows to showcase increasingly large back catalogues. Swift’s 44-song Eras setlist culls from 10 albums – 17 years of music. King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard’s 23 long-players since 2010 provide a labyrinthine songbook that can’t be represented in a gig of even 120 minutes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/23/taylor-swift-beyonce-king-gizzard-bruce-springsteen-three-hour-concert">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two young men journey from the classroom to the trenches in this tale of a forbidden relationship set against the first world war</p><p>In March 1915, public schoolboy Sidney Ellwood sends a letter to his close friend Henry Gaunt on the western front: “I am torn between wanting the War to go on so I can join you (‘We few, we happy few, we band of brothers!’), and wanting it to end so you can join the Ardents. Two such thrilling worlds! Aren’t we lucky?”</p><p>Needless to say, Ellwood’s perspective on luck soon changes. Alice Winn’s debut novel, named after Tennyson’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/apr/14/poemoftheweek34" title="">elegiac poem</a>, begins as Ellwood and Gaunt, seniors at Preshute College, are between two worlds. On the one hand, the cloistered idyll of school, with its long summer afternoons and jolly Ardents society; on the other, the seemingly great adventure of the first world war, with its many chances to die magnificently for king and country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/23/in-memoriam-by-alice-winn-review-an-elegy-for-young-love">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My wife and I had young kids, and we would have had to consume our body weight in Red Bull to stay awake. I still wish we had</p><p>It all started with an email from my friend Matt: “Prince is playing a secret gig at Koko in Camden. Tickets on sale at 10am.” Attending a secret gig had always been top of my bucket list. I’d come close once, when I turned up late to a mid-90s club night to discover that Philly rap legends the Roots had just finished playing an impromptu set. I was gutted. So when I got Matt’s email, I knew what I had to do: get tickets for my wife and me, book a train to London from Birmingham, find a hotel, and wrangle a grandparent to look after our two kids, who were then four and seven months old. With that sorted, we could do a leisurely hop down to London and have a power nap in our hotel, before heading off to see Prince and party like it was … well … 2007.</p><p>That was the plan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/23/my-biggest-regret-i-had-tickets-to-a-secret-prince-gig-but-was-too-tired-to-go">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The writer and historian, who has died aged 56, was not only widely respected for his writing on India but a kind and optimistic man, says fellow academic Maya Jasanoff</p><p>‘How should we understand a life – and where do literary, personal and intellectual biography meet?” asked Patrick French in a colloquium held last year. There was nobody better positioned to answer. A biographer of unparalleled sensitivity, Patrick learned early on “to realise the complexity of each person” and “the need for scrupulous research and selection, as well as intuition, empathy and compassion”. He will long be remembered for his literary achievements, especially his biography of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/13/biography.features">VS Naipaul</a>, which offers a masterclass in life-writing.</p><p>I was fortunate to get to know Patrick as a person and intellectual as well. We met in 2018, not long after he generously reviewed my book <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/03/dawn-watch-by-maya-jasanoff-review-joseph-conrad">The Dawn Watch</a> for this paper. He had recently become the founding Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at Ahmedabad University, in Gujarat, where he was tasked with building a liberal arts institution from scratch, and where he invited me to become a visiting professor. Not many people can move seamlessly between literary and academic realms, with the different forms of thought, creativity, and communication they entail; nor do many writers or professors possess the vision, patience, and pragmatism required to lead an institution. Patrick had all these capacities, plus an abundant curiosity and tolerance that helped him navigate across cultural and disciplinary lines.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/23/patrick-french-the-biographer-of-vs-naipaul-was-a-generous-collaborator-with-twinkling-wit">Continue reading...</a>

Here, the trappings and appurtenances of the leisured super-rich might turn out to be just the design features of a prison. Infinity Pool is set in a super-exclusive vacation resort, a razor-wired compound of pampering on an otherwise poverty-stricken fictional island – but the place turns out to have Hotel California-style rules about the respective times available for checking out and leaving.</p><p>Infinity Pool is part body horror, part folk horror, with twisty hints of JG Ballard and Ian McEwan; it also features a tremendous turn from Mia Goth, who is currently ruling our cinema screens elsewhere in Ti West’s shocker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/03/pearl-review-mia-goth-and-ti-west-scare-up-a-storm-in-extraordinary-pandemic-horror">Pearl</a>. There are some intriguingly nasty ideas, along with nice performances from Goth and from her male lead, Alexander Skarsgård. But after a great opening, there are some shark-jumping moments in the second and third acts, and the doppelganger idea is a bit tired. Getting the same actor to play the two parts is really something that should be confined to film students’ graduation projects or TikTok videos.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/23/infinity-pool-review-brandon-cronenbergs-holiday-horror-has-tremendous-mia-goth">Continue reading...</a>

## Plotters by Lizzie Dearden review – the terrorists who failed

<p>From malfunctioning satnavs to dud bombs, the stories behind botched attacks on the UK</p><p>Journalist Lizzie Dearden has been covering terrorism and extremism for about a decade. In her first book, Plotters, she looks at a series of botched terrorist attacks in the UK between 2017 and 2022, examining the attackers’ motivations and the reasons they failed. Sometimes it was down to luck: one would-be perpetrator got waylaid by a malfunctioning satnav; another mistakenly equipped his homemade bomb with acetone-free nail polish remover instead of the regular stuff, rendering it harmless. Often it was a matter of an indiscreet boast to a friend, who then tipped off the police. Surveillance by the security services, whose undercover agents infiltrate online extremist networks by posing as fixers or sympathisers, proved critical in several cases.</p><p>As Dearden explains, these agents have to tread delicately: they must gain a suspect’s trust without actively egging them on – because entrapment would probably scupper any eventual prosecution; and they have to discern “the difference between online boasting,<strong> </strong>genuine intent and actual capability”. She speculates that the banning of far-right groups under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/terrorism">anti-terrorism</a> legislation – as happened with National Action in 2016 – may, in the long run, make this information-gathering work more difficult, forcing extremists to meet offline to avoid detection: “If terrorists move completely away from … formal or informal online groups, the loss of intelligence could be catastrophic.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/23/plotters-by-lizzie-dearden-review-the-terrorists-who-failed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hensher brilliantly explores the lockdown experience, and how to bear witness to it, in this fluid portrait of south London lives</p><p>Three years on, it remains difficult to think coherently about Covid-19 and the many ways it has changed us. A global pandemic, abstract and vast, rendered painfully real in the most intimate of ways; in freedoms curtailed, in relationships lost, in millions of bodies broken or buried. How do we tell the story of something we can’t see? Is there a legible thread that connects a set of experiences that differ so radically along lines of wealth, geography, health, politics, risk appetite and plain old dumb luck?</p><p>These interpretative challenges are at the heart of To Battersea Park, the surefooted and emotionally generous new novel by Philip Hensher. At first glance, it might seem late in the day to be adding to the already swollen ranks of lockdown novels, but Hensher’s treatment of the topic is both original and affecting. To Battersea Park is primarily concerned with how the mechanisms of storytelling might enable us to bear meaningful witness to the experience of the pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/23/to-battersea-park-by-philip-hensher-review-a-pandemic-masterclass">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While too much time is spent on 1966 and all that Matthew Lorenzo’s profile draws out a hitherto unseen vulnerable side to the striker turned insurance salesman</p><p>The current flood of football documentaries shows no sign of abating; the recognition certain teams and individuals enjoy means that it’s not likely to any time soon. Geoff Hurst, the hat-trick hero of the 1966 World Cup final, is no doubt a natural subject for the “legacy” strand of these things: along with the likes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/20/finding-jack-charlton-review-documentary-irish-republic-football-ireland">Jack Charlton</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/26/bobby-review-documentary-bobby-moore-world-cup">Bobby Moore</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/01/bobby-robson-more-than-a-manager-review">Bobby Robson</a>, Hurst stands for a misty-eyed idea of Proper Football, when men were gods on the pitch and ordinary semi-dwelling blokes off it.</p><p>Hurst was all this and more, even if this profile focuses, football-wise at least, on that three-goal game at the expense of almost everything else. (Though that title might need a bit of nudging since Kylian Mbappé pulled off the same feat in 2022.) A rollcall of greats line up to heap praise on his sterling work against West Germany, with Gary Lineker (his nearest equivalent) being particularly enlightening on how Hurst exemplified the striker’s art – it’s all about “percentages”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/23/hurst-the-first-and-only-review-misty-eyed-football-doc-reveals-the-man-behind-the-hat-trick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It just needed a new oil pump part but none could be found in the world</p><p><strong>Our 2018 Jeep Compass has been waiting more than five weeks for an oil pump part. Our Fiat/Jeep dealer has now told us there was a production problem and the order with Fiat UK was cancelled. According to Fiat UK, the manufacturer needs an order of 200 before they’ll make it, and it could take up to a year to produce. The part could not be found anywhere in the world on the Fiat database. It seems incredible our four-year-old car is now obsolete.<br /></strong><em><strong>AM, London</strong></em></p><p>Global supply-chain issues have led to a shortage of some parts and delayed repairs, but your situation is ridiculous. Jeep, when I intervened, identified an “unfortunate set of errors”, and within five days the crucial part was on its way. It says: “We aim to maintain parts availability well beyond any local legal requirement to do so. Jeep has a long heritage of being there to support customers as vehicles get older, and there are no plans to change this.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/mar/23/missing-part-made-my-2018-jeep-suddenly-obsolete">Continue reading...</a>

In fact, within each nation are numerous unusual legal spaces, anomalous territories and peculiar jurisdictions. The world of nations is riddled with <em>zones</em> – city states, havens, enclaves, freeports, hi-tech parks, duty-free districts and innovation hubs – and they define the politics of the present in ways we are only starting to understand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/mar/23/the-ciskei-experiment-a-libertarian-fantasy-in-apartheid-south-africa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Great acting, kills galore and a pacy plot about an FBI agent who spends his days waiting for a hotline to ring. You couldn’t ask for more from a spy show</p><p>The Night Agent is a political thriller, based on Matthew Quirk’s 2012 political thriller of the same name, about a night agent who gets caught up in some political thrills. What’s a night agent, I hear you ask? Well, in this case, he is an FBI agent called Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso), who saves a bunch of ordinary joes from a bomb on a subway train. For some reason, he is put on desk duties in the basement of the White House, doing admin while he waits by a helpline phone that undercover operatives can call to let the powers-that-be know they are in trouble.</p><p>But that darn phone never rings.
