By adding web-browsing capabilities with its partner, Microsoft, OpenAI has brought ChatGPT up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenAI&rsquo;s major update to ChatGPT actually added three significant features: its newfound ability to browse the web, new plugin capabilities, and a sandbox in which it can execute and test code. The latter feature means that you&rsquo;ll actually see graphics in ChatGPT output, though what was shown was (for now) simple line graphs and charts, as well as some image manipulation. A fourth feature, a retrieval plugin, also means that developers can begin asking ChatGPT to incorporate documents of the developer&rsquo;s choosing, in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update means that ChatGPT is expanding on several fronts, potentially eliminating a competitor&rsquo;s advantage: <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666669/google-bards-ai-search-launch-was-well-boring.html\">Google&rsquo;s Bard may be boring</a>, but it knows what&rsquo;s going on in the present, thanks to its integration with Google Search. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ChatGPT web browsing \" class=\"wp-image-1669903\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ChatGPT-browsing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>ChatGPT uses a text browser to surf the web and find out what it needs to.</figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins&amp;xcust=2-1-1669890-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT won&rsquo;t open a web browser, per se, but behind the scenes it&rsquo;s working with Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing (which has its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html\">own AI chatbot</a>, of course) to browse the open web. In one example, ChatGPT was asked about the latest Oscar winners. The app indicated that it was browsing specific sites to learn the information, even &ldquo;clicking on&rdquo; specific sources of information. Previously, ChatGPT was current up until about 2021, with certain exceptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT &ldquo;knows&rdquo; a lot of information, period, but via plugins, the AI chatbot will be able to access specific stores of information that it didn&rsquo;t have access to previously&mdash;for example, flight times and prices from kayak, sophisticated mathematical modelling via <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/529116/wolfram_alpha_geek_almanac.html\">Wolfram Alpha</a>, and more. For now, OpenAI has deployed plugins from Expedia,&nbsp;FiscalNote,&nbsp;Instacart,&nbsp;Kayak,&nbsp;Klarna,&nbsp;Milo,&nbsp;OpenTable,&nbsp;Shopify,&nbsp;Slack,&nbsp;Speak,&nbsp;Wolfram, and&nbsp;Zapier. Other plugins are on a waitlist for further development, OpenAI said. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ChatGPT plugins\" class=\"wp-image-1669904\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ChatGPT-plugin-store.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Plugins will be installed into ChatGPT via a web store.</figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins&amp;xcust=2-1-1669890-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One function that CHatGPT has always specialized in is developing, writing, and checking code. Today, OpenAI said that it has added a small sandbox, along with disk space, for you to &ldquo;write&rdquo; and test code within ChatGPT. You can even upload files. &ldquo;We provide our models with a working Python interpreter in<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a sandboxed, firewalled execution environment,&rdquo; OpenAI said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That dovetails nicely with ChatGPT&rsquo;s final new feature: code interpretation and visualization. All that means is that you&rsquo;ll be able to use ChatGPT to begin solving visualization problems&mdash;which, interestingly, involves also converting files between formats.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ChatGPT graphics\" class=\"wp-image-1669905\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ChatGPT-graphics.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Here&rsquo;s ChatGPT interacting with graphics.

The AI took an uploaded image, resized it, and then changed the colors. It&rsquo;s a good sign that we could see more traditionally image-oriented activities within ChatGPTG&mdash;perhaps even AI art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, it appears that OpenAI sees ChatGPT as a platform&mdash;and that means&hellip; well, who knows what that means? </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1669890/chatgpts-new-web-browsing-power-means-its-no-longer-stuck-in-2021.html", "date_published": "2023-03-23 22:37:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Framework\u2019s latest DIY laptops embrace AMD Ryzen and discrete GPUs", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Framework is trying to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=50b714da855b604aa&amp;q=https://www.pcworld.com/article/394906/framework-laptop-review-take-it-apart-and-repair-it.html&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJq468ovL9AhUVFVkFHZydAO0QFnoECAIQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw1syFxXH1MGMwh5mqo7qka2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">change the way we think about laptops</a>, one big chunk of modular right-to-repair hardware at a time. The company has had a lot of success with its initial models, but now it&rsquo;s ready to expand its lineup even more. At a GDC presentation on Thursday, Framework announced that its newest revision, the Framework Laptop 13, will be available with both Intel 13th-gen and AMD Ryzen 7000 motherboard options. Even more impressive, the new Framework 16 model will offer discrete graphics, in the same modular style as the smaller designs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Framework Laptop 13 is a refined version of the initial Framework Laptop, which got an upgrade to 12th-gen Intel chips <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=50b714da855b604aa&amp;q=https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431799/framework-laptop-chromebook-review.html&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJq468ovL9AhUVFVkFHZydAO0QFnoECAcQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PiWoKKZiVARu63ELtEIpe\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">and a Chromebook edition</a> last year. This new version will offer a choice of either 13th-gen Core processors or an AMD Ryzen 7040 motherboard. The AMD variant will come with DDR5 memory and a specific Wi-Fi module for better compatibility, but will otherwise be identical to other Framework 13 laptops. Best of all, both the new Intel and AMD motherboards are compatible with older Framework Laptops &mdash; you&rsquo;ll be able to order the motherboards alone and slip them into your existing hardware for a cost-effective upgrade. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Framework laptop 13 on black background\" class=\"wp-image-1669472\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Framework-Laptop-13-side-by-side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Framework</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Framework Laptop 16 is the company&rsquo;s first media- and gaming-friendly design. With the larger screen comes a larger chassis, roomy enough to fit discrete graphics cards into the laptop. But just like the smaller Framework designs, this will be offered in a modular system that can be swapped in and out as needed. The Expansion Bay system exposes a PCIe x8 connection, which means there are options that go far beyond just graphics cards. Extra M.2 storage, card readers, video capture devices &mdash; the possibilities are nigh endless, since the Expansion Bay is capable of adding both depth and thickness to the chassis if needed. Serious DIY creators can build their own hardware and 3D-print module casings, thanks to open source designs. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Framework Laptop 16\" class=\"wp-image-1669479\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Framework-Laptop-16-Graphics-Module.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Framework Laptop 16&rsquo;s rear expansion bay can add both depth and thickness, allowing for tons of PCIe-based add-ons like discrete GPUs, storage, or card readers.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Framework</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Framework Laptop 16 also gets another modular expansion option: the keyboard deck. The keyboard area is split into three sections, which default to a standard laptop keyboard for the large module, an optional number pad for the medium module, and super-skinny aesthetic panels for the small module. But these are just the defaults: Users can mix and match as they desire, with proposed options for modules including secondary displays, e-ink panels, smart card readers, LED matrices, or even haptic input sliders. Again, the options are more or less endless thanks to open-source software and available 3D printing files. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Framework Cooler Master SFF case\" class=\"wp-image-1669480\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cooler-master-mainboard-case-02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=982\" width=\"982\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Framework</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The last goodie that Framework is announcing is a fun, easy way to put your older Framework motherboard to use. The company is teaming up with Cooler Master to release a custom plastic case that will turn the laptop&rsquo;s mainboard (complete with RAM and M.2 storage) into a Small Form Factor desktop PC. Just add a couple of Framework modules for video, wireless, and USB, and you&rsquo;re ready to go. The resulting mini-PC would make a great home theater machine or kid&rsquo;s computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Framework Laptop 13 Intel and AMD models should be available for pre-order <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://frame.work/&amp;xcust=2-2-1669299-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">on the Framework website later today</a>, starting at $849 for a barebones design without RAM, storage, or OS. Fully-laden laptops will start at $1049, and will begin shipping in May. Replacement motherboards for existing Framework owners will be available at the same time. The larger Framework Laptop 16 will be available in late 2023, with pre-orders available sometime this spring. Pricing and full hardware options were not announced. The Cooler Master SFF case will be available sometime in the spring for just $39. </p>\n\nLaptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1669299/new-framework-laptops-coming-in-ryzen-and-16-inch-flavors.html", "date_published": "2023-03-23 17:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Journalists targeted by USB drives that explode in PCs", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you get a strange, blank USB drive sent to you in the mail, don&rsquo;t put it into your PC. That&rsquo;s just basic data security, but for a few journalists in Ecuador, it&rsquo;s become potentially life-saving advice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A TV network had to call in the local police after a flash drive exploded when a journalist inserted the drive into a USB port. Reportedly the gadget was rigged to trigger a small amount of RDX, a military-grade chemical explosive, when the computer&rsquo;s electrical charge engaged over the USB connection.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As reported by the local TV channel, police, and the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-explosives-mailed-journalists-suspect-22a296a6eebc894205d65de3cdf0f010&amp;xcust=2-1-1669510-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Associated Press</a> (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/journalists-targeted-by-usb-drives-that-explode-when-inserted-into-pcs&amp;xcust=2-1-1669510-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PCMag</a>), no one was hurt in the small explosion. Police determined that only half of the drive&rsquo;s explosive load was triggered. Four other explosive USB drives have been sent to journalists and news agencies in Ecuador, three of which failed to detonate and the last of which was intercepted by postal carriers before it arrived. Police have one suspect so far, but the investigation is ongoing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organized crime is suspected. The journalist who unknowingly triggered the explosion, Len&iacute;n Artieda, covers crime and corruption in Ecuador, where hundreds of attacks against journalists and media outlets occur every year. While the improvised flash drive bombs have failed to hurt anyone so far, even a small amount of explosive inside a plastic or metal casing could cause serious injury via grenade-style shrapnel shreds.

That means you can expect deep blacks and good contrast. This particular set is massively popular with cinema buffs and PC gamers alike, thanks to its luscious visuals and support for PC-friendly features like G-Sync, FreeSync Premium, and Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce Now cloud gaming service. Reviews on the site absolutely rave about it. According to one buyer, the &ldquo;clarity and colors are fantastic.&rdquo; The interface is easy to use as well, which is a big sticking point for me. There&rsquo;s nothing more aggravating than a TV with a bad interface. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But visuals are only half of your entertainment experience.

This ranges anywhere from 72 to 29 percent off. To get the most bang for your buck, go for the longest subscription to net the biggest discount, but just be sure you&rsquo;re in it for the long haul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the pricing and subscription tiers for the Shared Hosting package, which is ideal for small businesses or those looking to launch a passion project.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"InMotion Hosting shared hosting plans\" class=\"wp-image-1660357\" height=\"505\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/InMotion-Hosting-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"947\" /><figcaption>A comparison of InMotion Hosting&rsquo;s Shared Hosting packages.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>InMotion Hosting also offers a Dedicated Server package. This is geared toward larger businesses that require top-tier support, performance, and optimization. Also, unlike the Shared Hosting plan, Dedicated Server packages come in 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>InMotion Hosting&rsquo;s free SSL certificates, unlimited bandwidth, multiple data centers, eCommerce features, developer tools, and website builders make it stand out as a powerful web hosting solution.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"InMotion Hosting dedicated server plans\" class=\"wp-image-1660358\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/InMotion-dedicated-server.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"944\" /><figcaption>InMotion Hosting&rsquo;s Dedicated Server packages for businesses.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to its competitors, InMotion Hosting&rsquo;s pricing is generally attractive. While both Bluehost and HostGator offer similar pricing and plans, some customers may find InMotion Hosting&rsquo;s pricing to be slightly less expensive for certain plans or features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"inmotion-hosting-setup\">InMotion Hosting: Setup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>InMotion Hosting makes the initial setup process easy for customers. This is an important factor, especially for those who are new to website hosting and may be unfamiliar with the technical aspects of getting a website online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The service provides a variety of resources to help customers with their initial setup. On par with other web hosting providers, InMotion offers a user-friendly control panel that makes it easy to manage your hosting account, install apps like WordPress, and access your files and databases. Also on par with others, InMotion offers free website migration services for customers who are transferring a website from another hosting provider. This is a major benefit if you&rsquo;re not tech-savvy and just want to focus on other aspects of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>InMotion Hosting provides a comprehensive knowledge base, video tutorials, and access to a 24/7 support team. This is useful if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with website hosting and want to set everything up yourself but may have questions about how to get started or throughout the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"inmotion-hosting-features\">InMotion Hosting: Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>InMotion Hosting provides several features across all of its plans that, in most cases, exceed those of its competition. Each plan includes unlimited bandwidth and subdomains. They also come with free SSL certificates, which are critical for securing your website and protecting your users&rsquo; data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Launch, Power, and Pro plans come with unlimited MySQL &amp; PostgreSQL databases. The Core plan comes with 40, compared to Bluehost&rsquo;s 20 of the same plan type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also many other key offerings, such as website storage, email accounts and storage, dedicated IPs, and so on&mdash;many of which have a leg up on the competition.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"InMotion Hosting features\" class=\"wp-image-1660366\" height=\"692\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/InMotion-Hosting-features.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"942\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>InMotion Hosting also provides support for eCommerce and developer tools, which sets it apart as a more flexible and robust hosting solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, InMotion Hosting does really well in the features department. Its free SSL certificates, unlimited bandwidth, multiple data centers, eCommerce features, developer tools, and website builders make it stand out as a powerful web hosting solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"inmotion-hosting-backup-and-security\">InMotion Hosting: Backup and security</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to backup and security features, InMotion Hosting is one of the best options available. One of the standout features is its free daily backups. This is a crucial feature for any website owner, as it ensures that their data is safe in the event of a disaster or server failure. The backups are automatic, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about setting up any complicated backup procedures. Remember, if your data doesn&rsquo;t exist in multiple locations, it doesn&rsquo;t exist at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to daily backups, InMotion Hosting offers other security features, including free SSL certificates, malware and virus protection, and DDoS protection. These features are essential for protecting your website from malicious attacks and ensuring that your website is secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"inmotion-hosting-reliability\">InMotion Hosting: Reliability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Server downtime means lost revenue and user trust. This makes server reliability extremely important. InMotion Hosting is known for providing excellent uptime and reliable performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>InMotion Hosting offers a 99.9 percent uptime guarantee, which is in line with industry standards. It also uses reliable hardware and software, such as SSD drives and the latest versions of PHP and MySQL, to ensure that its servers are fast and reliable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used InMotion Hosting for a security and data storage website for over a year, and never personally experienced any downtime. As one would expect, response times slowed as our traffic grew, but that&rsquo;s to be expected with a shared server, as you&rsquo;re sharing resources with other sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My experience is pretty well-aligned with customer reviews from various sources, such as <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.inmotionhosting.com&amp;xcust=2-1-1660348-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">TrustPilot</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.wpbeginner.com/hosting/inmotion-hosting/#comments&amp;xcust=2-1-1660348-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">WPBeginner</a>, praising the uptime and performance of their websites, with only the rare reports of significant downtime and performance issues. While most hosting service providers such as Bluehost promise 99.9 percent uptime, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1468898/bluehost-web-hosting-review.html#:~:text=Bluehost%3A%20Reliability\">it often falls short</a>. You won&rsquo;t need to worry about this with InMotion Hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, if you&rsquo;re looking for a reliable web hosting provider, InMotion Hosting is an excellent choice. With its 99.9 percent uptime guarantee and reliable hardware and software, it provides a solid foundation for your website&rsquo;s success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"inmotion-hosting-customer-support\">InMotion Hosting: Customer Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>InMotion Hosting also has glowing reviews from many users online for providing high-quality, responsive support. This type of quality support is extremely important, as you may need help with technical issues or have questions about your hosting account at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>InMotion Hosting offers 24/7 support via phone, live chat, and email. Its support team is based in the United States, and many customers praise the quality of their support interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the standout aspects of InMotion&rsquo;s support is the commitment to fast response times. The service aims to respond to support requests within 15 minutes, and it&rsquo;s always achieved this in my experience. This is especially important if you&rsquo;re experiencing a critical issue with your website that needs immediate attention. If this is due to user error on your part, you&rsquo;ll be guided through the steps to fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as mentioned earlier, InMotion Hosting provides a comprehensive knowledge base, community forums, and video tutorials to help customers troubleshoot common issues and learn more about their hosting account.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-use-inmotion-hosting\">Should you use InMotion Hosting?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>InMotion Hosting is an excellent choice for website hosting with a range of plans, competitive pricing, and excellent features. Its pricing structure is flexible, with different tiers available depending on the size of the website and the needs of the customer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also offers a variety of helpful resources, including a user-friendly control panel, video tutorials, and 24/7 customer support. The features provided by InMotion Hosting, such as unlimited bandwidth, free SSL certificates, and unlimited MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, make it an attractive option for those who want to get the most out of their website hosting provider.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, InMotion Hosting is a reliable and affordable choice for businesses and individuals who want to create a professional-looking website without breaking the bank.</p>\n\nInternet, Personal Software, Professional Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1660348/inmotion-hosting-review.html", "date_published": "2023-03-23 14:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Diablo 4 might brick your high-end graphics card", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The world of PC gaming is abuzz with news about<em> Diablo 4</em>, Blizzard&rsquo;s latest and most graphically-intense delve into its beloved dungeon crawler series.

A small number of initial players are reporting that their graphics cards have been dying while playing the new game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>User communities across the web are reporting unexpected GPU failures while playing <em><em>Diablo 4</em></em> in sessions as short as 20 minutes, and they go far beyond the usual Windows graphics crash. While the number of affected users seems to be relatively small at the moment, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rtx-3080-ti-gpus-are-mysteriously-dying-on-diablo-iv-beta&amp;xcust=2-1-1669157-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware has tabulated</a> that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is the most common card that shows problems, in various versions from Gigabyte, EVGA, and other vendors. At least one player each reported the same failure for the less-powerful RTX 3080 and the Radeon RX 6900 XT. At the time of writing less than 20 total users are reporting catastrophic problems. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afflicted cards cause the PC to crash, with some giving a slight warning of haywire cooling fans just before. Upon a reboot the video doesn&rsquo;t return unless the user switches to another card or integrated graphics, which tends to be the point at which an RMA return is the best solution. This situation is eerily reminiscent of when <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/395090/evga-explains-how-amazons-mmo-bricked-24-geforce-rtx-3090s.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon&rsquo;s <em>New World</em> MMO was bricking RTX 3090 cards</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of users reporting this problem is so small that it&rsquo;s probably unlikely to deter players from trying out <em><em>Diablo 4</em></em>. Even if it&rsquo;s ten times the number of people who&rsquo;ve been active on the forums at this point, that would be a tiny fraction of Blizzard&rsquo;s total beta players.

That&rsquo;s the idea behind budget gaming brands, like Dell&rsquo;s G-series underneath Alienware and the Asus TUF series under ROG. Lenovo is ready to dive into the budget PC gaming market, announcing the new LOQ (pronounced &ldquo;lock&rdquo;) label to go along with its more expensive Legion machines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first series of LOQ gaming PCs include two laptops and a desktop. The LOQ 15 and 16 come standard with AMD-powered internals, with the 15i and 16i variants sporting Intel hardware. Despite being budget machines, they&rsquo;re offering some serious hardware, at least on the high end. Both come with your choice of &ldquo;up to&rdquo; Ryzen 7 7840HS or Core i7-13700H processors, with the GPUs topping out at the Nvidia RTX 4060. (Note the lack of AMD options on the graphics side.) RAM goes up to 16GB DDR5, while storage is up to 1TB Gen 4. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo LOQ laptop from rear\" class=\"wp-image-1668223\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/11_Lenovo_LOQ_16Inch_Hero_Back_Ports_Lights_AMD_RGB_Backlit-Copy.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Lenovo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The laptops inherit a lot of the design language from the Legion family, with dark grey bodies and straight lines. Rear-facing ports along the chunky hinge are great for when you sit down at a desk for an extended play session. These ports include full Ethernet and HDMI, plus double USB-A, in addition to the USB-A and USB-C ports on the side. Both laptops can charge via USB-C at up to 140 watts, though the dedicated proprietary charger will be faster. Other hardware features include Lenovo&rsquo;s signature dedicated privacy shutter, 1440p screens at a maximum of 165Hz, and 4-zone keyboard lighting. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo LOQ laptop lid open\" class=\"wp-image-1668224\" height=\"926\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/13_Lenovo_LOQ_15APH8_Hero_Rear-Copy.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Lenovo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intel-powered LOQ 16i will be coming in May, starting at $1150. The AMD variant comes in June at a much more appealing $960. The 15-inch LOQ 15i arrives in April for $900, while the AMD version comes a month later at, strangely, the same starting price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The LOQ brand&rsquo;s first desktop offering is the LOQ Tower 17i, named for the liter capacity of its case. Lenovo is positioning it as a beginner&rsquo;s machine with plenty of room to grow. The design has some interesting lighting around the vertically aligned front air intake, along with USB-C and dual USB-A ports. Inside you&rsquo;ll find &ldquo;up to&rdquo; an Intel Core i7-13700 processor, an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU (the press release didn&rsquo;t say which ones), 32GB of RAM (though it&rsquo;s only DDR4), and a maximum of 1TB M.2 SSD or 2TB hard drive storage. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo LOQ 17i desktop\" class=\"wp-image-1668225\" height=\"1051\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/03_LOQ-Tower_Hero_Front_Facing_Right-Copy.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Lenovo</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The power supply maxes out at 500 watts, which will limit upgrade options along with the Micro-ATX B760 motherboard. At least you can get in easily with toolless thumbscrews for entry, and it&rsquo;s ready for modern wireless, with both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. The LOQ 17i desktop arrives sometime in the fall, starting at $980.

Google Workspace is mostly free, and for businesses it&rsquo;s pretty cheap.</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Google Workspace\" class=\"wp-image-1533092\" height=\"718\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/google-workspace-1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Google Workspace delivers the entire range of Google apps as an integrated suite.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Robert Strohmeyer / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft has been charging hundreds of dollars for its Office suite for as long as Office has been a thing. Today, Office 365 comes in a variety of slightly different and apparently arbitrary versions consisting of different combinations of its various applications at prices ranging from $70 a year for Personal to $264 a year for Business Premium. Yes, business rates are comparable, $72 and $264 annually, with larger enterprises getting reduced rates off the big bundle. But for personal use, Google apps are flat-out free. Not a penny. Just create an account and do your thing. Even my kids figured this out on their own, as did all their friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-google-offers-easier-collaboration\">2. Google offers easier collaboration.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From its inception, Google&rsquo;s app suite was built for collaboration. Being internet-first, Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc., were conceived at a time when sharing and collaborating on documents had become the norm for a new generation of workers, and Microsoft was years behind in that area. While Office 265 has stepped things up, Microsoft&rsquo;s collaboration experience remains kludgy and confusing, relying on Sharepoint and OneDrive back ends. But Google apps make it easier to see who&rsquo;s doing what, find and revert changes, and get it all done in real time without waiting for different users to save their changes.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"A document to be shared in Google Docs\" class=\"wp-image-1534525\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Accounts_payable.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>It&rsquo;s easy to share and collaborate in Google Workspace without having to worry about compatibility issues.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Jon Phillips/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-seamless-access-from-anywhere\">3. Seamless access from anywhere</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Office365 and Google Workspace live online and are accessible from any device, but Google&rsquo;s system was designed for easy access and sharability first, where Microsoft Office has a business-grade security bias that results in a lot of annoying hurdles to easy access and sharing. Whether you&rsquo;re on a browser or using Google&rsquo;s native apps on a mobile device, getting to Google Drive is always easier than hassling with Microsoft OneDrive. Chances are that anyone you want to share something with has a Gmail account, and that&rsquo;s all it takes to access Google Drive.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Google Docs Version Tracking\" class=\"wp-image-1533082\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/version-history.png\" width=\"393\" /><figcaption><p>Features like version tracking and restoring old versions is easier in Google apps than in Microsoft Office. Just pick the one you want and choose &ldquo;Restore this version.&rdquo;</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Robert Strohmeyer / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-google-apps-are-simpler\">3. Google apps are simpler</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Simplicity can be a double-edged sword, but for the average user, Google Docs and Sheets are just easier to work with than Microsoft Office. Because Google Drive is built into the suite, you don&rsquo;t have to worry much about where to put stuff. You can just create a new doc and start typing. The basic formatting tools are right there, and while it&rsquo;s possible to access advanced features, most people don&rsquo;t really need to. Google has done a brilliant job of curating an easy interface and moving the complex stuff out of the user&rsquo;s way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4-google-continually-adds-extensive-integrations\">4. Google continually adds extensive integrations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you buy a given version of Office365 (the basic personal edition gives you six apps plus Defender and OneDrive), you get a fixed collection of apps. By contrast, Google Workspace is always expanding. Pop open the Google Apps menu in the top-right corner of Google apps and you get a list of more than 20 apps, ranging from Docs and Sheets to Keep, Forms, and Voice, and even Youtube. Google&rsquo;s ecosystem of apps all work with Google Workspace in one way or another, making it easy to share your documents and content between them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5-you-probably-already-have-google-apps\">5. You probably already have Google Apps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you&rsquo;re one of those people who never signed up for a Gmail account, you probably already have Google Workspace and you&rsquo;re probably already using it. For free. There&rsquo;s nothing more to do or buy. Just embrace it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-you-might-want-to-keep-microsoft-office\">Why you might want to keep Microsoft Office</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Google&rsquo;s apps aren&rsquo;t perfect, and they&rsquo;re not always the most robust options. There are two big areas where Microsoft&rsquo;s productivity promise wins handily: Presentations and super-advanced spreadsheets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"advanced-data-wranglers-prefer-excel\">Advanced data wranglers prefer Excel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While Google Sheets is simple and easy to use and collaborate in, it doesn&rsquo;t hold a candle to the advanced capabilities of Excel. The average user may never create a pivot table or do the kind of sophisticated analysis that requires Excel, but if you <em>do </em>need those things, the comparison between these two tools isn&rsquo;t even close.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Excel Pivot Table\" class=\"wp-image-1533079\" height=\"469\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pivot-table.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Microsoft Excel does pivot tables better than Google Sheets, and it&rsquo;s easier to find and start with great templates for them.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Robert Strohmeyer / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"power-presenters-prefer-powerpoint\">Power presenters prefer PowerPoint</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve done enough serious presentation-building in my career to appreciate the sophistication of PowerPoint. It has a massive gallery of visual styles and effects, and its approach to creating layered, data-driven visuals is vastly superior to Google Slides. If you&rsquo;ve become a power user of PowerPoint, you&rsquo;ll immediately feel hampered by Slides&rsquo; oversimplified objects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On several occasions, I&rsquo;ve built my presentation decks out in PowerPoint to get the look and feel I really wanted, then exported the slides to Google Slides to use them or distribute them to team members. That&rsquo;s a pretty damning fact when it comes to declaring which is the superior presentation tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bottom-line\">Bottom line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For most people, the free Google apps are not just free, but easier to use and collaborate with than Microsoft Office is. Since most of us have Gmail or Youtube accounts anyway, we already have Google accounts and can just work there without any additional subscriptions or choices. But for serious professionals with specific needs in visual presenting or data analysis, Microsoft still reigns supreme by a wide margin. And if you do need these capabilities, your company should buy your Office365 subscription for you. Don&rsquo;t spend your own hard-earned money on it.</p>\n\nProfessional Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1533073/microsoft-office-vs-google-workspace.html", "date_published": "2023-03-23 10:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Kingston Fury Renegade SSD review: A price-to-performance gem", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"review-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" /><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Great PCIe 4.0 performance overall</li><li>Very affordable on Amazon</li><li>Fantastic TBW ratings</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Middle of the top-tier pack</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">This most affordable PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD from Kingston performs almost on par with the bigger names.

Its placement in the middle of the top-tier NVMe/PCIe 4.0 pack is more a testament to the overall quality of said pack than any pronounced weakness in the Renegade&rsquo;s performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the difference between the first-place drive and the eighth-place Renegade is a mere 4 percent. When you&rsquo;re talking about 7GB/s, any deficit is subjectively unnoticeable. And any slight drop in performance is more than compensated for by the fact that the Renegade is one of, if not <em>the</em> least-expensive PCIe 4.0 SSDs available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has extremely generous TBW (terabytes that can be written) ratings for a consumer drive.   </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html\">best SSDs</a> to learn more about competing products, what to look for in an SSD, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"kingston-fury-renegade-specifications-price-warranty\">Kingston Fury Renegade: Specifications, price, warranty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fury Renegade is a 2280 form factor (22mm wide, 80mm long) NVMe 1.4, PCIe 4.0 SSD that fits in your standard M.2 slot. It utilizes a Phison E18 and Micron 176-layer B47 3D TLC NAND. The MSRP pricing for the various capacities are as follows: 500GB for $79.99, 1TB for $112.99, 2TB (the version we tested) for $221.99, and 4TB for $629.99&mdash;but <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Renegade-Internal-SFYRS-1000G/dp/B09K36S11S/ref=asc_df_B09K3H2YHX?tag=bngsmtphsnus-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=80264475914621&amp;hvnetw=s&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvbmt=be&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=&amp;hvtargid=pla-4583863996638211&amp;th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1658193-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon offers all sizes of the drive</a> for up to 32 percent off, which makes for an incredible value.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>For the price, you&rsquo;re really not going to do much better than the Kingston Fury Renegade in a PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1658353\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ktc-product-ssd-sfyrd-2000gb-3-zm-lg-box.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The Kingston Fury Renegade NVMe SSD comes standard (pictured), or with a heatsink option for slightly more money.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the prices for the normal package with a graphene heat spreader. Our test unit arrived with a heatsink attached, an item that will set you back another $5 to $10 depending on capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In truth, few people will need the heatsink, which also will not fit in laptops. Working a drive so hard that it thermally throttles is rare, so the graphene heat spreader should be adequate. Most high-end gaming and creator motherboards come with their own heatsinks anyway. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that impressed us about the Fury Renegade is its TBW (terabytes that can be written) ratings under its limited five-year warranty. The TBW is exactly 1,000 times the stated capacity of the drive&mdash;i.e., 500TB for the 500GB, 1PB (petabyte or 1,000TB) for the 1TB, 2PB for the 2TB, and 4PB for the 4TB. Those are extremely generous for a consumer drive&mdash;about twice the norm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"kingston-fury-renegade-performance\">Kingston Fury Renegade: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Fury Renegade didn&rsquo;t top the charts in any one test, it was competitive in all of them. Outside of a slightly low sequential-read score, it was a good match for the highly rated <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1344995/samsung-990-pro-nvme-ssd-review.html\">Samsung 990 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394957/seagate-firecuda-530-review.html\">Seagate FireCuda 530</a>. It beat both in CrystalDiskMark&rsquo;s sequential-write test by a small margin.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1658258\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kingston-Fury-Renegade-CDM8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There was equally scant variance in our 48GB transfer tests. It&rsquo;s fast, though none of these drives could match the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338529/adata-legend-960-1tb-nvme-ssd-review.html\">Adata Legend 960&rsquo;s</a> 238 seconds. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1658259\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kingston-Fury-Renegade-48GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Fury Renegade fell a bit off the pace was in our 450GB write test. It&rsquo;s not slow, but it&rsquo;s 44 seconds off the pace of the FireCuda 530 and an additional 11 seconds slower than the PCIe 3 <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/793848/crucial-p3-review-top-pcie-3-speed-insanely-low-price.html\">Crucial P3</a>&mdash;an SSD it otherwise outperforms.  </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1658261\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kingston-Fury-Renegade-450GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue seemed to be that the controller couldn&rsquo;t make up its mind about the amount of date being transferred, continually having to allot more NAND as secondary cache (writing as single-bit SLC&mdash;a far faster process due to less error checking) when it ran out. You can see that in the bumpy screen capture of the copy process shown below.

One example: <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424421/ai-text-generation-is-moving-mainstream.html\">Canva launched Magic Write</a> last December, an AI-powered content tool that can write copy or suggest ideas. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1656353/microsoft-edge-copilot-adds-ai-content-creation-to-your-browser.html\">Microsoft launched Edge Copilot</a>, which offers similar features, earlier this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661514/microsoft-365-copilot-is-microsofts-ai-powers-applied-to-work.html\">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a> promises to be a game-changer, with features that will allow users to create PowerPoint presentations via a user prompt: type in &ldquo;a marketing deck for RuffRuffFunStuff&rsquo;s new spring line of dog chews,&rdquo; for example, and PowerPoint will attempt to generate a deck based on what it knows of the hypothetical brand and its products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Canva&rsquo;s Magic Presentations looks similar. Type in a similar prompt, and Magic Presentations will incorporate your brand imagery, if you have any, and lay out a presentation in various templates from the images it finds in your catalog. Canva will create the entire presentation from start to finish, though you can tweak it too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;So often, when you&rsquo;re thinking about giving a presentation you have an idea of a kind of broader-arching theme that you want to communicate,&rdquo; said Cameron Adams, one of Canva&rsquo;s co-founders, in an interview before its Canva Create conference this week. &ldquo;But getting from that blank page to actually having a presentation structure can often be a bit of a hurdle for people.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"Canva Magic Presentations\" class=\"wp-image-1665473\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Magic-Presentations.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Canva Magic Presentations can automatically construct a presentation using AI.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Canva</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Canva Magic Presentations isn&rsquo;t the only update that Canva is launching this week, however. Canva Magic Design, for example, is more in line with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419066/microsoft-designer-is-almost-a-masterpiece-already.html\">Microsoft Designer, a gorgeous AI-powered design tool</a> that PCWorld went hands on with last fall&hellip;but Microsoft has yet to launch in general availability. Like Designer, Magic Design allows you to upload an image or as style, and Magic Design will create a presentation around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features that Canva will announce at Canva Create include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Magic Edit:</strong> Essentially, this is Canva&rsquo;s version of &ldquo;inpainting,&rdquo; an AI tool where you can define part of an image and let AI replace or fill in additional detail. Alternatively, you can preserve just the highlighted area and let AI replace the rest.</li><li><strong>Magic Eraser:</strong> Like the feature that Google has added to its Pixel and Android phones, Magic Eraser allows you to select an object and &ldquo;erase&rdquo; it, replacing it with the background. This requires AI to process and isn&rsquo;t always perfect.</li></ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Canva Magic Edit\" class=\"wp-image-1665476\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Magic-Edit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Canva&rsquo;s Magic Replace is just a simple way to edit out  part of a scene and replace it with one you prefer instead.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Canva</p></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Expanded Magic Write:</strong> Magic Write is now available across the breadth of Canva, and not just as a copywriting tool.</li><li><strong>Beat Sync:</strong> One feature that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html\">Microsoft&rsquo;s Clipchamp</a> doesn&rsquo;t yet offer is syncing an audio track&rsquo;s beat to a visual scene change. Canva does, using AI to detect the audio transitions and sync them to video.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Canva is also adding features that Microsoft already offers, however. A new inking tool will transform a sketched shape, like a circle, into an actual circle (which <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/415797/microsofts-windows-ink-will-soon-do-your-math-homework-for-you.html\">Microsoft OneNote began doing</a> in about 2016 or so), and Canva&rsquo;s new translation feature has been a staple of Microsoft&rsquo;s Teams and Skype for several years. New AI-powered layouts and styles, however, are shared by both application suites.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"canva-pro\">Canva Pro</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Canva Pro\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Canva-product.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1764\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/449059/canva-review-free-tool-brings-much-needed-simplicity-to-design-process.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.canva.com/pricing/&amp;xcust=2-3-1665426-5-388646-14866&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$12.99 at  Canva</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Many of these AI features don&rsquo;t come free, however. Though Canva offers a free tier, it charges $119.99 per year for a Pro subscription, or $12.99 per month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magic Write can be used 25 times while in the free tier, but 250 times for Pro subscriptions. Magic Design and Magic Presentations are free while they&rsquo;re in beta, but will be charged later. Magic Edit is free, but only up to 100 images per day. Magic Eraser is part of the Pro tier, like the AI-powered Beat Sync, as well as anything that includes your own branding, Canva said. </p>\n\nPersonal Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1665426/cant-wait-for-microsofts-ai-powerpoint-switch-to-canva-instead.html", "date_published": "2023-03-23 05:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
