Kelleran Beq first appeared in the Star Wars kids\u2019 game show Jedi Temple Challenge and appears in a Grogu Order 66 flashback showing how Beq fought fiercely to get the child to safety. So how did Kelleran Beq go from kids\u2019 game show host on Star Wars Jedi Temple Challenge to the rescuer of the literal future of Star Wars? Join IGN host Max Scoville for the full breakdown on Star Wars Canon Fodder.\u00a0\n\nAhmed Best is perhaps best known for his role as Jar Jar Binks in the Star Wars prequel films, but he gets a major chance at redemption in his return as Kelleran Beq. So if you\u2019re wondering who is Kelleran Beq, he\u2019s the Jedi who rescued Grogu from Order 66. And if you\u2019re also wondering is Jedi Temple Challenge canon, the answer is\u2026kind of. The Star Wars game show uses a canon character (Kelleran Beq) to tell the non-canon stories in the series.\u00a0\n\nStar Wars has shown us many angles of Order 66 at this point, and this time Kelleran Beq Mandalorian is the next Ahmed Best Star Wars and Ahmed Best Mandalorian character you need to know about.
