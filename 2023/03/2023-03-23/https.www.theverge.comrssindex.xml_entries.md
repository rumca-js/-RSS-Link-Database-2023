  <p id="a61i0g">TikTok’s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, seemed to arrive at the Capitol well-prepared.</p>
<p id="eRPrCr">Taking his seat before dozens of House Energy and Commerce Committee members Thursday, he opened a packet of notes, diligently indexed with sticky notes. In the packet, there appeared to be a sheet matching the names and faces of the lawmakers preparing to question him — many of whom had already made up their minds over whether the app was safe for Americans.</p>
<p id="mMDCZ5">“Your platform should be banned,” Chair Cathy McMorris-Rodgers (R-WA) said in her opening statement Thursday. “I expect today you’ll say anything to avoid this outcome.”</p>
<p id="RPG8Pe">For more than three years, TikTok has been operating under the looming threat of a nationwide ban. But what was once a GOP-led campaign...</p>

  <p id="94K8T1">People all over the world can now pay for Twitter, as the company has announced that its Twitter Blue subscription service is <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1638988196380827651">now available globally</a>. While the subscription has been pretty widely available before (you could sign up for it in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230322055344/https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue">almost 50 countries</a>), the expanded availability reflects the company’s drive to make Twitter Blue an increasingly important part of the service.</p>
<p id="UqfLFA">Part of those efforts, however, includes making promises that it hasn’t kept yet. The company’s announcement tweets list some of the benefits of Twitter Blue, such as getting a checkmark, the ability to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591472/twitter-blue-subscribers-longer-tweets-4000-characters">write longer tweets</a>, getting prioritized ranking in conversations, and seeing half as many ads. Those last two, however, haven’t actually rolled out yet....</p>

  <p id="cdbSFU">“All electric vehicles drive the same.” That’s a criticism I hear pretty often lately, especially from car enthusiasts who are none too happy to lose things like engine noises and manual transmissions. It’s not exactly accurate; a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range">Porsche Taycan</a> will deliver a pretty radically different experience from a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302883/vw-id4-review-volkswagen-ev-specs-range-photos-video">Volkswagen ID.4</a>, for example, and they come from the same parent company. But that assessment isn’t completely incorrect, either.</p>
<p id="e4Ef2N">The truth is that there probably are fewer ways EVs feel different from one another compared to internal combustion cars. And the general auto industry consensus seems to be that cars of the future will be less defined by individual driving dynamics and more by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23445325/google-renault-sdv-ai-digital-twin-android">software-driven functions</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23540709/ram-1500-revolution-concept-ev-truck-ces-photos-specs">special features</a>. </p>

And now, <em>The Verge</em> has learned more details about the company’s next portable speaker. According to people familiar with Sonos’ product road map, the Move (Gen 2) is currently under development for release sometime in the second half of 2023. I’d expect it in the late summer / early fall timeframe.</p>

  <p id="pq8uRj">It is a shame Andy Serkis never won an award for his work as Gollum in the Peter Jackson-helmed <em>The</em> <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy. The way he managed to evoke two distinct personalities — Gollum and his mild-mannered Hobbit alter ego Sméagol — with his voice and body movements is a performance that should have netted him one of those goofy-looking gold statues. In a hands-on demo of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/24/23138534/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-release-date"><em>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</em></a>, I was reminded of Serkis’ mercurial performance as Gollum and was pleased to see that those dual personalities were a fundamental part of the game.</p>
<p id="DXVAJ2">In my short time with <em>Gollum</em>, I got to scamper around Mordor chasing troublesome crows and avoiding orcs, which, if they catch you, will automatically give you a “game over.” Sneakiness...</p>

## Dell’s new Latitude 9440 is one of the smallest 14-inch business laptops you can buy

  <p id="ZfTgUO">Dell’s new Latitude 9440, as far as I can glean from the photos, is a Latitude with XPS vibes. It’s a convertible made of machined aluminum, it weighs a bit over three pounds, it’s got a 16:10 display, and it’s got a 91.5 percent screen-to-body ratio — which is, according to Dell, the best screen-to-body ratio on a “14-inch commercial ultra-premium PC”. (It’s 12.2. x 8.46 x  0.59 inches.)</p>
<p id="iajV92">Hilariously specific accolades aside, this 2-in-1 device (which does not yet have announced pricing and availability, though I’ll spare you the suspense and predict that it will not be cheap) looks like a C-suite-oriented commercial product with a few funky features that you wouldn’t necessarily expect to see on... well, a Dell Latitude. </p>

Path tracing, also known as full ray tracing, will be enabled in the game on April 11th, which will bring even more accurately simulated light to the role-playing game.</p>
<p id="7sP9Lq">Path tracing is film-like rendering that’s been used by studios like Pixar to create incredible visuals in movies. Visual effects artists use path tracing for film and TV graphics, but it’s incredibly GPU-intensive for video games.

It’s the latest breach in a series of high-profile YouTube accounts being hacked, with scammers regularly gaining access to prominent accounts to rename them and livestream crypto scam videos.</p>

  <p id="Wg72di">TikTok’s CEO Shou Zi Chew is set to testify before Congress for the first time on Thursday, facing some of his app’s most dogged opponents in an attempt to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23629469/restrict-act-bytedance-tiktok-ban-bipartisan-bill-warner">mitigate a nationwide ban</a> attempt.</p>
<p id="wW7nvG">For more than three years, TikTok has been operating under the threat of a potential ban in the US. Now, with more than 150 million American users, the threats have escalated into legislation and an ultimatum from the Biden administration. Thursday’s hearing with the GOP-led House Committee on Energy and Commerce could be Chew and TikTok’s last shot at convincing lawmakers that the app is safe.</p>

<p id="ISoHLo">Although <em>Lego 2K Drive</em> is an open-world racing game similar to the <em>Forza Horizon</em> series, it also seems to incorporate some elements of the kart racing genre.

  <p id="N7RxB7">Lenovo has announced some of the top laptops that its Legion gaming arm will release in 2023. Among them are refreshes to the 16-inch Slim 7, Slim 7i, Slim 5, and Slim 5i as well as a new Slim 5 in a 14-inch size. These are, as the name implies, thinner and more portable devices than the beefiest gaming rigs on the market.</p>
<p id="BLU8qN">In addition to new processors from Intel and AMD, the devices include physical AI chips that power what Lenovo is calling its “AI Engine+.” This feature, Lenovo says, will dynamically adjust a system’s thermals to “optimize cooling on the fly and maintain maximum output with minimal noise.”</p>

  <p id="AOJht1">The US Federal Trade Commission is proposing a formal ban on subscriptions that are simple to start but difficult to stop. This morning, it announced a notice of proposed rulemaking it dubs “click to cancel,” requiring companies to make ending a subscription equivalently simple to signing up for one. That includes letting people use the same method for both actions — so a business can’t, for instance, let someone sign up for a service online but make them call a phone number to cancel.</p>
<p id="1BIbIJ">The rule has a couple of other provisions. Many companies try to keep subscribers by offering special deals or perks, and they’re still allowed to do that, but they must offer an up-front opt-out that lets customers bypass the sales pitches. They also have...</p>
