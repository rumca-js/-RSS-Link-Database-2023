If you didn’t like Valheim on PC, the Xbox console port is unlikely to change your mind. However, if you’ve never experienced the game and you have access to an Xbox but not a PC, this version of Valheim is definitely worth checking out. It has feature and content parity with the PC version, crossplay support, and the unparalleled sense of adventure and discovery that the original game has. 

Both versions are also still in Early Access, so they will benefit from ongoing updates, improvements, and expansions. If you’re also an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, Valheim is available through that subscription on console just as it is on PC, which makes it a no-brainer for users of that service.
