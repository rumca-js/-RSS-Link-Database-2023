<p>FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried may be stuck using a dumb phone for the foreseeable future. In a letter seen by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-04/bankman-fried-gets-a-flip-phone-while-out-on-bail-us-says?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, prosecutors involved in his criminal case said Friday that Bankman-Fried’s lawyers had agreed to modify the terms of his bail agreement. Provided the judge overseeing the case agrees to the changes, SBF will be restricted to using a “non-smartphone” without internet connectivity. Unless a lawyer is present, he will also be forbidden from contacting current or former FTX and Alameda Research employees. Additionally, SBF won’t be able to use encrypted messaging apps, including Signal.</p><p>The proposed restrictions come after Bankman-Fried allegedly attempted to contact the general counsel of FTX’s US subsidiary <a href="https://www.engadget.com/federal-prosecutors-ask-court-to-bar-sam-bankman-fried-from-using-signal-214122181.html"><ins>over Signal</ins></a> at the start of the year. “I would really love to reconnect and see if there’s a way for us to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other,” he said in one message, according to the Justice Department.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Earlier in the week, Nishad Singh, FTX’s former director of engineering, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftx-co-founder-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty-to-fraud-and-conspiracy-charges-192939749.html"><ins>pleaded guilty</ins></a> to federal fraud and conspiracy charges. Singh is the third of Bankman-Fried’s inner circle to cooperate with prosecutors in the case against him. At the end of last year, former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Zixiao &quot;Gary&quot; Wang <a href="https://www.engadget.com/two-top-fbx-executives-plead-guilty-to-fraud-and-are-cooperating-with-prosecutors-101009292.html">pleaded guilty to fraud charges</a> and said they would cooperate with investigators.</p><p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, District Judge Lewis Kaplan threatened to revoke Bankman-Fried’s bail and send him to jail before the start of his trial after learning that the disgraced entrepreneur may have influenced potential witnesses. Last month, Kaplan also banned Bankman-Fried from using a virtual private network (VPN) after his lawyers said he used one to watch a football game. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-can-have-flip-phone-limited-internet-while-bail-us-proposes-2023-03-04/">According to Reuters</a>, Kaplan said he did not want SBF &quot;loose in this garden of electronic devices.”</p><p>Under the modified bail agreement, SBF would be allowed to use a laptop to surf the web, but his access would be filtered through a VPN that would limit him to two categories of websites. One category would include resources his defense team says are critical to his case. The other features a list of 23 websites SBF could use to order food, read the news and watch streaming content. No word yet if the proposed restrictions would limit him from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-files-motion-to-end-ftx-sponsorship-deal-213121253.html">playing <em>League of Legends</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/justice-department-wants-sam-bankman-fried-to-use-a-flip-phone-for-the-rest-of-his-bail-201356652.html?src=rss

## Biden administration bars CHIPS Act funding recipients from expanding in China

<p>Chipmakers hoping to tap into the Biden administration’s $39 billion semiconductor manufacturing subsidy program will need to sign agreements promising they won’t expand production capacity in China. The requirement was among a handful of funding conditions the US Commerce Department outlined this week after <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2023/02/28/CHIPS-Commercial_Fabrication_Facilities_NOFO_0.pdf"><ins>announcing</ins></a> it would begin accepting applications for money from the CHIPS Act in late June. Congress <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chips-and-science-act-to-become-law-204602799.html"><ins>passed</ins></a> the $280 billion measure last July in a rare show of bipartisan cooperation and set aside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chips-and-science-act-funding-plan-biden-administration-semiconductors-chips-144633914.html">$52 billion</a> in tax credits and funding for US semiconductor firms to expand domestic production.</p><p>“Recipients will be required to enter into an agreement restricting their ability to expand semiconductor manufacturing capacity in foreign countries of concern for a period of 10 years after taking the money,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters, per the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9f4f9684-088c-45eb-b6bf-962061bfea7b"><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>. Raimondo did not name China by name. However, the superpower is among the nations the US government considers a “foreign country of concern.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, Raimondo said CHIPS Act recipients cannot “knowingly engage in any joint research or technology licensing effort with a foreign entity of concern that involves sensitive technologies or products,” a requirement likely designed to discourage domestic firms from signing agreements like the one Ford recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-reportedly-plans-to-build-a-35-billion-ev-battery-plant-in-michigan-213730306.html"><ins>announced with China’s CATL</ins></a>.</p><p>“I also want to be clear that no CHIPS dollars can be spent on stock buybacks,” Raimondo said. “This is about investing in our national security, not enabling these companies to use our money to increase their profits.” The Commerce Department will also require companies applying for more than $150 million to outline how they plan to provide affordable childcare to workers, a funding condition Raimondo said reflects the current labor market. In some instances, the agency may require those same recipients to return some of the money they receive from the CHIPS Act to the government if they generate excess profits.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-bars-chips-act-funding-recipients-from-expanding-in-china-172637590.html?src=rss

<p>Deep Brain Stimulation therapies have proven an invaluable treatment option for patients suffering from otherwise debilitating diseases like Parkinson's. However, it — and its sibling tech, brain computer interfaces — currently suffer a critical shortcoming: the electrodes that convert electron pulses into bioelectric signals don't sit well with the surrounding brain tissue. And that's where folks with the lab coats and holding squids come in! In<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9XZS1BcmUtRWxlY3RyaWMtMjAwLVllYXItQmlvZWxlY3RyaWMtZWJvb2svZHAvQjBCMzhTVlBCWj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1tay0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODYzMWMzZjAtNTQ5Ni00OTgzLWJiNWItNTE0MzBiYThmYzRkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXR5CFdWTWmgMQtT-Lbpr3SlD1Z0nrJZxqHEkFq4j9ko&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWe-Are-Electric-200-Year-Bioelectric-ebook%2Fdp%2FB0B38SVPBZ"><em>We Are Electric: Inside the 200-Year Hunt for Our Body's Bioelectric Code, and What the Future Holds</em></a><em>, </em>author Sally Adee delves into two centuries of research into an often misunderstood and maligned branch of scientific discovery, guiding readers from the pioneering works of Alessandro Volta to the life-saving applications that might become possible once doctors learn to communicate directly with our body's cells.</p><figure><img alt="Black backrgound with white and blue writing" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c9c7fc20-ae40-11ed-a9fa-ebfee75242bb" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hachette Books</div></figure><p>Excerpted from <a href="https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/sally-adee/we-are-electric/9780306826641/"><em>We Are Electric: Inside the 200-Year Hunt for Our Body's Bioelectric Code, and What the Future Holds</em></a> by Sally Adee.

Neurons, though, use ions like sodium and potassium. This matters because, to make a simple analogy, that means you need to translate the language.”</p><p>“One of the misnomers within the field actually is that I’m injecting current through these electrodes,” explains Kip Ludwig. “Not if I’m doing it right, I don’t.” The electrons that travel down a platinum or titanium wire to the implant never make it into your brain tissue. Instead, they line up on the electrode. This produces a negative charge, which pulls ions from the neurons around it. “If I pull enough ions away from the tissue, I cause voltage-gated ion channels to open,” says Ludwig. That can — but doesn’t always — make a nerve fire an action potential. Get nerves to fire. That’s it — that’s your only move.</p><p>It may seem counterintuitive: the nervous system runs on action potentials, so why wouldn’t it work to just try to write our own action potentials on top of the brain’s own ones? The problem is that our attempts to write action potentials can be incredibly ham-fisted, says Ludwig. They don’t always do what we think they do. For one thing, our tools are nowhere near precise enough to hit only the exact neurons we are trying to stimulate. So the implant sits in the middle of a bunch of different cells, sweeping up and activating unrelated neurons with its electric field. Remember how I said glia were traditionally considered the brain’s janitorial staff? Well, more recently it emerged that they also do some information processing—and our clumsy electrodes will fire them too, to unknown effects. “It’s like pulling the stopper on your bathtub and only trying to move one of three toy boats in the bathwater,” says Ludwig. And even if we do manage to hit the neurons we’re trying to, there’s no guarantee that the stimulation is hitting it in the correct location.</p><p>To bring electroceuticals into medicine, we really need better techniques to talk to cells. If the electron-to-ion language barrier is an obstacle to talking to neurons, it’s an absolute non-starter for cells that don’t use action potentials, like the ones that we are trying to target with next-generation electrical interventions, including skin cells, bone cells, and the rest. If we want to control the membrane voltage of cancer cells to coax them back to normal behavior; if we want to nudge the wound current in skin or bone cells; if we want to control the fate of a stem cell—none of that is achievable with our one and only tool of making a nerve fire an action potential. We need a bigger toolkit. Luckily, this is the objective for a fast-growing area of research looking to make devices, computing elements, and wiring that can talk to ions in their native tongue.</p><p>Several research groups are working on “mixed conduction,” a project whose goal is devices that can speak bioelectricity. It relies heavily on plastics and advanced polymers with long names that often include punctuation and numbers. If the goal is a DBS electrode you can keep in the brain for more than ten years, these materials will need to safely interact with the body’s native tissues for much longer than they do now. And that search is far from over. People are understandably beginning to wonder: why not just skip the middle man and actually make this stuff out of biological materials instead of manufacturing polymers? Why not learn how nature does it?</p><p>It’s been tried before. In the 1970s, there was a flurry of interest in using coral for bone grafts instead of autografts. Instead of a traumatic double-surgery to harvest the necessary bone tissue from a different part of the body, coral implants acted as a scaffold to let the body’s new bone cells grow into and form the new bone. Coral is naturally osteoconductive, which means new bone cells happily slide onto it and find it an agreeable place to proliferate. It’s also biodegradable: after the bone grew onto it, the coral was gradually absorbed, metabolized, and then excreted by the body. Steady improvements have produced few inflammatory responses or complications. Now there are several companies growing specialized coral for bone grafts and implants.</p><p>After the success of coral, people began to take a closer look at marine sources for biomaterials. This field is now rapidly evolving — thanks to new processing methods which have made it possible to harvest a lot of useful materials from what used to be just marine waste, the last decade has seen an increasing number of biomaterials that originate from marine organisms. These include replacement sources for gelatin (snails), collagen (jellyfish), and keratin (sponges), marine sources of which are plentiful, biocompatible, and biodegradable. And not just inside the body — one reason interest in these has spiked is the effort to move away from polluting synthetic plastic materials.</p><p>Apart from all the other benefits of marine-derived dupes, they’re also able to conduct an ion current. That was what Marco Rolandi was thinking about in 2010 when he and his colleagues at the University of Washington built a transistor out of a piece of squid.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-we-are-electric-sally-adee-hachette-books-153003295.html?src=rss

## NASA's DART spacecraft took out over 1,000 tons of rock from its target asteroid

<p>Last year, NASA's DART spacecraft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-dart-mission-smashing-success-184543626.html">successfully completed</a> its mission: To collide with an asteroid called Dimorphos to see if it's possible to change the trajectory of any potentially planet-killing space rock. Scientists from the DART team have been analyzing the data collected from the mission since then, and they've now <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9kNDE1ODYtMDIzLTAwNjAxLTQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRiZDA0ZWUwLWE3YmItNDJkYi1hNTQ3LWU1YjI2ZTBhYjI4MiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAawML_SZkPZXhjFdNyc22ha6NZIK4GbwZW_En1Otcdk6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-023-00601-4">published five papers in Nature</a> explaining the details of DART's results. They've also decided that, yes, the method <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-dart-data-validates-kinetic-impact-as-planetary-defense-method">can be used</a> to defend Earth if ever an asteroid big enough to kill us all heads our way.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, one of DART's solar panels hit Dimosphos first before its body fully collided with the rock at 6km per second (3.7 miles per second). The spacecraft smashed into the asteroid around 25 meters (85 feet) from its center, which was a huge factor in the mission's success, since it maximized the force of the impact. According to the studies, the collision had managed to eject 1 million kilograms or 1,100 tons of rock from Dimorphos. That spray of rubble flew outwards away from the asteroid, generating four times the momentum of DART's impact and changing Dimorphos' trajectory even further.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While NASA has only tested the mission on one space rock, the scientists have concluded that for asteroids as big as Dimorphos (around 560 feet across), we don't even need to send an advance reconnaissance mission. As long as we get at least few years of warning time, though a few decades would be preferable, then we will be able to intercept future asteroid threads.   Franck Marchis at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, told <em>Nature</em>: "[W]e can quickly design a mission to deflect an asteroid if there is a threat, and we know that this has a very high chance of being effective."</p><p>We're bound to get an even better look at the mission's effect on the asteroid after European Space Agency's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-02-esa-approves-hera-asteroid-deflection-ission.html">Hera spacecraft</a> arrives at Dimorphos in 2026. The mission will study the binary asteroid system Didymos and Dimorphos to further validate DART's kinetic impact method or future use.&nbsp;</p><div id="f36f2881139c47d28f4cbd1453ca1130"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nasas-dart-spacecraft-took-out-over-1000-tons-of-rock-from-its-target-asteroid-150139905.html?src=rss

## Amazon is shutting down eight cashierless Go stores

<p>Amazon is closing down two cashierless Go stores in New York City, two in Seattle and four in San Francisco on April 1st, according to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-closing-eight-amazon-go-convenience-stores-in-latest-tightening-of-its-physical-retail/"><em>GeekWire</em></a>. The e-retail giant made the announcement on the same day it admitted that it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-freezes-construction-of-second-headquarters-in-virginia-amid-job-cuts-173755605.html">pausing construction</a> on its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia as it reassesses its office needs in the face of more and more people preferring to work remotely. As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-03/amazon-closing-cashierless-stores-in-nyc-san-francisco-seattle?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> notes, these are but Amazon's latest cost-cutting moves amidst slowing sales growth. In January, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html">expanded its planned job cuts</a> from 10,000 to 18,000 roles, with the layoffs since then mostly impacting personnel from its retail and recruiting divisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Company spokesperson Jessica Martin told the publications in a statement: &quot;Like any physical retailer, we periodically assess our portfolio of stores and make optimization decisions along the way. We remain committed to the Amazon Go format, operate more than 20 Amazon Go stores across the US and will continue to learn which locations and features resonate most with customers.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The internet retail titan's Go stores were designed to be high-tech shops equipped with cameras and sensors that can detect when products are taken and returned to shelves. Customers can grab any item they want, which will be added to their virtual cart for online payment, and then walk out of the store without having to pass by a cashier.&nbsp;</p><p>While Amazon still has over 20 Go stores in the country, it has long struggled to conquer the physical retail space and has been changing up strategies every so often. It used to have 87 retail pop-up kiosks across the US, but the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-06-amazon-shutting-down-retail-pop-ups-whole-foods-kohls.html">shut them down</a> before the pandemic hit. And in 2022, Amazon closed down all 68 of its physical bookstores, pop-up locations and 4-star shops in the US and UK. Just this February, though, CEO Andy Jassy said the company plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-plans-to-eventually-go-big-on-physical-grocery-stores-154524344.html">go big on its brick-and-mortar</a> grocery store business. He told the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f132299d-3b31-4248-8ddf-81182c5930fc?uuid=s1PMXHAasdhrpbcd0295"><em>Financial Times</em></a><em>:</em> &quot;We're hopeful that in 2023, we have a format that we want to go big on, on the physical side.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-shutting-down-eight-cashierless-go-stores-100102563.html?src=rss
