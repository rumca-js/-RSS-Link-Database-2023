And he claims it's working. I'm suspicious, given that Mcdonald's food <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-3559112/McDonald-s-cheeseburger-chips-hasn-t-rotted-TEN-YEARS.html\" target=\"_blank\">literally never goes bad.</a> But we'll see how it pans out for him. </p><p>Fifty-six-year-old Kevin Maginnis decided to eat only Mickey D's for 100 days after he weighed 238 pounds on February 21st. He's apparently already down to 223 pounds.</p><p>On the first day, Maginnis announced the new diet plan in a TikTok: <em>\"I'm gonna eat nothing but McDonald's for the next 100 days. But instead of eating everything they give me, I'm going to go ahead and cut the meals in half. Just to kind of prove to myself and maybe some of the other people watching that it's not as much what you're eating, it's the quantity that we're eating that really jacks us up.\" </em></p><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bigmaccoaching/video/7202854510778223914\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n<section>\n<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bigmaccoaching\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@bigmaccoaching\">@bigmaccoaching</a>\n<p>Challenge: Eating mcdonalds every meal for the next 100 days to lose weight!  #mcdonalds #mcdonaldschallenge #weightloss #bigmaccoaching #transformativecoaching #nashvilleweightlosstransformation  #weightlossjourney #100daychallenge</p>\n</section>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bigmaccoaching/video/7206659266327940395\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n<section>\n<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bigmaccoaching\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@bigmaccoaching\">@bigmaccoaching</a>\n<p>Nothing but McDonalds for 100 days, 3 meals a day, cut in 1/2!  #portioncontrol  #Mcdonalds #mcdonaldschallenge #100daychallenge #100dayweightloss #bigmaccoaching #transformativecoaching #nashvilleweightlosstransformation #weightlossjourney #weightloss #mcdonaldsweightloss #unsupersizeme #supersizeme #halfsizeme #1/2sizeme</p>\n</section>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br /></p><p>Maginnis also cut out all snacks. His first day consisted of a Sausage McMuffin, hash brown, and a quarter pounder with fries. Despite the drop in weight, by day three, his bloodwork showed \"not good\" blood sugar, but he thinks this will improve as he loses more weight. </p><p>He said he chose McDonald's not because of any sponsorship, which was honestly my first thought. I can't imagine someone willingly consuming that much grease without a paycheck. While on the Today show last week, he <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/03/03/nashville-man-eating-only-mcdonalds-for-100-days-to-lose-weight/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a>,<em> \"I\u2019m big [and] my name is Maginnis, so the nickname Big Mac has been thrown out at times. I figured, 'Why not embrace it?' And I like McDonald\u2019s.\u201d</em></p><p>We'll see how this pans out for him. It seems like the calorie restriction is working, but the bloodwork might not come back totally a-ok.  And as someone who worked at a McDonald's when I was 17, I do not recommend this strategy. A lot goes on in those kitchens you'd probably rather not know about. </p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grandpa-mcdonalds-weight", "date_published": "2023-03-04 14:36:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Watch as this perfectly normal person donning cat ears explains why Christianity shouldn't be taught in schools", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33208816&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C200%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>In general, if someone is wearing cat ears, I tend to take them less seriously. If seriously at all. This is a new rule of thumb of mine, as the phenomenon of adults wearing cat ears is a very recent one.

Every child. When I go to Arizona Christian University's website [...] 'Above all else, be committed to Jesus Christ. Accomplishing His will and advancing His Kingdom on Earth as in Heaven.\" </em></p><p>Which sounds pretty good to me. But she went on to decry the college's promotion of Biblical values, such as the centrality of family, sexual morality, and marriage as defined between a man and a woman. Even better. </p><p>But Miss Cat Ears was quite displeased. </p><p><em>\"We have added our pronouns at the dias as solidarity to let our LGBTQ community know that we stand in making sure that they feel protected. Are we only performing performative solidarity, or are we going to dig deep and actually look at the partnerships we're doing?\"</em></p><p>First, I would say that yes, it is completely performative to add your <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/church-of-england-gender-neutral\" target=\"_blank\">pronouns</a>. It always is. No one was actually questioning your gender and frankly, no one cares. </p><p>But second, I would say that her concern over not achieving excelling for every child due to a partnership with a Christian university is completely unfounded. Christianity is the only thing that can heal division and allow children to feel accepted and loved for who they are. Dividing them up by race or gender, or in this case, feline, only makes matters worse. </p>", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/board-member-cat-ears-schools", "date_published": "2023-03-04 14:12:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "WATCH: Mom Torches The Teacher's Union that Sued Her For Asking Questions About Kindergarten Curriculum", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33208789&amp;width=2000&amp;height=1500&amp;coordinates=209%2C0%2C111%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>Nothing says total transparency like suing a parent for asking what is being taught to their children!

It's an obsession Elba says hinders people\u2019s aspirations and growth. It's why he stopped describing himself as a \"black actor.\" Elba was essentially marginalizing HIMSELF and putting himself in a box.</p><p>\"I didn\u2019t become an actor because I didn\u2019t see black people doing it and I wanted to change that. I did it because I thought that\u2019s a great profession and I could do a good job at it. As you get up the ladder, you get asked what it\u2019s like to be the first black to do this or that. Well, it\u2019s the same as it would be if I were white. It\u2019s the first time for <em>me</em>. I don\u2019t want to be the first black. I\u2019m the first Idris.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c561c\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33013516&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>I recognize this is easy for me to say as someone who looks less Hershey's chocolate than he does Hellmann's mayonnaise. I don't know the struggle of walking down the street and having strangers assume I can dunk a basketball, play bass guitar, and know the proper amount of seasoning to put in food. But it would drive me insane if I took my craft seriously, spent my entire life perfecting it, and work my ass off on a piece of art I'm proud of. Only to have the primary concern of others be \"so, what's it like to do all those things with your skin color.\"</p><p>It also tends to be woke-ass white reporters who are the most obsessed. Todd Bowles, head coach to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, had to explain to two woke journalismers how in 2023 it's <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/todd-bowles-woke-reporter\" target=\"_blank\">not all that noteworthy to be coaching against another black guy</a>. And how the minute reporters stop making a big deal out of it, everybody else will as well.</p><p>Whether Idris Elba goes on to become either the first black James Bond or the next James Bond, as has been rumored for years, is still anybody's guess. Whatever his next role is, Idris is just going to do Idris.</p><p><p>\n<em><strong>Editor\u2019s Note</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong><a href=\"https://lwcnewswire.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LwC is on Substack now</a></strong>!

There's a chance I'm getting trolled, which would make me the one without the brains. Fair play if that's the case. Most likely, she sent the video to a few friends. One of those friends was kind enough to upload this person being outsmarted by a dog. They must have known we'd all be easily amused by it.
