Jordan has starred in the Creed sequels as Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed, son of tragically killed former champ Apollo Creed. And with Creed III uppercutting theaters nationwide it\u2019s time to GO FOR IT! and rank all the Rocky flicks.\n\nThe Rocky movies morphed from earnest sports dramas into, for all intents and purposes, superhero stories with heightened stakes, action, and premises. That was fitting for a franchise that started in the \u201970s and transitioned into the \u201980s. The Creed movies\u2019 tone and traction are much more in line with the 2006 legacy sequel Rocky Balboa, which sought to deliver a sadder, more grounded take while also giving the Rocky character a better ending than 1990's Rocky V.\n\nRyan Coogler's Creed brought together all the pieces from the movies that came before it, even ones with disparate tones, and delivered a knockout punch to the feelings. So what's been the best outing for the franchise? What's the weakest link? Let's use our Eye of the Tiger and find the true hierarchy of the Rocky/Creed legacy.\n\n#IGN", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXJK3DnqN6o", "date_published": "2023-03-04 14:30:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Glorious - Official Trailer (2023) Ryan Kawnten, J.K.
