<p>Microwave crisps, simple seed bread and a quick shortcut for almond tarts</p><p>We’re all looking to work smarter, so if I can share a tip that will save time, avoid food waste, save on energy and make the household budget go further, I will. Here, the “hands-free” bread and “cheat’s” almond tarts can wait until you turn on the oven for something else. Or forget the oven entirely – have you ever tried making your own microwave crisps? One potato will yield the equivalent of an individual bag for a fraction of the cost, and no single-use packaging, either.</p><p>Nancy Birtwhistle is the author of Clean &amp; Green and Green Living Made Easy.

<p>These moreish flapjacks are easy to make with store-cupboard ingredients, so tinker at will</p><p>Recently, I’ve been toying with the idea of not cooking. By that I mean chopping and mixing my way to meals and snacks to give myself more time elsewhere. At this stage of my life (working mum to two young children), I see huge value in such dishes, because they allow me to make something homemade without buying expensive (or highly processed) foods. I wrote today’s recipe for flapjacks, which are set in the fridge, for my girls – and to use up leftover fruit and nuts from Christmas – and they went down a treat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/04/vegan-fridge-flapjacks-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

I like to make my own pie crust, but I often cheat with the filling. Here, I’ve used cheese, diced potatoes and plenty of softened leeks to bind the filling, avoiding any need to make a traditional roux. Just keep the pastry ingredients cold when mixing and rest the pie before baking – the key to a good crust.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/04/leek-tarragon-ticklemore-cheese-pie-recipe-thomasina-miers">Continue reading...</a>

## When it comes to foundation, stamina trumps finish all day long | Sali Hughes

<p>If your skin type or lifestyle means makeup fades quickly, it’s worth trying out foundations built for endurance</p><p>You may have observed the huge trend for “clean foundations” – that is, (usually) American makeup bases that mostly just adhere to existing European ingredients and safety guidelines, throw in some lovely natural oils, and are marketed as disruptive innovation. Many have beautiful textures, packaging and finishes, and I’m pro all three, but here’s what no one admits: they don’t last. If you’re someone whose skin type or lifestyle encourages makeup to fade, streak or break for the border by lunchtime, you’ll need a foundation designed specifically for stamina if you want it to stick around – and the longest-lasting ones are made by huge companies with fortunes to spend on research.</p><p>The most famously durable base is Estée Lauder <a href="https://www.esteelauder.co.uk/product/643/3894/product-catalog/makeup/face/foundations/double-wear/stay-in-place-foundation-spf-10?shade=0N1_Alabaster">DoubleWear</a> (£38.50), a product so successful that it alone is bigger than many major brands. Double Wear would hold steady in a tornado, promises 24-hour wear and comes in a commendable 60 shades, none of which alter on skin (inferior foundations turn orange on oilier types), so there’s no chance of not finding one to suit. Its texture (oil-free) and finish (shine-controlling) are not for everyone – drier skins will prefer its younger sister, <a href="https://www.esteelauder.co.uk/product/643/71600/product-catalog/makeup/face/foundations/futurist-hydra-rescue/moisturizing-foundation-spf-45">Futurist Hydra Rescue</a> (£39), or Nars’ <a href="https://www.narscosmetics.co.uk/en/natural-radiant-longwear-foundation/999NAC0000065.html">Natural Radiant Longwear Foundation</a> (£39) – but as any Double Wear devotee will tell you, there is nothing better for its specific job.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/04/when-it-comes-to-foundation-stamina-trumps-finish-all-day-long">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Batting on another plane’: how Travis Head broke the spell – and India hearts

<p>When Australia lost their first wicket to the second ball of the day, things looked grim. Then Travis Head slammed the door</p><p>When you read back over the scorecard in years to come, it will look easy. A run chase of 76 is a formality. Done in little more than an hour, purring along at 4.14 runs per over? Standard. Except it wasn’t. Not when the first ball of the third morning exploded in a dust cloud like a Dakar rally jeep jumping a dune. Not when Ravichandran Ashwin dialled back the turn on the next delivery, just enough of it to flick the bat so softly that even Usman Khawaja didn’t know he was out.</p><p>For the next 10 overs, Ashwin laid siege. Spin partner Ravindra Jadeja was his support. There was one Marnus Labuschagne boundary from a short ball, nine singles that were varyingly unconvincing, and a parade of deliveries that beat edges, leapt sharply, kept low, ragged on sharp angles, skidded straight, evaded gloves, drew appeals and reviews for leg before or for close catches. Australia were 13 for 1 and ripe to raise that second number.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/04/batting-on-another-plane-how-travis-heads-hitting-broke-the-spell-and-indias-heart">Continue reading...</a>
