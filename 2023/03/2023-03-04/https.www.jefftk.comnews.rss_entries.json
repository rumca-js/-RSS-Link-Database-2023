At the time I was thinking I would still\nmostly play my \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/new-mandolin\">acoustic</a> or bring both to\ngigs, but instead I've ended up switching entirely.  I \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/acoustic-vs-electric-mandolin\">compared recordings</a> and \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/microphone-on-electric-mandolin\">amplification</a> \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/microphone-on-electric-mandolin-ii\">options</a>, and it turns\nout that the cleaner sound works much better in the chaos of a dance\nhall.  I also really like that it works \n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/playing-with-a-talk-box\">with a talk box</a> and that I don't\nneed to worry about feedback on stage anymore.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/anna-playing-electric-mandolin-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"434\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/anna-playing-electric-mandolin.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI still play the acoustic when I'm jamming with friends or family, but\nit now spends most months without getting out of its case.  Which does\nmake me sad; it's a good mandolin and I enjoy playing it.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02bcigScJHbzCsSkKwpsgwnqNy1ABk2r4Nyur6Bq8m2aoCbpVC2VSeeJYNw18kD76Ll\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/W64dkvMCmoR94ddYf\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/109965780225505305\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/switching-to-electric-mandolin", "date_published": "2023-03-04 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
