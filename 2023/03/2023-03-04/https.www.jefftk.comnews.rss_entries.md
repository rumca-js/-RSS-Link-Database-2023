A little over a year ago I bought a </span>

electric mandolin</a>.  At the time I was thinking I would still
mostly play my 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/new-mandolin">acoustic</a> or bring both to
gigs, but instead I've ended up switching entirely.  I 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/acoustic-vs-electric-mandolin">compared recordings</a> and 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/microphone-on-electric-mandolin">amplification</a> 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/microphone-on-electric-mandolin-ii">options</a>, and it turns
out that the cleaner sound works much better in the chaos of a dance
hall.  I also really like that it works

need to worry about feedback on stage anymore.

I still play the acoustic when I'm jamming with friends or family, but
it now spends most months without getting out of its case.  Which does
make me sad; it's a good mandolin and I enjoy playing it.
