<p id="t0t80h">The company’s Arlington, Virginia-based headquarters, dubbed HQ2, is supposed to consist of two parts: <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/job-creation-and-investment/from-the-ground-up">Metropolitan Park</a>, an “urban campus” capable of housing 25,000 workers, and PenPlace, a complex with three 22-story buildings and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262149/amazon-helix-arlington-virginia-design-hq2-campus">corkscrew-shaped glass tower standing</a> 350 feet tall.

  <p id="I8HZh8">Welcome to the weekend — and the last one where you’ll be able to enjoy an “extra” hour of sleep before you lose it next Sunday. That’s right: Daylight Saving Time begins in the US next Sunday, March 12th, which means the clocks will spring forward one hour, the days will get brighter, and we’re all going to wake up the following Monday morning even sleepier than usual.</p>

  <p id="bk6D07">When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21504764/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-screen-size-5g-features-price-release-date">Apple announced the iPhone 12 Pro</a>, it introduced a powerful new camera feature: ProRAW. This feature is available now for all Pro and Pro Max models, starting with the 12 series and newer, and if you’re picky about your photo processing, it’s definitely a feature worth checking out. ProRAW combines the benefits of computational photography with traditional RAW image capture — kind of the best of both worlds.</p>
<p id="EWWLaC">So why would you want to use ProRAW in the first place? Let’s go back to digital photography school. A traditional RAW image file preserves a lot more of the information that’s captured when you take a photo. Usually, your iPhone’s camera will process that data into a HEIF or JPEG image, throwing away the extra data and...</p>

  <p id="EX3Lsg">LinkedIn has introduced a feature called collaborative articles, which uses “AI-powered conversation starters” to start discussions between “experts” that use the platform. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unlocking-nearly-10-billion-years-worth-knowledge-help-daniel-roth/">an announcement post on Friday</a>, the company says it will “match each article with relevant member experts” based on its skills graph, and invite them to add context, extra information, and advice to the stories.</p>
<p id="aPnFi6">The company thinks the system will make it easier for people to contribute their perspectives because “starting a conversation is harder than joining one.” People can judge the experts’ contributions with an “insightful” reaction.</p>

  <p id="o9QhfB">As a kid, I started typing by tapping in cheat codes on ’90s PC games like <em>Doom</em> and <em>Rise of the Triad</em>, but it wasn’t until the covid pandemic that I finally ditched my awkward hunt-and-peck technique and learned touch typing. </p>
<p id="lBhnIb">If you don’t know how to touch type, there are very approachable ways you can learn on your own. You may think you do just fine ham-fisting your way through the keys, but with a little effort, you can learn to type faster, use your fingers more ergonomically, and rarely have to take your eyes off your screen as you clackity-clack-clack-clack along.</p>

  <p id="6bRORS">The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Alphabet, Google’s parent company, should be considered a joint employer for a group of YouTube Music contractors. The workers are currently attempting to organize with the Alphabet Worker’s Union, and the NLRB’s decision could mean that the tech giant has to negotiate with them if they vote to unionize in an upcoming election.</p>
<p id="nk5KjP">The workers are directly employed by a company called Cognizant, which acts as an Alphabet subcontractor. However, the NLRB believes that Google has enough control over their “benefits, hours of work, supervision, and direction of work” that it counts as a partial employer, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-03/google-must-negotiate-if-contract-staff-unionize-nlrb-official-rules#xj4y7vzkg">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. </p>
