It has recipes for turnips with ginger, and with walnuts, and also for a buckwheat pilaf starring the tiny young ones favoured by the French. Perhaps if we, too, called turnips navets, they might start to seem rather chic.

There were a raft of defensive substitutions from Potter midway through the second half and Chelsea, who lifted the pressure on their head coach thanks to a headed winner from Wesley Fofana, did their best to throw it away.

Then, with the final action of six minutes\u2019 added time, the substitute Reiss Nelson ripped an 18-yard half-volley past a full-stretch Neto and Emirates Stadium erupted, the home bench piling onto the pitch in delirium.

Steven Spielberg offered him the part of Sgt Mike Horvath in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/06/saving-private-ryan-review-spielberg\">Saving Private Ryan</a>, and told him that he would be given a drug test at the end of every day of principal photography and his scenes would be re-shot with someone else if he failed even one.<br /><br />Sizemore stayed clean and played the tough, beefy, courageous soldier who is to be the loyal subordinate of Capt John Miller, played by Tom Hanks, Miller being the high-school teacher in civilian life who in 1944 is entrusted with the almost hopeless, quixotic mission of rescuing a certain private in occupied France on compassionate grounds because all three of this man\u2019s brothers had been killed in action. All the tricks and mannerisms that Sizemore had been cultivating for his tough guy crime roles, his faintly sweaty and pop-eyed relish for action and violence, his disdain for the rulebook and streak of ruthlessness, all these character traits were reversed and redeemed and even ennobled by his persona as a dedicated military man.</p><p>He was a badass, sure, but now he was a badass for Uncle Sam, fighting the Nazis. Sizemore was the friend and confidant of Hanks\u2019s thoughtful officer, and ready to pull a gun on any of his platoon who presumed to question his captain\u2019s orders. Of that platoon: Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Edward Burns and Sizemore, perhaps it\u2019s Vin Diesel who\u2019s gone on to the movie big time, but at the time it was Sizemore who was the standout, because he had what he had never had before and was never really to have again \u2013 a heart of gold.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/04/tom-sizemore-the-tough-guy-who-held-his-own-opposite-hollywoods-biggest-names\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/04/tom-sizemore-the-tough-guy-who-held-his-own-opposite-hollywoods-biggest-names", "date_published": "2023-03-04 05:50:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Country diary: There\u2019s only one topic of conversation among farmers at the moment", "description": "<p><strong>Tebay, Cumbria:</strong> While we scan the females, we discuss the post-Brexit payments for farmers, how it will affect hedgerows, barns \u2013 and our local breed of sheep </p><p>It\u2019s well after teatime but we are working late, scanning yows.
