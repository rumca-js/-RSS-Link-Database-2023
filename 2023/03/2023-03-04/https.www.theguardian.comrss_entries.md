World heritage monuments in Córdoba and Istanbul stand at the centre of a reductionist bid to rewrite the past<p>Córdoba’s mosque-cathedral is one of the most glorious buildings in Europe. I was last there 30 years ago, but the memory is still vividly etched in my mind. I remember walking through the Courtyard of the Orange Trees. Then, almost if they had magically changed form, the rows of orange trees give way to a forest of columns of red-and-white arches that mark the mosque.</p><p>The transition is stunning, as is the mosque, the beauty of which, spacious and peaceful, is almost impossible to convey in words rather than in the experience. And then, as you walk through, there comes another transition – to a Renaissance cathedral that squats like a familiar stranger within. It would be difficult to call the cathedral beautiful, but there is something quite remarkable about it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/04/mezquita-hagia-sophia-two-sacred-symbols-culture-wars-belie-complex-history">Continue reading...</a>

But how have we got by without such beautiful concepts as the Arabic “soubhiyé” (“a moment in the morning when you are the only one awake in the house and can enjoy a cup of coffee before the day starts”) or “sobremesa” (that delicious time in Spain when a meal has ended but the conversation hasn’t) or, for that matter, the widely understood but uncoined Finnish concept of “kalsarikännit”: getting drunk at home alone in your pants?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/04/finns-top-dogs-drinking-in-your-pants">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The broadcaster and writer on revisiting childhood for his nostalgic memoir, the genius of George Orwell, and his love of dancing</p><p>Melvyn Bragg’s memoir, <em>Back in the Day</em>, is a portrait of the town in which he grew up, Wigton in Cumbria. It describes his childhood as only son of Stan and Ethel, who ran the local pub, the Black-A-Moor. What is striking is how modestly marginal he makes himself, preferring to apply his formidable recall and affection to others.

## Don’t despair at a shortage of tomatoes – it gives us a chance to treasure the turnip | Rachel Cooke

They might not be exotic or imported, but there’s no shortage of recipes for this unsung hero of the vegetable world<p>Our greengrocer has tomatoes; I’ve seen them with my own eyes. But I’m not buying. For one thing, I’d rather not have to remortgage the house. For another, I’ve become slightly obsessed with turnips. And it seems I’m not the only one.</p><p>No sooner had a columnist made a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/23/food-shortages-environment-secretary-urges-britons-cherish-turnips" title="">Thérèse Coffey-inspired</a> joke about turnip carpaccio than social media dished up a photograph of just such a dish, the veg in question deep purple and sliced so thinly it resembled the petals of a tulip. For inspiration, I turn to Colin Spencer’s 1992 classic, <em>Vegetable Pleasures</em>. It has recipes for turnips with ginger, and with walnuts, and also for a buckwheat pilaf starring the tiny young ones favoured by the French. Perhaps if we, too, called turnips navets, they might start to seem rather chic. It has been fun watching those who ordinarily like to drone on about seasonal eating rail against the disappearance of tomatoes and peppers from our supermarkets. The hypocrites! But yes, I know this is unfair. We’ve long imported bananas and pineapples; if you live on a dark, wintry island such as ours, to be deprived of fresh, exotic, vitamin-rich fruit is to experience a powerful longing. In 1944, the wartime diarist Vere Hodgson recorded that a shop near her flat in Notting Hill had got hold of some oranges (fruit and vegetables were not rationed, but they were often in painfully short supply). <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/23/brexit-food-folly-turnips-for-a-month" title="">“We have seen orange peel in the street,”</a> she wrote. And then: “Most refreshing even to look at it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/04/do-not-despair-at-a-shortage-of-tomatoes-it-gives-us-a-chance-to-treasure-the-turnip">Continue reading...</a>

## Chelsea lift some pressure on Potter after Fofana header edges out Leeds

<p>Up in the directors’ box, Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali were deep in conversation. Chelsea’s co-owners had witnessed a rare thing: a goal, a win, flashes of positivity. But it so easily could have gone in a different direction. Chelsea were a bag of nerves when they were trying to hold on to their slender lead during the dying stages and, although Graham Potter was in no position to turn down the points, he will know that his side must show far conviction at both ends of the pitch when they host Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday.</p><p>In truth, this was not particularly convincing. There were a raft of defensive substitutions from Potter midway through the second half and Chelsea, who lifted the pressure on their head coach thanks to a headed winner from Wesley Fofana, did their best to throw it away. Leeds, whose relegation problems deepened here, would hit the post just before the end and the final action of the game was their goalkeeper, Illan Meslier, going close to scoring a dramatic equaliser.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/04/chelsea-leeds-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Arsenal keep on dreaming after Nelson seals epic comeback over Bournemouth

<p>When they are winning games like this it is hard not to conclude that Arsenal will be Premier League champions. They were toiling at two goals down to Bournemouth and, even though they clawed back to parity admirably, leaving with a point would surely have tipped the title race in Manchester City’s favour. Then, with the final action of six minutes’ added time, the substitute Reiss Nelson ripped an 18-yard half-volley past a full-stretch Neto and Emirates Stadium erupted, the home bench piling onto the pitch in delirium. Philip Billing’s opener after 9.11 seconds, the second-fastest goal in Premier League history, could hardly have felt more distant.</p><p>Until such a climactic finish it seemed this game would primarily be remembered for its astonishing start. Goals have been scored within seconds of kick-off before but the ingenuity of this one had little precedent. Bournemouth lined up to begin the game with five players stationed to the left of the centre-circle; they were feinting as if to play a long diagonal that way but instead the ball was instantly clipped right, to an open Dango Ouattara, and Arsenal were in trouble. Outtara was able to advance towards the penalty area but his low cross should still have been cut out; instead it skidded under Gabriel Magalhães’ foot and Billing, anticipating the error, swept in from six yards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/04/arsenal-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pliny the Younger said the tale of the city’s disaster would live for ever and a new excavation will reveal more about the Romans who lived – and died – there</p><p>The first sign was smoke rising from the mountain and it was Pliny’s mother who noticed it. They didn’t know which mountain this cloud came from, Pliny the Younger says, but it rose in the air before spreading out like a pine tree. Pliny wrote two letters to his friend, the historian Tacitus. They are quietly devastating: my uncle died in a disaster that destroyed some of the most beautiful places there are.</p><p>The younger man lived to write about the eruption which would destroy whole towns in a day because he refused to join his uncle on a rescue boat heading towards Vesuvius. Pliny preferred to stay at home reading a history book. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/06/discoveries-in-pomeiis-reveal-lives-of-lower-and-middle-classes" title="">The story of Pompeii</a> is full of such moments: lives preserved and destroyed, objects saved and lost, stories told or forgotten.

<p><a href="https://www.sublackwell.co.uk/">Su Blackwell</a> has always used text in her art, but it was after a trip to Asia that she began creating sculptures from books. “In my last year at college, I went to Thailand and, in a secondhand bookshop, bought a copy of <em>The Quiet American </em>with lines of Thai scrawled in its margins, which added another dimension.” Soon after she returned to the UK her father died and while grieving she found herself picking up the Graham Greene classic and cutting paper moths out of the pages. She then suspended them to form a cloud over the open book. Ever since, she has bought secondhand tomes from which to make sculptures of houses, fairytales, flora and fauna. “My work was once described as if I am ‘weaving with words’,” she says, “and I like that analogy.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/collect-2023">Su Blackwell’s work is on show at Collect Art Fair, Somerset House, London, until 5 March</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/mar/04/sculptures-created-from-secondhand-books-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(One Little Independent)<br />Marry Waterson, Lisa Knapp and Nathaniel Mann combine to revivify a rather gloomy collection of ancient folk music</p><p>All three voices of <a href="https://hackpoetsguild.com/">this newly convened trio</a> boast award-laden histories in traditional and avant-folkery <a href="https://www.marrywaterson.com/">Marry Waterson</a>, scion of a famous folk clan; <a href="https://www.lisaknapp.co.uk/">Lisa Knapp</a>, something of a national treasure since her rendition of the BBC <a href="https://n.com/music/2013/sep/22/lisa-knapp-hidden-seam-review">shipping forecast</a>; and <a href="https://thenestcollective.co.uk/artists/nathaniel-mann/">Nathaniel Mann</a>, sound sculptor and film-maker. The genesis of their collaboration was a visit the Bodleian Library in Oxford to rummage among centuries-old song sheets and polemics that once sold for pence – the forerunners of social media perhaps – and which inspired the trio’s name.</p><p>There are some original songs, but recycled ballads are their basis. Producer Gerry Diver conjures a variety of backings – a dash of trip-hop for Waterson’s gothic ghost tale <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=2d8MnrZ9Qio">Ten Tongues</a>, spectral piano and strings elsewhere – but mostly he lets the voices tell their stories. Knapp, ever the ethereal lark, finds her own idiosyncratic way through Birds of Harmony and The Troubles of This World, and there are three-part harmonies on the doleful 16th-century Meat for Worms. It’s expertly delivered, but the parade of mortality and misfortune inevitably weighs heavily. For relief there is only Daring Highwayman, set to a bounding bodhrán backing and delivered by Knapp as 18th-century hip-hop. More lightness would be welcome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/04/hack-poets-guild-blackletter-garland-review-marry-waterson-lisa-knapp-nathaniel-mann">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Creed and a childhood friend settle old scores in this solid but familiar third instalment directed by Michael B Jordan</p><p>We’ve probably all seen enough of the <em>Rocky/Creed</em> series of boxing dramas to know that when our hero steps into the ring, it’s not so much his rival that he has to defeat, but his own snarling pack of personal demons. Even so, the opponent in this instalment, Damian “Dame” Anderson, is particularly formidable, in part because he is a physical manifestation of those demons, an uncomfortable reminder of the guilt and shame that now-retired champion Adonis Creed (Michael B Jordan) has carried with him since childhood. But mainly because he is played by the charisma forcefield that is Jonathan Majors, an acting heavyweight in every sense of the word.</p><p>Jordan is doing double duty here, directing as well as starring in this solidly by-numbers chapter in the ongoing <em>Creed</em> saga. He does a workmanlike job – the fight sequences are thrillingly visceral, but his weakness for cheesy montages and the film’s formulaic screenplay ensure that the picture was never going to take the franchise anywhere new.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/04/creed-iii-review-gloves-are-off-as-the-rocky-prequel-fights-on">Continue reading...</a>

The broadcaster, 89, on wishing to write one perfect poem, having a high old time, failing to make the world a better place and missing wearing high heels<p><strong>I’m going to </strong>be 90 this year and, looking back, I was always happiest when I’d fallen in love. Falling in love is a very expressive thing. And I’ve done it once or twice. Of course, the high point of all this carry-on was in the 1950s and 60s, when I was a student and then I was in London, having a high old time. I did enjoy the 1960s very much.</p><p><strong>I had a childhood </strong>that was mixed. My parents were quite young and delighted to have a child. And I remember them being very full of laughter and teases. But as I got older, things got more difficult because my mother, who was very brilliant as a young schoolgirl, had had to leave school to earn some money. When she saw me getting on in life a bit, passing exams and going to Cambridge, she began to think, “I could have done that.” And she certainly could. So there was a certain melancholy about her, which made life rather difficult. And her depression infected us quite a lot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/04/this-much-i-know-joan-bakewell-i-did-enjoy-the-1960s-very-much">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author of The Battle for Your Brain has serious reservations about neurotechnology, from the surveillance of mental experiences to ‘brainjacking’</p><p>Our brainwave activity can be monitored and modified by neurotechnology. Devices with electrodes placed on the head can record neural signals from the brain and apply low electric current to modulate them. These “wearables” are finding traction not only with consumers who want to track and improve their mental wellness but with companies, governments and militaries for all sorts of other uses. Meanwhile, firms such as Elon Musk’s <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a> are working on next-generation brain implants that could do the same thing, only with far greater power. While the initial use may be to help people with paralysis to type, the grand idea is for augmentation to be available to all. <a href="https://law.duke.edu/fac/farahany/">Nita Farahany</a>, a professor of law and philosophy at Duke University who studies the ethical, legal and social ramifications of emerging technologies, is sounding the alarm.</p><p><strong>Technology that can read our minds sounds terrifying. But it is also way ahead of where things are. Aren’t you jumping the gun? <br /></strong>I don’t think so and, furthermore, we dismiss it at our peril. While the technology can’t literally read our complex thoughts, there are at least some parts of our brain activity that can be decoded. There have been big improvements in the electrodes and in training algorithms to find associations using large datasets and AI. More can be done than people think. There are a lot of real-world applications and major tech companies <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg-teases-wearable-tech-with-neural-interface-facebook-post-2022-05-04/">like Meta</a> are investing in it.</p><p><em>The Battle for Your Brain</em> by Nita Farahany is published by St Martin’s Press on 14 March (£25.99).

<p><strong>The Mill, Birmingham<br /></strong>Hang on to your internal organs as saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings and friends whip up the loudest free jazz frenzy you’ll hear all year</p><p>Over the past decade, saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings has established himself as one of the most powerful voices in British improvised music. Powerful not just by virtue of his status playing with a number of the country’s best-known jazz groups, such as the Mercury prize-nominated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/15/sons-of-kemet-black-to-the-future-review-shabaka-hutchings-george-floyd">Sons of Kemet</a>, but because he blows a louder and more physical sound through his tenor sax than almost anyone else playing the instrument today. Using circular breathing techniques, Hutchings produces a coruscating stream of sound capable of punctuating even the most heady rhythm sections.</p><p><a href="https://www.thecometiscoming.co.uk/">The Comet Is Coming</a>, with keyboardist Dan Leavers and drummer Max Hallett, is perhaps his most mighty outfit. Locking into Hallett’s thundering rhythms and Leavers’s expansive, bone-rattling synth sounds, since the Comet Is Coming’s 2016 debut release, <em>Channel the Spirits</em><em>, </em>the trio have been a vehicle for Hutchings’s sharply dynamic playing to be untethered from formal restraints. With only two instruments as backing, here he can soar freely through genres as varied as psychedelic rock, earthy dub and undulating swing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/04/the-comet-is-coming-the-mill-birmingham-review-shabaka-hutchings-hyper-dimensional-expansion-beam">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Legal claim provides glimpse into world of corporate espionage and reputation management</p><p>The story Matthew Earl tells is of a black Mercedes-Benz, which parked outside his home and started following him. He claims it was intended to send a deliberate message: that he and his family – including two young children – were under surveillance. After a couple of days, he says, two men emerged from the car to deliver a legal letter from their client, the German payments company Wirecard. The men, from the private investigations company Kroll, allegedly used a “pointed and intimidating” tone.</p><p>While the manner of the letter’s delivery may be disputed, it kicked off years of threats of legal action and accusations of wrongdoing against Earl. But, according to a legal claim brought by Earl, it also marked a new chapter in a “campaign of unlawful harassment” carried out by Wirecard’s law firm, Jones Day, Kroll, and other firms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/04/covert-cameras-alleged-hacking-how-bust-payments-company-wirecard-hired-spies-lawyers-silence-critics">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Madison Karrh, Wings; PC, Mac)</strong><br />Born out of lockdown, this warm, tactile puzzle adventure game inspired by ‘libraries, bugs, bones and decay’ is a simple yet profound exploration of loneliness</p><p>Into the city you go, not to find fame or fortune but a body. In <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1889040/Birth/">Birth</a></em>, you solve puzzles to collect the bones and organs that make a human being – a partner, even. Chicago-based designer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-chat-with-the-creator-of-birth">Madison Karrh</a>’s Sunday afternoon puzzle adventure game feels at once fiercely contemporary and also like the work of a Weimar-era experimental artist, where every person’s head is represented by an animal skull.</p><p>Each location – the antique shop, the apothecary, the laundromat, the museum and more – represents a series of simple, textless puzzles themed around the establishment. In the bakery, for example, you must arrange slices of banana on a piece of bread in the “correct” order. The puzzles are tactile; with your cursor you prod at objects scattered on tables, or resting on shelves, moving them to reveal clues as to how things fit together – or break apart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/04/birth-madison-karrh-review-make-your-soulmate-from-spare-bones-and-organs">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Stone Nest; St George’s Hanover Square; Royal Festival Hall, London</strong><br />The raw, ravishing power of four solo cantatas is taken to the next level at the London Handel festival, while young star cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason works overtime</p><p>Bodies in space, tumbling, rolling, hurtling; at the same time singing, playing, dancing. Handel’s many solo cantatas, which parse the extremes of human anguish, are dramatic on their own terms. As staged by director <a href="https://adelethomasdirector.com/">Adele Thomas</a> for the headline event of this year’s <a href="https://www.london-handel-festival.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAjPyfBhBMEiwAB2CCIpVuUgRgtuFdaZ8TqjaarEp296RuhvJubtDL1ruXxRt5OQsPo_WC8hoCt0AQAvD_BwE">London Handel festival</a>, they expose life’s agonies with new levels of pity and transparency. Anger, grief, revenge, enveloped in music of gleaming precision and beauty, chafe and discomfort us. In their intensity and physicality, the performances here – four cantatas, each with a different singer, together with a dancer and small instrumental ensemble – provoke stark sympathy.</p><p>Gathered under the title <strong><a href="https://www.stonenest.org/events/in-the-realms-of-sorrow">In the Realms of Sorrow</a></strong>, the cantatas are amplified further, almost discreetly, by tiny musical interludes newly composed by <a href="https://heloisewerner.com/">Héloïse Werner</a>: an untuning or retuning, strange harmonics, a hint of a scale, a double bass turned into a resonant drum. The countertenor James Laing, in evening dress and “smoking” a cigar, acted as a smooth master of ceremonies. Under its current music director, <a href="https://www.london-handel-festival.com/about-us/musical-director/">Laurence Cummings</a>, and his team, this annual Handel festival, founded in 1978, has stepped away from advocacy and put creativity and progress to the fore. Cummings was key to Opera North’s 2022 <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/22/orpheus-opera-north-leeds-review-apartment-house-wigmore-hall-jakub-hrusa-royal-opera">Orpheus</a></em>, a European baroque-Indian classical collaboration.

<p>Lesser-known composers take centre stage in the mezzo-pianist duo’s lieder recital, while the Italian star dazzles in a wife-and-husband piano double bill</p><p>• In <strong><a href="https://www.chandos.net/products/catalogue/CHAN%2020177">Befreit: A Soul Surrendered</a></strong> (Chandos)<strong>,</strong> the mezzo-soprano <strong><a href="https://kittywhately.co.uk/">Kitty Whately</a></strong> and pianist <strong><a href="https://josephmiddleton.com/">Joseph Middleton</a></strong> perform late romantic songs from the Austro-German tradition about death, loss and hope. From Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler to Johanna Müller-Hermann (1868-1941) and Margarete Schweikert (1887-1957), the programme is well balanced and admirably performed. Two songs by Müller-Hermann, a student of Alexander Zemlinsky (she is also next week’s Radio 3 <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001jlgh">Composer of the Week</a></em>), open the recital.</p><p>The first, Like a Night in Full Moon, bursts with vocal urgency and limpid, rippling piano chords; the second, The Last Evening, records a painful separation. Schweikert, a prolific composer of songs, is often harmonically experimental but always sensuous. Whately’s ability to trace the drama of each song, whether in powerful climax or drawing back to a whisper, makes this an absorbing journey, with Middleton a poised and incisive co-traveller. By inserting Strauss’s Morgen! (Tomorrow) halfway through, we too have a sense of momentum, as well as release.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/04/kitty-whately-joseph-middleton-befreit-a-soul-surrendered-review-clara-wieck-robert-schumann-piano-concertos-chamber-orchestra-europe-yannick-nezet-seguin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How will the fortunes of drivers and team leaders form the narratives for the next edition of TV series Drive to Survive?</p><p>Last season, with the car woefully off the pace and both drivers grinding out results while bouncing about like pinballs, Lewis Hamilton and George Russell made companionable teammates. This year, with Mercedes intent on ultimately producing a more competitive ride capable of winning races, tension between the pair is likely to ratchet up. Russell had a superb debut for Mercedes in 2022, becoming only the third teammate to beat Hamilton over a season, and can expect to only be better this year. Nor is he intimidated or shy of fighting his corner against the seven-times champion as he proved in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/13/george-russell-claims-sao-paulo-f1-gp-from-lewis-hamilton-for-first-win" title="">winning in Brazil last year</a>. That said, Hamilton is motivated like never before, targeting an eighth title and more victories with the same fierce determination that has defined his career. Immovable object and unstoppable force, then. If there is to be a changing of the guard at Mercedes it will not be conducted lightly. Probably the most competitive and exciting driver pairing on the grid.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/04/russell-v-hamilton-vasseurs-hill-climb-and-other-thrilling-f1-plot-lines-for-2023">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At 24, Gary Younge was sent to report for the Guardian on South Africa’s first democratic elections. Thirty years on, he reflects on his career, how the world has changed – and what still needs to be done</p><p>On the eve of South Africa’s first democratic elections I slept at the home of a family in Soweto so I could accompany them to the polls the next day. A thick fog hung low over the township that morning and was only just beginning to burn off as they went to cast their ballots. Beyond those closest to you, all you could see were shoes and trouser hems, the number of ankles growing with every step and every block as more joined us on our way to the polling station. Dressed in Sunday best, nobody was talking. Nelson Mandela had described his political journey as “the long walk to freedom”. This was the final march.</p><p>It was a huge day for me personally. As a 17-year-old I had picketed the South African embassy in Trafalgar Square with my mother, calling for Mandela’s release; as an 18-year-old I had set up an anti-apartheid organisation at my university in Scotland. And now here I was, watching the mist burn on the moment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/04/i-have-no-problem-being-regarded-as-a-black-writer-but-i-wont-be-confined-by-it-gary-younge-on-race-politics-and-pigeonholing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After once looking doomed, Mikel Arteta is leading Arsenal towards the title but Potter offers no guarantee of following suit</p><p>Mikel Arteta is the new Sir Alex Ferguson. In previous eras Ferguson’s early struggles at Manchester United would be cited when people called for a club not to sack a struggling manager. But the argument has moved on. These days it feels more relevant to point to Arsenal’s backing of Arteta, who did not look like a revolutionary figure when at risk of losing his job <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/25/mikel-arteta-says-relegation-fight-looms-if-arsenal-fail-in-next-three-matches" title="">in December 2020</a>.</p><p>It is a reminder that there are rarely certainties in football. We can praise Arsenal, who are closing in on a first Premier League title since 2004, for having the courage to stick by their man. But we can also acknowledge that there would have been little uproar if they had lost their nerve with Arteta and, much as Chelsea are trying to give Graham Potter time to grow into his role, there comes a point when clubs must accept the glorious future they are waiting for is taking too long to arrive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/04/chelsea-graham-potter-puzzle-mikel-arteta-arsenal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kopites adore the striker who formed a thrilling alliance with Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah in uniquely joyous fashion</p><p>The last day of August 2019 and Liverpool have just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/31/burnley-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">beaten Burnley 3-0</a> at Turf Moor with a display that is as dominant as it is devastating. But all is not well in the visitors’ ranks given Sadio Mané’s angry reaction to being substituted late on after becoming increasingly frustrated with Mohamed Salah’s failure to pass to him. All eyes are consequently on the pair as they head back to the dressing room, yet ultimately it is the other member of Liverpool’s frontline who catches the attention as he walks between them. Looking directly at camera, Roberto Firmino stops, blows out his cheeks, smirks, then smirks again.</p><p>It was a <a href="https://twitter.com/FootyHumour/status/1167917873982918659?lang=en-GB">wonderful moment</a> and one many Liverpool supporters are no doubt reflecting on as they digest the news that Firmino has decided to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/03/roberto-firmino-liverpool-leave-free-transfer-end-of-season-jurgen-klopp">leave the club in the summer</a>. Because for them he has not just been a brilliantly influential part of the Jürgen Klopp era but, more than any other player, encapsulated the sheer joy of it, too. The smirks, the smiles, the no-look goals and Kung fu-kick celebrations; “Bobby” delighted Kopites in so many ways, over and over again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/04/roberto-firmino-smiling-hero-liverpool-klopp">Continue reading...</a>

For me, though, a kitchen hack is about having something ready-made in the fridge – a chilli paste, for example, or today’s flavoured butter – which can make otherwise simple snacks and meals super-special in an instant. It’s also very often about the fridge- and cupboard-raid: using up spices and herbs, nuts and jars that are already open and in danger of being forgotten. Or it’s about things that just seem as if they require more work than they actually do: a no-cook pudding, say, where the result seems so much more impressive than the time taken might suggest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/04/vegan-chocolate-pots-tahini-caramel-mango-pickle-fried-rice-crispy-fried-egg-fridge-raid-butter-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-kitchen-hacks">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gritty drama She Said, about the two reporters who exposed Harvey Weinstein, joins newsroom classics from His Girl Friday to All the President’s Men</p><p>Around the time that Tom McCarthy’s 2015 newsroom drama <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/31/spotlight-review-boston-globe-catholic-child-abuse-scandal">Spotlight</a></strong> started piling up critics’ awards en route to the best picture Oscar, more than a few wags commented that film critics are not to be trusted on films that make the journalism industry look good: it’s the hand that feeds us, after all. Still, Hollywood tends to oscillate between two extremes on journalists: they’re either virtuous crusaders for truth and justice or leeching, corrupt sleazebags.</p><p>Maria Schrader’s solidly absorbing <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/she-said-2022">She Said</a></strong> (2022) takes the former stance. Its story of how <em>New York Times</em> reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey (studiously played by Zoe Kazan and Carey Mulligan) exposed Harvey Weinstein’s serial sexual abuse and triggered the #MeToo movement is fresh in everyone’s minds. Too fresh, perhaps, which may be why the film made few waves at the box office or with awards voters. Its pleasures lie instead in the granular, procedural depiction of how such a vast story comes together. As its heroines go knocking on doors and crossing continents in pursuit of sources – one of them played in a blistering one-scene performance by Samantha Morton – <em>She Said</em> becomes an ode to the enduring importance of shoe-leather reporting in an increasingly online realm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/04/streaming-the-best-films-about-journalism-she-said">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The New Yorker writer explores what it takes to get good at something, from baking and boxing to mastering his own mind</p><p>What does it mean to master a skill – drawing, dancing or driving – and how do you actually do it? That is the question New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik asks in The Real Work, and it becomes the springboard for a discussion of art, family, empathy, mortality. Via memoir, analysis and criticism he assembles a celebration of the flaws that make us human.</p><p>The “real work” is a term used by stage magicians to describe “the accumulated craft, savvy and technical mastery that makes a great magic trick great”. The magician credited with having achieved the “real work” for a given trick, Gopnik explains, isn’t necessarily the one who invented it, but rather the first to master every detail of its performance. The book is structured round Gopnik’s interactions with practitioners of various crafts, from baking to boxing: he becomes an apprentice of sorts, learning just enough of each skill to develop an understanding of what mastery may mean.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/04/the-real-work-by-adam-gopnik-review-the-art-of-expertise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To celebrate the release of Creed III, Guardian writers make the case for why their favourite sports movie should also be yours</p><p>The greatness of any Ron Shelton sports movie has as much to do with that <em>isn’t</em> in them as what is. Shelton’s Bull Durham, as with follow-ups like White Men Can’t Jump and Tin Cup, has no Big Game ending or inspirational schmaltz, and features a flawed, never-was athlete whose triumphs are known to few outside his inner circle. In a breezily assured performance, Kevin Costner plays a journeyman catcher who’s spent almost no time outside the minor leagues, where his job is teach the finer points of the game to cocky young flamethrowers like “Nuke” Laloosh (Tim Robbins) before they graduate to “The Big Show”. Coaching arrogant dopes to live out your dream is humbling work, but Shelton savors the smaller, unseen victories for his hero, like his relationship with a minor-league “groupie” (Susan Sarandon) who represents a tantalizing off-season promotion. As a former minor-leaguer himself, Shelton parlays his understanding of baseball rituals, superstitions and gimmicks into a hilarious, impeccably detailed romantic comedy. <em>Scott Tobias</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/04/best-sports-movies-guardian-writers-creed-iii">Continue reading...</a>

This is quite rare in 2023 – for some reason, there is a growing movement where people cannot watch films or TV (unless it’s high fantasy or set in space) where characters who aren’t explicitly coded as the villain do a single bad thing. People can’t get their heads round this, at all (“Sorry, Tony Soprano did what?”). So every time Billy or Daisy do something that can only be described as “rock’n’roll” – Drugs! Being mean in a recording session! Gratefully receiving a sex act in a van! – it feels, honestly, quite refreshing. Here are two horrible and annoying people, Daisy Jones &amp; the Six says.

<p>Having first seen the sea on a day trip to north Wales, I now plan budget family beach breaks with lessons learned on those early ‘holidays’</p><p>My memory of first seeing the sea sits deep within. Once a year during the endless, sticky summers in Birmingham we would go on a day trip. This would be planned with military precision, as it was a holiday of sorts for my parents, who worked in a cotton factory and took very little time off. A minibus would be booked. Cousins, aunts and uncles would assemble to discuss logistics and, most importantly, the food rota. No one was going anywhere without paratha, pakoras, samosas and desi-style tea.</p><p>Having seen TV adverts of golden-haired children frolicking in the waves and looking impossibly happy on white, sandy beaches, I had been pestering my parents to make one of these annual days out a trip to the coast. I would usually lose this battle, and we’d all head to a theme park. I hated rides; still do. But aged eight, and using all the persuasive powers I could muster, I finally convinced them. So one early August morning, off we headed – all 23 of us – to Rhyl.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/mar/04/childhood-trips-to-the-beach-that-still-inspire-my-holidays">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Beer-can chicken is far more than just a novelty – it’s an efficient way to cook a bird using up the dregs of an old can of beer, and made even thriftier with a spent coffee grounds rub</p><p>Even though it’s vulgar-looking, I’ve always wanted to cook beer-can chicken. The technique is more than just a novelty, however, and actually helps to moisten the meat. It’s also a fun way to use up beer dregs. So next time you get to the end of a can andfind it warm, flat and undrinkable, think beer-can chicken.</p><p>Beer cans are lined with a Bisphenol-A (BPA) plastic lining. Cook’s Illustrated did some <a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/cooksillustrated/how_tos/5870-bpa-and-beer-can-chicken">tests</a> to see if it was safe to cook with BPA residues, and came to the conclusion that “ the beer can cooking method is safe”.

<p>In a career which often saw him play characters with a streak of ruthlessness, it was as a soldier with a heart of gold in Saving Private Ryan that he truly excelled</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/04/tom-sizemore-star-of-saving-private-ryan-dies-aged-61-after-brain-aneurysm-reports">Tom Sizemore dies aged 61 after brain aneurysm</a></strong></li></ul><p>Perfect casting is something that happens rarely in the career of any actor – starring or supporting – but it happened for Tom Sizemore in the late 90s, just as he was getting to be known for amoral tough guy roles, but also for drug abuse in his personal life. Steven Spielberg offered him the part of Sgt Mike Horvath in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/06/saving-private-ryan-review-spielberg">Saving Private Ryan</a>, and told him that he would be given a drug test at the end of every day of principal photography and his scenes would be re-shot with someone else if he failed even one.<br /><br />Sizemore stayed clean and played the tough, beefy, courageous soldier who is to be the loyal subordinate of Capt John Miller, played by Tom Hanks, Miller being the high-school teacher in civilian life who in 1944 is entrusted with the almost hopeless, quixotic mission of rescuing a certain private in occupied France on compassionate grounds because all three of this man’s brothers had been killed in action. All the tricks and mannerisms that Sizemore had been cultivating for his tough guy crime roles, his faintly sweaty and pop-eyed relish for action and violence, his disdain for the rulebook and streak of ruthlessness, all these character traits were reversed and redeemed and even ennobled by his persona as a dedicated military man.</p><p>He was a badass, sure, but now he was a badass for Uncle Sam, fighting the Nazis. Sizemore was the friend and confidant of Hanks’s thoughtful officer, and ready to pull a gun on any of his platoon who presumed to question his captain’s orders. Of that platoon: Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Edward Burns and Sizemore, perhaps it’s Vin Diesel who’s gone on to the movie big time, but at the time it was Sizemore who was the standout, because he had what he had never had before and was never really to have again – a heart of gold.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/04/tom-sizemore-the-tough-guy-who-held-his-own-opposite-hollywoods-biggest-names">Continue reading...</a>

There is a regular clunk as the scanning crate doors open to let one yow out and another in. I have to juggle my spray cans so I use the right colour on the yow to show if she is carrying a single lamb, twins, triplets or is geld – empty. The scanner works quickly and shouts “twins” or “empty”.</p><p>The barn is full of activity. The scanner and myself by the door, but also my son and the scanner’s son dashing about in the barn moving animals around and making sure the “race” is always full of yows so that there is no delay. The scanner sits in an old car seat on the floor, concentrating on the screen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/04/country-diary-theres-only-one-topic-of-conversation-among-farmers-at-the-moment">Continue reading...</a>
