## Ask HN: How do you know if leaving your 1st software job will make you happier?

<p>After uni I joined a FinTech with ~200 engineers and strong employee reviews. Like many grads, it's my first full time job in software, which makes it hard to gauge how good or bad the overall experience is compared with other companies.<p>Three years in I <i>think</i> our company is, on average, as good as the best 'out there', but when individuals hit rough patches (stress, poor growth, low autonomy, etc.) they often start looking for a new job. Even if they decide to stay put, they sometimes plow on with low morale, berating themselves for not trying a new gig.<p>I believe other good software companies would have just as many problems - though maybe not the same ones as us - and that some of my despairing colleagues would be happier if they had that mindset, focusing on making the most of the opportunities they have and driving change instead of pining for a nirvana. But maybe my expected cosmic background shittiness is too high, I'm romanticising pointless suffering, and we should actually all bugger off.<p>How can first timers make better judgements about their situations - both in terms of being grateful for what's good around them and critical of the genuinely bad?<p>PS:
For those who have been at one company for most of their career, but who felt like quitting for one or more reasons, did things get better or did you just accept the tradeoffs?<p>Have you ever truly regretted quitting a job - why?<p>Money aside, did you ever leave a job you were happy with to find one where you were even more happy? Did that work?</p>

## Tell HN: Duolingo (NYSE: DUOL) disrepects your privacy and dislikes questions

<p>After a mandatory signup for a Duolingo account, <i>anyone</i> using their iPhone and Android (and possibly web) apps can add you as a 'friend', without requiring any confirmation from you whatsoever.<p>This is mostly just annoying and might be considered 'typical growth hacking', but also constitutes a privacy risk: your 'friends' are notified whenever you are online, have completed a number of lessons, or whatever. The Duolingo privacy policy (https://store.duolingo.com/pages/privacy-policy) is obviously a cut-and-paste job (for a NYSE-listed-company, really?) that doesn't address concerns like this at all.<p>In the Duolingo app, you get notifications like 'your friends congratulated you on 14 days of being online' and, more worryingly, 'XXX congratulated you on completing 10 lessons today'. Nevermind that you don't know who XXX is, and can't do anything about notifications about your online state being sent to them. Even if you have removed XXX as a 'friend' from your in-app Duolingo profile aeons ago.<p>So, there is a 'privacy' option in the Duolingo app. This apparently (again, pretty much without notification, much less consent) requests a ZIP export of all your data (FYI: I'm in the EU, US experiences may differ). Which takes up to 30 days (Sure, ZIP is not the most efficient file format, but <i>that</i> slow?)<p>But, at least there is an email address: privacy@duolingo.com (pretty much the only contact details you'll get as a fully paid up Duolingo customer). Sending a <i>very</i> polite email reply to the minders of this account about the continuous harassment by 'friends', however, is a mistake.<p>You will not receive a reply, but your paid Duolingo account will be disabled pretty much immediately. Leaving you, I guess, to sort things out with Google/Apple/your credit card company.<p>'Typical growth hacking'... Oh, joy...</p>

## Show HN: A Unix timestamp converter that includes the micro and nanoseconds

<p>I find myself having to convert a lot of unix timestamps to a human readable format, but most of the online calculators I found don't include the micro or nanoseconds in the human readable output. It's a small detail, but I find myself having to manually space out the timestamp frequently. I'm learning frontend development, so I made this converter to hopefully make it easier to convert timestamps. Welcome to any feedback :)</p>

<p>So, my older son is almost 12, and while he reads a good amount of science fiction (Three-Body Problem, Asimov, Project Hail Mary etc.) - he does not enjoy Science Fiction movies as much.<p>He found 2001: space odyssey kind of slow and tedious, and I have not introduced him to The Matrix etc., as I think it has some strong adult language and themes.<p>However, I would like him to be introduced to a world of movies beyond Star Wars and the Marvel Universe. What are some well-made science fiction movies appropriate for 12-year-olds?</p>

## Ask HN: How did you rebuild yourself after having hit rock bottom?

<p>I [28M] got broken up with by my partner of almost 4 years a couple weeks ago. I thought she was the love of my life and I would marry that woman. I'm also in the last year of my PhD in a sub-field I have never envisioned myself in and somehow slipped into due to Covid and my own passiveness and weak sense of self. The PhD is also not going super well and I'm stressed about not having enough research to finish in time. I also grew up in a dysfunctional family environment (toxic parent relationship, some narcissistic/borderline traits in them) and have been struggling with the consequences of that on my development and mental health. I also don't have a large social circle, and some of my friends are scattered internationally.<p>As you can see, I feel like I've hit rock bottom. On the outside I look all successful, in shape and doing a PhD in a prestigious research group. But most of the time in my life I've felt empty, doubting myself and struggling with a weak sense of self and unhealthy thought/behavioural patterns that are hard to shed off. I feel like I've lost any passion for anything, and don't know what I want or need.<p>I've read tons of psychology/philosophy/self-help over the past 10 years and it helped to some extent. I've also started therapy 2 months ago, but it's going slow and it hasn't been very useful yet. The advice so far has boiled down to "do things you like".<p>I would be grateful for any of your advice or shared life stories. At the moment I feel like standing in front of a massive pile of broken glass.</p>
