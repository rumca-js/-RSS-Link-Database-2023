<p>The next Bayonetta game for Nintendo Switch is almost here. Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, a prequel spin-off, releases on March 17..

## The Marvel Cinematic Universe Has Already Messed Up Kang the Conqueror's Story

<p dir="ltr">Did you know that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ant-man-the-wasp-quantumania-review/1900-6418027/">Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania</a> villain Kang, played by Jonathan Majors, is the Marvel Cinematic Universe's next main villain after Thanos? You almost certainly did, but not from watching that movie or anything else in the MCU. You know that because you know about Kang the Conqueror from the comics or because you watched a YouTube video or read an article about him, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kang-the-conqueror-explained-everything-we-know-ant-man-the-wasp-quantumania-mcu/1100-6511614/">like this one.</a> There's not much chance you could glean how important this guy is just from watching this movie.</p><p dir="ltr">So it's kind of hilarious when Janet and the residents of the Quantum Realm spend most of the movie cryptically referring to Kang as "he" and "him" instead of saying his name. Because when they do finally say it, it means nothing, as all we know about him is he's angry and wants to kill everybody--we have absolutely no further sense of him as a person or as a cosmic being. And without any setup or development, he doesn't feel like anything more than the baddie from this movie, who will return in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">That's partially the fault of Quantumania itself. This film is Marvel Mad Libs, having recognizably Marvel proper nouns do recognizably Marvel verbs in recognizably Marvel situations and hoping for the best. They pulled out <em>all</em> the old Marvel tricks for this one--introducing a generic new fantastical world with generic fantastical locals in a generic resistance movement fighting against a generic fantastical bad guy who shoots generic energy projectiles out of his hands. And a good guy whose defining trait is that he loves his daughter. For what it's worth, Jonathan Majors is doing his best with the part--and he's extremely watchable in Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania. So he's not the issue.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-marvel-cinematic-universe-has-already-messed-up-kang-the-conquerors-story/1100-6512045/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After the Destiny 2: Lightfall campaign, you're given basic Strand abilities, but you'll need to purchase grenades, Aspects, and Fragments from the Pouka Pond in Hall of Heroes on Neomuna. Strand Meditations are currency stored in your inventory that let you purchase additional abilities. Once you've unlocked the full suite of abilities, you'll then be able to start a quest to obtain a new Exotic sidearm, Final Warning. Here's what to expect.</p><p>You'll earn 300 Strand Meditations by speaking to Nimbus if you complete the Legendary campaign, and the Pouka Pond will give you 500 to start unlocking options.</p><p>The grenade section has the Threadling grenade, Shackle grenade, and Grapple; each of those abilities costs 50 Strand Meditations. The <b><i>two </i></b>Aspects cost 150 Strand Meditations each, and each of the 14 Fragments costs 200 Strand Meditations. Unlocking all Strand abilities on a single class will help customize your subclass, but it'll also unlock The Final Strand Exotic quest.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-farming-strand-meditations-and-final-warning-exotic-sidearm-guide/1100-6512030/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actor Michael B. Jordan has made no bones about the anime influences that he brought to the feel of Creed III. He's even gone on to mention that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23617380/michael-b-jordan-creed-3-interview-anime">he looked to Dragon Ball Z and Naruto</a> for inspiration for how he blocked the fight scenes between his titular Adonis Creed and Jonathan Majors' Damian. But it's more than the feel, it's also about the look.</p><p>In the first movie, Adonis wore simple white trunks, and for the sequel, trunks that belonged to his father, Apollo (played by Carl Weathers in the original Rocky franchise). For the third installment, Jordan wears gear inspired by an all-time anime classic, Akira.</p><p>Costume designer and concept artist Raphael Imhotep (Moon Knight, Jupiter's Legacy) posted Jordan's trunks for the movie, which take a visual cue from Kaneda's jacket from Akira. Imhotep and fellow costume designer Lizz Wolf (Pacific Rim, Expendables) pitched the idea to Jordan and he went with it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-a-closer-look-at-michael-b-jordans-akira-inspired-trunks-for-creed-iii/1100-6512046/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Lightfall expansion has dropped and players are no doubt scouring Neomuna's neon-soaked city streets and roofs for secrets. Among them are new action figure collectibles that are modeled after Neomuna's favorite Cloudstrider, Nimbus, and are scattered across the war-torn city, reminiscent of Witch Queen's hunt for Lucent Moths. As of now, players can only find the first two, meaning that the rest will likely be rolled out on a weekly basis, and players will want to find them all since it's <strong>necessary for completing the Lightfall Triumph</strong> and getting the accompanying title.</p><p dir="ltr">First of all, players can find hints as to where to look for these action figures right by the landing zone where Nimbus is on Neomuna. Once you drop into the city itself, a building just off to the right with neon signage will have a door that reveals a room with displays all over the place. Once you find the action figures, they'll be shown off in this room. A pair of displays have clues that point players to the general area where they'll find the figures and give some indication as to where they're hiding and how to find them. Here's where and how to find all of Neomuna's hidden action figures:</p><h2 dir="ltr">Ahimsa Park</h2><p dir="ltr">The Ahimsa Park hint reads: "At the center of Ahimsa Park, find an unexpected hideaway beneath the stairs." The figure in Ahimsa Park, Neomuna's eastern zone, is hiding in a giant central building that players should be able to spot the second they get there.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-action-figure-locations-where-to-find-lightfalls-hidden-collectibles/1100-6512015/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Golf fans know that's one of the biggest weeks of the year for pro golf, as The Masters at Augusta National takes place that week, with Round 1 beginning April 6.</p><p>"Creating an authentic golf experience has been our goal, and this small shift in release date allows us to add a few final touches to the game that we are very excited to deliver to all of you, including updates to some favorite courses to reflect 2023 designs," EA said.</p><div>          </div><p>EA Sports PGA Tour includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-pga-tour-promises-realism-down-to-the-blade-of-grass-30-courses-revealed/1100-6511690/">30+ courses at launch</a>, including Augusta National.

<p>Believe it or not, Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-stalling-gta-5-sales-pick-up-again-to-reach-175-million-copies-sold/1100-6511237/">continues to sell millions of copies every few months</a>, and its multiplayer mode--GTA Online--gets updates on a weekly basis. Rockstar North design director Scott Butchard has reflected on GTA Online's 10th anniversary this year, saying the team never imagined what the game would become.</p><p>"When we started out, I don't think we could have ever dreamed we'd still be going 10 years on.

## Nintendo Switch 2: 11 Features We Want, From Backwards Compatibility To 3DS Support

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107613-switch-2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>After six years, the Nintendo Switch has cemented its legacy as one of the best game consoles of all time. A revolutionary system at the time of its launch, the console's key selling point of seamless gaming at home or on the go was a turning point for Nintendo after its previous device, the Wii U, performed dismally across the globe. The Switch was a game-changer for Nintendo, one which needed very few updates to its hardware over the years when compared to the more frequent rollout of newer DS and 3DS handhelds during its run.</p><p>At the same time, the Switch console updates that we have seen have been well-executed and thoughtful spins on the original hardware. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-lite-review-hard-to-resist/1100-6470016/">Switch Lite</a> turned the console into a pure handheld gaming console, while the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-oled-review-another-successful-nintendo-iteration/1100-6496821/">OLED Switch enhanced the experience</a> of playing games on that platform with a better screen and several other small physical tweaks to its design. Currently, it's rumored that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-nintendo-console-coming-late-2024-report-says/1100-6511902/">next-gen Switch will launch in 2024</a>.</p><p>More than half a decade later, fans are wondering what Nintendo has up its sleeve next. While the company envisioned a long shelf-life for the Switch, the console is beginning to show its age and is slowly nearing the end of its life-cycle. Nintendo has kept a tight lid on what the Switch successor will offer users and how it'll differ from its predecessor, but with the system celebrating its sixth anniversary today, March 3, we decided to compile some of our ideas for the features that we'd like to see when it eventually arrives.</p><p>These range from a few obvious ideas on our wishlist such as backwards compatibility and an ergonomic revamp of the Joy-Cons if Nintendo decides to build on the Switch platform, to more subtle but essential tweaks to how games are played and preserved on that future console.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Switch backwards compatibility</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107614-switch-2-stand.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">With over 122 million Switch consoles sold so far, Nintendo has a massive playerbase to appeal to with its next console, if it allows for those established game libraries to be playable on its new system. Backwards compatibility was one of the major strengths of the Wii U and 3DS console generations, and the option to jump onto a new platform with a treasured library of games would be a major selling point.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles are great examples of previous-gen backwards compatibility, and the Switch 2 mirroring that approach would be a major step forward given the number of first and third-party games released on that console over the years.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>More power</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107615-supermario.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>If there's one area where the Switch is lagging behind, it's in the graphical hardware department. While it's amazing just how much the console is capable of with its aging hardware--just look at Xenoblade Chronicles 3--the last couple of years have shown just how many compromises are needed to get games running smoothly on that system. No one is expecting Nintendo to somehow figure out how to shrink an Nvidia 40-series GPU onto a tiny chipset, but a solid foundation that can provide a more contemporary and stable gaming experience could help ensure a long and healthy attention-gabbing lifespan for the console.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>A shift up to 4K for TV, 1080p for handheld</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107616-switch-oled.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">With more power comes a greater opportunity to create a gaming experience that's comparable to what Sony and Xbox have to offer. While Nintendo's strengths lie in its strong pedigree of gaming over pure graphical grunt, there are more immediate benefits to establishing a higher benchmark for how games run on Nintendo's next system. A 4K output makes text and user interface elements look sharper, while core gameplay looks less muddy and takes advantage of newer TV screens to stand out more. Nintendo's first-party games in particular emphasize a vibrant palette of colors, and seeing those joyful titles pop on newer screens could help sell the identity of this new console.</p><p>If the Switch successor retains the portable aspect of its predecessor--and it absolutely should--then the OLED screen should be the new standard as well. While the original Switch still provides a great mobile gaming experience, the OLED model blows it out of the water with its brighter display and more vivid colors. Looks <em>do </em>matter when it comes to gaming, as nothing turns heads quicker than gameplay which unloads a dizzying number of powerful colors directly into your eyeballs.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Improved controllers</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107617-joycons.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The Joy-Cons are one of Nintendo's most innovative ideas, detachable controllers that emphasize the spirit of sharing that has helped make the Switch a blockbuster device. There's a reason why they're not called Joy-Pros, and as the last couple of years has proven there are some definite cons to their design. Awkward to use if you have big hands, subject to analog stick drift issues, and about as ergonomically comfortable as high-fiving a cheese grater, the next Nintendo console could benefit from more comfortable controllers.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, Nintendo doesn't have to look too far to get an idea of what would work on this front. Third-party manufacturers such as Hori offer a wide range of officially licensed Joy-Cons that have a more traditional feel to their design, and pinching a few ideas from this playbook would make marathon gaming sessions on the Switch 2 that much more enjoyable.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>New controller input methods</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107621-switch-oled-3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">One of the most exciting developments in the gaming space recently has been focused on <em>how </em>we interact with games. The PlayStation DualSense controller is a benchmark in haptic feedback design thanks to its nuanced vibrations and adaptive triggers, while the more humble Playdate uses a crank mechanism to adorable effect. Nintendo is a pioneer when it comes to innovative methods for gaming, from the WiiMote motion controller to the 3DS touchscreen and stylus, and the company knows how to make these inputs feel less like a gimmick and more like an essential way to experience its games.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a distinctively Nintendo field of expertise, as the company has a knack for creative design that'll hopefully play a large role in establishing the identity of its console.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Upgradeable SSD storage</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107623-switch-4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">When it first launched, the Switch's options for storage were simple but reliable. 32GB of onboard storage that could be expanded with a microSD card meant that there was more than enough room for several indie titles and first-party games, but times have changed since then. With games being more demanding and new consoles hammering home the benefits of SSD storage, a more modern solution is required to keep up with the competition.</p><p dir="ltr">NvME SSD drives are now far more commonplace and affordable compared to a few years ago, and even if Nintendo opts to use a smaller drive for its next console, it'd still be a game-changer to access games at lightning-quick speeds. Extra storage capacity will always be needed, and if Nintendo follows Sony's footsteps by allowing for first or third-party upgrades, it'll be future-proofing its Switch successor in the process.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Overhaul the eShop to deal with all the shovelware</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107626-switch-eshop.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Switch eShop library is one of the most impressive digital storefronts around thanks to the sheer variety of games on it, but this also means that a lot of shovelware is available on it. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a major problem, but these low-quality games often dominate eShop pages and, combined with the store's laggy performance, can make it difficult to find what you're looking for. While there's nothing <em>technically </em>wrong with having them up for sale, the next Nintendo console needs to have a serious look at how it curates and promotes games for its storefront, as implementing a form of quality control could allow for real hidden gems to rise to the top.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The return of Mii Plaza and StreetPass</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107627-streetpass.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There's a certain social networking magic that made the Wii U and 3DS console generations fondly remembered, something which has been lacking with the Switch. A new Nintendo console could easily recapture that charm with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/streetpass-deserves-a-successor-on-nintendo-switch/1100-6488183/">rebirth of the Mii Plaza</a>, social networking without the toxicity of the modern-day equivalent. The 3DS was especially adept at this thanks to the StreetPass feature, and if you owned one of those consoles, you knew just how exciting it was to go out, return home, and open your handheld device to see how many new friends you'd come across in your travels.</p><p dir="ltr">Updated for the next era of Nintendo gaming, and Mii Plaza could shine as a wholesome form of social interaction on the company's next generation of hardware.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Improved gameplay capture options</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107631-switchmetroid.png" /><br /><h3><p>Compared to PlayStation or Xbox, the game capture options of the Switch are <em>severely </em>limited. Screenshots are an easy tap away, but if you're looking to grab video gameplay of more than 30 seconds, then you're going to need to invest in a capture card. There's an opportunity for Nintendo to offer a much more robust set of capture options for its next console--especially if it seems to have loosened up on its infamous stance towards YouTube--as the more eyes on your product the better. At the same time, integrated approaches to streaming games would also be a sound move, allowing streamers to more easily broadcast their adventures across Nintendo's various titles.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nintendo 3DS game support</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107634-nintendo-3ds.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">It's a safe bet that NES, SNES, and N64 games will make the jump to the next Switch thanks to the popularity of its online subscription service, but if Nintendo wants to appeal to a different audience, then finding a way to bring its DS and 3DS games to its next console could be a huge reason to sign up. This would likely be one of the biggest challenges that Nintendo has ever taken on with its Virtual Console and retro gaming library, due to the dual-screen nature of its older handheld generation, but it's not an impossible challenge to overcome for a company that thinks outside of the box.</p><p dir="ltr">With the closure of the 3DS and Wii U eShops this year, Nintendo is in a prime position to preserve its past as it heads into a new console generation, giving longtime fans a nostalgic reason to stay invested while introducing a new audience to some of the best games from yesteryear.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Make the game carts taste even worse</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4107637-mario-clutch.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>By now, children with curious appetites have developed a resistance to the infamously foul taste of a Switch cart, so it's time to head back to the kitchen and concoct a new disgusting flavor to coat physical copies of games with. This is <em>naturally</em> for the good of the children and could be an environmentally-friendly way to recycle all those unsold copies of Devil's Third into the essence that carts could be coated with.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />

<p dir="ltr">Scream 6 is being promoted with a disturbing marketing campaign that has, to say the least, caused concern. The movie's iconic slasher, Ghostface, has been spotted in various locations, including Sonoma, New Orleans, and St. Louis, which has led to 911 calls from frightened onlookers. Well, no cause for alarm, as sources close to the film confirmed to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/ghostface-sightings-scream-6-stunt-police-called-1235541627/">Variety</a> that it's all part of the promotion for the movie.</p><p dir="ltr">Paramount Pictures, which is producing the movie, declined to comment on the promotional campaign. (Paramount did something similar for the horror movie Smile, with hired actors sitting behind home plate and <a href="https://twitter.com/SNYtv/status/1573501441104298019?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">flashing unsettling grins at televised Major League Baseball games</a>.)</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">The people of Sonoma got a bit of a scary surprise on Monday when a person wearing a "Scream" costume stood motionless at the Sonoma Plaza.

can buy is a detachable grip. Though the Switch is one of Nintendo's best gaming consoles ever, not everyone finds the default form factor very comfortable--especially when playing for hours in a row. Thankfully, there are third-party accessories that drastically improve the Nintendo Switch's ergonomics. We've rounded up a handful of the best Nintendo Switch grips available in 2023.</p><p>Nintendo Switch grips come in all shapes and sizes. Some are designed exclusively for the regular Switch or Switch OLED, while others, like the stellar <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satisfye-Ultimate-Accessories-Comfortable-Ergonomic-Thumbsticks/dp/B07FNJJG5V?tag=gamespot-switchgrips-20">Satisfye ZenGrip Pro</a>, are compatible with both models. Naturally, the significantly smaller Switch Lite requires its own separate grip, but there are great options for the handheld-only Switch, too.</p><p>In addition to detachable grips that enhance your experience holding the Joy-Con controllers, there are accessories that completely replace the Joy-Cons while also functioning as ergonomic grips. Our favorite option in 2023 is still Hori's Split Pad, but now there are two different models: the <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/1804712/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/nintendo-switch-split-pad-pro/-/A-83076169?preselect=80110543#lnk=sametab&amp;subid1=subid_value&amp;subid2=bestswitchgrips&amp;sharedid=gamespot">Split Pad Pro</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/cjfsVxySLGq">Split Pad Compact</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-switch-grips/1100-6469777/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Here's where you can find Xur this weekend and what the Agent of the Nine has for sale.</p><p>This week you can find Xur in the <strong>EDZ, in the Winding Cove</strong>. For his weapon, Xur is offering <strong>Trinity Ghoul</strong>.

<p>If you've ever wondered why so many mythical and monstrous beings call Dracula's castle their home in Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, you're not alone. In fact, that line of thought is precisely what led to the creation of The Deep End Games' newest steamy action game, Romancelvania.</p><p>In an exclusive dev diary, creative director Bill Gardner, narrative director Amanda Gardner, and producer Lindsay Gardner discuss how playing Symphony of the Night and encountering creatures like the Salem Witch and Frankenstein inspired them to come up with a reason as to why they lived under Dracula's roof. The team then shares how this led to them offering up their own light-hearted and spicy take on the situation, and creating Romancelvania.</p><p>"We wanted to create a game that was fun and quirky and gothic and spooky," Amanda said. "I think the world needs some fun, the world needs some kookiness."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/castlevania-meets-the-bachelor-in-the-first-behind-the-scenes-look-at-romancelvania/1100-6512010/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The Saw franchise will never die. These movies are just too cheap to make and too strangely compelling to let go. The two attempts to reboot the series after Saw: The Final Chapter didn't quite manage to tap into what made the franchise interesting, sadly, but Saw X has the potential to bring everything back together. But there are many big ifs involved.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When does Saw X release?</h2><p dir="ltr">Saw X is currently scheduled for release on October 27, 2023, just in time for Halloween this year.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Is there a trailer?</h2><p dir="ltr">Not yet, but <a href="https://collider.com/saw-10-filming-wrap-kevin-greutert-comments/">they've completed filming</a> and so a trailer could drop tomorrow.

<p>HBO's post-apocalyptic series The Last of Us has set a new viewership milestone. According to Nielsen data shared with <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/03/the-last-of-us-black-panther-wakanda-forever-streaming-netflix-disney-plus-ratings-nielsen-1235277471/">Deadline</a>, the series reached its first billion-minute week on HBO Max.</p><p>The Last of Us reached 1.2 billion minutes streamed from January 30-February 5. Of note, Nielsen's streaming data only counts HBO Max streams in the US, not numbers from HBO's linear TV channel or other sources.</p><p>While HBO was quick to boast about The Last of Us viewership numbers for episodes 1-4, the network stopped sharing numbers since then, presumably because they don't look as good. It's been reported that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/02/17/the-super-bowl-ended-the-last-of-uss-unprecedented-ratings-climb/?sh=740b86be40ff">Episode 5 was the first to see a week-over-week decline in viewers</a>. That could be because the episode clashed with the Super Bowl. It did stream two days early on HBO Max, however.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbos-the-last-of-us-reached-1-billion-minutes-streamed-in-a-week-for-the-first-time/1100-6512025/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

However, the game isn't being received too well so far on PC (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23623679/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-pc-version-reviews-performance">Polygon</a>) with players pointing out various problems from performance, constant crashing, and bugs.</p><p>Wo Long currently has an overall "mostly negative" review label according to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1448440/Wo_Long_Fallen_Dynasty/">Steam page</a>, and out of 3,339 total reviews, over 2,850 are negative. The main complaint focuses on technical issues, with one popular review reading, "A good game buried beneath the biggest catastrophe of a PC port that I have ever seen.

<p>Destiny 2's new Lightfall expansion has introduced several new Exotic weapons to the game, including a deadly sidearm that might be a little <em>too </em>good for PvP. Final Warning, a Strand-energy sidearm, is currently proving to be a menace in the Crucible, as evidenced by videos doing the rounds on social media:</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">The new Strand sidearm Final Warning is absolutely CRACKED in PvP! | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Destiny2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#Destiny2</a> <a href="https://t.co/RZb9qMvMG5">pic.twitter.com/RZb9qMvMG5</a></p>  — Destiny Bulletin (@DestinyBulletn) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1631635106174476292?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">March 3, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>What makes Final Warning so effective is that this weapon can fire rounds that aggressively track targets. For its All at Once perk, holding down the trigger marks targets within your range and loads multiple bullets, which fire in a burst with increased stability when you release the trigger. If these rounds hit a target, it'll apply a high-damage unraveling effect to them.</p><p>The gun gets even better with its other perk, Pick your Poison. This is what allows for bullets to track targets when you hip-fire the sidearm, and these rounds deal increased body shot damage on impact. If you prefer to aim, projectiles will have greatly increased velocity and deal extra critical hit damage to marked targets. With the right loadout and fireteam backing you up, Final Warning currently has devastating potential in PvP.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-new-final-warning-exotic-sidearm-might-be-too-overpowered-for-pvp/1100-6512026/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Director Steven Spielberg is known for, among other things, movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and War of the Worlds, and the man himself is a believer that aliens are out there.</p><p>Speaking to Stephen Colbert, Spielberg said the recent government disclosures about Unidentified Aerial Phenomena are "fascinating" and he wants to know more.</p><p>"I think what has been coming out recently is fascinating, just absolutely fascinating. I think the secrecy that is shrouding all of these sightings, the lack of transparency until the Freedom of Information Act compels certain materials to be released publicly, I think there is something going on that simply needs extraordinary due diligence," he said. "I don't believe we are alone in the universe. I think it is mathematically impossible that we are the only intelligence species in the cosmos."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steven-spielberg-is-fascinated-by-aliens-has-no-plans-for-et-2/1100-6512023/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The Wii U might be remembered as one of Nintendo's least successful consoles ever, but it had a number of great games that you can still play today. Well, maybe not literally today, as Nintendo recently <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/netinfo/en_GB/index.html">announced</a> that Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon were taken offline due to "a vulnerability related to online play." No timeline was given for their return.</p><p dir="ltr">Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon were two of the most successful games for the Wii U, being the first- and sixth-best-selling games for the console <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/wiiu.html">respectively</a>. Mario Kart 8 has sold 8.46 million copies as of late 2022, while Splatoon has sold 4.95 million copies. Super Mario Maker, another hit online game for the console, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-maker-1-online-services-shutting-down-next-year/1100-6484876/">shut down permanently</a> in early 2021.</p><p dir="ltr">This shutdown is particularly notable because the Wii U remains the only way to play the original Splatoon, arguably one of Nintendo's most innovative games of the past decade. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe remains online on Switch, so we recommend checking that out if you need your Mario Kart 8 fix immediately.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wii-u-classics-mario-kart-8-splatoon-taken-offline-due-to-security-issue/1100-6512024/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Dead Space First-Person Mod Gives You A Reason To Play Original Game Again

<p>The original Dead Space is a solid reminder about the value of brown pants, but if you're looking to have an even more stressful time in this classic survival-horror game, then this first-person mod is what you've been looking for. Naturally only available on PC for the 2008 game, the first-person mod designed by Reverse Engineering Gamer shifts the perspective to a more in-your-face angle and is the end result of several months of hard work by its creator.</p><p>"The core of this mod took a little over five days to create," Reverse Engineering wrote on their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/deadspace/mods/37?tab=description">Nexus Mods page</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-dead-space-first-person-mod-to-make-things-even-scarier">Eurogamer</a>). "The fine-tuning of this mod is what took several months; to locate functions, compare variables, stabilize pointers, write bug-free scripts, play-test. Although initially started out of curiosity as to see what else I can do other than create a free cam and player fly mod for Dead Space, this quickly grew into a first-person mod project."</p><p>A first-person view does heighten the tension of the classic game, although it does so at the expense of vital visual information. You won't be able to see how much health you have left on protagonist Isaac Clarke's handy spinal gauge and you'll have to listen carefully for any Necromorphs hunting you from beyond your peripheral vision.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-first-person-mod-gives-you-a-reason-to-play-original-game-again/1100-6512021/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Jack Black Dressed Up As Bowser And Had A Wardrobe Malfunction That Required Censoring

<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie releases in theaters next month, and as such, the animated film's marketing machine is revving up. Jack Black, who plays Bowser in the film, appeared on The Kelly Clarkson Show this week dressed in costume, and, well, his performance was overshadowed by the actor's testicles and what NBC did to try to hide them from viewers.</p><p>As part of a stunt, Black ran out on stage in costume as Bowser, and during his entrance, his bean bags were flopping around enough inside his tight yellow onesie to prompt NBC to censor them. Really. This probably happened out of an abundance of caution on NBC's part.</p><p>Presumably NBC could have been fined if Black's coin purse was actually exposed to the audience. There is also the matter of how The Super Mario Bros. Movie is very much a family film, and showing Black's privates, even the outline of them, is probably something best to be avoided. Here's the video in all its glory(?).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jack-black-dressed-up-as-bowser-and-had-a-wardrobe-malfunction-that-required-censoring/1100-6512018/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

And that's exactly what happened at Madison Square Garden as the celebrated actor watched the Ottawa Senators against the New York Rangers. What's unique here, though, is that Neeson decided to have some fun in recreating his Taken character, Bryan Mills, for a bit.</p><p dir="ltr">ESPN senior NHL writer Greg Wyshynski shared <a href="https://twitter.com/wyshynski/status/1631467700852514817">on Twitter</a> a clip of the Jumbotron playing the iconic scene from Taken where Mills says: "I will find you, and I will kill you." The big-screen then switched to Neeson sitting in his seat. He has his phone to his ear and a scowl, re-enacting the sequence.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Always the best when Liam Neeson gets MSG Jumbotron time. <a href="https://twitter.com/NYRangers?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@NYRangers</a> <a href="https://t.co/v2SX9QgkW7">pic.twitter.com/v2SX9QgkW7</a></p>  — Greg Wyshynski (@wyshynski) <a href="https://twitter.com/wyshynski/status/1631467700852514817?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">March 3, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Neeson ends with a big smile, obviously having fun playing up the Taken angle.

<p>Elden Ring's sprawling and hauntingly beautiful world is easily one of the most well-realized settings we've seen in an open-world game. If you spent dozens of hours in the Lands Between, you already know it's the type of video-game world that you want to stop and admire. As such, it makes sense that Elden Ring's world will soon fill the pages of an official art book.

Right now, Amazon is selling preorders for $54 each. It's worth noting that art books often receive even steeper discounts closer to release.

We wouldn't be surprised to see preorders sell out, so Elden Ring fans may want to secure their preorders soon.</p><figure style="width: 1000px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4107426-eldenringartbook.png"><img alt="Elden Ring - Official Art Book" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4107426-eldenringartbook.png" /></a><figcaption>Elden Ring - Official Art Book</figcaption></figure><p>Together, the two-volume set eclipses 800 pages.

<p>As a part of Nintendo's recent move to bring its more iconic Game Boy and Game Boy Advance titles to its subscription service, Nintendo Switch Online, the company has announced a port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-fusion/">Metroid Fusion</a> is on the way. The classic Game Boy Advance title will be available for all subscribers starting Thursday, March 9.</p><div>          </div><p>Originally released in 2002, Metroid Fusion follows the iconic bounty hunter Samus Aran as she explores the surface of planet SR388 in search of parasitic organisms referred to as X.

And, considering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-dread/">Metroid Dread</a> is also a fairly recent entry in the Metroid series, we're crossing our fingers all this means the long-awaited Metroid Prime 4 is coming sooner rather than later. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/">Announced back in 2017</a>, the fourth entry in the series has been in and out of development repeatedly over the course of the last six years.
