<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are few pieces of technology — ever — that have enjoyed a deeper lovefest from the media and the consumer public than ChatGPT and other efforts built atop vanilla GPT-3.

<p>It’s almost impossible to overstate the usefulness of remote desktop access for Windows PCs. Simply put, it lets a user or administrator on one Windows PC, called a client machine, establish a remote session on another Windows PC, called a server or host machine.</p><p>Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is the foundation on which various built-in Windows remote access tools rest. This secure network communications protocol supports both the old-school Remote Desktop Connection application and the modern Remote Desktop app, both shown in Figure 1 below.</p><p>Using available network connections between client and host via RDP, these programs let the client user open a window that displays some chosen remote desktop. With a remote desktop session up and running, that user can operate the targeted remote desktop almost as if they were sitting in front of it.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3688354/fix-windows-remote-desktop-problems.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
