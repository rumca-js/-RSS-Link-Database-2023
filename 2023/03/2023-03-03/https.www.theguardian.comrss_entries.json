Trossard has spent much of his career drifting in off the left flank but that was never the full story: only a month previously he had lined up against his future employers as a nominal centre-forward and his versatility, at a time when Arteta\u2019s options in that area were limited, was a crucial part of the package.</p><p>Nonetheless it still felt bold when Arteta selected Trossard as a drifting false 9 for the trip to Leicester last week.

Although both are mobile, intense, clever players who know how to create space for others, neither shares Trossard\u2019s creativity or polyvalence.

Sir John Saunders, the inquiry\u2019s chairman, paints a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/02/manchester-arena-attack-families-accuse-mi5-of-devastating-failure\" title=\"\">quietly devastating</a> portrait of wrong calls and serious misjudgments. The conclusion of the 226-page report is that there had been a \u201csignificant missed opportunity\u201d by MI5 that might have stopped the carnage. Sir John found it had failed to act on two key pieces of intelligence, rejecting earlier claims by the agency that the information was related to \u201cnon\u2011terrorist criminality\u201d. The apology from MI5\u2019s director general, Ken McCallum, was necessary. The agency had to acknowledge its mistake. But it does not ease the pain felt by bereaved families.</p><p>MI5\u2019s defence of the realm in the modern age has been as a counter-terrorist agency. Until 1989, it operated in a legal and political grey area, without statutory authority. The report shows that even today, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/02/manchester-arena-inquiry-lacks-crucial-details-hard-reading-mi5\" title=\"\">service</a> largely runs under its own rules, operating with the trust of senior British politicians \u2013 themselves a small group. Sir John\u2019s report is not the whole picture. Another document, which covers evidence heard in private, will never be made public on the grounds of national security. This is likely to raise more unanswered questions. A lawyer for the families could have signed the Official Secrets Act and been given access to a redacted version of this file. It seems wrong that this did not happen. That might have helped those mourning loved ones find some closure.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/03/the-guardian-view-on-mi5s-missed-opportunities-failures-of-analysis\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/03/the-guardian-view-on-mi5s-missed-opportunities-failures-of-analysis", "date_published": "2023-03-03 18:30:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Guardian view on children\u2019s reading: a gift that should be for all | Editorial", "description": "<p>With stressed families less likely to have time and money to spare for books,  young readers are losing out.

First, the preparations for government by Labour need to start now. An election may still be over a year away, but there is an enormous amount of work to be done if the party is to hit the ground running. Well before the election comes, Labour will need to have a very clear idea of what it wants to do and how it wants to do it. This is a vital appointment that can\u2019t wait.

If there is any justice, it will be producer-director Todd Field, with fellow producers Alexandra Milchan and Scott Lambert, who will be invited up on stage at the end of the evening to receive the climactic best picture statuette.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is wonderfully commanding as the haughty sociopath musical megastar, the monster who is disdainful of the philistinism and stupidity that surrounds her, the European-American exotic with the preposterous accent on the \u201cA\u201d. Blanchett also gives us something faintly preposterous, but seductive and intimidating in her speaking voice: resonant, deep, faintly nasal. She wears mannish black suits and white shirts with insouciant style and shakes her hair free with explosive abandon at the podium. At other moments, her face has a way of becoming a Tutankhamun mask of contempt.<br /><br />Lydia is preparing a long-planned live recording of Mahler\u2019s Fifth Symphony, a project apparently delayed by the Covid lockdown, that is of overwhelming importance to her. But she has problems in her life. Her marriage to first violinist Sharon (Nina Hoss) is happy, but professionally fraught and when their daughter is bullied at school, Lydia shows us her sinister side by murmuring icy threats to the bully in the playground while assuring this little girl that it would be no use complaining to a grownup: \u201cNo one would believe you \u2013 I am a grownup\u201d \u2013 thus revealing very clearly the abuser\u2019s modus operandi.<br /><br />Lydia\u2019s assistant Francesca (played by No\u00e9mie Merlant) is a conducting student who has emerged through Lydia\u2019s mentoring programme which may well exist simply to provide Lydia with submissive young lovers. Francesca is self-harmingly in love with Lydia and suspects that she is about to be jilted professionally and emotionally, having witnessed the catastrophic case of another student. And most calamitously, Lydia is persuaded to host a masterclass at New York\u2019s Juilliard School at which she humiliates a student who identifies as Bipoc pangender for presuming to dismiss the supposed cis white misogyny of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jsbach\">JS Bach</a>. Lydia\u2019s life begins to crumble and she (and we) begin to see how the walls are closing in.</p><p>Do we sympathise with Lydia or not? Does her terrible glamour reside in this conventional split between attraction and revulsion? Partly. The extended opening sequence might be seen as indulgent: the New Yorker\u2019s cultural critic Adam Gopnik, playing himself, does a deferential interview with this imaginary creative legend. The New Yorker film critic, Richard Brody vehemently took against T\u00e1r for apparently endorsing regressive and reactionary attitudes.<br /><br />But this opening scene very cleverly puts us inside the head of the superstar figure who has persuaded everyone to take her at her own estimation of herself, but whose moment-by-moment existence at achievement\u2019s pinnacle means that there is no time, or space, left for enjoying anything.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/03/why-tar-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar\">Continue reading...</a>", "link":

Chelsea fear that Silva will be out for six weeks and Graham Potter, who is under growing pressure amid a dreadful run of form, could be short of defensive leaders when Leeds visit Stamford Bridge. Wesley Fofana is only three months older than Badiashile and has had injury problems, while Trevoh Chalobah is out of favour and the 31-year-old Kalidou Koulibaly has been poor since joining last summer. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p><p><em>Chelsea v Leeds, Saturday 3pm (all times GMT)</em></p><p><em>Liverpool v Manchester United (Sunday, 4.30pm)</em></p><p><em>Manchester City v Newcastle, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p><p><em>Arsenal v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/03/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/03/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend", "date_published": "2023-03-03 00:05:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Holyrood\u2019s presiding officer calls for ban on all-male committees", "description": "<p>Gender-sensitive audit also urges quotas for governing bodies and a new permanent proxy-voting scheme</p><p>Holyrood\u2019s presiding officer is calling for a ban on all-male committees, alongside quotas for key governing bodies and a new permanent proxy-voting scheme, in order to improve gender equality within the Scottish parliament.</p><p>Publishing the findings of the first gender-sensitive audit on Friday, Alison Johnstone \u2013 the Holyrood equivalent of the Commons speaker \u2013 warned \u201cequal representation of women is not yet embedded within the parliament, nor is it guaranteed going forward\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/03/holyrood-presiding-officer-ban-all-male-committees-scotland\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/03/holyrood-presiding-officer-ban-all-male-committees-scotland", "date_published": "2023-03-03 00:01:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
