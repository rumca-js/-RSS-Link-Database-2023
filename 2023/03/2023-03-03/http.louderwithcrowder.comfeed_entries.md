She should be in the clear from the woke mob since she is not white, but you never know. Maybe she'll be the next <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/real-racism-larry-elder-attacked-by-white-leftist-wearing-a-gorilla-mask" target="_blank">"black face of white supremacy".</a></p><p>The chick, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kaliwillnotbecensored" target="_blank">@kaliwillneotbecensored</a> on TikTok, simply rattled off some headlines about white people and asked viewers to replace the word "white" with any other race. Spoiler - it sounds very, very bad. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cImagine if these headlines were about black folk \ud83d\ude2c\u201d</div> — Kali Fontanilla (@Kali Fontanilla)

</blockquote>

<p>Kali said, <em>"I want you to take all of these anti-white racism headlines that are totally acceptable in America and mainstream news right now and insert the word Jewish and just see how racist and scary this stuff is."</em></p><p>The headlines she rattled off included:</p><p><em> "White Americans are the biggest terror threat in the United States"</em></p><p><em>"Are White Parents Part of the Problem With Public Education?"</em></p><p><em>"There's Nothing More Frightening In America Today Than An Angry White Man"</em></p><p><em>"When White People Take Up Too Much Space"</em></p><p><em>"White Women Drive Me Crazy"</em></p><p>I'm guessing you see the problem here. If you substituted the word "white" for literally any other race, it would be a huuuuuuuge problem. And maybe even spark a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/black-lives-matter-riots-cost" target="_blank">summer of violent, fatal riots</a>. But since they're all about white people and it's considered acceptable or even cool to hate on the whites these days, it's considered totally fine. </p><p>Kali went on to explain how terrifying this trend is, concluding: <em>"This reminds me of what happened in 1930s Germany with the propaganda that was being put out about Jewish people."</em></p><p>And this is, unfortunately, so true. The hatred of white people has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ohio-elementary-school" target="_blank">seemingly spread even to the youngest generation</a> of Americans. It's almost like constantly dividing everyone by the color of their skin and demonizing a single race leads to <em>more</em> racism. Who woulda thunk it. </p>

First, he wouldn't visit <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pete-buttigieg-east-palestine-response" target="_blank">East Palestine</a> for many, many days, even though the entire town was nuked because of a transportation failure. Now, it turns out he mentored an actual pedophile. I'm not sure which is worse - ignoring the United States's version of Chernobyl, or this. Let's call it a tie to be on the safe side. </p><p>Patrick Wojahn is the Mayor of College Park, Maryland. Er, actually, he <em>was</em> the mayor, until last week when he was charged with 40 counts of possession of child sexual exploitative material and 16 felony counts of distribution of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/florida-man-child-ton" target="_blank">child porn</a>. He is now no longer the mayor. </p><p>Wojahn is a "gay activist democrat" and was the first openly gay man to serve as Mayor of College Park. Wojahn reportedly made several visits to the White House as an invited guest, and his most recent appearance was about two months ago. He attended with his husband to celebrate the so-called "Respect For Marriage Act". He was also <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/revealed-democrat-maryland-mayor-charged-with-child-porn-was-mentored-by-pete-buttigieg?utm_campaign=64466" target="_blank">mentored by Pete Buttigieg</a>, who also happens to be a gay former Mayor. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cPatrick Wojahn, the first openly gay mayor of College Park, MD\u2014who was also a regular White House guest and Pete Buttigieg "mentee"\u2014has just been arrested on 56 counts of child porn.\u201d</div> — Charlie Kirk (@Charlie Kirk)

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/2019/11/14/re-elected-college-park-mayor-discusses-politics-future-plans/" target="_blank">Washington Blade</a> interview from 2019:</p><p><em> "'I actually met Mayor Pete Buttigieg shortly after I was elected mayor in 2015,' Wojahn said. 'I went to the U.S. Conference of Mayors’ Winter Meeting in D.C. in January and he was assigned to be my buddy.' The two continued to talk over the phone and Buttigieg explained the conference to him and what would take place at the meeting. Later, they would both attend a White House reception during the Obama administration where Dave and Chasten (Buttigieg) would meet as well. Buttigieg continued to mentor Wojahn, advising him on how to get the most out of his participation in the conference. 'I now serve in a leadership role as vice chair of city livability and bicycling in part due to his mentorship.' </em><em>They also talked about the challenges of being an openly gay mayor with Buttigieg sharing with his mentee the story of his coming out while serving in office."</em></p><p>Now, this doesn't prove that Mayor Pete knew about Wojahn's criminal activities or did anything wrong himself. But it's definitely not a great look. </p>

## Watch: Plus-Size Chick Says Weight Loss Is Racist And We Should Trust Her Because She Has A Master's Degree

This information is brought to us by "Cute Fat Queer" on TikTok. And she has a master's degree in it. So we should probably take her very, very seriously. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cPromoting weight loss and fitness is now racist. Listen to her. She has a master\u2019s degree in fatness studies.\u201d</div> — Catch Up (@Catch Up)

<p>She began, <em>"I get very angry when people start promoting diets in their lives. And I have to go. I can't be around it. I am a fat person, and you're attacking me by opening your mouth and saying shitty things about your fat body." </em></p><p>Ma'am, people going on diets to look better in a bikini is neither a personal attack on you nor your fatness. That's what we call, "projection" </p><p>But there's more. We still haven't even gotten to the racism part yet. This chick went on to claim, "<em>Be careful about what you say and what you are perpetuating. Because it's all tied to racism. And eugenics. You're being a racist when you start promoting weight loss. I said what I said, it's the truth [...] If you care about me, if you care about fat people, if you care about yourself, you will stop. You will stop right now."</em></p><p><em></em>She never did elaborate on how promoting <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/woman-issues-warning-positivity" target="_blank">weight loss</a> is actually racist. If anything, wouldn't encouraging people of any race to get healthier be a positive thing? I don't know. My brain can't comprehend such wokeness. </p><p>But I guess she doesn't want anyone to lose weight ever. She concluded the video by claiming doctors are lying to people when they tell them they need to lose weight for their health. What the motive for that would be, who knows. What I do know is, based on our trajectory, our future is looking more and more like the movie Wall-E every day. </p>

## UPDATE: Pit Bull Owners Trained Dogs to Be Aggressive With Meat Before They Murdered An Elderly Man. Shocker.

Now it turns out the couple that owned the dogs actually trained them to be aggressive with meat. Shocking. </p><p>The couple has been charged with "Dangerous Dog Attack Resulting in Death and Injury to Elderly - Criminal Negligence". Their bonds were set at a combined $125,000. One of the victims was 81-year-old Ramon Najera, who died after he was mauled by the couple's three pit bulls after the beasts escaped from the couple's yard. The dogs then <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-dog-secret-service" target="_blank">attacked</a> Najera's 74-year-old wife while Najera tried to protect her. Two other men also tried to help and were subsequently mauled. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>According to the affidavit, the female owner of the dogs " recorded conversations with her husband regarding how dangerous the dogs had become". So it seems like she knows this was a bad scenario. Inexplicably, though, she doesn't blame her husband. After the attack but before her arrest, she told a local news station,  <em>"We were coming back and I saw the dogs behind the gate but they were full of blood. It's traumatizing to see my dogs that I have raised since they were puppies do that to somebody. From the bottom of our hearts, we're sorry but my husband is not responsible."</em></p><p>Er, ma'am, if you purposely trained your extremely strong dogs to be aggressive with meat, and weren't vigilant enough to prevent them from escaping your yard...then yeah, there's definitely some responsibility there. And the dogs apparently weren't even wearing harnesses or collars before the attack. So there's that. </p><p>This is such a tragic story as it was completely preventable and did not need to happen. And now, a poor elderly woman has lost her husband. </p><p>The dogs have since been euthanized, as they should be. </p>

## Watch: Elementary Schoolers Force White Kids To Say 'Black Lives Matter' Or Catch A Beating

It's simply not real. So anything you may see in this post that even hints at that possibility is just a figment of your imagination. Got it? Good. </p><p>Ohio police are investigating an event that took place at an elementary school. Black students reportedly forced their white peers to say "Black Lives Matter" on camera and assaulted any who refused. The incident is being treated as an <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/msnbc-white-trash-james-carville" target="_blank">Anti-White</a> hate crime (But remember, anti-white racism DOES NOT exist). </p><p>The incident was caught on video and showed two students leading another student around the playground while punching him in the head. The student was then tossed on the ground and was quickly followed by two others. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cHorrendous. CCTV released showing white children being rounded up by black children at a school in Ohio, then forced to kneel and say "black lives matter" and assaulted. The race issue is so toxic.

<p>The school district released a statement explaining that it won't disclose how the students are being punished:<em> "The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) prevents the District from disclosing personally identifiable information or details about the discipline of a child to anyone other than their parent or guardian."</em></p><p><em>"Moving forward from this experience, the District is working closely with counselors, mental health experts, and multiple community partners and agencies to provide support to children and staff directly involved, as well as those not directly involved. </em><em>The District will use this experience as an opportunity to strive for greater acceptance, grow and reinforce community connections."</em></p><p>It's shocking and incredibly sad that such racial division has now spread even to elementary schoolers. When I was a kid, I never though about the race of my peers. We were all just friends. </p><p>But on the bright side, good for these kids for refusing to bend the knee. That's more than many adults did during 2020's 'Summer of Love'. </p>
