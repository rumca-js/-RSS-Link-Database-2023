Metroid Fusion will be available for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion pack members as part of the Game Boy Advance Nintendo Switch Online library. Watch the action-packed trailer and get ready to join Samus on this mission.

While lending mission support on planet SR388, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite, an organism with the ability to mimic the abilities of any creature it infects. Near death, Samus is saved by a vaccine made from the DNA of the last Metroid—the X parasite's only natural predator. When the X spread to a research station in orbit around SR388, a weakened Samus is forced to exterminate them all...or die trying.

Experience classic Metroid game play as Samus explores the secret passages of a massive research station teeming with hostile life-forms. Master moves such as clinging to ledges, leaping to high ladders, and firing new weapons like Diffusion Missiles. Along the way, collect classic power-ups like the Morph Ball, Screw Attack, and Wave Beam. All these skills will be useful when you encounter the SA-X, an unstoppable X mimicking Samus, which is on the loose and could be just around the corner.
