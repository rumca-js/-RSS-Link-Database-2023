<p><strong>(Verve)</strong><br />The Pakistani American singer’s follow-up to breakthrough album Vulture Prince is a tender, softly triumphant reunion with her former collaborators  </p><p>Since her 2015 debut Bird Under Water, Pakistani American singer Arooj Aftab has honed the delicate cadence of her voice in increasingly minimal settings. On that album, she embellished yearning Urdu poetry with traditional instrumentation such as the sitar and bansuri, along with drums and cajon; 2018’s follow-up Siren Islands experimented with a layered synth backing. Her breakthrough album, 2021’s Grammy-winning Vulture Prince, reduced the percussion further, instead opting for the ornamentation of violin, harp and double bass.</p><p>On her latest record, Love in Exile, Aftab collaborates with jazz pianist Vijay Iyer and synth player Shahzad Ismaily, balancing her melismatic voice between entirely percussion-less, almost ambient soundscapes. The trio formed in 2018 and developed their sound through improvisatory live shows. That same intuitive process informs Love in Exile, with each of its seven compositions building undulating textures as if establishing an onstage atmosphere: the opening three minutes of To Remain/To Return features Ismaily’s keening synth trills and Iyer’s slowly developing piano phrase without a whisper of Aftab’s voice; Sharabi luxuriates in creating a 13-minute dark and angular synth palette.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/03/arooj-aftab-vijay-iyer-and-shahzad-ismaily-love-in-exile-review-a-trio-in-striking-harmony">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The stars sizzle with chemistry, the band shenanigans are fun and everyone and everything in it looks gorgeous – but it all just feels too slick and sanitary</p><p>T<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/02/taylor-jenkins-reid-daisy-jones-and-the-six-interview">aylor Jenkins Reid</a>’s bestseller Daisy Jones &amp; the Six is a beautifully controlled depiction of the exuberant rise and chaotic fall of a 1970s band – fictional but very much reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac. It captured the glamour, the hedonism, the freedom, the joy of unleashing talent and the agony of addiction, all the while building an acute psychological portrait of each character and – even more impressively – the cross-currents between them all. Love, resentment, creative and sexual tension, insecurities and monstrous egos collide, rebound and send shockwaves back into and beyond the group, compounding their mistakes but also creating the alchemy that gives rise to great music.</p><p>It is a book made for television – even down to the way it is structured, as the members of the band are being interviewed for a documentary 20 years after they broke up – and the rights were duly snapped up by Reese Witherspoon. The result is a glossy, 10-part Prime Video adaptation, developed by writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H Weber, and directed by James Ponsoldt. They have kept the style and glamour – everyone and everything in it looks ceaselessly gorgeous – but failed to repeat Jenkins Reid’s great feat, which was to make you care about this group of talented, fortunate people who couldn’t keep themselves together enough to succeed for long, and who damaged an awful lot of people in the fallout.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/03/daisy-jones-the-six-review-not-even-elviss-grandkid-can-save-this-70s-rocknroll-saga">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the film Meet Me in the Bathroom relives the glory days of the Strokes and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, fans and musicians recall the sweat, swagger and skinny jeans that made the British scene they inspired even wilder</p><p>‘Are you guys aware of the craziness you’ve created here?” a British journalist asked a dazed-looking Julian Casablancas in 2001. The exchange is included in the documentary Meet Me in the Bathroom. The only words the Strokes frontman could muster were: “It’s crazy and bizarre.” When Yeah Yeah Yeahs landed on UK soil a year later, it was more of the same. “I was not prepared for it at all,” says Karen O, the lead singer, in the film. “We were drunk on the ravenous fanaticism.”</p><p>Meet Me in the Bathroom is based on Lizzy Goodman’s 2017 book of the same name, which is subtitled Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001-2011, but ends up being as much about the UK. New York birthed these bands, but British media, fans and record labels lapped them up with such relish that they became stars here first.

## Trump has a better shot at the Republican nomination than people realize | Osita Nwanevu

<p>In some ways, Trump may be even more difficult for his Republican rivals to beat next year than he was seven years ago</p><p>It’s worth remembering that most Republican voters didn’t back Donald Trump in the race for the party’s nomination in 2016. Trump came away with something like 45% of the vote in the Republican primaries; though the field had by then shrunk to just three candidates – Trump, John Kasich, and Ted Cruz – polls showed Trump struggling to hit 50% support among Republicans as late as early April of that year.</p><p>Most explanations for his victory justifiably center around his political style and the rise of the rightwing populism we’ve come to call Trumpism ⁠– though it significantly predated Trump ⁠– among a growing share of Republicans. But as a practical matter, Trump won the Republican nomination in 2016 for a very simple reason: he built and kept a large minority of incredibly loyal supporters within the party, while the majority of Republican voters, who would have preferred another candidate, split their votes among too many alternatives. Had they united behind one candidate early enough in the race, Trump may well have lost. Instead, they divided themselves into defeat.</p><p>Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/03/donald-trump-republican-nomination-2024-biden">Continue reading...</a>
