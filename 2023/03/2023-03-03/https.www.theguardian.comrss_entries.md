## ‘Create chaos’: Leandro Trossard is delivering Arsenal’s Plan B in title bid

<p>The versatile Belgian international has helped Mikel Arteta freshen up his attacking approach at the perfect time</p><p>When Mikel Arteta moved for Leandro Trossard in January he knew Arsenal would be getting more than a winger. Trossard has spent much of his career drifting in off the left flank but that was never the full story: only a month previously he had lined up against his future employers as a nominal centre-forward and his versatility, at a time when Arteta’s options in that area were limited, was a crucial part of the package.</p><p>Nonetheless it still felt bold when Arteta selected Trossard as a drifting false 9 for the trip to Leicester last week. Arsenal had blazed a trail through this season’s Premier League with the help of specialist attacking spearheads, first Gabriel Jesus then the Brazilian’s understudy, Eddie Nketiah. Although both are mobile, intense, clever players who know how to create space for others, neither shares Trossard’s creativity or polyvalence. Playing Trossard where one of that pair had once operated meant recalibrating Arsenal’s attack midway through a title race that will be decided on tweaks, details and fine margins.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/03/arsenal-mikel-arteta-leandro-trossard-is-delivering-arsenals-plan-b-in-title-bid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The wing uses the technique to cope with injury and prepare for games – and it led to a picture-perfect try in win over Wales</p><p>Anthony Watson’s try for England against Wales last week came with a sense of deja vu. An obvious feeling of cathartic release, too, after spending so long out with injury, but underlying it all, a familiarity. For Watson had scored the try before, diving into the left-hand corner and dotting the ball down with his right hand. In fact, he had done so only days earlier during one of his visualisation blocks – a preparation method the 29-year-old winger swears by.</p><p>“I don’t really judge my quality of games by tries but to be able to score in the corner was nice and something I had spent a lot of the week visualising,” he says. “That is how I try to calm myself down before games. It is weird how it happened exactly how I had pictured it. Literally in that corner, because I was playing on the left wing and it was finishing with the ball in my right hand in that kind of style.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/03/anthony-watson-try-england-six-nations">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on MI5’s missed opportunities: failures of analysis | Editorial

<p>Whether lessons are learned by the security services should be a matter for democratic debate</p><p>The final <a href="https://files.manchesterarenainquiry.org.uk/reports/2023/MAI-Final-PDF-Volume-3.pdf" title="">report</a> of the public inquiry into the Manchester Arena attack in May 2017, which left 22 people dead, offers revealing insights into how the bomber, Salman Abedi, ended up as a violent jihadist; and how the security services lost chances to prevent him from carrying out the deadly blast. Sir John Saunders, the inquiry’s chairman, paints a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/02/manchester-arena-attack-families-accuse-mi5-of-devastating-failure" title="">quietly devastating</a> portrait of wrong calls and serious misjudgments. The conclusion of the 226-page report is that there had been a “significant missed opportunity” by MI5 that might have stopped the carnage. Sir John found it had failed to act on two key pieces of intelligence, rejecting earlier claims by the agency that the information was related to “non‑terrorist criminality”. The apology from MI5’s director general, Ken McCallum, was necessary. The agency had to acknowledge its mistake. But it does not ease the pain felt by bereaved families.</p><p>MI5’s defence of the realm in the modern age has been as a counter-terrorist agency. Until 1989, it operated in a legal and political grey area, without statutory authority. The report shows that even today, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/02/manchester-arena-inquiry-lacks-crucial-details-hard-reading-mi5" title="">service</a> largely runs under its own rules, operating with the trust of senior British politicians – themselves a small group. Sir John’s report is not the whole picture. Another document, which covers evidence heard in private, will never be made public on the grounds of national security. This is likely to raise more unanswered questions. A lawyer for the families could have signed the Official Secrets Act and been given access to a redacted version of this file. It seems wrong that this did not happen. That might have helped those mourning loved ones find some closure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/03/the-guardian-view-on-mi5s-missed-opportunities-failures-of-analysis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Labour should take a stand against the excesses of the Israeli government, amid mounting violence in the West Bank, says <strong>Dr Anthony Isaacs. </strong>Plus letters from <strong>Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah</strong> of Oxfam and<strong> Godfrey Stadlen</strong></p><p>Your leader on the Palestinian territories is timely (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/28/the-guardian-view-on-mob-violence-in-the-west-bank-a-new-low" title="">The Guardian view on mob violence in the West Bank: a new low, 28 February</a>). The appalling settler rampage through Huwara, abetted by Israeli troops and encouraged by avowedly far-right and racist members of the governing coalition, has been likened in Israel to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/01/israeli-police-arrest-five-over-settler-rampage-in-west-bank" title="">pogrom</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/27/israeli-settler-violence-in-west-bank-escalates-huwara" title="">Kristallnacht</a>. It is not necessary to seek precise equivalence to feel revulsion for the acts of vengeance in Huwara.</p><p>You point to the dangers of escalating violence and state that “this [Israeli] government cannot be left to wreak more damage”, but give no clues as to how they might be deterred. The first essential for dealing with a problem is to recognise that it exists. Although there has been no acknowledgment of the current escalation from the British government, the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, has <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1631006282307063818?s=20" title="">met the Palestinian ambassador to the UK</a> and discussed what he referred to as “shocking settler violence” and the need for accountability for violations of international law. Consideration of these matters is too often met by accusations of antisemitism, yet openly critical opinions of the current Israeli government are increasingly prevalent in the mainstream Jewish community.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/03/israels-far-right-shift-is-a-clear-and-present-danger">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>The Photographers’ Gallery, London<br /></strong>Black history and identity loom large in the work of Samuel Fosso and Arthur Jafa while Frida Orupabo offers strange, hybrid creations and Bieke Depoorter faces an ethical dilemma</p><p>There are many abiding spirits, historical and cultural, hovering over the work on display on the fourth floor of the <a href="https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/">Photographers’ Gallery in London</a>, where <a href="https://samuelfosso.com/">Samuel Fosso</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/11/arthur-jafa-video-artist-love-is-the-message">Arthur Jafa </a>are in competition for this year’s <a href="https://www.deutscheboersephotographyfoundation.org/en/support/photography-prize.php#:~:text=The%20Deutsche%20B%C3%B6rse%20Photography%20Foundation,Europe%20in%20the%20previous%20year.">Deutsche Börse prize</a>. As you enter the gallery, the stern faces of Martin Luther King, Haile Selassie and Angela Davis stare down from the opposite wall, instantly recognisable but unsettlingly unreal. Next door, Robert Johnson and Miles Davis gaze directly at the viewer, cigarettes dangling from their lips, the latter in particular seeming to channel the ghost of the mythical “bad man”, Stagger Lee, from behind his outsize shades.</p><p>Black history and identity loom large in the work of both artists, but also the historical and contemporary function of the photographic image in creating, and distorting, that history and identity. African Spirits, Fosso’s series of performative self-portraits of iconic black figures, have such a powerful presence that they seem to be watching you from across the years as you peruse his other work. The diptych on an adjoining wall in which Fosso pays homage to the many west African soldiers who fought in both world wars is poignant as well as historically and formally complex. It carries a less immediately dramatic, but no less resonant, charge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/03/deutsche-borse-prize-review-the-photographers-gallery-london">Continue reading...</a>

It must be fantastically good!<br /></strong>Well … how do I put this? Remember how last year The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s tense homoerotic western, was pipped to the post by Coda, which looked like something the Hallmark channel put out on a wet Wednesday? The best picture doesn’t always win best picture. Everything Everywhere has split opinion. Some like it for its originality and spunk, quirky anime-inspired visual panache and absurdist humour. Others find it dim, derivative, unfunny, repetitive, overlong, smug and insufferable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/03/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-the-2023-oscars-but-were-afraid-to-ask">Continue reading...</a>

Bassist with Pulp who was also a successful producer, remixer and fashion photographer<p>It was a fool’s errand to try to upstage Jarvis Cocker during <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/pulp]" title="">Pulp</a>’s remarkable 1990s peak, but bassist Steve Mackey, who has died aged 56 after a long period of ill health, came close. A model of self-contained cool and dance-influenced grooves, he was key to the Pulp sound and look. On stage, Cocker was the insinuating, finger-pointing extrovert, but Mackey, reserved and elegant, was an attraction in his own right. His basslines gave Pulp a disco undertow that set them apart from their indie peers.</p><p>After he joined in 1989, the Sheffield group evolved: no longer struggling art-rockers but danceable art-poppers, they found their own space as Britpop’s idiosyncratic outliers. Mackey’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BH4Q2FIhcO9/?hl=en" title="">description of their sound</a> was, without much exaggeration, “Eastern European Balkans disco with acid house and Sheffield bleep music”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/03/steve-mackey-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Busy and diligent Labour MP disappointed in his hopes of becoming sports minister under Tony Blair</p><p>Like many of his generation, the former Labour junior minister Tom Pendry, who has died aged 88, was unlucky that after his election to parliament in 1970 his party was in opposition for all but five of the years until 1997. By the time Tony Blair then swept into office, Pendry was 63 and adjudged too old for the vibrant, zippy image of the new government heading into the millennium.</p><p>He had spent six years as a Labour whip in the 1970s, three of them in government, and a year as a parliamentary undersecretary in the Northern Ireland Office (as what was known as the “statutory Roman Catholic”) until 1979, but would later find his metier in 1992 when he became shadow sports minister. His lifelong enthusiasm for boxing and football and myriad connections in the sporting world had led him confidently to anticipate appointment to the same post in government when the opportunity arose five years later.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/03/lord-pendry-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Or find out what on earth a sunchoke cremosa is when it’s at home?</p><p>To be fair to the couple, this apparent lack of culinary curiosity probably leaves them more time to actually enjoy each other’s company, rather than horse trading side dishes.

<p>The band’s former bass player, who collaborated with the late Pulp musician on 2017 album Everything Now, pays homage to his generous, engaged friend</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/02/steve-mackey-bass-guitarist-for-pulp-dies-aged-56">Steve Mackey, bass guitarist for Pulp, dies aged 56</a></p><p></p><p>I knew Steve Mackey mostly as a producer. I suspect I was exposed to about one tenth of his talent. I met him when he came to help produce an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/arcadefire">Arcade Fire</a> record, Everything Now, in 2015. We were excited to work with him for a few reasons – Pulp was a very relevant influence for our band, and it seemed plausible that he’d be good with band dynamics, having navigated them in his own life. He was also great at making beats and into all sorts of dance music. It seemed like he’d be game to go where the music led.</p><p>Production in our case was partly a technical task, an engineering task: how do you take the sounds the band is producing and make them sound good? How do you connect a series of machines to make it so an idea can be expressed? And partly a curatorial task: which of these songs are exciting? Which of these ways to make the song reel sound the most promising? And partly a spiritual task, the ability to balance the needs of the different humans in the room. But it’s mostly to nurture some barely alive musical creature until it can breathe on its own. He was good at every aspect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/03/he-had-such-sharp-judgement-yet-you-never-felt-judged-arcade-fires-will-butler-on-working-with-steve-mackey">Continue reading...</a>

Some hope. He was interviewed by his former sportscaster Garry Richardson on Radio 4’s Today programme in the ministerial grilling slot usually reserved for those who have wrecked the country rather than enriched it. And schedule predecessor Zoe Ball, handing over for the last time at 9.30am, upgraded for the occasion from her default “My lovely!” to “My darling Ken!”</p><p>Bruce insists he wasn’t desperate to leave; Radio 2 claims to have been keen for him to stay. But somewhere between sloppy contract negotiations and music playlists rejigged to appeal to something called “mood mums”, the most fluent and loved BBC broadcaster since Sir Terry Wogan was lost to Greatest Hits Radio. Among his eight million weekly Radio 2 listeners, it’s not just the mums who are moody.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/03/ken-bruce-bbc-radio-2-after-31-years">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Shirt-first dressing sets the tone for the rest of your outfit – just choose colour and stripes over perfect white</p><p>Recently I stumbled across the concept of getting dressed “shirt-first”, and it’s my new favourite thing. Please try it. A great shirt turns out to be a magic ingredient that pulls an outfit together in moments. Getting dressed shirt-first is a speedy, drama-free morning formula that makes you feel like an effortlessly competent grownup. It works, it feels fresh without being try-hard and, well, I just think you should give it a go.</p><p>The cotton button-down shirt that I used to think of as a Work Shirt is now a hero piece around which to build an outfit. In fashion speak: the Power Shirt is a thing. This is a non-trend trend too, which aims to look current rather than shoutily fashionable – like, say, a trenchcoat – and tends to hold steady for years without overexposure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/03/building-your-outfit-around-a-shirt-feels-effortlessly-grown-up">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As Lucasfilm prepares to reveal the plan for the next phase of Star Wars movies and lure fans back to the big screen, the epic Disney+ series could be just what they are looking for</p><p>It’s an exciting time to be a Star Wars fan, particularly if you live in the UK. The new season of The Mandalorian just debuted its first episode on Disney+, revealing (minor spoiler alert!) that Din Djarin and Grogu must journey to the ruined planet of Mandalore in the hope of receiving redemption after the former removed his helmet one too many times and was silly enough to admit it to the Armorer. Moreover, <a href="https://www.starwarscelebration.com/">Star Wars Celebration is coming to London next month</a>, and we are promised Disney/Lucasfilm is finally going to start revealing what the plan is for the next phase of Star Wars movies.</p><p>So after the incredible disappointment of 2019’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/19/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-review-jj-abrams-daisy-ridley-adam-driver">The Rise of Skywalker</a> – a movie that managed the remarkable feat of making many Star Wars fans wonder why they should ever bother entering the multiplex again – we’ll soon start to get an <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/marvel-star-wars-tv-shows-movies-slowdown-1235326681/">idea of how the studio plans to get us thrilled</a> for the prospect of a new ream of far-out, big-screen space battles.

<p>Fortunes on the pitch have changed this season but, as global superclubs, they resemble each other more and more</p><p>It was October 2021 and Jürgen Klopp was in a knife-twisting mood. “United never look happy when they play us,” he told his Liverpool squad in their final team meeting before their visit to Old Trafford. “They always want to use this game to sort out everything. We are different. We want to squeeze everything out of this amazing situation we have here.” The subtext was clear enough: this was a team liable to shatter on first contact. In for the kill.</p><p>Before the game, as Liverpool coach Pep Lijnders recounts in his book Intensity, Klopp and his staff homed in on United’s pressure points with a sadistic relish. Scott McTominay and Fred were to be targeted ruthlessly in midfield. Roberto Firmino was assigned to drag Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelöf out of position. Bruno Fernandes’s space was to be shut down aggressively. The result was a 5-0 victory, the Theatre of Dreams set ablaze, thousands of fans beating a path for the exits at half-time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/03/liverpool-look-to-manchester-united-game-as-potential-remedy-for-woes">Continue reading...</a>

Airline staff have informed a group of passengers they hold a special, cheap ticket that denies them the right to take a carry-on bag. The agents blame Expedia. A quick online search indicates the airline is totally in on it (the policy soft-launched last summer), but either way, holders of a “basic economy” ticket can now only board with “one small, personal item”. No one in the queue has heard of this. Everyone is towing, in the American style, a huge wheelie suitcase, which they are invited to pay $40 to stow. There is a lot of waving and shouting.

## Conspiracy theories are about Sue Gray’s job with Labour are absurd – here’s why | Bob Kerslake

<p>I worked closely with Gray, and she is the ultimate professional. The government would do well to remember it was Boris Johnson who brought down Boris Johnson. Not her.</p><ul><li>Bob Kerslake is a former head of the civil service</li></ul><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/02/keir-starmer-considers-sue-gray-labour-chief-of-staff">proposed appointment</a> of Sue Gray by Keir Starmer, to his chief of staff, is a smart move for three reasons. First, the preparations for government by Labour need to start now. An election may still be over a year away, but there is an enormous amount of work to be done if the party is to hit the ground running. Well before the election comes, Labour will need to have a very clear idea of what it wants to do and how it wants to do it. This is a vital appointment that can’t wait. Having someone who really knows how government works from the inside will be enormously valuable.</p><p>Second, the chief of staff job requires someone with both great political understanding and strong organisational capability. It is not a surprise, therefore, that two previous holders of the role – Jonathan Powell for Tony Blair and Ed Llewellyn for David Cameron – were former diplomats in the civil service. If you are going to go for an experienced senior civil servant, it is hard to think of anyone better placed to do this than Gray.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/03/conspiracy-theories-sue-gray-job-labour-boris-johnson">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>EartH Hackney, London</strong><br />ADHD, Tory supremacy and the limited appeal of ‘Sir Keir’ combine in another unrestrained report from the standup’s struggles to hang on to optimism</p><p>Some comics alight on a new theme for each show. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/24/josie-long-re-enchantment-edinburgh-interview-free-speech-activists" title="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/24/josie-long-re-enchantment-edinburgh-interview-free-speech-activists">Josie Long</a>’s theme remains the same: her shows are a journal of her personal and political life (the two always closely intertwined) since last we spoke. Re-Enchantment traces her journey from the crushing disappointment of the 2019 general election, via lockdown, to the rebirth of her optimism on Kenmure Street in her adopted home town of Glasgow, where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/14/a-special-day-how-glasgow-community-halted-immigration-raid">community protests</a> stopped the arrest of two men for alleged immigration violations. Now 40 years into a life of hard political knocks and demands she start living in “the real world”, idealism and irrepressible fun are never far from the surface when Long takes to the stage.</p><p>So it is here, in a show outlining Long’s personal milestones (second child; move to Scotland; ADHD diagnosis) before the lens widens to address life under, and resistance to, the endless Tory supremacy. If her 10 minutes on lockdown feel out-of-date, the ADHD material is self-aware and delightfully silly, as she engages in pretend-childish tit-for-tat with her neurotypical oppressors. An encounter with an angry Glaswegian pest controller prompts ruminations on the culture wars, the real reasons why people feel less free these days, and a droll pidgin-Spanish sketch puncturing those rightwing bogeymen, “the woke brigade”.</p><p>Tonight at Contact theatre, Manchester, then <a href="https://josielong.seetickets.com/tour/josie-long">touring</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/03/josie-long-review-earth-hackney">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With first-time buyers unable to get a mortgage and landlords hiking up rents, it’s a vicious cycle</p><p>UK house prices are falling. In the year to February, prices <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/01/uk-house-prices-fall-at-fastest-annual-rate-since-2012">fell by 1.1%</a> to reach their lowest level for over a decade. The drivers are clear: inflation and rising interest rates are combining to put off mortgage borrowers. Approvals are at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/01/uk-mortgage-market-contracts-for-fifth-month-after-liz-truss-mini-budget">lowest rate since 2009</a>.</p><p>Without hefty government intervention, the current negative trajectory will continue. If inflation remains above wage growth, buyer confidence will remain low. On the other hand, if wages start to accelerate, the Bank of England will almost certainly ramp up interest rates to avoid further inflation, which will also dampen the demand for mortgages.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/03/falling-house-prices-renters-first-time-buyers-mortgages-landlords-rents">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Controversial former bandleader says he wanted to ‘re-address the political and emotional message’ of album that turns 50 years old this week</p><p>Roger Waters has revealed the first minute of music from his re-recorded version of Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon, after the original turned 50 years old this week.</p><p>He posted a clip of himself listening to a new recording of the song Us and Them, along with an explanation of the project, which does not feature his former bandmates. Waters wrote the original album’s lyrics, confronting war, capital, death and other weighty existential themes, and said he wanted to “re-address the political and emotional message of the whole album”, adding:</p><p>We are now in the process of finishing the final mix. It’s turned out really great and I’m excited for everyone to hear it. It’s not a replacement for the original which, obviously, is irreplaceable. But it is a way for the 79-year-old man to look back across the intervening 50 years into the eyes of the 29-year-old and say, to quote a poem of mine about my father, “We did our best, we kept his trust, our Dad would have been proud of us”. And also it is a way for me to honour a recording that Nick and Rick and Dave and I have every right to be very proud of.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/03/roger-waters-reveals-first-music-from-re-recorded-solo-dark-side-of-the-moon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A platform that can mimic humans’ writing with no commitment to the truth is a gift for those who benefit from disinformation. We need to regulate its use now</p><p><br /></p><p>It has taken a very short time for artificial intelligence application ChatGPT to have a disruptive effect on journalism. A technology columnist for the New York Times wrote that a chatbot <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html">expressed feelings</a> (which is impossible). Other media outlets <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams">filled with examples </a>of “Sydney” the Microsoft-owned Bing AI search experiment being “rude” and “bullying” (also impossible). Ben Thompson, who writes the Stratechery <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/from-bing-to-sydney-search-as-distraction-sentient-ai/">newsletter</a>, declared that Sydney had provided him with the “most mind-blowing computer experience of my life” and he deduced that the AI was trained to elicit emotional reactions – and it seemed to have succeeded.</p><p>To be clear, it is not possible for AI such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> and Sydney to have emotions. Nor can they tell whether they are making sense or not. What these systems are incredibly good at is emulating human prose, and predicting the “correct” words to string together.

<p>Comments come as Tory anger grows over Labour poaching Gray to work as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff</p><p><strong>Neil Coyle</strong> MP should be suspended from the House of Commons for five days after breaching parliament’s bullying and harassment policy, the <strong>independent expert panel</strong> says.</p><p>The IEP, which was set up to consider bullying and harrassment claims against MPs, has published<a href="https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/mps-lords--offices/standards-and-financial-interests/independent-expert-panel/hc-1194---the-conduct-of-mr-neil-coyle-mp.pdf"> a report</a> recommending the suspension after the “foul-mouthed and drunken abuse” of another MP’s assistant.</p><p>The most striking aggravating factor [in relation to the first complaint] was the ‘power gradient’ between an MP and a junior member of staff. The most striking aggravating factor [in relation to the second one] was the racial overtone in the verbal abuse. In relation to both episodes, it was clear that very marked abuse of alcohol was at the root of events.</p><p>As to mitigating factors, it was clear that the respondent had accepted what he had done, and fully agreed that what he did was far below any acceptable level of conduct. He also acknowledged that he had been heavily abusing alcohol at the time. Since then he had stopped consuming alcohol completely, and had maintained his abstention for the year following the complaints.</p><p><strong>Thomas described the appointment of Gray as chief of staff to Keir Starmer was “unusual” and “surprising”. </strong>He told the Today programme:</p><p>I do think this is unusual, it’s surprising. Although civil servants have crossed the aisle before – Jonathan Powell for Tony Blair, or others – I mean, it hasn’t happened before with a civil servant who was still serving of this seniority and with the public profile and career history in the deep centre of government that Sue Grey has.</p><p><strong>He said the appointment “raises quite tricky questions for the civil service in the long term about the trust of relationship between ministers and civil servants”.</strong></p><p><strong>He said it was important for Gray to stress that she would not be divulging confidential information she obtained when she was in government. </strong>He told Times Radio:</p><p>Sue Gray can’t unknow what she knows. And if she does this job, I do think she needs to be very clear she’s not going to share details of the work that she did in government.</p><p><strong>But Thomas rejected suggestions that the appointment meant Gray might have acted in a biase manner as a civil servant. </strong>Thomas said that he had worked with her, and that he had always seen her “behave entirely impartially and equally robustly with ministers and political advisers of any party”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/mar/03/labour-sue-gray-keir-starmer-partygate-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cate Blanchett is wonderfully commanding as the sociopath musical megastar whose life is crumbling around her but it is the steely menace in Todd Field’s film that is simply delicious</p><p>The great crack-up of Lydia Tár, the Berlin Philharmonic’s entirely fictitious but docudramatically real-seeming chief conductor, has given the cinema its greatest spectacle, its greatest provocation and its greatest pleasure. If there is any justice, it will be producer-director Todd Field, with fellow producers Alexandra Milchan and Scott Lambert, who will be invited up on stage at the end of the evening to receive the climactic best picture statuette.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is wonderfully commanding as the haughty sociopath musical megastar, the monster who is disdainful of the philistinism and stupidity that surrounds her, the European-American exotic with the preposterous accent on the “A”. Blanchett also gives us something faintly preposterous, but seductive and intimidating in her speaking voice: resonant, deep, faintly nasal. She wears mannish black suits and white shirts with insouciant style and shakes her hair free with explosive abandon at the podium. At other moments, her face has a way of becoming a Tutankhamun mask of contempt.<br /><br />Lydia is preparing a long-planned live recording of Mahler’s Fifth Symphony, a project apparently delayed by the Covid lockdown, that is of overwhelming importance to her. But she has problems in her life. Her marriage to first violinist Sharon (Nina Hoss) is happy, but professionally fraught and when their daughter is bullied at school, Lydia shows us her sinister side by murmuring icy threats to the bully in the playground while assuring this little girl that it would be no use complaining to a grownup: “No one would believe you – I am a grownup” – thus revealing very clearly the abuser’s modus operandi.<br /><br />Lydia’s assistant Francesca (played by Noémie Merlant) is a conducting student who has emerged through Lydia’s mentoring programme which may well exist simply to provide Lydia with submissive young lovers. Francesca is self-harmingly in love with Lydia and suspects that she is about to be jilted professionally and emotionally, having witnessed the catastrophic case of another student. And most calamitously, Lydia is persuaded to host a masterclass at New York’s Juilliard School at which she humiliates a student who identifies as Bipoc pangender for presuming to dismiss the supposed cis white misogyny of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/jsbach">JS Bach</a>. Lydia’s life begins to crumble and she (and we) begin to see how the walls are closing in.</p><p>Do we sympathise with Lydia or not? Does her terrible glamour reside in this conventional split between attraction and revulsion? Partly. The extended opening sequence might be seen as indulgent: the New Yorker’s cultural critic Adam Gopnik, playing himself, does a deferential interview with this imaginary creative legend. The New Yorker film critic, Richard Brody vehemently took against Tár for apparently endorsing regressive and reactionary attitudes.<br /><br />But this opening scene very cleverly puts us inside the head of the superstar figure who has persuaded everyone to take her at her own estimation of herself, but whose moment-by-moment existence at achievement’s pinnacle means that there is no time, or space, left for enjoying anything.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/03/why-tar-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Geffen/EMI)</strong><br />The Colombian-American pop star’s third LP is a lush, emotive confection of soft-focus R&amp;B that delves into the 28-year-old’s love life</p><p>In astrology, a red moon can often trigger an emotional tailspin. On the third album by Colombian American singer-songwriter Kali Uchis, she embraces these upheavals, delving into their effects on her love life. While her 2018 debut, Isolation, skipped between reggaetón, funk and bedroom pop, here Uchis couches her velveteen mood pieces in pillow-soft R&amp;B, creating a suite of songs luxuriant enough to bathe in.</p><p>Things start suitably mushy. Elegant lead single I Wish You Roses – its swirling chorus as soft as candy floss – promises a love that’s deep enough to weather any storm, while on the woozy All Mine, Uchis longs to stay in her loved-up cocoon: “I hate your phone, throw it away,” she pleads. While it’s lovely to hear about her sexual gymnastics on the slinky Fantasy, things get more interesting when the passion wilts. The bilingual Hasta Cuando, punctuated by 80s drum fills, sees Uchis rap-singing delicious kiss-offs (“paint me as the villain if that makes you feel better”), while the head-knocking Deserve Me comes as close as she gets to musically confrontational.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/03/kali-uchis-red-moon-in-venus-review-elegant-expose-of-a-troubled-heart">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Booker winner captures our collective despair in a thrillerish novel about climate crisis</p><p>In a literary marketplace that sometimes seems oversupplied with novels about brittle intellectuals feeling alienated from their emotions, or twentysomethings grinding axes about their exes, there is the wonder of Eleanor Catton: a novelist of lavish technical gifts who addresses herself to the world, broadly and richly conceived.</p><p>Catton’s first novel, 2008’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/18/rehearsal-eleanor-catton-review">The Rehearsal</a>, was a small miracle. Leaping acrobatically between fictional and metafictional modes, it tells the story of a secondary-school scandal (male teacher, female student) restaged by trainees at a local drama school. There is something almost Brechtian about the way it shocks you out of familiar fictional comfort zones, and something almost Wildean in the way it lobs its arch perceptions, like glittering little hand grenades, at all sorts of social and artistic pieties.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/03/birnam-wood-by-eleanor-catton-review-hippies-v-billionaires">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Guardian visits<strong> </strong>courtrooms<strong> </strong>in Blackpool, Doncaster and Caernarfon in north Wales, and finds a surge in cases</p><p>It is a February morning at Doncaster county court and a retired man is being led out of a courtroom wiping his eyes with a handkerchief. He has sobbed his way through much of a near 15-minute hearing, telling a district judge how his efforts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation failed to save the life of his ageing mother just four weeks earlier.</p><p>That personal tragedy compounded efforts to solve mounting financial problems that had worsened since his retirement – including more than £60,000 in mortgage and interest arrears on his £300,000 home, for which Leeds building society is pursuing him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/03/eviction-cases-mount-in-northern-england-and-wales">Continue reading...</a>

## Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre review – Guy Ritchie’s big, breezy spy caper

<p>A spirited cast, including Jason Statham and Aubrey Plaza, help deliver a fun time in Guy Ritchie’s slick and silly action comedy </p><p>After briefly disappearing into the Hollywood machine, steering IP-based franchises rather than creating his own films, Guy Ritchie is having something of a Shyamalan-esque B-movie reinvention. The big-budget bloat of Aladdin, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and The Man from Uncle (fondly remembered by some but wisely forgotten by most) has gone and, instead, there’s a renewed sense of purpose, a returned vitality that had gone missing. While the director has not exactly regressed to his roots per se, he has focused more on what he does well rather than what pays him well, from having a boss to being the boss.</p><p>While The Gentlemen might not have been quite the riot Ritchie seemed to think it was, 2021’s brooding revenge thriller <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/06/wrath-of-man-guy-ritchie-jason-statham">Wrath of Man</a> delivered an effectively arresting jolt to the system and he’s re-teamed with star Jason Statham for his latest, the absurdly titled yet absurdly enjoyable Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre. It’s got a bit of a cursed backstory – it was shot during Covid, later renamed (it was originally called Five Eyes, blander but better), then yanked off the release schedule twice in early 2022 due to fears over Ukrainian baddies seeming in bad taste, sold from STX to Lionsgate early this year and now being released, nay dumped, a few weeks later (it will go straight to Amazon Prime in the UK) – all of which belies a rather sleekly entertaining little romp, the light to Wrath of Man’s dark.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/02/operation-fortune-ruse-de-guerre-review-guy-ritchie-jason-statham-aubrey-plaza">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Escalating violence by Israeli settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories is happening amid unprecedented anti-government protests. It’s no coincidence, reports Bethan McKernan</p><p>Incidents of<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/20/land-beyond-road-forbidden-israeli-settler-shepherds-displacing-palestinians"> Israeli settler violence</a> across the West Bank are not rare. In fact they happen almost every day and have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/28/israel-palestine-west-bank-settler-violence-tension">steadily increased over the past few years</a>. But this week’s scenes were an unprecedented escalation. Hundreds of Israeli settlers went on a violent rampage, setting alight dozens of cars and homes after two brothers were killed by a Palestinian gunman.</p><p>The Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent <strong>Bethan McKernan </strong>has been in the West Bank this week and tells <strong>Michael Safi </strong>that many of the 700,000 or so Israelis living in the territory and East Jerusalem are motivated by what they see as a religious mission to restore the historical land of Israel to the Jewish people. Settlement communities are viewed as illegal under international law, and one of the biggest obstacles to peace.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/mar/03/israel-west-bank-week-rage-rampage-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After raids at the New Bilibid prison identified thousands of contraband goods, the management of the country’s prisons is in the spotlight</p><p>When officials last raided the Philippines’ biggest prison, their discoveries ranged from deadly to bizarre. Tens of thousands of contraband goods were identified in New Bilibid prison, including lethal weapons, alcohol, drugs and gambling material. A menagerie of horses, game fowls and pythons were also found living in the prison complex.</p><p>In the Philippines, prisons have long had a reputation for corruption but the sweep in New Bilibid in Manila late last year put the country’s prisons back in the spotlight. Last month, four Japanese men were arrested for allegedly orchestrating a string of scams and robberies in their home country from inside a Philippine immigration detention centre. A subsequent inspection of the facility found phones, laptops, routers and cash.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/03/drugs-jacuzzis-and-a-horse-the-anarchic-philippines-prison-where-anything-can-be-bought">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mohamed Salah bids to bring Manchester United down to earth, Spurs seek an attacking spark and a high-stakes derby</p><p>It is surely not a coincidence that Benoît Badiashile’s only disappointing performance since his move to Chelsea came when Thiago Silva was rested for last month’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/18/chelsea-southampton-premier-league-match-report">defeat to Southampton</a>. Badiashile is quick and strong, but he is still only 21 and has much to learn. It is no surprise that the former Monaco defender has been better next to Silva. Unfortunately for Chelsea though, Silva cannot play every game. They had to rest the 38-year-old against Southampton and struggled after he went off with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/28/thiago-silva-injured-up-to-six-weeks-graham-potter-chelsea">knee injury</a> against Spurs. Chelsea fear that Silva will be out for six weeks and Graham Potter, who is under growing pressure amid a dreadful run of form, could be short of defensive leaders when Leeds visit Stamford Bridge. Wesley Fofana is only three months older than Badiashile and has had injury problems, while Trevoh Chalobah is out of favour and the 31-year-old Kalidou Koulibaly has been poor since joining last summer. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p><p><em>Chelsea v Leeds, Saturday 3pm (all times GMT)</em></p><p><em>Liverpool v Manchester United (Sunday, 4.30pm)</em></p><p><em>Manchester City v Newcastle, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p><p><em>Arsenal v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/03/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>
