<p>Boston Dynamics’ canine automatons steal show in Paris as maison stages modern fable, designers say</p><p>Welcome to the age of the super-robot.<br /><br />With their impossible proportions, thousand-yard stares and supernatural ability to walk in 5in heels, catwalk models often appear a different species to regular humans.<br /><br />But it was the models, including Kate Moss’s daughter Lila, who played the role of vulnerable, flesh and blood creatures at the Coperni fashion show in Paris, where they shared the stage with five robots.</p><p>Coperni partnered with Boston Dynamics for the first fashion show in which robots, rather than models, were the star turn.<br /><br />As the lights went down, four pairs of green eyes began to flash in the darkness. When the “Spots” – Boston Dynamic’s robot canines, in tarantula stripes of yellow and black – stalked into the room, there was an audible collective intake of breath as each creature seemed to lock eyes with, and approach, an audience member.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/03/models-and-robots-share-the-runway-at-coperni-fashion-show">Continue reading...</a>
