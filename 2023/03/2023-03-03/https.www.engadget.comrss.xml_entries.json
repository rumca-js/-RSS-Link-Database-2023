Moreover, the proposed legislation would afford consumers more access to and ownership over their health data. It would also place more restrictions on companies\u2019 use of personal health data without the explicit consent of a user.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The bill aims to prohibit the use of personally identifiable health data from any source for advertising. This includes data from users themselves, medical centers, fitness trackers and browser histories. The UPHOLD Privacy Act's restrictions wouldn't apply to public health campaigns.</p><p>The legislation was introduced by Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Mazie Hirono. \u201cWith Republicans working to ban and criminalize reproductive health care nationwide, it\u2019s critical we safeguard the reproductive data privacy of everyone in our country,\u201d Hirono said <a href=\"https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=C2C49755-FA37-4E22-AE31-BF63F9143373\">in a statement</a>. \u201cEveryone should be able to trust that personal data about their bodies and their health care will be protected. By restricting the sale and use of personally identifiable health data, this bill will give patients and providers the peace of mind that their private information is secure.\u201d</p><p>Since the Supreme Court overturned <em>Roe v.

Period-tracking apps have given some particular cause for concern. Developers of some of these apps have since <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/flo-anonymous-mode-is-now-available-on-ios-130039242.html\"><ins>introduced features</ins></a> and policies to help protect their users' data.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ftc-responds-abortion-data-privacy-legal-authorities-030247915.html\">said</a> soon after the Supreme Court ruling that it would clamp down on companies which misuse health and location data. This week, the agency <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ftc-moves-to-ban-betterhelp-from-sharing-mental-health-data-for-ad-targeting-184605314.html\"><ins>moved to ban</ins></a> online counseling service BetterHelp from sharing consumers' health data for ad targeting without consent. The FTC found that the company shared users' email addresses, IPs and health questionnaire responses. BetterHelp says it has never shared clinical data from therapy sessions with advertisers, publishers or social media companies.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/new-senate-bill-aims-to-better-protect-health-data-after-roe-reversal-211457607.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/new-senate-bill-aims-to-better-protect-health-data-after-roe-reversal-211457607.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-03 21:14:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Facebook stretches out Reels to a maximum 90-second length", "description": "<p>Meta <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-pushing-reels-into-nearly-every-part-of-its-app-170028977.html\"><ins>sees Reels</ins></a> as an important aspect of its apps, and the platform is rolling out some new features for the format on Facebook.

The massive 200MP sensor camera Samsung added was the big news upon the phone's debut, though it takes some tinkering to get the most out of those extra pixels. The battery lasted an impressive 19 hours and 26 minutes and it's got a great build. One caveat we mention is the high price tag. But perhaps Amazon's gift card offer will ease up on that drawback a little.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eargo 7 Micro Hearing Aid</h2><p></p><p>If you're looking for FDA-approved, self-fitting hearing aids that are pretty close to invisible, you may like this deal on the new <a href=\"https://shop.eargo.com/eargo-7\">Eargo 7</a> hearing aid. They're on sale for $360 off the usual price, bringing the $2,950 devices down to $2,590. When we <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/eargo-6-review-160023198.html\">wrote about</a> Eargo last year, we said the brand acts \"more like a technology company instead of a stuffy medical-device provider\" and that's partly due to its annual release cycle \u2014 like you get with Samsung or Apple \u2014 that continually improves upon the technology with each new version of a product. This week, our editor James Trew checked out the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/eargo-7-the-tiny-hearing-aids-you-wont-need-to-take-out-to-shower-140000815.html\">latest release from Eargo</a> and called the Eargo 7 the best model to date.</p><p>Apart from a few set-up snags within the app and the fact that the case deep sleeps when it needs a charge (even if the hearing aids are full), the experience with the devices was smooth sailing. These are CIC or in-canal hearing aids, which tend to be fairly unobvious when you wear them and they're even rated to handle sweat from workouts or minor splashes in the shower. Trew likes how they adequately amplify sound but don't emphasize sharp noises like keys. The battery lasts all day and the customer service is pretty great \u2014 important for a medical device that you buy direct from a company, instead of going through an audiologist.</p><h2>Apple M2 Mac mini</h2><p></p><p>This week, Apple's new M2 Mac mini dropped to its lowest price since its debut earlier this year with the entry level models for $50 off the list price.

That said, those devices are far from pocketable. But with the rise of cloud gaming, there's a newer breed of mobile machines like <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d043077a-4ba1-4321-a933-30b8701d8d31&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Razer&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkMDQzMDc3YS00YmExLTQzMjEtYTkzMy0zMGI4NzAxZDhkMzEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmF6ZXIuY29tL21vYmlsZS1oYW5kaGVsZHMvcmF6ZXItZWRnZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDYxMTk3ZTgtY2M4MC00ODAzLWIzMDEtMDI0NzliYzVhNTQ2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdXCHw5ahlB8MPZ5-8Cf5KeIVZbjv-zHjCOLyZGtkNnW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-handhelds%2Frazer-edge\">the Razer Edge</a> that are trying to make things even more travel-friendly. Instead of relying solely on local performance, the Edge runs Android for lightweight apps while services like GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud gaming provide the computing power for more demanding titles. And for those who can't live without access to their games no matter where they are, there's even a model that supports 5G connectivity. But the question is: even with a relatively low starting price of $400, is a cloud gaming handheld something you really want or need?</p><h2>Design</h2><p>Unlike Logitech's rival game streaming handheld \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/logitech-g-cloud-gaming-handheld-preorder-amazon-logi-play-142636818.html\"><ins>the G Cloud</ins></a> \u2013 the Razer Edge is based on a two-piece design. There's the Edge itself which is a somewhat plain matte black slab that houses a 6.8-inch 144Hz OLED display and combines with an included detachable controller.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"1d97b4f34cb747e2962d311c2150ec74\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Anyone familiar with Razer's other mobile gaming products will immediately notice that the Edge's gamepad looks <em>a lot</em> like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/razer-kishi-v2-android-gamepad-announcement-150058248.html\"><ins>Kishi V2</ins></a>, and that's because it's basically the same thing with a couple of tweaks. Technically, the controller that comes with the Edge is called the Kishi V2 Pro, and it features an identical arrangement of buttons and triggers and joysticks. The two additional features are some added haptics and a 3.5mm audio jack, which is important because the only port on the Edge is a USB-C connector. That said, you do get a microSD card tray that's a very welcome inclusion in a world where expandable storage is becoming a rarity.</p><p>Meanwhile, the exterior of the Edge is rather plain. It's got a plastic body that's a bit bigger and thicker than a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-specs-price-photo-and-video-take-center-stage-140034341.html\"><ins>Galaxy S23 Ultra</ins></a>. Combine that with a boxy frame and some rather large bezels, and you're left with a chunky slate that's not quite a tablet but not quite smartphone-sized either. You also get stereo speakers on each side of the device along with a handful of vents in the back for the internal fans. The other departure compared to a standard handset is that, to better support livestreaming while gaming, there's a 5MP front-facing camera mounted on the long side of the Edge.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Edge features a bright 6.8-inch OLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate and a Snapdragon G3x chip.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/3d48aa40-b9cd-11ed-bb9b-e2164d473c21\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>All told, it's a rather understated device that's focused solely on function over form. Heck, there's not even any RGB lighting, which just seems a bit weird from Razer. That said, one thing I wish the company had included was some kind of fingerprint sensor, because without support for face unlock, being forced to enter a PIN, swipe or password all the time definitely gets a bit tedious. If this thing had an in-screen fingerprint sensor, it would be so easy to move your finger away from the right joystick real quick to unlock it. So how about it Razer, something to consider for the Edge 2?</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>When it's finally time to sit down and game, the Edge is rather easy to set up. The gamepad extends so you can easily fit the Edge inside, and then all you have to do is line up the USB-C port on the right before letting the controller snap back into place. Razer thoughtfully included some small cutouts so the Edge's stereo speakers don't sound muffled and, despite not being anchored in on the left side, the whole setup feels relatively secure. Yeah, there's a little wiggle room if you press hard enough, but I was never worried about things falling apart.</p><figure><img alt=\"Thanks to a recent update, the Razer Edge's Kishi V2 Pro can map virtual touch controls to the gamepad's physical joysticks and buttons. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/14133cc0-b9ce-11ed-bfef-57c992da4581\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>After going through the initial setup, you're greeted by the Android 12 homescreen, which has been tweaked with some green accents and a colorful wallpaper by Razer. From here, you can launch games and services as you'd expect by tapping on their respective icons, but if you want to take full advantage of the Edge, you'll need to tap the button on the gamepad below the right joystick. This summons Razer's Nexus app, which serves as both a launcher for quickly booting into games and as a place to tweak settings for the Edge's controller remapping, livestreaming, and haptics features.</p><p>One of the nice things about the Edge is that when connected to the Kishi V2 Pro, it automatically detects games that feature controller support, so in titles like <em>Diablo: Immortal</em> or <em>Streets of Rage 4, </em>you can just jump right into the action. But perhaps more importantly, thanks to a recent update to the Nexus app, the Kishi V2 Pro can also remap touchscreen controls to the gamepad's physical buttons and joysticks. This makes playing games like <em>Genshin Impact</em> and others that don't have official controller support much more enjoyable, especially if you're like me and prefer physical buttons over virtual ones.</p><figure><img alt=\"To better support all sorts of games, the Raze Edge's Kishi V2 Pro gamepad features two joysticks, a D-pad and an assortment of shoulder and face buttons. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/82072020-b9ce-11ed-9bff-236c433121cd\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>However, activating the Edge\u2019s touchscreen remapping can be a bit tricky at first That's because new owners will need to manually update the Nexus app in the Google Play Store before enabling the virtual controller feature by toggling on an accessibility setting. And even then, I still had to restart the device a couple times before everything started working. It's a good thing this is a one-time process, so after you get it set up, you won't have to do it again for every app.</p><p>When you launch a game, you\u2019ll see a little semicircle icon at the top of the screen. Tap that and you can access a handy menu that allows you to map physical buttons to their respective virtual controls. It's pretty simple and only takes a minute or two depending on the game, and when you exit out, it'll even save your virtual layout so you don't have to redo it next time. However, it's important to mention that this only works when you launch a game via the Nexus launcher. If you tap an icon from the Android homescreen or the app tray, it won't activate.</p><figure><img alt=\"In games like Streets of Rage 4 with native controller support, the Razer Edge will automatically detect that which makes setup extremely easy. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/d24fa570-b9ce-11ed-9fcf-89b58257dcef\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>This can make some titles much more accessible, but it's not a cure-all. Not only is the virtual controller feature still in beta, it doesn't do much to address things like menu buttons that don't line up with a game's virtual controls, which is something I experienced while trying out <em>Mega Man X Dive</em>. That means you'll still need to stretch your fingers over to the screen from time to time. Furthermore, while the virtual controller feature can be very handy, it doesn't do much to enhance traditional mouse and keyboard games. So while technically you can stream <em>Civ 6</em> to the Edge from a nearby computer using the Steam Link app, it's still not a great experience. In the end, I found this made me stick more to standard Android apps or console games from Xbox Game Pass instead of trying to play more complicated PC titles.</p><p>Thankfully, despite its petite dimensions, the Edge's gamepad feels solid. Buttons are nice and clicky while the joysticks are tight and responsive. You even get bonus controls on the shoulders for Mouse 1 and Mouse 2, along with additional buttons for taking screenshots, opening menus or accessing the general Android settings.</p><figure><img alt=\"Connecting the Edge to its included controller is as simple as lining up the USB-C jack on the right and extending the Kishi V2 Pro to fit around the device. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/17eb9f80-b9cf-11ed-b7bb-46075dd175c6\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the Edge's screen, which sports big rounded bezels and an extra-wide 20:9 aspect ratio. The lack of additional vertical screen space can make the Edge feel cramped, especially when trying to use its hilariously squat keyboard. I've made way more typos trying to enter text on the Edge than I do on my phone, and that's saying something because my daily driver is a Z Fold 4 and the keyboard on its exterior Cover Screen is tiny. I really wish Razer had gone with a taller aspect ratio, because that would make pretty much every game look and play better. That is, aside from regular touchscreen apps like <em>Marvel Snap</em>, where the sheer width of the Edge makes it feel awkward in portrait mode. Granted, it\u2019s hard to make both landscape and portrait games play well on a mobile device, but the balance feels off.</p><p>Also, while I appreciate that there's a version with cellular connectivity, the current state of 5G coverage means you don\u2019t often have access to peak speeds. That's OK, because even on 4G, your connection is probably fast enough for most things unless you live way out in the sticks. But when you combine that with the fact that the 5G model costs $200 more and is a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2225d53b-bfe1-4d56-bd6e-3885c642b140&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Verizon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMjI1ZDUzYi1iZmUxLTRkNTYtYmQ2ZS0zODg1YzY0MmIxNDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmVyaXpvbi5jb20vdGFibGV0cy9yYXplci1lZGdlLTVnLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDYxMTk3ZTgtY2M4MC00ODAzLWIzMDEtMDI0NzliYzVhNTQ2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAcef2DzOQnZ8RLhkbCYdKto9DGbflDfBh1ESpH3-J0ND&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Ftablets%2Frazer-edge-5g%2F\"><ins>Verizon exclusive</ins></a>, I feel like the standard Wi-Fi-only model is the better option for most people.</p><h2>Performance</h2><figure><img alt=\"Remapping virtual controls with the Kishi V2 Pro on the Edge can be down by tapping the semicircle icon at the top of the screen in a game. Just make sure you've updated Razer's Nexus app first and enabled its accessibility permission.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/4ce83a90-b9cf-11ed-afee-5186404b4e96\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Now before we talk about performance, I think it's important to sort out the Edge's specs first because there's been a bit of confusion. Initially, both the standard Wi-Fi-only model and the 5G model were listed with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. However, Razer has since clarified that the Wi-Fi version only comes with 6GB of memory while the 5G version gets the full 8GB. Furthermore, while some also thought that the Edge\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-8cx-gen-3-7c-gen-3-arm-chipsets-windows-gaming-handheld-230008247.html\"><ins>Snapdragon G3x chip</ins></a> features an Adreno 730 GPU, it actually has Adreno 660 graphics. This means the Razer Edge may not be quite as powerful as you expected, which sort of carries over to real-world performance.</p><p>In tests like Geekbench 5, the Edge posted a multicore score of 3,410 compared to 4,921 for the new Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. And in 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme test, that gap was even bigger with the Edge hitting 1,424 versus 3,809 for the Samsung. That means you're basically looking at a device with performance similar to a flagship phone from 2022, which isn't bad, but it isn't all that impressive either (though it's way more powerful than the Logitech G Cloud).</p><p>Of course, if you're streaming games from the cloud, local performance isn't nearly as important, and the Edge has more than enough horsepower to ensure titles on GeForce Now and Xbox Live run smoothly and stutter-free. And in Android games like <em>Genshin Impact, </em>I didn't run into any major hiccups either.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><figure><img alt=\"The Razer Edge only features a single USB-C port, though its included gamepad supports a 3.5mm audio jack and pass-through charging via USB-C as well. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/54229ef0-b9ce-11ed-bfff-dd5419584c16\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>As for longevity, the Edge definitely has an advantage compared to beefier handheld PCs. On our local video rundown test, it lasted over 15 hours (15:22). However, when you're gaming, you're looking at more like seven or eight hours depending on the title, and even less if you're using cellular data. But in most situations, that's still significantly more than what you'd get from a Steam Deck (which typically conks out after three or four hours).</p><p>The one quirk with the Edge is that while its controller features passthrough charging via USB-C, juicing it up that way is actually slower than plugging a cable into the slab itself. Using a USB power meter, I found that when connected directly to the Edge using its included 45-watt power brick, charging speeds top out at around 25 watts, but if you use the pass-through charging on the Kishi V2 Pro, things slow down to around 15 watts. Granted, this disparity might not make a huge difference if you're plugging the Edge in overnight, but it can be annoying to have to disassemble the Edge's components when you need to recharge it faster. And if that\u2019s not speedy enough, Razer says the Edge can handle power adapters of up to 65 watts.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt=\"While some may prefer a sturdier all-in-one design like the Logitech G Cloud, thanks to its Snapdragon G3x chip, the Razer Edge offers way better performance. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/99663540-b9cd-11ed-bddf-7941ceb16f30\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engagdet</div></figure><p>OK, let's get back to my original question: Is the Razer Edge something you really need? Starting at $400 for the Wi-Fi model, you get a device with performance similar to one of last year's flagship phones and an included controller add-on, which is actually a pretty good deal. You also get active cooling to help keep thermals in check, while Razer's Nexus app helps you play both touchscreen-only apps and more intensive games from the cloud with ease. Not too bad so far.</p><p>But at the same time, the Edge is basically a chunky phone with an add-on that you can buy on its own for $100. And if you remove the slab from the equation, you even have the option of getting either <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d043077a-4ba1-4321-a933-30b8701d8d31&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Razer&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkMDQzMDc3YS00YmExLTQzMjEtYTkzMy0zMGI4NzAxZDhkMzEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmF6ZXIuY29tL21vYmlsZS1jb250cm9sbGVycy9yYXplci1raXNoaS12Mi1mb3ItYW5kcm9pZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDYxMTk3ZTgtY2M4MC00ODAzLWIzMDEtMDI0NzliYzVhNTQ2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAci9-c3532oYAA8LUowur-XwCNPYEICmfqofg4rJRDoj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-controllers%2Frazer-kishi-v2-for-android\"><ins>Android</ins></a> or <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=d043077a-4ba1-4321-a933-30b8701d8d31&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Razer&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkMDQzMDc3YS00YmExLTQzMjEtYTkzMy0zMGI4NzAxZDhkMzEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmF6ZXIuY29tL21vYmlsZS1jb250cm9sbGVycy9yYXplci1raXNoaS12Mi1mb3ItaXBob25lIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwNjExOTdlOC1jYzgwLTQ4MDMtYjMwMS0wMjQ3OWJjNWE1NDYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV97EMidbhLwiCMrG7loR6FWfJ2wQ2UzTcYK9sOWYU6r&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-controllers%2Frazer-kishi-v2-for-iphone\"><ins>iOS versions</ins></a> of the Kishi V2. So if you've got a relatively recent phone with good performance, you're probably better off doing just that. This way, you get all the perks of having a dedicated gamepad but with the upside of having fewer devices to manage and carry around. Alternatively, you could spend the same $400 on a Steam Deck and get a device that's a bit bigger, but has the power to stream games from the cloud and play AAA games using local hardware.</p><figure><img alt=\"Despite Razer's usual love of RGB lighting, the Edge's matte black design is rather understated. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/70291c10-b9cd-11ed-be7d-db2cbfe2e4b3\" style=\"height: 1200; width: 2000;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>However, if you have an older phone and don't plan on upgrading for a while, the Razer Edge could be a decent device to hold you over until you do. And if you're the kind of person who's constantly on the go and can really take advantage of a speedy cellular connection, the Edge 5G might actually be a good fit for you. Or if you <em>really</em> want a dedicated gaming device that\u2019s not your main phone, the Edge presents an interesting value proposition.</p><p>But as someone who is trying to reduce the number of gadgets in my life, it feels like these situations may be a bit niche. Sure, there are other tasks the Edge can handle pretty well like emulation, but that's sort of an off-label use. And honestly, the Steam Deck is better at that too. And while the popularity of cloud gaming continues to grow, I'm still not convinced that most people need a dedicated device for apps like GeForceNow or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. One of the best things about cloud gaming is that it works on any modern gadget regardless of specs, so while the Edge is a more than passable first attempt, I think there's a fair bit of room for improvement as devices like this continue to evolve.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/razer-edge-review-a-new-breed-of-gaming-handheld-170026147.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/razer-edge-review-a-new-breed-of-gaming-handheld-170026147.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-03 17:00:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "'Metroid Fusion' comes to Switch Online Expansion Pack on March 9th", "description": "<p>One of the Game Boy Advance's better-known games is officially playable on a modern console.

The game also has a more linear, story-driven experience than past titles (there's even a Navigation Room to tell you where to go), and new abilities to climb ladders and grab ledges made you more nimble.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"ff836eb8470c4329860def1ad78e60d6\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>An Expansion Pack membership costs $50 per year.

Wade</em>, limiting access to safe, legal abortion. Now, eight months later, privacy experts say not to let your guard down. Legislative bodies have made little progress on health data security.</p><p>We give up so much data each day that it\u2019s easy to tune out. We blindly accept permissions or turn on location sharing, but that data can also be used by governing bodies to prosecute civilians or by attackers looking to extort individuals. That\u2019s why, when SCOTUS declared access to abortion would no longer be a constitutional right, people began to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/data-privacy-period-tracking-apps-130054404.html\"><ins>scrutinize the amount of private health data they were sending</ins></a> to reproductive-health apps.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>\u201cThe burden is really on consumers to figure out how a company, an app, a website is going to collect and then potentially use and share their data,\u201d Andrew Crawford, senior counsel, privacy and data, at the Center for Democracy and Technology said.</p><p>There aren\u2019t widespread industry standards or federal legislation to protect sensitive data, despite <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ftc-responds-abortion-data-privacy-legal-authorities-030247915.html\"><ins>some increased regulatory action</ins></a> since last year. Even data that isn\u2019t considered personally identifiable or explicitly health related can still put people at risk. Location data, for example, can show if a patient traveled to receive an abortion, possibly putting them at risk of prosecution.</p><p>\u201cCompanies see that as information they can use to make money,\u201d Jen Caltrider, lead at Mozilla\u2019s consumer privacy organization Privacy Not Included, told Engadget. Research released by Caltrider\u2019s team in August <a href=\"https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/in-post-roe-v-wade-era-mozilla-labels-18-of-25-popular-period-and-pregnancy-tracking-tech-with-privacy-not-included-warning/\"><ins>analyzed the security of 25 reproductive-health apps</ins></a>. Eighteen of them earned a privacy warning label for failing to meet privacy standards.</p><p>So, what\u2019s left for users of reproductive-health apps to do? The obvious advice is to carefully read the terms and conditions before signing up in order to better understand what\u2019s happening with their data. If you don\u2019t have a legal degree and an hour to spare, though, there are some basic rules to follow. Turning off data sharing that isn\u2019t necessary to the function of the app, using encrypted chats to talk about reproductive care, signing up for a trustworthy VPN and leaving your phone at home if you\u2019re accessing reproductive health care can all help protect your information, according to Crawford.</p><p>While industry standards are still lacking, increased public scrutiny has led to some improvements. Some reproductive-health apps now store data locally as opposed to on a server, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/flo-period-tracker-app-anonymous-mode-212157123.html\"><ins>collect data anonymously</ins></a> so that it cannot be accessed by law enforcement or base operations in places like Europe that have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/eu-tougher-gdpr-monitoring-big-tech-151519695.html\"><ins>stronger data privacy laws</ins></a>. We spoke with three popular apps that were given warning labels by Privacy Not Included last August to see what\u2019s changed since then.</p><p>Glow\u2019s Eve reproductive-health app introduced an option to store data locally instead of on its server, among other security measures. Glow told Engadget that it doesn't sell data and employees are required to take privacy and security training.</p><p>A similar app, Flo Health, has introduced an anonymous mode and hired a new privacy exec since the report. The company told Engadget that it hopes to expand its anonymous mode features in the future with additions like the ability to stop receiving IP addresses completely.</p><p>Clue, another app that landed on the warning list, adheres to the stricter privacy laws of the European Union known as General Data Protection Regulation, co-CEO Carrie Walter told Engadget. She added that the company will never cooperate with a government authority to use people\u2019s health data against them, and recommended users keep up with updates to its privacy policy for more information.</p><p>But there are no one-and-done solutions. With permissions changing frequently, people that use health apps are also signing up to consistently check their settings.</p><p>\u201cApps change constantly, so keep doing your research, which is a burden to ask consumers,\u201d Caltrider said. \u201cUse anonymous modes, when they're available, store things locally, as much as you can.

While the hearing industry is busy trying to shake off its dowdy medical product image, Eargo\u2019s out there releasing yearly models with ever new features rolling over stereotypes as it does so. This year\u2019s model, the Eargo 7, doesn\u2019t offer a huge leap <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/eargo-6-hearing-aid-030036492.html\">over</a> its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/eargos-latest-smart-hearing-aids-bring-a-much-needed-hearing-test-160001810.html\">predecessors</a>, but like the latest aforementioned phone or rugged camera, it\u2019s still the best model to date. But with continued improvements comes a narrower focus on the areas for improvement.</p><p>Most of these areas are minor software details. For example, the hearing test in the app initially left me unsure whether it had worked properly or not. On my first pass, not all the tones seemed to play (there\u2019s a \u201creplay\u201d button, and pressing that sometimes the tone was unmissable). On a second pass, after speaking with an Eargo representative, I had a more reliable experience, but it was enough to give me some doubt about its efficacy until I was told my results were as expected on both tries.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>After the first test, the app told me to place the hearing aids into their case to update them with the new settings \u2013 at which point it remained stuck on \u201cconnecting\u201d until I restarted it.</p><p>To be clear, the above is the biggest wrinkle I\u2019ve experienced with the Eargo 7, and if anything it\u2019s a testament to the all round experience. One other minor annoyance is that the charging case seems to go into a deep sleep when it\u2019s low on battery, which means it won\u2019t wake the hearing aids when you remove them - even if they themselves have charge. A quick connection to a power cord is all you need to fix, but if you were out and about at the time, you might be out of luck.</p><figure><img alt=\"Three screenshots from the Eargo app.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/28b46320-b848-11ed-bddc-14f7b4322c93\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The above aside, the experience from there on out has been smooth sailing. Eargo positions itself as a more affordable option for \u201cinvisible\u201d hearing aids aimed at those with mild to moderate hearing loss. At $2,650, it might seem expensive compared to other OTC options, but most of the alternatives are not the tiny in-canal (CIC) type. Nor do they always offer other quality of life features like a slick charging case, personalized hearing profiles and other features you typically only find on conventional models your audiologist would supply.</p><p>The Eargo 7 adds a new enhanced version of the company\u2019s \u201cSound Adjust\u201d program that adapts the settings depending on your environment - this is what you need to take the hearing test for. This iteration includes a new \u201cclarity\u201d option which puts a focus on conversation. The new hearing aids are also IPX7 rated meaning you can wear them during a vigorous workout or even in the shower without worrying about damaging them. (They are not marketed as fully waterproof.)</p><p>Eargo\u2019s other selling point is its ongoing customer support. The company urges new users to schedule a \u201cwelcome\u201d call with one of its personal hearing professionals (PHP). There are a total of four ways to speak with a PHP depending on your needs (email, phone, chat, or video call). Scheduling a call is a trivial task in the app and there\u2019s no cost at all.  It\u2019s this combination of modern technology and enhanced user experience that puts Eargo in a fairly unique spot in the growing pile of assistive hearing devices.</p><p>Of course, a well thought out app experience, sleek technology and good customer service are really important parts of the experience, but none of that matters if the hearing assistance isn\u2019t up to scratch. For me, my unilateral hearing loss is certainly helped by the Eargo and there\u2019s very little feedback unless you cover your ear canal completely. If you have mild to moderate hearing loss these are effective, but as always, you should probably consult your audiologist if you\u2019re not sure what you need.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Eargo 7 charger case open on a desk.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/979c7f90-b90e-11ed-bfd5-c5e412a1eae1\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>What I do appreciate is the way the assistive sound doesn\u2019t emphasize sharp noises like jangling keys or enthusiastic typing and the general lack of feedback, which is a common issue for devices of this size. They definitely amplify sound adequately if I wear both, but with that comes a slight discomfort from having augmented hearing even in my \u201cgood\u201d ear, which is a unique problem for unilateral hearing loss that obviously doesn\u2019t apply to those with problems on both sides.</p><p>As before, battery life is plenty enough for all day use and the charging case offers two full re-charges. All day use is pretty comfortable, but for me, the first hour or two I am definitely aware I have something inside my ears before I gradually adapt. In general the built-in rechargeable battery adds to the convenience, though it also means a risk of degrading over time compared to using disposables.</p><p>In short, with the Eargo 7, the company once again makes a good case for how OTC hearing aids don\u2019t have to mean scrimping on features and performance. But with the company\u2019s tech-forward \u201cstart-up\u201d approach do come some small challenges, such as the quirks in the app I mentioned right at the open. Fortunately, these are far easier to address and iron out than poor hardware of inadequate performance, which isn\u2019t an issue here.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/eargo-7-the-tiny-hearing-aids-you-wont-need-to-take-out-to-shower-140000815.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/eargo-7-the-tiny-hearing-aids-you-wont-need-to-take-out-to-shower-140000815.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-03 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget Podcast: The most interesting things from Mobile World Congress 2023", "description": "<p>This week, our hosts are joined by UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith to dive into the most interesting devices that were announced at Mobile World Congress, which has been happening this week in Barcelona.

It was a significant redesign for the tablet, which stayed mostly the same its previous iterations. The fact that it has USB-C for charging and that it works with the second-gen Apple Pencil also means you can use your <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html\">accessories</a> with it if you have already another iPad that supports them.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In addition, we praised the iPad Mini for having a 12-megapixel ultra wide front camera with Center Stage. That allows the camera to automatically zoom and pan to follow you around during video calls, so the person on the other end can still see you while you're moving. Overall, we found the device's performance to be solid and even called it the best small tablet available when it was released in 2021. It's been a while since then, but the device remains a great option even if it's not as powerful as the iPad Air and the iPad Pro.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-ipad-mini-99-off-amazon-124519353.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-ipad-mini-99-off-amazon-124519353.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-03 12:45:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: FDA reportedly denied Neuralink's request to begin human trials of its brain implant", "description": "<p>Neuralink\u2019s efforts to bring a brain-computer interface still have a way to go.

It paused production and sent a stop-shipment order to dealers after a battery issue caused a truck to catch fire in a holding lot on February 4th. It\u2019s unclear what exactly led to the fire or how Ford has resolved the problem, though the company has said there's no indication a charging fault was to blame. Since it initially <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ford-starts-f-150-lightning-production-182232321.html\">started F-150 Lightning production</a> last April, Ford has sold fewer than 20,000 of the EV.

The Paramount+ series is ending after season 5, which according to its official summary, &quot;will find Captain Burnham (Martin-Green) and the crew of the U.S.S. Discovery uncovering a mystery that will send them on an epic adventure across the galaxy to find an ancient power whose very existence has been deliberately hidden for centuries.&quot; According to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/star-trek-discovery-final-season-5-paramount-plus-premiere-date-2024-1235541321/\"><em>Variety</em></a>, Paramount+ is also streaming the fifth season in 2024 as opposed to this year as previously expected.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> marked the first time the franchise has had a Black female lead and has prominently featured LGBTQIA+ characters. It also largely took on a more serialized format, wherein each episode is its own installment in a season's main storyline, unlike other entries in the franchise. That became a point of criticism about the series, however, until the showrunners <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-season-four-episode-six-140053318.html\">changed course</a> and embraced storytelling with an overarching plot in season four.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/star-trek-discovery-season-5-end-1235339464/\"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a> notes, the series currently holds the distinction for being the longest-running drama on Paramount+ so far. Its debut back in 2017 led to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/25/star-trek-discovery-debut-led-to-record-sign-ups-for-cbss-streaming-service/\">record sign-up numbers</a> for the streaming service then known as CBS All Access, and its success paved the way for other Trek shows, including <em>Lower Decks</em> and <em>Prodigy</em>.</p><p>Tanya Giles, chief programming officer at Paramount Streaming, said in a statement: &quot;Star Trek: Discovery is a perennial favorite on the service, near and dear to the hearts of legions of \u2018Star Trek\u2019 fans as well as all of us here at Paramount+. The series and its incredible cast and creatives ushered in a new era for Star Trek when it debuted over six years ago, embracing the future of streaming with serialized storytelling, bringing to life deep and complex characters that honor Gene Roddenberry\u2019s legacy of representing diversity and inclusion, and pushing the envelope with award-winning world-building. This final season will see our beloved crew take on a new adventure and we can't wait to celebrate the series\u2019 impact on the franchise leading up to its final season early next year.&quot;</p><p>At the moment, Trek fans can watch<em> Star Trek: Picard</em>, which is streaming on Paramount+. Its third season will also be its last, but there are rumors going around that the service is developing spinoffs centering on characters from the show.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-ending-season-5-next-year-070320271.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-ending-season-5-next-year-070320271.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-03 07:03:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
