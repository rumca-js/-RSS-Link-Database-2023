  <p id="w0u05S">Mark Zuckerberg has announced that the Meta Quest Pro, the company’s mixed and virtual reality headset focused on business users, will be getting a substantial price cut, going from $1,499.99 to $999.99. Likewise, the 256GB version of the Quest 2 will be going from $499.99 to $429.99.</p>
<p id="mDrM8u">Meta says its goal is to “create hardware that’s affordable for as many people as possible” and that it’s lowering the Pro’s price to make its tech “available to even more businesses and professionals around the world.” </p>
<p id="wVYBJS">According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23619730/meta-vr-oculus-ar-glasses-smartwatch-plans">the company’s hardware roadmap</a>, which was published by <em>The Verge </em>earlier this week, it doesn’t seem like the high-end VR headset is getting a follow-up for at least a few years.

  <p id="UTzN0S">Last September, the world watched in delight as NASA <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/26/23372818/nasa-dart-crash-asteroid-redirect">deliberately crashed a spacecraft</a> into an asteroid in a test of planetary defense. The idea of the DART mission was to see whether an impact from a spacecraft could change the trajectory of an incoming asteroid in case such a looming disaster ever threatened the Earth. </p>
<p id="DvVIWw">The impact and its aftermath were observed by telescopes all across the planet and by several in space, including the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes, and preliminary data showed that the test had been successful in changing the orbit of this asteroid. Then scientists got to work analyzing all the data they had collected for more insights.</p>

Well, an investigation team led by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05810-5">released a paper</a> confirming that the successful Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission wasn’t just for fun; it proves that humanity can deflect asteroids and also actually save the planet.</p>
<p id="0zZarF">NASA outlined the conclusion in <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-dart-data-validates-kinetic-impact-as-planetary-defense-method">a new blog post</a> on Wednesday, explaining that the “kinetic impactor” technique, which APL writer Ajai Raj jokingly defines as “smashing a thing into another thing,” could indeed be used as an effective means of planetary defense.</p>
