After having delivered two excellent Soulslike action RPGs in the Nioh games, Team Ninja is back with another one that has a different flavour to it- if Nioh was their Dark Souls, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is their Sekiro. And yes, that means it's an even more challenging game than the studio's last two efforts. 

Mechanically, it's a dense game with a lot going on, so here, we're going to go over a few basic pointers that you should keep in mind as you dive into its offerings.

There is also a massive focus on loot and gear, which creates a problem that was also present in Nioh- equipment management. Inventory screens are just a jumble of numbers and minor percentages that don’t really affect gameplay that much from what I could tell, and only serves to confuse and overwhelm. If you like micromanaging stats down to the smallest percentage, you’ll love it, but I opted to pick the largest numbers and dump everything else.

Ultimately, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a fun Soulslike that, while still providing a challenge, will be a breeze for seasoned Soulslike players
