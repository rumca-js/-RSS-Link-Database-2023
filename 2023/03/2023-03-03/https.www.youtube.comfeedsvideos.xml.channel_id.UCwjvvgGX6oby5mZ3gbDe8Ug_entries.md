Fan Bingbing, one of China's biggest film stars, appeared on the red carpet at the Berlinale on Feb. 23rd, 2023. Itâ€™s seen as her official comeback after being out of the public eye for some time. 5 years ago, Fan was involved in a tax evasion scandal. She was classified as a "bad artist" by Chinese authorities and shut down. At the Berlinale, Fan wore a white cheongsam-style dress with a lotus flower pattern on it. She attracted a lot of limelight, and Chinese fans were thrilled by her appearance.
