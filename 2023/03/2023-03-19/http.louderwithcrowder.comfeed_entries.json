Specifically, rectal ozone therapy. Which no one wanted or needed to know about. Ever. </p><p>But viewers of that interview were also concerned with Paltrow's self-described diet. She explained she does intermittent fasting, breaking her fast around noon. She has coffee in the morning, bone broth for lunch,  and lots of vegetables for dinner. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">None</div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/urbanmodernism/status/1635706462902075393\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't know about you, but this diet would leave me seriously hangry. I actually also do intermittent fasting, but I eat waaayyy more than bone broth and vegetables. That just sounds sad. </p><p>After facing widespread criticism, Gwyneth made a video defending her dietary choices. She said she's trying to treat her \"long Covid\". With bone broth. Now, I'm no doctor, but that seems like it <em>may</em> not work. </p><p><em>\"So I\u2019ve been working with Dr. Cole to really focus on foods that aren\u2019t inflammatory ... so lots of vegetables, cooked vegetables, all kinds of protein, healthy carbs to really lower inflammation and it\u2019s been working really well. This is, you know, based on my medical results and extensive testing that I\u2019ve done over time.\" </em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">None</div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1636843001040326657\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She also clarified that she doesn't eat this way everyday, and that her diet shouldn't be an example for anyone else to follow: <em>\"I eat full meals. I also have days where I eat whatever I want, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mcdonalds-employee-murdered-french-fries\" target=\"_blank\">French fries</a> or whatever. My baseline has been to try to eat healthy and try to eat foods that really calm the system down.\"</em></p><p>I hope she's telling the truth. A diet of broth and veggies is enough to make anyone feel constantly ill. And sad. But she could just be trying to quell the criticism by claiming she eats french fries. </p><p>What would be <em>more</em> interesting is an explainer on the ozone rectal therapy. I know I said that was TMI, but once you put something like that out there, you gotta expect some questions from the public. </p><p><p>\n<i>\n<strong>Editor's Note:</strong>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>It\u2019s official.

It's actually one of the worst sins that plagues mankind. Lucifer 's pride led to him being cast into Hell for all of eternity. On top of that, the whole movement is centered around one of the acts that got Sodom and Gomorrah served up extra crispy. </p><p>In other words, the reason for Reimer's protest is not because he's a meanie head who hates gay people. The problem is the public endorsement and celebration of sinful acts.
