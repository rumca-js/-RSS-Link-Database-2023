Dead by Daylight Mobile, the 4v1 horror action asymmetrical multiplayer game, has launched a massive update including graphical upgrades, new features, and new content. The Sadako Rising Collaboration event is also part of the update to Dead by Daylight Mobile that brings the vengeful ghost from the Ringu novel and movie franchise to the game. Sadako is the spirit who can strike down anyone who watches a cursed VHS tape by teleporting through TVs that appear on the map, allowing her to get the drop on any Survivors that dare enter her range of influence and destroy them with her supernatural abilities. Yoichi Asakawa, another character from Ringu, is also added to the game as a new Survivor along with limited-time crossover outfits. The Sadako Rising Collaboration Event for Dead by Daylight Mobile runs from March 15 - March 28 on iOS and Android.
