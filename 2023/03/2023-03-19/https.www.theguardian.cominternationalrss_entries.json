Pavlo Kyrylenko said a park had been targeted and \u201ca dozen residential buildings\u201d damaged. Agence France-Presse reporters heard about 10 explosions go off nearly simultaneously and said they saw a woman die at the scene from her wounds. Soon after, another round of explosions was heard in a neighbourhood 2km away.</p><p><strong>Russia launched a series of attacks on Friday, according to the Ukrainian armed forces. </strong>Seven homes in the village of Veletenske in the Kherson region were destroyed and a nursery was damaged on Friday, but no one was injured, it said. The update, which the Guardian has not verified, also said 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones had been shot down, and that Ukrainian forces had \u201crepelled more than 100 enemy attacks\u201d.</p><p><strong>Ukraine said some of the overnight drone attacks hit the relatively peaceful western region of Lviv.</strong> Dnipro was also targeted, as was Kyiv, where air defences shot down all attacking drones. Ukraine\u2019s air force said 11 out of 16 drones were destroyed.</p><p><strong>The Black Sea grain deal was renewed, according to parties to the agreement.</strong> Turkey and the UN announced the initiative was extended, but did not say for how long. A spokesperson for Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it had notified other parties that the deal was extended for 60 days, while a Ukrainian minister said the deal was extended for 120 days.</p><p><strong>Another 880 Russian soldiers were reportedly killed on Friday, according to unverified totals published by the Ukrainian army. </strong>Its general staff said that it meant more than 164,000 Russian service personnel had been killed since the outbreak of war in February last year. Another five tanks, seven armoured combat vehicles and eight artillery systems were disabled by Ukrainian forces, it said in an update posted on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group plans to recruit about 30,000 new fighters by the middle of May, its founder has said. </strong>In an audio message on Telegram on Saturday, Yevgeny Prigozhin said that Wagner recruitment centres, which he said last week had opened in 42 Russian cities, were hiring an average of 500-800 people a day.</p><p><strong>Russia would probably introduce wider conscription to boost its military requirements, the UK Ministry of Defence said. </strong>In its latest intelligence update, it said Russian Duma deputies introduced a bill to change the conscription age for men from the current 18-27 to 21-30. The law would probably be passed, it said, and come into force in January 2024.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-visits-mariupol-in-first-trip-to-occupied-eastern-ukraine\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-visits-mariupol-in-first-trip-to-occupied-eastern-ukraine", "date_published": "2023-03-19 06:59:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Turner\u2019s slam lifts USA over Venezuela into World Baseball Classic last four", "description": "<ul><li>Turner hits go-ahead grand slam to lift USA into semi-finals</li><li>United States will face Cuba on Sunday for spot in final</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/mar/18/united-states-v-venezuela-world-baseball-classic-quarter-finals-live\">USA 9-7 Venezuela: WBC quarter-finals \u2013 as it happened</a></li></ul><p>Trea Turner hit a go-ahead grand slam in the eighth inning that lifted the United States over Venezuela 9-7 Saturday night and into the World Baseball Classic semi-finals.</p><p>The defending champion Team USA will face Cuba on Sunday night for a spot in the WBC championship.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/19/world-baseball-classic-usa-venezuela-trea-turner\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/19/world-baseball-classic-usa-venezuela-trea-turner", "date_published": "2023-03-19 04:12:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
