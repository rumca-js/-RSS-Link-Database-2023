Starting on March 20th, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/17/23605073/twitter-blue-charge-sms-2fa\">Twitter will place its text message-based 2FA behind</a> its $8 per month Blue paywall.</p>\n<p id=\"B95uH3\">As part of this change, Twitter will also <em>turn off 2FA</em> for your account completely if you don\u2019t switch away from SMS verification or pay for Blue before that deadline, leaving your account vulnerable to hacking. Fortunately, you can still enable 2FA for free using an authenticator app, like Google Authenticator or Authy. You can also use a security key, but this requires the purchase of an actual piece of hardware.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"fWLuvT\"><div></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"84B3Nu\">Twitter\u2019s making SMS 2FA a paid feature because it\u2019s the least secure form of authentication....</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/19/23647399/switch-away-twitter-sms-2fa-reminder\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/19/23647399/switch-away-twitter-sms-2fa-reminder", "date_published": "2023-03-19 19:55:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "title": "Google Pixel exploit reverses edited parts of screenshots", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"Google Pixel 7 home screen\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXUcOqQ4OmL9003fVJ4BhH3gRL0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72091833/226337_Pixel_7_and_7_Pro_AKrales_0110.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"BWYXD5\">A security flaw affecting the Google Pixel\u2019s default screenshot editing utility, Markup, allows images to become partially \u201cunedited,\u201d potentially revealing the personal information users chose to hide, as <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/03/18/pixel-markup-screenshot-vulnerability/\">spotted earlier by <em>9to5Google</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/android-pixel-markup-exploit-discord-acropalypse/\"><em>Android Police</em></a>.
