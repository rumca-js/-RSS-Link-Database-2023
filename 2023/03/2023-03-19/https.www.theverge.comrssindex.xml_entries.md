  <p id="xbLgS7">If you haven’t switched away from Twitter’s SMS two-factor authentication (2FA) method yet, today’s the last day to do it. Starting on March 20th, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/17/23605073/twitter-blue-charge-sms-2fa">Twitter will place its text message-based 2FA behind</a> its $8 per month Blue paywall.</p>
<p id="B95uH3">As part of this change, Twitter will also <em>turn off 2FA</em> for your account completely if you don’t switch away from SMS verification or pay for Blue before that deadline, leaving your account vulnerable to hacking. Fortunately, you can still enable 2FA for free using an authenticator app, like Google Authenticator or Authy. You can also use a security key, but this requires the purchase of an actual piece of hardware.</p>

  <p id="BWYXD5">A security flaw affecting the Google Pixel’s default screenshot editing utility, Markup, allows images to become partially “unedited,” potentially revealing the personal information users chose to hide, as <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/03/18/pixel-markup-screenshot-vulnerability/">spotted earlier by <em>9to5Google</em></a> and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-pixel-markup-exploit-discord-acropalypse/"><em>Android Police</em></a>. The vulnerability, which was <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsSimonTime/status/1636857478263750656?s=20">discovered by reverse engineers</a> Simon Aaarons and David Buchanan, has since been patched by Google but still has widespread implications for the edited screenshots shared prior to the update.</p>
<p id="2E5I3W">As detailed in <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsSimonTime/status/1636857478263750656?s=20">a thread Aaarons posted on Twitter</a>, the aptly-named “aCropalypse” flaw makes it possible for someone to partially recover PNG screenshots edited in Markup. That includes scenarios where someone may have used the tool to crop or scribble out their name,...</p>
