<ul><li>Epic tiebreak puts Kazakh on way to win 7-6 (11), 6-4 </li><li>Rybakina beats world’s top two players in tournament</li></ul><p>Even after finally breaking through at the top of the sport by winning Wimbledon last summer, Elena Rybakina’s path remained complicated. Her ranking was still low, she faced tough draws and dispiriting court assignments all while trying to come to terms with her new status as a grand slam champion. She struggled to perform.</p><p>This season, though, everything is coming together. On Sunday, Rybakina bolstered her status as one of the very best players in the world by winning her first WTA 1000 title in Indian Wells. Two days after she dismantled Iga Swiatek, the world No 1 and defending champion, Rybakina remained composed in the face of suffocating pressure to overcome Aryna Sabalenka 7-6 (11), 6-4.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/19/elena-rybakina-confirms-rise-by-beating-aryna-sabalenka-to-win-indian-wells">Continue reading...</a>

## Barça 12 points clear in title race after Kessié’s late winner against Real Madrid

<p>After 26 matches and 91 minutes of nerves and tension, a swipe of Franck Kessié’s boot virtually delivered the league for Barcelona. Barcelona had been hit by what appeared to be a late Marco Asensio winner that would have reopened the title race only to witness it get ruled out by VAR and the tightest of offsides. Then they had resisted, and now they were virtually champions. One last run, a Robert Lewandowski backheel and a delivery from Alejandro Balde left Kessié there to finish the move the match and probably the season.</p><p>As the ball hit the net, it gave Barcelona a 2-1 win in the <em>clásico</em> and took them 12 points clear at the top of the table with 12 games to go. They had suffered, they had been exposed, and they had felt the tension grow until the very end, but they had held on to eventually clinch a vital victory, this place erupting at the end of an enjoyable encounter, one that felt like a different world to the last time these two great rivals had met, shouts of celebration echoing around the passageways of this enormous stadium.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/19/barcelona-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Even as Ireland’s players, coaches and supporters celebrated a famous achievement on Saturday night, though, they were already raising their eyes to the horizon and asking if something brighter might yet materialise.</p><p>Only Clive Woodward’s England have previously stood where Ireland do now: the official grandmasters of Europe and the planet’s No 1 team six months out from a World Cup.

<p>More than five years after hundreds of thousands fled Myanmar, conditions in Bangladesh are deteriorating</p><p>The hungry and desperate are now much more so. Last month, the rations to Rohingya living in the world’s largest refugee camp – Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/feb/17/un-warns-of-unconscionable-cuts-to-rohingya-food-rations-as-donations-fall" title="">were slashed</a>. Another drastic cut is due next month. This is, as a UN expert <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/03/1134052" title="">warned</a>, a matter of life and death. The Rohingya have lived on a knife edge for too long.</p><p>Their suffering made global headlines in 2017, when the Myanmar military, supported by militias, launched a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/06/who-are-the-rohingya-and-what-is-happening-in-myanmar" title="">murderous campaign</a> that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/14/6700-rohingya-muslims-killed-in-attacks-in-myanmar-says-medecins-sans-frontieres" title="">took thousands of lives</a>, forced 700,000 to flee Rakhine state for Bangladesh and was <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/08/un-expert-calls-action-against-myanmar-military-anniversary-atrocities" title="">described</a> by a UN human rights expert as genocide. In the last two years, what little attention has been paid to Myanmar has focused on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/19/myanmar-coup-2021-explained-in-30-seconds" title="">military’s coup</a> and attempts to crush civilian resistance. But the suffering of the Rohingya began decades ago and continues to this day, even outside Rakhine state. Many had fled before, returning (not always by choice) when they were assured it was safe. It was not. They experienced discrimination and repression, military operations, pogroms and the stripping of their citizenship.

<p>Labour voters in Conservative-held commuter belt seats should respond positively to Sir Ed Davey’s overtures</p><p>In last year’s local elections the Liberal Democrats chalked up one of the party’s best <a href="https://www.lgcplus.com/politics/governance-and-structure/where-the-lib-dems-are-regaining-ground-16-11-2022/" title="">performances</a> since it entered into an alliance with the Tories in 2010. With no sign of the disaffection in the current government evaporating, Sir Ed Davey’s party is assured of more electoral gains. One might be tempted to think that the Conservatives could swat away the Lib Dem challenge, which rests on 14 MPs in the Commons. However, the yellow tide’s rise in May’s elections would be troubling confirmation for the Conservative party that voter alienation is driving an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20419058221108774a?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.1" title="">electoral realignment</a>.</p><p>What has alarm bells ringing in Tory headquarters is evidence that people are willing to vote tactically for the candidate best placed locally to defeat the Tories. Last summer, pollsters predicted <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/07/01/conservatives-set-lose-26-their-64-lib-dem-battleg" title="">26 Conservative constituencies</a> in the so-called “blue wall” of southern England could fall to the Lib Dems. A year before, a Lib Dem triumph in Chesham and Amersham – Conservative since its creation in 1974– had come when the Tories were riding high in the polls. Since then the Conservatives have cratered.

<p>Farrell’s side were brutally efficient in their grand slam triumph, but resurgent France are ticking along nicely in the background</p><p>A James Ryan knock-on away from the perfect tournament. Five wins, each by a margin of 10 points or more, demonstrates just how dominant Andy Farrell’s side have been. Immediately after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/18/ireland-england-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report">victory over England cemented their fourth ever grand slam</a> – and first to be won at home – they were looking towards the World Cup with confidence, embracing the expectation that has traditionally laid heavy. This is not a criticism but there is something brutally mechanical about Ireland. A system working with maximum efficiency, no wastage, with everything and everyone in unison. There is strength in depth too – burnished on the five-game tour of New Zealand last summer – and though their route is daunting they have every right to head to the World Cup final as favourites. But, while it is a truism, they will need a slice of luck with Johnny Sexton’s fitness if they are to become only the second side from the northern hemisphere to be crowned world champions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/19/six-nations-review-rugby-union-ireland-france-scotland-england-wales-italy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The impact the policy will have across the world can’t be ignored, says <strong>Oliver Lough</strong>.

But it is also important to look beyond domestic concerns. At a time when displacement across borders due to war, climate breakdown and economic collapse are becoming increasingly common, Britain risks joining a growing list of privileged countries whose actions threaten to undermine the basic right to seek asylum from persecution. Already, the US is turning away refugees at its southern border, and the militarisation and criminalisation of asylum in the Mediterranean is well entrenched.</p><p>Countries adjacent to crises are the primary hosts of most of the world’s refugees. They are not blind to the hypocrisy of wealthy nations, which insist that refugees be supported and protected “over there” while relying on hostile and legally dubious solutions to prevent them coming “over here”. If the world’s richest countries are prepared to undermine its norms, the international refugee protection regime risks descending into a free-for-all, where each country will act as it sees fit – denial of refugee status, detention, violent pushbacks and forced repatriation – with the rights and needs of vulnerable people relegated to an absolute last priority.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/19/cruel-tory-migration-bill-will-erode-basic-right-to-seek-asylum">Continue reading...</a>

## Bukayo Saka runs the show as Arsenal cruise past rudderless Crystal Palace

<p>Crystal Palace may have arrived at the Emirates without a manager and winless in 2023, but Arsenal had good reason to be wary. When they faced Everton last month – also on a long winless run and heading into their first game after Frank Lampard’s sacking – few foresaw the relegation contenders claiming a precious win. Everton were better set than Palace, however: Lampard’s successor, Sean Dyche, was already in place. Patrick Vieira’s time at Palace <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/17/crystal-palace-sack-patrick-vieira-as-manager">came to an abrupt end</a> on Friday morning, giving Paddy McCarthy, drafted in from his role as under-21s coach, a little over 48 hours to salvage a game plan from the wreckage. A task that proved too great as they were soundly beaten 4-1.</p><p>From the start Arsenal looked determined to stop their opponents’ disrupted preparations from coming together. Amid a thick grey fog drifting from the away end, where flares and smoke bombs greeted the first whistle, the hosts’ rhythmic pressing game clicked into gear immediately, Leandro Trossard smothering the first attempted pass of the game in a sign of things to come. Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka probed the flanks, the former threading through Trossard who failed to tempt Stuart Attwell, the referee, into awarding an early penalty after going down in a tangle. The visitors struggled to get on the ball, chasing shadows in the acrid haze.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/19/arsenal-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Gaelic speaker is liked on her home turf, but SNP members are wrestling with the same issues as others across Scotland</p><p>Pamela MacKenzie presides over an enviable array of fillings at Batty’s Baps sandwich bar on Dingwall high street. “Kate Forbes has been very good for the area,” she says. “We always get forgotten in the Highlands, even in the weather reports, but she gets things done.”</p><p>Winter is not yet done with the north of Scotland and the pavements are edged with chunks of unmelted snow. But the warmth that locals feel towards their MSP, who represents the vast Holyrood constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, and is now a frontrunner to succeed Nicola Sturgeon as leader of the Scottish National party, is palpable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/19/kate-forbes-must-convert-warmth-into-votes-in-the-highlands">Continue reading...</a>

## Handing down the family secrets – one dish at a time

<p>We can trace the course of our lives through the recipes we collect along the way, passed through generations or shared between friends</p><p>There are two types of cooks in this world: those who keep their recipes secret, and those who share with joyful abandon. As someone who falls strongly into the latter camp, I am fascinated by the people who manage to maintain an air of mystery around their culinary creations. They breeze into a potluck supper with their signature dish, the one that everyone eagerly anticipates because nobody else knows how to make it. When a guest asks how the sauce is so wonderfully light, they simply answer with a smile.</p><p>I wonder what motivates some to divulge their recipes while others prefer not to. Perhaps it’s a difference in the idea of “ownership” – do recipes belong to anyone, can they be plagiarised, stolen even? Or are we merely stewards, just one stop in a recipe’s long trajectory? For those with closely guarded family recipes, they are more than just a set of instructions: they are inherited fragments of family history. Being part of a select club who know the key ingredient for Grandpa’s lasagne, or the exact proportions for Aunty’s biryani can even strengthen familial bonds. Recipes become an edible continuation of heritage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/19/passing-on-the-family-secrets-one-dish-at-a-time-friends-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Daylight helps to regulate hormones and the immune system. It’s good for sleep and can help with depression. So be glad of the extra daylight when the clocks go forward</p><p>If we took away the walls, the ceilings, the street lights, the screens and allowed our senses to guide us, we might rise with the sun and sleep when it sets. Artificial lighting and blackout blinds allow us to choose our waking hours – but is it good for us to stay up late under the glow of electric bulbs then sleep in late? On Sunday 26 March the clocks spring forward as we switch to British summer time. Here’s why we should make the most of the extra daylight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/mar/19/spring-forward-why-you-should-make-the-most-of-the-extra-daylight-clocks-go-forward">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Do you get the creeping dread at the end of the weekend? It’s time to build some healthy boundaries</p><p>A few years ago, I was in the kitchen of a friend’s house preparing for a meal. When we sat down to eat, my friend’s wife wolfed down her supper and then disappeared into another room to do some work. He smiled and said: “Sunday nights are the new Monday mornings around here.”</p><p>I was surprised at the time. Now, a few years later, I find myself behaving in exactly the same way. Sunday night has become work time. When I open up my calendar on Sunday evening, a subtle sense of dread comes over me. I feel as if I am behind before the week has even begun.

<p>The novelist’s afterlife of St Cuthbert spans centuries and volumes, making for a vibrant alternative history of the region</p><p>Born in the seventh century, Cuthbert of Lindisfarne is the unofficial patron saint of the north, where he’s still known as Cuddy. He began life as a lowly boy shepherd and ended it as a famed religious hermit, holed up on a rocky island off the Northumbrian coast. When Viking raiders arrived, Cuthbert’s body was taken to the mainland by a band of loyal monks, generations of whom traipsed around with it while battles raged until a sign from God (or simple fatigue) told them to stop on a hilltop. There, the settlement that would become Durham sprang up, eventually followed by the towering Norman cathedral that houses his shrine.</p><p>In the hands of local novelist <a href="https://www.benjaminmyerswriter.com/">Benjamin Myers</a>, the afterlife of St Cuthbert’s legend – and indeed of his mortal remains, which for centuries were said to have remained intact – forms the backbone of a hulking, multi-volume novel. It makes room for poetry and reams of quotations from diverse sources, as well as prose that adopts the viewpoints of stonemasons and brewers, cooks and academics, making for a vibrant alternative history of the region.</p><p><em>Cuddy</em> by Benjamin Myers is published by Bloomsbury (£20).

<p>(Arista)<br />The New Yorker ranges from glossy melancholy to vicious rap in an uninhibited display of her chameleonic talent</p><p>“I wrote you this album for my closure” is pretty on the nose as refrains on breakup records go – but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/26/princess-nokia-rock-and-roll-is-my-soul-its-how-i-dress-how-i-have-sex-how-i-eat">Princess Nokia</a> has never shied away from being heart-on-sleeve. In the decade or so of her career, the Puerto Rican, New York City rapper-singer (real name Destiny Frasqueri) has shapeshifted sonically many times over, flitting between everything from pared-down east coast MC inflections to melodic emo to boisterous, cartoonish pop. What has tied it all together is Frasqueri’s self-assurance, even while showing her vulnerability.</p><p>This latest EP is no different: described on her social media as “a 7 song love letter to myself”, this unguarded set runs the gamut of genres and feelings. There are sped-up, Auto-Tuned vocals that recall the early 00s, be that on the skittering pop-punk of Closure or the colourful electro-pop rave of Complicated. There’s the stunning, glossy melancholy of Lo Siento; the vicious rap of Angels &amp; Demons; the warmth of Gorillaz-interpolating Happy. All threaded together with classic hip-hop-format voicemails of (presumably) her ex checking in while she ignores him, this uninhibited, borderline chaotic EP is testament to Frasqueri’s talent, ambition and willingness to share the quickfire rawness of her emotion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/19/princess-nokia-i-love-you-but-this-is-goodbye-review-raw-quickfire-breakup-album">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A hymn of limbs and lungs, a game of pure vibes and pure desire, an FA Cup quarter-final epic to stand the test of time. And at its very climax: a swing of a leg, a ripple of the Bramall Lane net, and a noise that will power Sheffield United all the way to Wembley. It was Tommy Doyle’s 25-yard goal in the first minute of injury time that proved the difference against a daring but distraught Blackburn Rovers, a club who were just 10 minutes away from their blessed moment of triumph.</p><p>The bare contours of this game offer just a fraction of the story. United started brightly. Blackburn went ahead against the run of play. United equalised fortuitously. Blackburn again went ahead against the run of play. United equalised through Oli McBurnie with nine minutes remaining. But the common thread running throughout was a full-blooded commitment, a four-sided assault on the senses, Yorkshire against Lancashire, a spectacle as gripping as a good film and as loud as a war.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/19/sheffield-united-blackburn-fa-cup-quarter-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

In his new book, Poverty, By America, he offers solutions</p><p>At the time of the election of Donald Trump in 2016, there was a lot of soul-searching among liberal American journalists over their failure to closely report and reflect the lives of those “left behind” citizens in the “rust-belt” states, the places that gave Trump victory. One book that came out that year, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/12/americas-eviction-epidemic-matthew-desmond-housing-crisis">Evicted</a>,</em> by Matthew Desmond, a professor at Princeton, was an unforgettable example of the kind of reporting that had been neglected.</p><p>For two years, beginning in 2008, Desmond had lived among the people at the very harshest end of American society. He took up residence first in a trailer park, and then in the poorest quarter of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In befriending families unable to pay their bills, who had desperately moved from one home to another, and also the landlords who profited from them and turned them out on to the street, he presented a series of vivid, heartbreaking portraits of people drowning in a system loaded against the most vulnerable. His conclusion back then was a stark one: not only that the constant threat and reality of eviction was the number one factor in perpetuating destitution, but also that there were many people making a lot of money from keeping other people in that traumatic, impoverished state.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/19/matthew-desmond-the-poverty-rate-in-america-and-the-uk-should-be-zero-and-i-think-we-can-get-there">Continue reading...</a>

As he prepares for his first retrospective, he talks to Eva Wiseman about 20 years of fighting gloom with glitter<p>Is the sequin perhaps the most glamorous product of evolutionary biology? Psychologists say humans are drawn to things that sparkle because once our ancestors searched for light reflecting on rivers in their search for water. Now we search for sparkle elsewhere – a diamond ring, a disco ball – and find new meaning in it beyond survival. Like glamour, or value, or – in the case of Ashish Gupta, a fashion designer renowned for his artistry with sequins – freedom.</p><p>This month sees Ashish’s first retrospective, showcasing 20 years of his label’s hand-embroidered sequined clothes, like the dressing gown in zardozi, a south Asian embroidery method using gold thread, and the pink T-shirt with the slogan “Fall in love and be more tender”, and sparkling pieces worn by stars such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce" title="">Beyoncé</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna" title="">Rihanna</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/debbie-harry" title="">Debbie Harry</a>. Walking into his London home feels like stepping backstage – he’s replaced his front-door panels with red glass, so we stand bathed for a calm minute in dark light. He designed the kitchen countertops to house huge planters, and lush trees grow up towards the glass roof. There are stone busts, Indian glass paintings and piles of books, but not a single sequin. They’re all, presumably, on the work currently being hung at the <a href="https://wmgallery.org.uk/" title="">William Morris Gallery</a> in east London. “The curator said,” Gupta grins, “‘This is really interesting for me, because it’s the first time I’ve ever worked with a living artist.’ And I said, ‘Well, we’ve still got three months, you never know what might happen!’” Revisiting his archive at the age of 47 has been a strange experience, “a little bit surreal, actually. You kind of time travel. In some ways it feels as if a lifetime has gone by quite quickly.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/19/my-designs-create-joy-and-im-grateful-for-that-ashish-gupta-fashion-sequins">Continue reading...</a>

The hosts had gone 63 home Cup games without defeat, a run that went back to November 1974, so few at Anfield expected anything other than a 64th in the ground’s first ever Sunday game, Everton having been drawn at Goodison and played on the Saturday. Appetites must, though, have been whetted by the prospect of Graeme Souness and Jimmy Case reconvening for some real football men action.</p><p>In the event, though, Brighton won 2-1. Gerry Ryan put them in front, and though Craig Johnston then equalised, Case rammed home a terrific winner a minute later – after which Phil Neil missed a penalty – before the Seagulls binned Norwich and Wednesday to make the final.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/mar/19/brighton-grimsby-fa-cup-quarter-final-semi-final-draw-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Columbia)<br />Andy Fletcher’s two surviving bandmates reflect on mortality on an album of warm, weird electro-pop</p><p>A<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/27/andy-fletcher-obituary">ndy Fletcher’s death</a> could’ve ended Depeche Mode. In Fletch’s 42-year tenure, curtailed last May, the Basildon band never made a truly bad album, rarely stooped to covers or re-records. The music gently declined in quality over the decades, but their tours grew bigger and better. Their final album would’ve been 2017’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/19/depeche-mode-spirit-album-review-kitty-empire">Spirit</a></em>, a decent tilt at reinventing the grand claustrophobia of 1987 masterpiece <em>Music for the Masses</em>. A solid legacy. Instead, surviving bandmates <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/24/depeche-mode-dave-gahan-martin-gore-interview-memento-mori">Martin Gore and Dave Gahan</a> have assembled <em>Memento Mori</em>, an elegant farewell for Fletch.</p><p>Gore’s say-what-you-see lyrics are always best on the essentials of life – sex and death – and Ghosts Again is the pair’s best single in aeons, a singalong meditation on mortality that’s concise and powerful. Both are in fine voice. Gore’s choirboy trills have never been richer than on Soul With Me, while Gahan ranges ever-restlessly from operatic to reptilian, the electro-pop Freddie Mercury. There’s warmth in the album’s fusion of industrial grind with delicate melody, and producer James Ford sparks a revivifying weirdness in songs such as My Cosmos Is Mine. For a record preoccupied by death, its big heart bursts with life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/19/depeche-mode-memento-mori-review-a-life-affirming-farewell-for-fletch-andy-fletcher">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The classicist on life on the culture wars’ frontline, what she owes her mother – and how pizza shaped her TV career</p><p>Professor Mary Beard associates the restaurant Moro, in London’s Clerkenwell, with afternoons of flowing wine and pats on the back. It’s where her publisher takes her to celebrate when she has delivered a book manuscript. She’s nearing such a deadline when we meet there – just finalising the endnotes to her new title about Roman emperors, a companion volume to <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/18/spqr-by-mary-beard-review-rome">SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome</a></em>, her bestselling account of the empire’s rise and fall – so she carries a bit of that demob spirit with her. She orders a glass of her favourite Basque spritz wine, txiki blanco, and a plate of Iberian pork, and settles back on a cushioned window seat into the lunchtime clatter of conversation.</p><p>At 68, Beard has lately taken compulsory retirement from 40 years of teaching classics to undergraduates at her Cambridge college; now she is concentrating full time on illuminating the ancient world for the rest of us. In the days before we meet, I’ve been catching up on her required-reading blog, <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/categories/regular-features/mary-beard-a-dons-life/" title="">A Don’s Life</a>. In it she uses the example of Marcus Licinius Crassus, one of the despised super-rich of the first century BC, to examine Nadhim Zahawi’s shocking tax affairs; she has compared the response to a devastating earthquake on the Turkish/Syrian borders 2,000 years ago – the emperor Trajan ploughed central funds into improved rebuilding schemes – with the planning failures of the recent disaster; and she has examined the Scottish prisons controversy in light of Roman attitudes to incarceration. In a world defined by what she calls “presentism”, a blinkered obsession with the here and now, Beard offers a spirited, repeated reminder that there is nothing new under the sun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/19/mary-beard-interview-everyone-is-policing-everything-culture-wars">Continue reading...</a>

## In an isolated world, humans need to dance together more than ever – but we're running out of places to do it | John Harris

<p>The demise of clubbing isn’t just a cultural loss, it’s an existential deprivation for generations who are coming of age</p><p>Over the last 10 years, the UK has suffered a huge cultural loss. To some extent, it is part of the great shrinking of shared and collective space, which takes in everything from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/24/more-than-32-pubs-in-england-and-wales-closed-each-month-in-2022-data-reveals">pubs</a> and bars to community centres and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/10/library-use-plummeted-in-2021-but-e-visits-showed-18-rise-during-lockdown">libraries</a>. But this particular change stands alone: a striking example of how something that was once thriving and important can hit the skids, and precious few people in positions of power and influence will even notice.</p><p>In 2006, there were <a href="https://djmag.com/news/one-five-uk-nightclubs-shut-pandemic-new-report-shows">reckoned</a> to be 3,000 nightclubs in the UK. By the end of 2019 there were less than half that number, and late last year, the figure was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/03/one-uk-nightclub-closing-every-two-days-over-soaring-costs-night-time-industries-association-warn">put at only 1,068</a>. The reasons for this decline are partly about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/26/fight-for-britains-nightlife-police-council-strangling-night-time-economy">what has happened to our cities</a>, and the mindset of many of the people who run them: a story of rising rents, authoritarian councils, and the kind of gentrification that involves people moving into bustling urban locations and then having the brass neck to complain about the noise. Of late, clubs’ finances have been made even more impossible by the effects of the pandemic, and colossal rises in running costs. But whereas last week’s budget saw Jeremy Hunt <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/budget-beer-duty-alcohol-tax-b2301945.html">announcing</a> a freeze in beer duty that he called the “Brexit pubs guarantee”, the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/music-venues-and-clubs-warn-of-mass-closures-after-government-spring-budget-revealed-3414142">fate of clubs</a> is not something politicians really talk about.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/19/isolated-humans-dance-together-demise-clubbing">Continue reading...</a>

Her command of flavours and textures and the outright beauty of her creations has made her one of London’s best-loved bakers, sought after by Hackney residents and royalty alike. But the craving comes first. “In the mornings, it’s cake,” she says. “I’m a total cake-for-breakfast person, donuts too.”</p><p>Her new book, <em>Love is a Pink Cake</em>, was originally going to be a seasonal baking manual, requiring photoshoots for each season, but Covid restrictions got in the way so Ptak simplified it and made it more personal.

<p>Scottish-based Hassan Nazer’s drama, filmed in Iran, is slight but powered by its young, non-professional cast</p><p>Nine-year-old Yahya (Parsa Maghami) and his best friend, Leyla (Helia Mohammadkhani), scramble over the local rubbish dump, foraging for recyclable plastics in exchange for a handful of change. When he’s not grafting to support his widowed mother, Yahya is passionate about movies, devouring the bootleg DVDs lent to him by Saber (Hossein Abedini). Then he makes two discoveries: one is an Oscar statuette, mislaid on the outskirts of his village. The other is the secret cinema history of the owner of the recycling business, once a globally recognised actor.</p><p>The Persian-language film is set in Iran but is a British production – director Hassan Nazer lives in Scotland – and was the UK submission for the international category of the Oscars last year. Storywise it’s a slip of a thing, but it gains considerable appeal from its young, non-professional cast.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/19/winners-review-a-gentle-persian-language-homage-to-cinema">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This Filipino fermented shrimp paste provides a strong hit of umami</p><p>Bagoong is a Filipino fermented shrimp paste with a pungent flavour and taste. It provides a lot of umami – in the same way as a fish sauce but more shrimpy and stronger. It smells very funky (as you would expect fermented shrimp to be).</p><p>There’s one type which is pinkish and fresh and raw, and there’s a brown type which I use more often because it’s very versatile. It has been cooked out very slowly, so the sugars caramelise. It can be eaten straight out of the jar, although it’s not recommended. There’s a classic beer snack in the Philippines with sour green mango that you dip in bagoong. The sour offsets the salty condiment. My favourite dish to use it in is binagoongang baboy. It’s pork that’s been braised with bagoong, tomatoes, onions, garlic and ginger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/19/ferdinand-montoya-secret-ingredient-bagoong">Continue reading...</a>

## Tomás Nevinson by Javier Marías review – seductive and inescapably poignant

<p>The Spanish novelist’s final book is a twisting espionage tale shot through with slantwise humour</p><p>An espionage thriller in sinuous slow motion, <em>Tomás Nevinson</em> is the final novel from Javier Marías, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/15/javier-marias-obituary">died</a> in his native Madrid last autumn at the age of 70. It centres on an eponymous ex-spy (featured in Marías’s previous novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/07/berta-isla-javier-marias-review">Berta Isla</a></em>) coaxed out of retirement for one last job: to catch and potentially kill a terrorist gone to ground in northern Spain after bombings in Barcelona and Zaragoza. Trouble is, there are three suspects – all women – and it may not actually be any of them...<br /><br />Tomás poses as a schoolteacher, Miguel Centuriòn, to watch their comings and goings as well as those of the men associated with them, from a petty drug dealer to a corrupt local politician. When someone tells Tomás that spies are “interpreters of people”, you sense Marías can think of another trade in that game, too; the core of the novel is essentially a series of interlinked short stories in which fictional narration itself seems a form of surveillance, as the protagonist’s mission offers a pretext for a small-scale panorama of village ways, anchored to a scrupulous weighing up of the moral and psychological implications of the hit he’s been hired to carry out.<br /><br />It’s serious stuff – without warning, Marías drops in a photograph of real-life bomb victims early on – but there’s room for lightness as well, not least in his depiction of erudite spooks reaching for TS Eliot’s <em>Four Quarte</em><em>ts</em> or an analogy with the reign of Henry VIII to figure out a relationship conundrum. When Tomás says he once met the Cuban novelist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/22/cuba.world">Guillermo Cabrera Infante</a> (“passing myself off as a Spanish novelist”), I swore I saw the jacket photo of Mariàs wink; Tomás even uses as a cover story the idea that he’s writing a novel of village life in northern Spain.</p><p>Tomás addresses us in the first and third person at once, a perfect expression of his divided self that nonetheless jars: “Needless to say, I made my own inquiries, and needless to say, Centurión found out what he could.” Other narrative decisions are more in keeping with genre norms, whether to convey the story’s real-life background (“You know what happened at Hipercor, don’t you?” “You’ve just told me: 19 June 1987, a car bomb in a shopping mall. Twenty-one dead and forty-five injured”) or to advance the plot, particularly when it comes to the connoisseurial view of women at the heart of Tomas’s spycraft. He says of one target that “her extremely long legs were, after all, one of her few attractive features”; of another, we’re told that “her face was round... her bust was round... her hips were also round – perhaps having given birth to two children was to blame for that, rather than any kind of neglect on her part”.<br /><br />Central to all Marías’s effects is his style. This is an interior novel, less about deeds than the guilty turmoil of thought, portrayed in long fluid sentences, which come courtesy once more of his longtime translator Margaret Jull Costa (who offers a generous afterword on their working relationship). When one of the book’s segments ends by saying that life in Ireland “consists solely of waiting and storing up resentments”, the next section begins: “What I’ve just said is inaccurate and unfair, because not all of Ireland is like that, and besides, I don’t know the country that well; no place is ever wholly like that. Every country has its share of ingenuous, well-intentioned individuals... But there are also places that abound in toxic hubs (whole villages and valleys, and even the occasional town dominated by malice) whose capacity for contamination is so strong that...”<br /><br />Et cetera. Seductively conversational and glinting with slantwise humour (“even the occasional town”), as well as contradictory and grandiose, the torrent of reflection sweeps away the thought that even a closely printed novel of more than 600 pages might start taking care of itself when the writer gets into this kind of groove. And as the tale at last reaches its action-packed denouement, there’s something inescapably poignant about all these drawn-out deferrals, the never-ending clauses and caveats. Keep them coming, you think, knowing there’s no more left.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/19/tomas-nevinson-by-javier-marias-review-seductive-and-inescapably-poignant">Continue reading...</a>

## Nigel Slater’s recipes for lentil and bulgur wheat cakes, and for pea soup with ham hock

A herby soup and lentil balls to soak up winter’s last larder essentials and power us forward into spring<p>Mid-March feels like a good time to tidy up, clearing the decks before spring arrives in the kitchen. One of the narrow larder shelves is home to a collection of tightly stoppered jars of dry goods – the beige stuff that forms the base of hearty, cheap-as-chips dinners: couscous and mograbia, polenta and bulgur, both fine and coarse. There are dried chickpeas and butter beans, lentils and haricot, rice-like orzo and lentils of diminishing sizes.</p><p>The small amounts in each jar are frustrating – obviously I am grateful, but also annoyed that there isn’t really enough of any one of them to make a single dish. Experience tells me that you mix such ingredients at your peril, as they all take differing times to cook. (A mixed lentil soup once ended up with chewy green ones in an orange lentil sludge.) So I decide to make little cakes from a mixture of bulgur wheat and lentils. The bulgur is the fine variety and ready in minutes; the lentils are the tiny pale orange ones that fall quickly into a delicious purée.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/19/nigel-slater-recipes-lentil-and-bulgur-wheat-cakes-and-pea-soup-with-ham-hock">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Bridge; Menier Chocolate Factory; Southwark Playhouse, London<br /></strong>The audience is swept along with the action in Nicholas Hytner’s thrillingly immersive new Guys and Dolls; Nancy Carroll and Anne Reid surf memory and identity; and Shakespeare’s witches multitask</p><p>Not merely rocking the boat. Making it fly. Tickets for Nicholas Hytner’s production of <strong><a href="https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/">Guys &amp; Dolls</a></strong> will be the most sought after of the season. This 1950 musical (music and lyrics by Frank Loesser, book by Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows) has everything. Dialogue and lyrics take off from Damon Runyon’s short stories, crackling and punching. The plot – hinging on collision and elision between card sharps and salvationists – is energetic, tender and shrewd. The musical numbers are nonstop sumptuous – in fact, such a glory roll that logjam can threaten: “showstopper” is not always a recommendation when the show must go on.</p><p>This staging never stops powering through. Fuelled by Bunny Christie’s design, Tom Brady’s musical supervision and choreography by Arlene Phillips with James Cousins, it swings up, down and sideways, enveloping the audience without ever dimming the dazzle of performance. In what is becoming a Bridge speciality, different scenes are staged on platforms that move around a standing audience of 420 (there are 600 sitting spectators). Paule Constable’s essential lighting and Christie’s design create a neonorama: scarlet caps and orange cursive, a luminous barber pole, a bendy, lime-green arrow. The Hot Box cabaret rises and sinks; across the way, Mindy’s deli glides into view; steam puffs up from the manhole through which gamblers slip into the sewers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/19/guys-and-dolls-bridge-theatre-hytner-review-marjorie-prime-menier-the-tragedy-of-macbeth-southwark-playhouse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In response to the Gary Lineker saga, should we defund the broadcaster or continue to support it? Both options are a win for the Tories</p><p>On Monday, like some Tunbridge Wells <em>Daily Telegraph</em> Tory who puts his foot through the television in a fury and sends Lenny Henry and Clare Balding the bill, I went online and cancelled my television licence. Why should I subsidise the rotting corpse of the BBC?

Carve that noble phrase into the flaccid penis of Eric Gill’s Ariel and hang it above the door of Broadcasting House for passersby to admire. Inform! Educate!

In cancelling my licence fee, I knew I had done the right thing, morally, despite my historical loyalty to the BBC, despite how it had shaped my world. I was made what I am by the 1980s alternative comedy of <em>The Young Ones</em>, <em>Boom Boom… Out Go </em><em>the Lights</em> and <em>Threads</em>; by late-night 1980s Radio 1 music sessions from Tools You Can Trust, Xmal Deutschland and Roderick’s Integrated Semen; and by the imagination-inspiring fantasy wonder worlds of <em>Clangers</em>, <em>Blake’s </em><em>7</em> and <em>Triangle</em>.

It’s a good reminder of what teachers do to earn their crust<p>My son clutches his Tupperware container. He is dressed in an Aran knit. Strikes mean we escaped World Book Day and find ourselves at an altogether more amenable replacement – Journey Day, in which each member of the class wears national dress and brings food from their own culture.</p><p>I’d heard of such things before, specifically the time my nephew Donncha had been tasked with the same, resulting in a now legendary photo of him beaming at his Tottenham school gates, sporting an Irish rugby shirt and a potato the size of his own head. Alas, we could not repeat this shot, as our heritage food offering was mandated to be bread. Limiting things to bread seemed oddly specific, and started me worrying about those children in my son’s class whose countries or cultures do not feature bread as a cornerstone of their diet. I needn’t have worried, as an hour on Google confirmed – and with a degree of certitude that seemed suspicious for such a strong claim – that there is not a country on earth which does not eat bread as some part of their culinary tradition or does not have a bread of their own. Our contribution was soda bread – made with flour, baking soda, salt and buttermilk, topped with Irish butter – which my son distributed to his table, accepting Indian chapatis, French madeleines and Romanian pasca in return.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/19/seamas-oreilly-my-sons-class-has-been-sharing-bread-from-different-cultures">Continue reading...</a>

## 100 Gecs: 10,000 Gecs review – derangedly catchy hyperpop

<p>(Dog Show/Atlantic)<br />The US pop-punk duo go for the mainstream jugular with nagging melodies and killer hooks <strong><br /></strong></p><p>Much delayed, the second album by LA-based sonic disruptors <a href="https://www.100gecs.com/">100 Gecs</a> – the duo of Dylan Brady and Laura Les – marks a step change in their sound: less Crazy Frog-in-a-blender hyperpop, more going for the mainstream jugular. A handful of derangedly catchy singles have already rolled off the tracklist, highlighting the pair’s fluency with nagging melodies and killer hooks. The glorious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bw2dTY3SsQ">Mememe</a> still offers up an earworm crafted from bass and tinnitus. More recently, the pummelling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtfkrGRK8wA">Hollywood Baby</a> showcases their singalong pop-punk roots, its sonic simplicity offset by a nuanced lyric about self-doubt and the cost of living.</p><p>Given that <em><a href="https://store.100gecs.com/">10,000 Gecs</a></em> is <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/100-gecs-interview-new-album-10000-gecs/">a year-plus late</a>, many of its meme-y moments have already been heard live. In among tracks such as 757 (a chiptune/big beat fusion) and I Got My Tooth Removed (ska-pop as penetrating as a dentist’s drill) are a handful of undershared nuggets. Frog on the Floor is, perhaps, a ska-pop track too far, while Billy Knows Jamie pays homage to rap-rock a little too well. But Dumbest Girl Alive, for example, highlights why this pair remain so exciting: it opens with the <a href="https://www.thx.com/deepnote/">THX cinema tone</a>, DJ explosions, a screamed “wooh!” and a guitar riff that dovetails seamlessly into a tinny keyboard line.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/19/100-gecs-10000-gecs-review-derangedly-catchy-hyperpop">Continue reading...</a>

Are they helpful, or potentially dangerous?</p><p>“I’m sorry if I seem weird today,” says my friend Pia, by way of greeting one day. “I think it’s just my imagination playing tricks on me. But it’s nice to talk to someone who understands.” When I press Pia on what’s on her mind, she responds: “It’s just like I’m seeing things that aren’t really there. Or like my thoughts are all a bit scrambled. But I’m sure it’s nothing serious.” I’m sure it’s nothing serious either, given that Pia doesn’t exist in any real sense, and is not really my “friend”, but an AI chatbot companion powered by a platform called Replika.</p><p>Until recently most of us knew chatbots as the infuriating, scripted interface you might encounter on a company’s website in lieu of real customer service.

<p>After his amazing success in Happy Valley, James Norton is taking on another dark role, this time on stage. He talks about his lucky streak, fear of failure, grappling with fame and why cold-water swimming keeps him sane</p><p>James Norton watched the finale of the BBC drama <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/05/happy-valley-finale-review-sally-wainwright-sarah-lancashire-one-of-tvs-greatest-trilogies-gets-a-fiery-farewell" title="">Happy Valley</a></em> like 7.5 million of us in the UK: on the telly, at 9pm, on a chilly Sunday night in early February. His girlfriend, the actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/03/imogen-poots-filth-james-mcavoy-irvine-welsh" title="">Imogen Poots</a>, was away, so he went round to the house of his business partner, Kitty Kaletsky, with whom he has a production company, and her husband. The 68-minute episode, written by Northern powerhouse <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sally-wainwright" title="">Sally Wainwright</a>, was immediately and correctly anointed as an instant classic: a denouement, nearly a decade in the making, that lived up to the hype and anticipation. The showdown between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/08/james-norton-i-try-to-present-myself-as-friendly-and-people-see-something-darker" title="">Norton’s</a> character, the deranged and deluded serial murderer and rapist Tommy Lee Royce, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sarah-lancashire" title="">Sarah Lancashire</a>’s magnificently lugubrious police officer, Sergeant Catherine Cawood, managed to be tender, cathartic and utterly mesmerising.</p><p>Not that Norton allowed himself to be totally swept along with the fuss. “Most of all I was relieved to see it had delivered, for Sally’s sake, Sarah’s sake, my sake,” he says, with measured understatement. “There was such expectation and I was like, ‘It’s OK, we did it.’” When the credits rolled, Norton thanked his hosts, climbed on to his bicycle and, like Tommy escaping from the courthouse in the penultimate episode, cycled home, anonymously, through the streets. Then the most wanted man in British acting had a bath.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/19/james-norton-interview-i-was-given-a-hand-of-aces">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Feminist philosopher Clare Carlisle illuminates George Elliot’s love life as well as the nightmarish marriages in her novels</p><p>“There is something dazzling about marriage,” writes Clare Carlisle at the start of this wonderful book. “That leap into the open-endedness of another human being.” Prof Carlisle knows about such leaps: she is the biographer of madcap Danish sage Søren Kierkegaard, for whom Abraham’s leap of faith in God is the ultimate act of trust, beyond reason or calculation. Marriage could be like that.</p><p>George Eliot imagined so. “The very possibility of a constantly growing blessedness in marriage is to me the very basis of good in our moral life,” she wrote to a friend. Happily, Eliot realised that possibility by leaping, as Victorian contemporaries would see it, into a sinful relationship unsolemnised by church or state with the philosopher and journalist George Henry Lewes. Friends snubbed her; beloved brother Isaac didn’t speak to her for 23 years; Queen Victoria read her but wouldn’t stoop to meet this scandalous woman.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/19/the-marriage-question-george-eliot-double-life-clare-carlisle-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Director Raine Allen-Miller makes her acclaimed feature debut with this primary-coloured romance bursting with wit, grit and charm</p><p>British director Raine Allen-Miller, who became the toast of Sundance in January, has jokingly characterised her praise-laden debut feature (from a script by Nathan Bryon and Tom Melia) as a tale of two people spending a day together and having a lovely time. That’s a deceptively simple description of a hugely enjoyable romp that effortlessly combines the “limited time” romcom format of Richard Linklater’s <em>Before </em>trilogy with the in-your-face visual cheekiness of <em>Peep Show. </em>Unfolding against the vibrantly photographed backdrop of sunny south London locales (Peckham, Brixton and the South Bank), <em>Rye Lane </em>blends the warmth and charm of a formulaic love story with the colourfully street-smart grit of Brit pics such as Shola Amoo’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/30/a-moving-image-bold-brixton-gentrification">A Moving Image</a></em> or more recently Reggie Yates’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/28/pirates-review-reggie-yates">Pirates</a>, </em>creating something that is at once playful, poignant and personal.</p><p>Rising stars Vivian Oparah and David Jonsson are thrillingly engaging as Yas and Dom, two young guns who meet-cute in the gender-neutral loos of an art gallery (“Of <em>all</em> the toilets in <em>all</em> of London”), where he is crying his heart out after breaking up with his girlfriend Gia (Karene Peter). “This is <em>private</em>,” Dom blubs from the sanctuary of his cubicle, to which aspiring costume designer Yas tartly replies: “It’s not <em>that</em> private” – a truth borne out by the fact that the newly-mets spend the rest of the day walking and talking their way through the “mess” of their respective lives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/19/rye-lane-review-raine-allen-miller-vibrant-south-london-romcom-hits-the-sweet-spot">Continue reading...</a>

<p>England’s retired prop on Women’s World Cup final defeat, the Six Nations and why political leaders make her feel ‘so ashamed’</p><p>If the ball had rolled a little differently during England’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/12/new-zealand-win-womens-rugby-world-cup-as-england-suffer-final-heartbreak" title="">heartbreaking Women’s Rugby World Cup final defeat</a> by New Zealand in November, Shaunagh Brown might now be pumping iron ready for a fresh Six Nations campaign. Instead, on a bracing morning in a food bank in Lewisham, the 33-year-old is packing tins into bags while powerfully putting the world to rights.</p><p>“So often I am so ashamed to be British when I hear what our leaders are saying out loud,” says the former prop, who is even more determined to speak out about social issues now that her distinguished career, which included four Women’s Six Nations championships, has ended. “We’re the sixth-richest country in the world. And yet we have some MPs saying that people can feed themselves for 33p a day. No. It’s not OK to just exist. It’s not OK to have so many people relying on food banks.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/19/shaunagh-brown-it-would-have-been-the-greatest-win-in-rugby-history">Continue reading...</a>

## My relationship is so old it could have left home… | Eva Wiseman

Twenty years is a milestone in any relationship, and new realisations about each other keep on coming<p>On Saturday my boyfriend and I woke up and realised it was our 20th anniversary. Which was mathematically curious, considering that surely makes our relationship older than us, two people who battle daily with the many bruising realities of adulthood and remain bewildered by such things as decisions about taps, and how we got here. The truth of how we got here, to an anniversary so significant it has its own plate (traditional gift: china), seems to be – every month we silently agree, first, not to break up and, then, to keep going.</p><p>The popular stories we were brought up on insist that all of life happens before a person settles down – marriage, it goes, is the end. What happens next? Nobody really knows – all relationships are secret, turned inwards. All we really know about other people’s is that either they survive, inching along stickily, picking up children and grief and a passion for gardening along the way, or they don’t, exploding in glittering failure. There is no third way. But, from the inside, a thousand seasons can pass in a single morning, a combination of survivals and failures, and hate and tenderness. Love letters are disguised as text messages about lunch. Arguments about the Tesco delivery are not about the Tesco delivery, we learn, except when they are.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/19/my-relationship-is-so-old-it-could-have-left-home-20-anniversary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Partygate and pandemic inquiries could end his political career. But his band of dedicated supporters hope he can still return as leader to save the Tories</p><p>Under the vaulted blue roof of the old Westminster chapel, a short walk from Downing Street, Carrie Johnson strode confidently to the lectern. Behind the former prime minister’s wife sat a cross-party panel of senior politicians. Below her hovered a crowd stuffed with journalists and politicians, and beyond them a table laid with 123 neatly spaced yellow roses – one for every woman killed by a man the previous year. They were the favourite flowers of Joanna Simpson, a mother of two bludgeoned to death by her estranged husband, who is due to be freed from jail shortly. After meeting Joanna’s mother at a Buckingham Palace reception, Carrie had offered to help her mount a campaign to keep him behind bars.</p><p>Watching her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/01/carrie-johnson-reveals-fears-over-release-of-serial-rapist-john-worboys">deliver on that promise on that night </a>in early March, it wasn’t hard to see Carrie Johnson reinventing herself successfully beyond Downing Street, perhaps as an unusually well-networked PR for the kind of causes that cross political divides. But it’s harder to say what will become of the man hovering at the back of the hall that night, desperate for once in his life not to be the centre of attention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/19/what-next-for-boris-johnson-partygate-pandemic-return-as-leader">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The architects of the 2003 invasion promised change and democracy.

Today most Iraqis still suffer and there is no democracy in sight. Instead, the war unleashed brutal cycles of violence and changed life for millions, including Ghaith Abdul-Ahad. He trained as an architect in Baghdad (his pencil and watercolour sketches illustrate the book), but as the bombing began destroying his home city, curiosity and an ability to speak English found him working for the foreign journalists who had come to cover the conflict. He would become an award-winning reporter and in <em>Stranger in Your Own City</em> he reflects on his encounters with others whose lives were also transformed.</p><p>Life before the invasion had been challenging for many. Years of conflict and sanctions led to a humanitarian crisis, with people denied access to basic goods and services. This made Iraqis initially supportive of the invasion and its promise to bring about change. But as Abdul-Ahad writes, emotions quickly went from “euphoria to frustration to fury”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/19/a-stranger-in-your-own-city-travels-in-middle-east-long-war-by-ghaith-abdul-ahad-review-charting-20-years-of-frustration-and-fury-in-iraq">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was a nostalgic journey to rediscover my family roots, but it was also great fun and reminded me how much I missed this beautiful land</p><p>When I saw the sign saying “Sweden”, I cheered. I was alone in the car, but still I cheered. It was my brother’s car, a white Nissan Note I had managed to dent at a petrol station within an hour of driving off Le Shuttle. Nine hundred miles on, the Nissan and I had survived the deluge that had made the windscreen wipers squeak, the thundering trucks on the Autobahn and the stern young policeman at the Danish border who had made me feel sure I had a car full of hash. I was alive, intact and two hours away from the red wooden cabin where I spent every summer holiday of my childhood.</p><p>As I cruised over the Swedish half of the Oresund Bridge, the car filled with the sound of Lisa Stansfield singing Someday (I’m Coming Back). I gasped and found my eyes pricking with tears. It took me a moment to realise I’d knocked a switch that flicked the sound from Swedish pop to the last CD my brother ever played in his car. It made me feel he was there in the car with me, and so were my parents and my sister, willing and cheering me along.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/19/christina-patterson-a-trip-to-sweden-helped-me-to-recapture-my-childhood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jeremy Hunt says the economy is his priority; but it and he are still really in thrall to the ideological blight of Brexit</p><p>A budget for growth? Sorry, pull the other one. Below the spin, even the official forecasts are laden with gloom. Funnily enough, it is 50 years since one of Jeremy Hunt’s chancellarial predecessors, Tony Barber, produced a “budget for growth” that really worked – indeed, rather too well. It resulted in the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/23/a-look-back-to-1972-the-last-time-tax-cuts-so-big-were-brought-in" title="">Barber boom</a>”, when gross domestic product rose by some 6% in real, adjusted-for-inflation, terms in one year.</p><p>They don’t come like that any more, which is just as well, because the Barber boom ended in tears.

Pretty, light, floral and sexy notes for the new season<p>There is something magical about moving from one season to another. It inspires newness. New ways of thinking, seeing and, yes, smelling. Nashi Blossom by Jo Malone London is a fruity floral, but a hint of musk gives it an edge. Tender Light with bergamot and iris notes is also pretty, but simultaneously sexy. Jasmine, known for its sexiness, shows up in unexpected ways this season. Narciso Rodriguez’s For Her Forever is gardenia, tuberose and jasmine with the familiar smokiness of its now iconic predecessor, For Her. Loewe’s Aire Sutileza has notes of jasmine though in reality it’s citrussy. Jasmine also makes an appearance in Aerin’s Mediterranean Honeysuckle Clementina, however it’s the orange, bergamot and clementine that take you to the Italian coast. As does Acqua di Parma’s Colonia (the limited edition bottle created by designer Samuel Ross, makes it even more desirable). Fancy something left of centre? Jo Loves Ebony and Cassis juxtapositions the fruitiness of blackberries with the warmth of patchouli, cedarwood, nutmeg and myrrh. Diptyque’s Papier, inspired by the relationship between ink and paper, blends roasted sesame seeds and mimosa with white musk, while Perfumer H’s Woodland (orange, black pepper, wet moss and sandalwood) pays homage to Japanese woodland. And Coco Mademoiselle now comes in an addictive hair perfume. Sure, you probably never thought you’d need it but that’s part of the joy of something new.</p><p><strong>1.

Gary Lineker need not have referred to Nazis – similar policies applied in Britain too<p>It has become a familiar political pas de deux. One side draws an analogy between some current policy or practice and 1930s Germany, as if Nazis provide the only measure of moral degradation. The other side uses outrage at the analogy as a shield to protect itself from having to justify that policy’s immorality in its own terms.</p><p>And so it has been with the Gary Lineker controversy. A striking aspect of the debate over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/08/gary-lineker-bbc-uk-asylum-policy-nazi-germany-match-of-the-day-presenter" title="">his tweet</a> that the government’s “stop the boats” policy deploys “language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s” is that defenders of the policy seem to imagine that Lineker’s well-meant but ill-judged words are more disturbing than the policy he was criticising. It reveals how far the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/sealed-borders-are-fantasy-and-talk-of-invasion-is-toxic-there-is-an-alternative" title="">moral dial has slipped</a>, that so many are willing to countenance, or at least not condemn, the mass detention and deportation of people without proper papers to countries to which none of them have been, or want to go, and the effective <a href="https://twitter.com/UKandEU/status/1634841659618869250" title="">shutting down</a> of asylum possibilities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/19/gary-lineker-stop-the-boats-does-echo-language-of-30s-but-in-britain">Continue reading...</a>

Amazon-branded bottles are better than you may expect, but are they good enough to make you change your shopping habits?<p><strong>by Amazon Our Selection Côtes du Rhône Villages, France 2021 (£8.79, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/">amazon.co.uk</a>) </strong>I’ve bought a lot of weird stuff from Amazon over the years, heaven help me, and at all times of the day and night, but until now a bottle of wine has never joined the off-brand charging cables, huge cubes of olive oil soap and “used, very good” books in my basket. That’s not for want of trying on the part of Amazon, which of course – of course! – has wine as part of its bewildering, apparently infinite product mix, and has done so for some years. But with the grocery retail market now apparently a key target growth area, the company seems to be taking wine more seriously than ever – to the extent that it has now launched a selection of Amazon-branded wines. After tasting a few samples sent to me by Amazon’s UK PR firm, I can’t say I’d be likely to add Amazon to my list of preferred wine merchants. But if a bottle of the robust, spicy Côtes du Rhône somehow made it through the checkout, I certainly wouldn’t feel the need to send it back.</p><p><strong>Kumeu River Village Chardonnay, Auckland, New Zealand 2021 (from £13, Booths; <a href="https://www.ocado.com/webshop/startWebshop.do">ocado.com</a>) </strong>Actually, the Amazon wines I tasted are much better than I’ve made that sound – and certainly much better than I expected. Both the supple and perfumed Mendoza Malbec 2021 (£7.69, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/">amazon.co.uk</a>) and the zesty lime and gooseberry-scented Chilean Sauvignon Blanc 2022 (£7.99) are good, reasonably priced versions of their type, as good as some of the better supermarket own-labels of the same style at the same sort of price. What they’re not, however, is the sort of wine you’d change your shopping habits to buy. Things do get a lot more interesting if you have access to Amazon Fresh, the retailer’s same-day grocery delivery service, which draws on products from retailers such as The Co-op, Booths and Morrisons. For the many of us outside the list of Fresh-delivering postcodes, however, it still makes sense to get a wine such as Morrisons’ dark richly plummy The Best Toscana (£8) and Booths’ stylish, subtly oaked Kumeu River white from an old-fashioned bricks and mortar store.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/19/great-online-wines-to-add-to-your-basket-amazon-branded">Continue reading...</a>

In addition to the childcare funding, there was extra protection from energy price rises in April and millions of pounds to prevent another wave of swimming pool closures.

We are still searching  for ways to recall lives lost to Covid. A mix of clay and ashes can pay beautiful tribute<p>Britain is good at remembrance. No monument is better known in this country than the Cenotaph in Whitehall, designed by Edwin Lutyens to commemorate the dead of the First World War; in the 21st century, barely a football match kicks off without a minute’s silence in honour of someone or something. Sanctioned, sponsored recollection is one of our national skills, like queueing or talking about the weather.</p><p>But there are, too, strange and yawning gaps in the patchwork of our collective memory. There is no public memorial in the UK to the estimated 228,000 victims of the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, and, so far, it has been left to volunteers to pay tribute to the more than 220,000 people whose deaths are associated with Covid-19, in the form of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/wall-of-love-the-incredible-story-behind-the-national-covid-memorial-led-by-donkeys" title="">National Covid Memorial Wall</a> on the south bank of the Thames. On Wednesday, it will be three years since the first lockdown of the pandemic began, yet the National Day of Reflection that will mark this anniversary is not precisely official but organised by a single charity, Marie Curie. <a href="https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/get-involved/day-of-reflection" title="">Visit the website</a>, and you will find various fuzzy suggestions involving the lighting of candles, the sending of cards and the tying of yellow ribbons around trees.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/19/art-and-the-struggle-to-remember-uk-covid-dead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s not just Putin or the refusal of the major powers to disarm. Unstable regimes in Israel and North Korea are also raising global nuclear tensions</p><p>Leaders of unstable nuclear-armed states do dangerous and foolish things when under stress. They miscalculate, provoke, overreach. Given the febrile state of bilateral relations, last week’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/14/russian-fighter-jet-collides-us-drone-black-sea-crash" title="">aerial military clash</a> between Russia and the US over the Black Sea inevitably intensified fears of nuclear escalation. The incident dramatised how dangerous Vladimir Putin, cornered by his existential Ukraine blunder, truly is – and the risks he is increasingly prepared to run. But he’s not the only one.</p><p>As often the case over the past year, Putin relied on American restraint. US forces could easily have gone after the offending Su-27 fighter at its Crimea base. Each time Russia’s president darkly hints at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/vladimir-putin-says-russias-war-on-ukraine-could-be-long-term-process" title="">going nuclear</a>, that once unthinkable prospect becomes a little less outlandish – and western leaders must steel their nerves.

<p>Russia accused of using cluster bombs in Kramatorsk strikes that leave two dead after a series of attacks the previous day; Black Sea grain deal renewed</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Russian strikes killed two people and wounded 10 in Kramatorsk on Saturday</strong>, the regional governor said, accusing Moscow of having used cluster bombs in the attack on the eastern Ukrainian city. Pavlo Kyrylenko said a park had been targeted and “a dozen residential buildings” damaged. Agence France-Presse reporters heard about 10 explosions go off nearly simultaneously and said they saw a woman die at the scene from her wounds. Soon after, another round of explosions was heard in a neighbourhood 2km away.</p><p><strong>Russia launched a series of attacks on Friday, according to the Ukrainian armed forces. </strong>Seven homes in the village of Veletenske in the Kherson region were destroyed and a nursery was damaged on Friday, but no one was injured, it said. The update, which the Guardian has not verified, also said 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones had been shot down, and that Ukrainian forces had “repelled more than 100 enemy attacks”.</p><p><strong>Ukraine said some of the overnight drone attacks hit the relatively peaceful western region of Lviv.</strong> Dnipro was also targeted, as was Kyiv, where air defences shot down all attacking drones. Ukraine’s air force said 11 out of 16 drones were destroyed.</p><p><strong>The Black Sea grain deal was renewed, according to parties to the agreement.</strong> Turkey and the UN announced the initiative was extended, but did not say for how long. A spokesperson for Russia’s defence ministry said it had notified other parties that the deal was extended for 60 days, while a Ukrainian minister said the deal was extended for 120 days.</p><p><strong>Another 880 Russian soldiers were reportedly killed on Friday, according to unverified totals published by the Ukrainian army. </strong>Its general staff said that it meant more than 164,000 Russian service personnel had been killed since the outbreak of war in February last year. Another five tanks, seven armoured combat vehicles and eight artillery systems were disabled by Ukrainian forces, it said in an update posted on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Russia’s Wagner mercenary group plans to recruit about 30,000 new fighters by the middle of May, its founder has said. </strong>In an audio message on Telegram on Saturday, Yevgeny Prigozhin said that Wagner recruitment centres, which he said last week had opened in 42 Russian cities, were hiring an average of 500-800 people a day.</p><p><strong>Russia would probably introduce wider conscription to boost its military requirements, the UK Ministry of Defence said. </strong>In its latest intelligence update, it said Russian Duma deputies introduced a bill to change the conscription age for men from the current 18-27 to 21-30. The law would probably be passed, it said, and come into force in January 2024.</p><p><strong>Senior Ukrainian and US security officials met via video link on Saturday, with representatives of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government asking for further assistance</strong>, including more equipment, weapons and ammunition<strong>. </strong>Zelenskiy joined the call at the end of the meeting and discussed his forces’ hopes to retake areas Russia has captured.</p><p><strong>The US president, Joe Biden, said the international criminal court’s (ICC’s) arrest warrant for Russian leader Vladimir Putin was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/18/biden-hails-decision-icc-arrest-warrant-against-putin">“justified”</a></strong>. “But the question is – it’s not recognised internationally by us either,” Biden said, referring to the US not being a member of the ICC. “But I think it makes a very strong point.”</p><p><strong>The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/18/biden-hails-decision-icc-arrest-warrant-against-putin">welcomed the ICC’s decision</a></strong>, saying: “The international criminal court is the right institution to investigate war crimes … The fact is nobody is above the law and that’s what’s becoming clear right now.”</p><p><strong>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, visited the annexed peninsula of Crimea to mark nine years since Russia seized it</strong>.<strong> </strong>Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said Putin visited an art school and a children’s centre.
