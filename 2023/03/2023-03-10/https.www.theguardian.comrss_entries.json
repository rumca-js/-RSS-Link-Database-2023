It\u2019s become so commonplace that it may be the first thing you look for, but the truth is, many of the wines with which you may be most familiar, including bordeaux, c\u00f4tes du rh\u00f4ne and rioja, are made from more than one variety.</p><p>Blends have many advantages. Just as with a recipe for a dish, a winemaker can combine different components to make a more harmoniously satisfying whole. And if it\u2019s a bad year for one variety, say, you can simply bump up another. This is particularly true of bordeaux, where the proportions of merlot, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc habitually vary depending on the weather. Other varieties that are natural bedfellows are sauvignon blanc and semillon, which you find in sauternes and white bordeaux, Rh\u00f4ne varietals grenache, syrah and mourv\u00e8dre (otherwise known as GSM, especially in Australia); and chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier, the usual triumvirate of varieties found in champagne and similar sparkling wines. Even wines that appear to be made from one variety may include only 85% of it (or 75% in the US). Even a small amount of another variety can make a significant difference, especially in the case of headily aromatic muscat, or <em>moscato</em>, which needs the addition of only a few percent to give the wine an exotically perfumed lift.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href=\"https://fionabeckett.substack.com/\">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/10/wine-the-art-of-blending-fiona-beckett\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/10/wine-the-art-of-blending-fiona-beckett", "date_published": "2023-03-10 14:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Biggest carbon credit certifier to replace its rainforest offsets scheme", "description": "<p>Verra will phase out the programme by mid-2025 after a Guardian investigation found it was flawed </p><p>The world\u2019s leading carbon credit certifier \u2013 used by Disney, Shell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci\">Gucci</a> and other big corporations for climate claims \u2013 has said it will phase out and replace its rainforest offsets programme by mid-2025 after a Guardian investigation found it was flawed.</p><p>Verra, the main guarantee of credibility for the rapidly growing <a href=\"https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/the-art-of-integrity-state-of-the-voluntary-carbon-markets-q3-2022/\">$2bn (\u00a31.6bn) voluntary offsets</a> market, has committed to scrapping its rainforest protection programme by July 2025 and introducing new rules, which it is in the process of developing.

Back after 24 years, Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt explain how lockdowns led to a new album \u2013 and why they\u2019ve embraced Auto-Tune</p><p>In early 1997, Everything But the Girl were at the height of their fame. Fifteen years into their career, they had executed a remarkable turnaround in fortunes. Ben Watt and Tracey Thorn had been dropped by their label after the release of their 1994 album, Amplified Heart, only to see a Todd Terry remix of its track Missing belatedly become a vast global hit: No 2 in the US, double platinum in the UK, topping the charts for weeks around Europe. Their ensuing album, 1995\u2019s Walking Wounded, was both their most successful, and curiously influential. Soon you couldn\u2019t move for singer-songwriters plying their melancholy trade over drum\u2019n\u2019bass breaks or house beats: everywhere from Olive\u2019s No 1 single You\u2019re Not Alone, to Dido. Roni Size and Reprazent sampled them on their Mercury prize-winning debut album, New Forms. The singer Karen Ramirez covered another old EBTG song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHKVETEnB34\">I Didn\u2019t Know I Was Looking for Love</a>, in the style of Missing and scored a Top 10 hit. Then U2 asked them to support their US stadium tour, news the duo received while staying in an Australian hotel room so sumptuous it had enough space for a grand piano and offered breathtaking views over Perth.</p><p>It was at precisely this point \u2013 when the call came from U2 \u2013 that Thorn pulled the plug on EBTG, with the winningly nonchalant phrase: \u201cActually babe, do you know what? I think I want to stop now.\u201d Always equivocal about the anxiety-inducing task of performing, Thorn was filled with \u201cstomach-churning horror\u201d at the thought of appearing in front of 60,000 U2 fans a night. Moreover, she wanted herself and Watt, a couple since their teens, to start a family. So EBTG turned U2 down, made one more album \u2013 1999\u2019s Temperamental \u2013 did a few shows and that was that.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/10/everything-but-the-girl-on-their-unlikely-return-this-life-came-into-our-music-we-didnt-have-control-over-it\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/10/everything-but-the-girl-on-their-unlikely-return-this-life-came-into-our-music-we-didnt-have-control-over-it", "date_published": "2023-03-10 06:00:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Outlast review \u2013 a brilliant survival show that ends up in full-on Lord of the Flies wildness", "description": "<p>The contestants in Netflix\u2019s addictive new reality show are forced to work together whether they like it or not \u2013 and they really do not like it.
