HN! We are Charly and Bryan, founders of Defer (<a href=\"https://www.defer.run/\">https://www.defer.run/</a>). Defer is a zero-infrastructure background jobs platform for Node.js developers. As a managed platform that brings modern development standards to background jobs (ex: multi-env support, zero-API design), we enable Node.js developers to build products faster and scale without effort and infrastructure knowledge.<p>Background jobs, while being used in all web applications (processing webhooks, interacting with 3rd party APIs, or powering core features), did not benefit from the developer experience improvements that arose in all other layers of the Node.js API stack: quick and reliable databases with Supabase or easy Serverless deployment with Vercel.<p>Today, even for simple use cases, working with background jobs in Node.js necessarily requires some infrastructure knowledge\u2014either by deploying and scaling an open source solution (ex: BullMQ) or using an IaaS such as AWS SQS with Lambdas, which comes with complexity and limited features (no support for dead letter queues, dynamic concurrency, or throttling).<p>At a large scale, you will need to solve how to handle rolling restarts, how to auto-scale your workers, how to safely deploy without interrupting long-running jobs, how to safely encrypt jobs\u2019 data, and how to version them. Once deployed, your background job\u2019s code lives in a separate part of your codebase, with its own mental model (queues and workers). Finally, most solutions provide technical dashboards which are not always helpful in debugging production issues, so you end up having to build custom dashboards.<p>Most companies we talked to try to handle those different aspects, building custom similar solutions and using developers\u2019 time that could have been used on user-facing features.<p>Bryan and I are technical founders with 10+ years of experience working at start-ups of all stages (e.g. Algolia, home of HN Search!), from tech lead to CTO roles. Like many developers, we got asked many times to work on background job stacks and invest time into tailoring and scaling them for product needs.<p>I even dedicated most of my time at Algolia to building a custom background jobs pipeline to power the Algolia Shopify integration: ingesting partial webhooks from Shopify, enriching them given customers configuration, in FIFO order per shop, with the Shopify rate limited API, for thousands of shops and the equivalents of 3 millions of jobs per day. Given the complex and unique product requirements of the Algolia Shopify Ingestion Pipeline, the only solution (at the time and context) was to build a custom background jobs stack combining Redis and Kubernetes.<p>When consulting with some startups, we witnessed some developers choosing to keep some slow API routes calling 3rd party APIs synchronously instead of investing time in setting up background jobs. When looking back to the recent increase of productive zero infrastructure solutions in the Node.js ecosystem, we were surprised that the experience with background jobs remained unchanged. We decided to build Defer, so working with background jobs, CRONs, and workflows would match the current standard of Node.js developer experience.<p>Inspired by Next.js, Remix, and Netlify design, background jobs in Defer become background functions that live in your application\u2019s code, with direct access to all configuration options: retry, concurrency, and more (<a href=\"https://docs.defer.run/features/retries-concurrency/\">https://docs.defer.run/features/retries-concurrency/</a>) , and no specific mental model to learn. Your background functions get continuously deployed from GitHub with support for branch-based environments, allowing you to test new background jobs in no time, before safely moving to production.<p>Defer works for all kinds of Node.js projects, not only serverless ones. It does not require you to learn any new architectures or adapt your system design\u2014you just turn your code into background functions using coding patterns you already know, ex: map-reduce, or recursion. \nDefer brings features such as configurable retries (advanced backoff options), throttling, and concurrency at the background job level, which other solutions either require you to implement yourself or are simply not available. Finally, the Defer Dashboard is the only background jobs Dashboard to allow developers to quickly find executions based on business/product metadata, ex: \u201cShow all executions for `user_id=123`) to quickly debug product issues.<p>Defer\u2019s infrastructure, written in Go, is composed of 3 main components: a Build pipeline, a Scheduler, and a Runner. The Build pipeline enables us to build any Node.js project without requiring any configuration file (<a href=\"https://docs.defer.run/platform/builds/\">https://docs.defer.run/platform/builds/</a>). The Scheduler relies on Postgres for persistent storage of your jobs (no risk of losing some)\u2014all jobs\u2019 data is encrypted\u2014and on Redis, as an atomic counter to handle features such as concurrency and throttling (<a href=\"https://docs.defer.run/platform/executions/\">https://docs.defer.run/platform/executions/</a>). Our infrastructure runs on AWS EC2 - leveraging auto-scaling groups, using the containerd API directly from Go.<p>We run a progressive deployment approach to enable uninterrupted long-running jobs (some of our customers\u2019 jobs run for more than 5h) while releasing updates multiple times a day.\nOnce your application is up and running, the Defer dashboard gives you all the essential information to operate background jobs: activity histograms, performances, and Slack alerting upon failures. The executions list comes with rich filters, allowing you to quickly find all the executions linked to a specific customer or other business metadata.<p>In short, we ensure that you get all the essential features, with the best developer experience, and with a fully managed infrastructure and observability tools so you can focus on building your product.<p>All of this would be meaningless without a free plan for small and side projects and usage-based pricing, so that\u2019s what we offer: <a href=\"https://www.defer.run/pricing\">https://www.defer.run/pricing</a>. If you want to give Defer a try, you can get started with a simple GitHub login, without any credit card information required, and our docs are at <a href=\"https://docs.defer.run\">https://docs.defer.run</a>.<p>We would love to get to read about your experience with doing background jobs in Node.js and feedback on what we\u2019ve built. We look forward to your comments!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35096366\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35096366</a></p>\n<p>Points: 52</p>\n<p>#

Build AI for Testing", "description": "<p>Hey HN,<p>I'm Gabriel, founder of Meticulous.<p>Our mission is to radically accelerate the pace of software development for every company in the world. We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"http://meticulous.ai/\">http://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You\u2019ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach
