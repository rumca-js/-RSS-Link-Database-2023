<p>With technology being such a common part of everyday life, it&rsquo;s important to put certain boundaries in place to protect kids from mature websites and whatnot. If you&rsquo;re a concerned parent and happen to have Microsoft 365, you actually have a wide variety of applications available to you, including something called Family Safety. Family Safety is a Microsoft hub that allows parents to set limits on their child&rsquo;s technology use. There are a few ways to access this app. All you have to do is just follow these simple steps.</p>



<h2><strong>Open family safety through the Microsoft 365 app</strong></h2>



<p>If you have the Microsoft 365 app on your computer, select the blue and purple overlapping circle icon to open the hub. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft 365 logo" class="wp-image-1534328" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/microsoft-365-logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<p>Once you&rsquo;re in Microsoft 365, you&rsquo;ll see a menu on the left-hand side. Click &ldquo;Apps&rdquo; to open up a menu of all Microsoft apps available.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Click &quot;Apps&quot; to open up a menu of all Microsoft apps." class="wp-image-1534331" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/select-apps-in-microsoft-365.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<p>In the Apps menu, select the green icon that says &ldquo;Family Safety&rdquo; next to it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="In the apps menu, you will see a green icon that says &quot;Family Safety&quot; next to it." class="wp-image-1534332" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/select-family-safety-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<p>This will open a browser window that displays all the possible Family Safety options. Simply select the ones you want to set up for your children and follow the prompts.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="How to set up win 11 family safety setup" class="wp-image-1534268" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/family-safety-features-on-microsoft.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<h2><strong>Open family safety on the Microsoft website</strong></h2>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the Microsoft 365 app or you&rsquo;re setting it up from a different computer, you can sign in to your <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/&amp;xcust=2-1-1534243-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft account</a> and get these settings in place from anywhere. On the web page, click the &ldquo;Sign In&rdquo; button on the right to login. You may already be logged in if you&rsquo;ve used Microsoft online before.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Sign in on Microsoft " class="wp-image-1534451" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sign-in-on-microsoft.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<p>After you sign in, return to the main Microsoft page and click the same place to open your account information. When you&rsquo;re on your account page, click the app button on the top left of the screen.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Inside your account page, there is an app button on the top left of the screen." class="wp-image-1534334" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/select-app-launcher-on-left.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<p>After you click the app button, a menu will show up with all your options. &ldquo;Family Safety&rdquo; may be one of the options available in the menu. if so, select it. If not, select &ldquo;All Apps&rdquo; to show more options.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Select family apps on Microsoft" class="wp-image-1534453" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/select-family-safety-app-on-microsoft.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Alex Huebner</p></div>



<p>This method will take you to the same webpage as the 365 method where you can select the features you want to implement for your family. Select the tile you&rsquo;re interested in to have it walk you through the setup and options.</p>

## ‘Play-to-earn’ games are the next target for crypto scammers

<p>There are plenty of games that essentially turn into an unpaid job, or worse, a job that you pay for. <em>World of Warcraft </em>and <em>EVE Online </em>players can relate. But a new crop of &ldquo;play-to-earn&rdquo; games, in which the player can reportedly earn real money (or cryptocurrency that might count as real money) are tempting players desperate to make their leisure time profitable. And, according to the FBI, they&rsquo;re also being targeted by&mdash;who else?&mdash;crypto scammers. </p>



<p>A short post to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA230309&amp;xcust=2-1-1654330-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Internet Crime Complaint Center</a>, spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-warns-of-cryptocurrency-theft-via-play-to-earn-games/&amp;xcust=2-1-1654330-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bleeping Computer</a>, lays out the details. Players are lured to a game where they can allegedly earn cryptocurrency rewards simply by playing and directed to connect a crypto wallet to the game. But it actually works in reverse: The more cryptocurrency the player places in the wallet, the more the game shows the player their &ldquo;rewards,&rdquo; without actually adding any value (such as it is) to the wallet. </p>



<p>Once the player stops depositing cryptocurrency to the wallet, the trap is sprung. The scammer uses the player&rsquo;s wallet credentials, which were input to the game as part of its &ldquo;reward&rdquo; mechanics, to drain the wallet. The money&rsquo;s gone and the game might disappear, too. The player is left with nothing but lost money and time. </p>



<p>Gamers have been targeted by scammers for a long time, but typically the runaround is either stealing in-game assets (annoying, but essentially harmless) or trying to get you to pay real money for fake game currency like <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/blog/top-four-fortnite-scams/23808/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20common,%E2%80%9CEpic%20Games%20Approved%E2%80%9D%20stamps." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fortnite&rsquo;s </em>V-Bucks</a>. These fake play-to-earn games are a new vector, using the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency and the allure of earning money while you play video games to sucker people. Remember, cryptocurrency itself might be the closest thing to fake that you can still report on your taxes, but people put in and take out real money in order to participate.  </p>



<p>The FBI recommends setting up a separate, isolated cryptocurrency wallet if you want to play pay-to-earn games, so as to isolate your main stash of crypto from what you&rsquo;re willing to risk. I have a better idea. Just stay away from any game that purports to let you earn cryptocurrency by playing. The rewards are worth less than a minimum wage job for the time expended <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2022/11/02/blockchain-play-to-earn-games-like-axie-infinity-have-failed-investors-now-what/?sh=4b8c2dfb3b53&amp;xcust=2-1-1654330-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">and the games are generally crap</a> to boot. And that&rsquo;s assuming that you&rsquo;re playing a real one. </p>

</div>


<p>I was a bit surprised when Adata sent the 512GB capacity of its latest Legend 850 NVMe 1.4, M.2 SSD. Larger-capacity drives (1TB, 2TB, and higher) generally achieve better performance numbers because of the greater amount of NAND available for use as secondary cache. </p>



<p>This is what I was thinking when the 512GB Legend 850 lagged on the first two tests. But then, startlingly, the drive managed a 4th-place finish in the 48GB file transfers among all the drives we&rsquo;ve tested, most of which are 1TB and 2TB contenders. This is the test that most mimics real-world use. Color us impressed. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">the best SSDs</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in an SSD, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="adata-legend-850-design-and-specs">Adata Legend 850: Design and specs</h2>



<p>Adata sent us a limited edition Legend 850 styled by German Designer Mister Fred (not <em>Ed</em>.). The colorful floral motif is evocative, though not particularly indicative of digital storage. If it&rsquo;s not to your taste, there&rsquo;s a more mainstream charcoal-gray and gold color scheme, as shown below.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1514027" height="558" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/LEGEND-850-cropped-plain.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Adata&rsquo;s Legend 850 is its more mundane pewter and brass livery.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The 512GB capacity of the Legend 850 we tested costs only $48, but there are also 1TB and 2TB versions available for $90 and $216, respectively. That&rsquo;s a very good price for the 1TB, with the 2TB about par for this class of drive.</p>



<p>The Legend 850 is a 2280 (22x80mm) form factor, M.2, PCIe 4.0 SSD that uses a DRAM-less HBM (host bus memory) design. In other words, it uses some of your system memory for primary caching duties. </p>



<p>Employing an SM2269XT Silicon Motion controller, it was also very smart about allocating NAND for secondary caching purposes (written as 1-bit SLC rather than the 176-layer, 3-bit TLC that&rsquo;s the native capacity of the cells).</p>



<p>The Legend 850 is warrantied for five years, or 500TBW (terabytes written) per 512GB of capacity&mdash;whichever comes first. That&rsquo;s a rather generous TBW rating for the price.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The 512GB Legend 850 really came alive in reading and writing our 48GB single file and data set, besting many drives with 1TB/2TB of NAND.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="adata-legend-850-performance">Adata Legend 850: Performance</h2>



<p>As noted up top, the Legend 850&rsquo;s synthetic benchmark numbers were mixed, with very good read scores and off-the-pace write scores. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1514029" height="524" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/adata-legend-850-CDM8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>Though respectable, the 512GB Legend 850&rsquo;s CrystalDiskMark 8 numbers were slow when it came to writing. Not surprising given that the competition were 1TB and 2TB drives.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>However, the drive really came alive in reading and writing our 48GB single file and data set, besting many drives with 1TB/2TB of NAND. That&rsquo;s no mean feat and likely due to the new Silicon Motion controller&rsquo;s deft handling of secondary cache.</p>



<p></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1514031" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/adata-legend-850-48GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Legend 850 performed exceptionally well in our 48GB transfers despite being only a 512GB drive. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Legend 850 came back down to earth in our 450GB write after a very good start. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1514030" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/adata-legend-850-450GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>There&rsquo;s just no getting around the fact that it only had 62GB of NAND to spare in this particular test. You can see in the screen capture below that performance dropped quite a bit after the 100GB mark and again at around 350GB. </p>



<p>However, it dropped only to around 450MBps, which while not NVMe-like, is not the slothful hard drive pace we&rsquo;ve seen from some SSDs writing off cache.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1514028" height="745" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-12-at-9.05.40-AM.png" width="1024" /><figcaption>Where the Legend 850 couldn&rsquo;t  escape its relative small capacity was when writing our single large 450GB file. Still, the result is hardly tragic compared to some.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Note also that the Legend 850 formatted and optimized very quickly. Some bargain-level drives will take a comparative lifetime to perform these operations.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Internal drive tests currently utilize Windows 11 64-bit running on an MSI MEG X570/AMD Ryzen 3700X combo with four 16GB Kingston 2666MHz DDR4 modules, a Zotac (Nvidia) GT 710 1GB x2 PCIe graphics card, and an ASMedia ASM3242 USB 3.2&times;2 card. Copy tests utilize an ImDisk RAM disk using 58GB of the 64GB total memory.</em></p><p><em>Each test is performed on a newly formatted and TRIM&rsquo;d drive so the results are optimal. Over time, as a drive fills up, performance will decrease due to less NAND for caching and other factors.</em> </p><p><em>The performance numbers shown apply only to the drive we were shipped and of the capacity tested. SSD performance can vary by capacity due to more or fewer chips to shotgun reads/writes across and the amount of NAND available for secondary caching.</em> <em>Vendors also occasionally swap components, and Adata did not exempt this drive from the practice. If you ever notice a large discrepancy between the performance you experience, and that which we report (systems being roughly equal), please let us know.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-adata-legend-850">Should you buy the Adata Legend 850?</h2>



<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re not likely to want a 512GB Legend 850 for your main SSD in a fast gaming or creative PC. But for the average bargain PC or laptop it&rsquo;s very nice foundation or upgrade. </p>

<p>When it comes to marathon gaming session, a comfortable headset can make a world of difference. Personally, I&rsquo;m a massive fan of memory foam ear cups. I can&rsquo;t function without them. So, if you&rsquo;re looking to pick up a comfortable headset on the cheap, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Amazon&rsquo;s selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Cloud-Core-Detachable-Cancelling/dp/B08HQW9SGP&amp;xcust=2-1-1654353-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">HyperX Cloud Core wired gaming headset for $29.99</a>, which is a massive 57 percent off of the original $69.99 price. It&rsquo;s a phenomenal value. Let&rsquo;s dive in then.</p>



<p>We reviewed the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/820732/hyperx-cloud-core-wireless-review-a-quality-gaming-headset-without-the-fuss.html">wireless version</a> of this headset back in August and we loved it so much that we awarded it four and a half stars plus an Editor&rsquo;s Choice award. We liked the clear mids and highs, the durable design, and the comfortable earcups with memory foam cushioning (heck yeah). The wired version has much of the same features. You&rsquo;re getting 3D audio spatialization (in which the sound surrounds you), a detachable noise cancelling microphone, and an aluminum frame design. It&rsquo;s also compatible with PC and PS4.</p>



<p>This is a fantastic deal. If you&rsquo;re looking for a reasonably priced gaming headset, the HyperX Cloud Core is the one to pick.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re used to working with multiple computer monitors at your desk, traveling with a laptop can be tough. Suddenly, you&rsquo;re back to the single-screen lifestyle, and on a cramped laptop display to boot. Fortunately, though, there&rsquo;s a free way to use old iPads, Android tablets, or even other laptops as extra monitors for your Windows PC. </p>



<p>The solution is a utility called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.spacedesk.net/&amp;xcust=2-1-1526926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Spacedesk</a>. It may not be the only multi-monitor software out there, but it&rsquo;s the most versatile free option I&rsquo;ve found so far.</p>



<h2 id="installing-spacedesk-for-windows">Installing Spacedesk for Windows</h2>



<p>Spacedesk consists of two parts:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Spacedesk&rsquo;s Driver software</strong> runs in the background on your PC and connects to your other screens. You can install it f<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.spacedesk.net/&amp;xcust=2-1-1526926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">rom the Spacedesk website</a>. Note that you&rsquo;ll need to make a firewall exception for Spacedesk to work. An option to do so is included in the installation process.</li><li><strong>Spacedesk&rsquo;s Viewer apps</strong> can be launched on other devices, at which point your PC will recognize them as additional monitors. Apps are available for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/spacedesk/9NBLGGH4TRM4?hl=en-us&amp;gl=us&amp;activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab&amp;xcust=2-1-1526926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spacedesk-datronicsoft/id1069217220&amp;xcust=2-1-1526926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">iOS</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ph.spacedesk.beta&amp;xcust=2-1-1526926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Android</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H377LBT&amp;xcust=2-1-1526926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Amazon devices</a>, and any other device <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://viewer.spacedesk.net/&amp;xcust=2-1-1526926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">via the web viewer</a>.</li></ul>

<p>The server connection works over Wi-Fi. Once you&rsquo;ve installed the Driver software, open the Viewer app. Spacedesk should recognize your computer automatically if it&rsquo;s on the same Wi-Fi network, so you can select it and launch second-screen mode.</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Monitor selection in Windows 11" class="wp-image-1526934" height="812" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/windowselection.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>By default, Spacedesk doesn&rsquo;t scale up any display elements, which can make things look too small on your extra screen.</p>



<p>To fix this, head to <em>Windows Settings &gt; System &gt; Display</em>, select your new display from the list of monitors, then try adjusting both the display resolution and scaling to a more comfortable level.</p>



<p>Also, note that by default, the Spacedesk Driver will always launch when your computer boots up. To change this, right-click on Spacedesk&rsquo;s taskbar icon, select &ldquo;Spacedesk driver console,&rdquo; then uncheck the box that says &ldquo;Automatic Start at System Boot Time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Make sure to configure your monitors in Windows as well. Head to <em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Display</em>, and you&rsquo;ll see a layout of all your screens, which you can drag and drop to reflect their actual positioning at your desk. Now you can move your mouse in the direction of your additional screens, and they&rsquo;ll be right where you expect them.</p>



<p>In the Viewer app, you can also click the Gear icon and select Settings for additional options, including screen resolution and quality.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Spacedesk quality options on iOS" class="wp-image-1526937" height="847" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spacedeskquality.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Unfortunately, Spacedesk only supports wired USB connections on Android devices, and the company has indicated that this may become a premium feature in the future. But even over a wireless connection, Spacedesk is good enough for referencing emails, documents, or team chats alongside your main windows. It also has no issues playing video in sync with system audio.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in exploring more multi-monitor apps, here are a few to consider:</p>

It eliminates the cursor lag typically found on other solutions, so it&rsquo;s a compelling alternative for graphic design or any other application where fine-grained input is important.</li><li><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.duetdisplay.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1526926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Duet Display</a> supports both wired and wireless connections, but requires a subscription starting at $25 per year.</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab owners can take advantage of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/831794/how-to-use-samsungs-galaxy-tab-as-a-second-pc-display.html">Samsung&rsquo;s Second Screen app</a>, turning the tablet into a secondary computer monitor at no charge.</li><li>For Mac users, the built-in Sidecar feature lets you use an iPad as a space screen. You can activate it through Control Center by hitting the &ldquo;Display&rdquo; button, then selecting your iPad. Alternatively, hover your cursor over the green full screen button on any window, than choose the option to move it to your iPad.</li></ul>



<p>For most people, though, Spacedesk is a great free option for those times when a single screen won&rsquo;t suffice.</p>
