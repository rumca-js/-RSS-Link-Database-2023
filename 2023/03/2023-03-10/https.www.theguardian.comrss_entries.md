## Becoming Frida Kahlo review – this joyful celebration makes the artist fascinating in a whole new way

<p>The seemingly impossible is managed by this gripping three-part series: shining a new light on the Mexican icon. It’s packed with love, art and politics – there’s almost too much to take in</p><p>Too often, documentaries about art and artists can lean towards the pretentious and stodgy. Not so with Becoming Frida Kahlo, the first of a three-part series on the legendary Mexican painter, which canters along at a celebratory pace. This opening episode, The Making and Breaking, squashes a great deal of information and insight about Kahlo’s early life into an hour, and sets up a gripping and convincing portrait of the great artist that she would become.</p><p>Her work is so familiar (and so astonishingly valuable – her 1949 painting Diego y yo sold for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/nov/17/frida-kahlo-self-portrait-sold-for-record-34m-at-auction">almost $35m</a> in 2021) that it seems a mammoth task to shine a new light on it, and yet this documentary manages to do so. There are interviews with biographers, art historians, and, fascinatingly, family members. Kahlo’s great-niece Cristina Kahlo, now a photographer, talks about the artist’s husband and great love, the artist Diego Rivera, as does Rivera’s grandson. The information they provide is out there already – Rivera was a huge celebrity in Mexico, as famous as Picasso in his time (“<em>possibly</em> Picasso was more famous”, says one contributor) – yet it gives it a personal and comprehensive feel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/10/becoming-frida-kahlo-review-joyful-portrayal-of-mexican-art-icon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jeremy Hunt has little to offer a country battered by austerity and venal politics </p><p>On one thing, politicians, economists and commentators on the left and right can agree: Britain is broken. Not as in the silly, smirking slogan used by David Cameron in opposition, but in the most basic sense. This winter, sick people have died <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/01/up-to-500-deaths-a-week-due-to-ae-delays-says-senior-medic" title="">in the hours that it took for ambulances to arrive.</a> This week’s cold snap has again forced many families across the UK to debate whether to heat their homes or feed themselves. On Wednesday, as Jeremy Hunt delivers his budget in parliament, teachers in England and Wales, junior doctors, civil servants, university staff and tube drivers will all be <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/news/employment/march-15-strike-from-tube-workers-to-teachers-whos-on-strike-on-wednesday/" title="">on strike</a>.</p><p>The newish chancellor is not even pretending next week’s measures will fix these problems. Perhaps such candour is to his credit. What is shaming is that he doesn’t even try. Getting to the root causes of big issues and turfing out dogma has never been Mr Hunt’s style. To take one example: the Treasury will almost certainly keep down fuel bills by maintaining the energy price guarantee. A U-turn on the policy announced in the autumn by No 11, ministers will hail this as compassionate conservatism – the state mitigating the pain of ordinary people. Yet bills will still be twice what they were in 2021, and the government will once again hand over taxpayer money to energy suppliers in a privatised market that has comprehensively failed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/10/the-guardian-view-on-the-budget-no-easy-fixes-for-a-broken-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Australia opener’s astonishing 10-hour century threatened records and put the tourists on top in Ahmedabad</p><p>There are times, on a placid batting pitch, when a good performance can’t win you a match but the lack of one can lose you a match. There are times when a good innings is an achievement that belongs on the standard tier, but continuing it elevates it to the realm of the special.</p><p>When Australia lost two wickets relatively quickly in the final session of day one in Ahmedabad, having chosen to bat in the fourth and final Border-Gavaskar Test, a position of 170 for four could easily have become an insufficient total on a surface where the threat level was beige. By the time the next wicket fell about 22 hours later, Usman Khawaja and Cameron Green had made that score 378 for five, wearing down India’s bowlers for the lower order. When the Australian innings was said and done, the team had made 480 and taken two days out of the game.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/10/usman-khawaja-australia-india-test-cricket-special">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Architect best known for the rhythmic concrete forms of the Birmingham Rep</p><p>In the 1950s, traditional theatres seemed doomed in the face of television, as Royals, Empires and Alhambras across Britain closed and were demolished. Yet this was only half the story, for at the same time small repertory theatres, working in local communities with their own companies of young actors, were flourishing. Their model was the Birmingham Rep, founded in 1913 and where Laurence Olivier, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/08/albert-finney-obituary">Albert Finney</a>, Julie Christie and many others started their careers. Such was its success that by the 60s it sought a larger building, and turned to Graham Winteringham, a local architect.</p><p>The new Rep opened in October 1971. Winteringham, who has died aged 99, brought to central Birmingham the sinuous, rhythmic concrete forms made fashionable by the Brazilian architect <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/dec/06/oscar-niemeyer-obituary">Oscar Niemeyer</a> – far more inviting than the brutalism found in most British cities. The huge areas of glass illuminate the foyers, an enticing, sparkling sight when lit up from within at night. The interior posed a more difficult brief. Winteringham had to provide 900 seats on a single, egalitarian level while maintaining a sense of intimacy and good sightlines. There were two lobbies for latecomers to watch the show, as well as bars and a cafe that also became popular destinations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/10/graham-winteringham-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Sainsbury Centre, Norwich<br /></strong>Orca whale totem poles and otter masks feature in this eye-opening exhibition of a culture in which ‘every man was his own Leonardo’ </p><p>When the artist Simeon Stilthda saw a picture of Egypt’s Great Sphinx in a missionary bible in the 1870s, he carved his own version of it. Stilthda was a member of the Haida people in the Pacific Northwest of the Americas and his carving was a tribute from the indigenous culture of this region to ancient Egypt, thousands of miles and years away. It’s not just a wonderful sculpture – round the back, the Sphinx has a Haida hairstyle – but a piece of art theory in wood. Stilthda draws eye-opening parallels between his community’s religious art and that of the Pharaohs.</p><p>Like the ancient Egyptians who conjoined a human and lion to create the Sphinx, the Indigenous peoples of North America’s Pacific Northwest have a magical eye for nature. This compelling exhibition transports you to vast coniferous forests and the open ocean where humans and animals are close. This style of Pacific Northwest art, with its blocky curved patterns, appears to emulate the black and white markings of one of the region’s ruling creatures, the killer whale. Not only do orcas feature on totem poles along with birds mythic and real, but their “abstract” appearance is reflected in a style that brilliantly stretches and warps reality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/10/empowering-art-review-indigenous-masterworks-full-of-wonder-and-sorrow">Continue reading...</a>

And, in a way, he was a player hopelessly out of his time: a pure No 10 coming through at the turn of the century, just as they were disappearing from the game.</p><p>A maverick and a thrill-seeker in a sport tending increasingly towards regimentation. Good enough to be at Milan without ever being good enough to play for them. Even when he dropped down to third-division Lecco on loan, he fell out with manager Roberto Donadoni. His ability with a ball was never in doubt; his ability to adapt always was. “I am a dreamer,” he would later tell La Gazzetta dello Sport. “Very ambitious, honest but unstable, impatient and fiercely volcanic.” For De Zerbi, football had to be played his way if it was worth doing at all.

In my 30s, I developed <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lupus/" title="">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>, which went undiagnosed for several years, my symptoms wrongly diagnosed by (male) GPs as stress triggered by a high-powered job.

I believed them: my mood invariably deteriorated during flare-ups, and when I was well, I felt wonderful.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/10/are-male-doctors-quick-to-diagnose-mental-illness-in-women">Continue reading...</a>

Don’t rush this decision</p><p><strong>I’m torn between two places – London (my current home)</strong><strong> and New Zealand, where my parents and sibling live. I’m a mixed race 29-year-old female, and moved around a lot as a child. My family settled in New Zealand when I was eight</strong><strong> despite having zero connections there. In my early 20s, I left home to move to Australia, then London. Initially, I never wanted to go back to New Zealand as I felt isolated</strong><strong> there as a teenager.</strong></p><p><strong>When I first moved to London I started with nothing, but eventually</strong><strong> landed a great job and developed close friendships</strong><strong>. This took time and was not easy, especially in the midst of a pandemic.

## Wine: the joy of blends | Fiona Beckett on drinks

<p>Oenophiles are often sniffy about blends, but some of the world’s most admired wines are clever mixes of different grape varieties</p><p>Do you feel daunted when you don’t see the name of the grape variety on the label of a bottle of wine? It’s become so commonplace that it may be the first thing you look for, but the truth is, many of the wines with which you may be most familiar, including bordeaux, côtes du rhône and rioja, are made from more than one variety.</p><p>Blends have many advantages. Just as with a recipe for a dish, a winemaker can combine different components to make a more harmoniously satisfying whole. And if it’s a bad year for one variety, say, you can simply bump up another. This is particularly true of bordeaux, where the proportions of merlot, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc habitually vary depending on the weather. Other varieties that are natural bedfellows are sauvignon blanc and semillon, which you find in sauternes and white bordeaux, Rhône varietals grenache, syrah and mourvèdre (otherwise known as GSM, especially in Australia); and chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier, the usual triumvirate of varieties found in champagne and similar sparkling wines. Even wines that appear to be made from one variety may include only 85% of it (or 75% in the US). Even a small amount of another variety can make a significant difference, especially in the case of headily aromatic muscat, or <em>moscato</em>, which needs the addition of only a few percent to give the wine an exotically perfumed lift.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/10/wine-the-art-of-blending-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

## Miley Cyrus: Endless Summer Vacation review – gossip, grit and glorious pop

<p><strong>(Columbia)<br /></strong>After years trying to reconcile chart success with her leftfield musical instincts, the singer has delivered a hazily atmospheric album that plays to her provocative strengths</p><p>It says something about the degree of anticipation around Miley Cyrus’s eighth studio album that it was leaked, turning up on illegal download sites a good 24 hours before its official release. It’s a phenomenon that feels faintly old-fashioned. You might have thought the whole business of leaking albums belonged to a past era, before streaming supplanted downloads, and that people are now largely happy to adhere to the schedule knowing they’ll be able to stream the album for free when it arrives.</p><p>But apparently there are exceptions. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/27/miley-cyrus-flowers-breakup-anthem">Such is the power</a> of a hit like Endless Summer Vacation’s lead single, Flowers. It’s hit No 1 everywhere from Poland to Paraguay, seven weeks and counting at the top of the British charts, its lyrics and video painstakingly scanned by a media and fanbase eager to discover references to Cyrus’s ex-husband Liam Hemsworth, three years after their divorce.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/10/miley-cyrus-endless-summer-vacation-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>David Harewood and Florence Pugh narrate this incisive collection, edited by the author’s son</p><p>The late spy novelist John le Carré wasn’t a fan of the telephone and was, by his own admission, a poor typist. As a result, much of his communication was done via handwritten letters and, later in life, the occasional email. In this collection, compiled, edited and annotated by the author’s son Tim Cornwell (who died last summer as the book was going to press), we get snapshots of a man whose life was, in one way or another, about deception and fabrication. The letters span seven decades, stretching from his schooldays at Sherborne in Dorset, to his final years mostly spent at his Cornish home, and show the many incarnations of le Carré: abandoned son (his mother left when he was five, after which he was raised by his con artist father), spy (at MI5 and MI6), renowned writer, husband, adulterer.</p><p>Actors <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-harewood">David Harewood</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/florence-pugh">Florence Pugh</a> are the book’s narrators, both presumably chosen on account of having starred in TV adaptations of le Carré stories. While Pugh narrates the biographical sections, written by Cornwell to provide context, Harewood reads the letters, revealing le Carré as incisive, self-assured and opinionated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/10/a-private-spy-audiobook-review-the-letters-of-john-le-carre">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s hardly their fault that £7.60 for a single slice of eggy bread with one sliced strawberry seems to be the going rate these days</p><p>Bromley, to the south-east of London, hasn’t made cultural waves since 1976, when the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie Sioux and the “Bromley Contingent” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TnmuIhIueQ">called Bill Grundy a “dirty fucker” live on ITV</a>. Bromley, I learned at an early age, was where the punks came from. It later transpired that Siouxsie actually came from Chislehurst and others in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromley_Contingent">the Bromley Contingent</a> were from the likes of Orpington, Burnt Oak and Highgate, although it was Bromley that, in the nation’s eyes, carried the can as a hotbed of cultural dissent, potty mouths and septic piercings.</p><p>I’d have loved to have been a fly on the wall in the town hall at the time: the scandal and rumpus must have been terrific. More recently, however, this grade II-listed building has been subjected to an extremely tasteful renovation, preserving all the ostentatiousness of a 1906 local government building, with its fluted concrete columns, stained-glass windows and vaulted doors, while reviving the walls and panelling with litres of soothing, pseudo-Soho House shades of sage-green, pale biscuit, shimmering gold and ombré.

<p>A Good House for Children by Kate Collins; White Cat, Black Dog by Kelly Link; The Curator by Owen King; The Space Between Us by Doug Johnstone</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/a-good-house-for-children-9781788169301?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">A Good House for Children </a>by</strong> <strong>Kate Collins</strong> <strong>(</strong><strong>Serpent’s Tail, £14.99</strong><strong>)<br /></strong>The isolated old house on a cliff in Dorset was never Orla’s dream, but her husband Nick is sure it’s the best place to raise their two small children: she agrees, before realising he plans still to work in Bristol all week. Back in 1976, Lydia has no desire to leave London, but accompanies her grieving, recently widowed employer for support, as nanny to her four children. The dream house in the country is a fictional standard for illuminating the realities of women’s domestic life; when the dream turns to nightmare, it’s the perfect setting for horror. This accomplished debut works on both levels as it tells two stories separated in time but linked by situation. Atmospheric and beautifully written, it builds slowly but surely into a terrifying ghost story.<strong><br /></strong><br /></p><p><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/white-cat-black-dog-9781804548400?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">White Cat, Black Dog</a> by</strong> <strong>Kelly Link (Ad Astra, £20)<br /></strong>Her first collection since 2015’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/25/get-in-trouble-kelly-link-review-short-story-collection"> Get in Trouble</a>, this is Link’s most direct engagement with the fairytales and folk legends that have always inspired her work. The seven stories display the author’s inimitable blend of fantasy and realism: psychologically acute, funny and horrific by turns, they range from far-future SF in the Iain M Banks mode to ghostly romance. All involve journeys, relationships and a search for something or someone important. Individually, they are as intense, absorbing and weird as the best dreams.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/10/the-best-recent-science-fiction-and-fantasy-reviews-roundup">Continue reading...</a>

## The Whale is not a masterpiece – it’s a joyless, harmful fantasy of fat squalor

<p>The Oscar nomination for The Whale must mean it’s great, right? Wrong! It is a shallow and stigmatising reflection of thin people’s assumptions about fat bodies</p><p>I hadn’t planned on engaging with The Whale. In fact, one of my fat friends and I joked extensively about how much we were not, under any circumstances, going to shine our light on The Whale, no disrespect to the fat writers who chose to do so. Why would we? There is nothing new in it, as much as its director, Darren Aronofsky, believes he has made a novel masterpiece of fat humanity. Every bit of The Whale is old.</p><p>However, I changed my mind about watching The Whale when another friend (a thin one, so you can take him seriously!) texted me, fresh out of a pre-release screening, that it was one of the worst, stupidest movies he’d seen in years. Well, now I was intrigued! The hype around The Whale – in particular Brendan Fraser’s Oscar-nominated performance – had been so self-serious, so high-minded, I’d assumed it was a well-made art film whose creators just happened to have chosen a subject matter they likely weren’t equipped to handle. But to find out it was simply <em>bad</em>? The thought of gilded Academy voters weeping over a video of Fraser in a fat suit choking on a meatball sub gave me a strange pleasure. The joke, suddenly, was on them. Delicious as a Cheeto sandwich sprayed with ranch dressing, a meal that The Whale’s protagonist eats while crying. Standing ovation! LOL.

But then they develop long Covid at the height of the pandemic, meaning they no longer had the lung capacity to run, let alone live independently. If that was your experience, you’re likely to think the government didn’t do enough to protect children from Covid-19, or vaccinate them fast enough.</p><p>On the other hand, what if your child developed an eating disorder due to social isolation and depression? In that case, you might think that lockdown measures were disproportionate. If you lost a loved one to the disease, then you might blame government for doing too little. If your small business of 20 years shut down, you might blame government for doing too much.</p><p>Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/10/pandemic-mental-health-covid-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While recovering from cancer, an amateur photographer found solace capturing the insects – including his stunning signature ‘take off’ shots</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p>Five years ago, at summer’s end, Andrew Fusek Peters was diagnosed with bowel cancer. “I was waiting for surgery, feeling really ill, sitting in my garden. It was amazing weather and there were painted lady butterflies everywhere,” he says. “They were a symbol of fragile life, of hope and defiance, and something appealed to my soul.”</p><p>A children’s author and poet who had become a keen amateur photographer, as Peters watched the butterflies and idly wondered if he could capture them in flight. It swiftly became an obsession as he recovered from a successful operation to remove the cancer. In recent summers, he has travelled the length and breadth of Britain to photograph all 58 native species of butterfly, from the ubiquitous small tortoiseshell to the rare and elusive high brown fritillary. Now the fruits of those summers have been published in a beautiful new book.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/10/one-mans-incredible-photos-of-all-58-of-britains-native-butterflies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Injuries cost defender months of action and World Cup spot but he is back to best at timely moment for club and country</p><p>A mundane win over Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League was drawing to a close when Ben Chilwell’s small supply of luck ran out. His punishment for attempting one last sprint was to feel the pain shooting up his left hamstring and, as he lay on the turf in front of the West Stand at Stamford Bridge, receiving treatment from the physios and listening to some consoling words from Mason Mount, the Chelsea defender struggled to keep the emotions at bay.</p><p>There were tears in Chilwell’s eyes when he got back to his feet and hobbled off. All those lonely hours in the treatment room at Cobham; all they added up to was more heartbreak. Barely a year had passed since Chilwell had been in a similar situation. A damaged anterior cruciate ligament injury, sustained towards the end of Chelsea’s 4-0 win over Juventus in the Champions League in November 2021, was behind him. He was fit again and pushing for a place in England’s squad for the World Cup. Another injury felt cruel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/10/ben-chilwell-making-up-for-lost-time-to-lift-chelsea-and-nudge-southgate">Continue reading...</a>

The song is called Sheriff of the Salton Sea, and it captures the mood of the record perfectly: the Salton Sea is a saltwater lake in southern California, whose waters and shores have been despoiled by human exploitation, despite it being a short drive from Palm Springs, that Californian symbol of turning the desert into a playground.</p><p>Manzanita is an album about the contrast between beauty and desolation.

<p>The BBC Newsnight reporter looks at what led to the closure of the Tavistock Centre, and what it means to be transgender</p><p>There are knowns, as the saying goes, and there are known unknowns. But most difficult of all, perhaps, are the things we can’t know for sure, but must still make definitive judgments about. The latter form the heart of the BBC journalist Hannah Barnes’s densely reported account of events inside the Tavistock Centre’s Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) in London, the country’s only specialist clinic for transgender children, where, as one clinician tells her, it was “impossible to be sure” of getting decisions 100% right, but mistakes had frightening consequences.</p><p>The book traces Gids’s evolution from its foundation in 1989 – offering a non-judgmental therapeutic approach to exploring gender identity, and serving a handful of mainly natal boys – to a modern service swamped by demand, much of it from natal girls, providing a gateway for the prescription of puberty-blocking drugs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/10/time-to-think-by-hannah-barnes-review-inside-britains-only-clinic-for-trans-children">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author uses her first-hand experience of migration to examine the flaws and hypocrisies of the asylum system</p><p>The question driving Dina Nayeri’s latest book, “who gets believed?”, is deceptively simple. The Iranian-American novelist, once a child refugee, weaves stories from her own life with those people who were wrongly denied asylum in the UK and US. In doing so, she shows how “the accident of birth, the privilege of race, class, and nationality” often trumps “data, history, science, and reason” when it comes to whose voices are heard, and whose truths acknowledged. The consequences can be devastating.</p><p>The book is instantly gripping, opening with the story of a Sri Lankan refugee known only as KV. He arrived in Britain in 2011 as an asylum seeker with scars on his back and an account of being tortured by the Sri Lankan government. Despite the support of medical experts, his asylum claim was rejected. KV was accused of inflicting the injuries on himself, kickstarting an eight-year legal battle that reached the UK supreme court.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/10/who-gets-believed-by-dina-nayeri-review-the-kafkaesque-ordeal-faced-by-refugees">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘It’s its own little world!’: why we should learn to love the Oscars more

<p>With the relevancy of the Oscars still in question before this week’s event, writer Michael Schulman explains why they should be examined rather than ignored</p><p>It happens every year, as sure as the changing of the seasons. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announces their slate of nominations, and much to the good-natured chagrin of writer Michael Schulman, the irresolvable debate over whether the Oscars still matter is reignited. “I think the Oscars are a lot of fun!” the New Yorker staffer tells the Guardian. “It’s funny to me how people keep questioning the purpose of the Academy Awards; you never hear anyone doing that with the Super Bowl, you know? No one ever asks whether the Super Bowl is ‘important’. It’s enough to just be something people like that keeps happening!”</p><p>His new book Oscar Wars: A History of Hollywood in Gold, Sweat, and Tears makes the case for Hollywood’s biggest night as more than a self-evident good time, however. In an exhaustively detailed history oriented around a dozen or so pivotal ceremonies, his astute analyses reveal these glam-a-paloozas to be telling case studies integral to understanding the past and gaining perspective on the present. In each telecast, campaign, snub and upset, students of show business can seemingly learn about everything: America’s shifting social mores, upper-echelon economics of the industry, the influence of new technologies. Touched by war, the red scare, counterculture, and the constant tug-of-war between liberalism and conservatism, the evolution of the Academy and its glitzy annual blowout doubles as a potted history of 20th-century politics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/10/oscar-wars-book-academy-awards-history-michael-schulman">Continue reading...</a>

I’ve watched 50 of his recent <a href="https://rumble.com/c/russellbrand">videos</a>, with growing incredulity. He appears to have switched from challenging injustice to conjuring phantoms.

<p>They went from leftist outsiders to huge dance-pop stars, then walked away when stadiums came calling. Back after 24 years, Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt explain how lockdowns led to a new album – and why they’ve embraced Auto-Tune</p><p>In early 1997, Everything But the Girl were at the height of their fame. Fifteen years into their career, they had executed a remarkable turnaround in fortunes. Ben Watt and Tracey Thorn had been dropped by their label after the release of their 1994 album, Amplified Heart, only to see a Todd Terry remix of its track Missing belatedly become a vast global hit: No 2 in the US, double platinum in the UK, topping the charts for weeks around Europe. Their ensuing album, 1995’s Walking Wounded, was both their most successful, and curiously influential. Soon you couldn’t move for singer-songwriters plying their melancholy trade over drum’n’bass breaks or house beats: everywhere from Olive’s No 1 single You’re Not Alone, to Dido. Roni Size and Reprazent sampled them on their Mercury prize-winning debut album, New Forms. The singer Karen Ramirez covered another old EBTG song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHKVETEnB34">I Didn’t Know I Was Looking for Love</a>, in the style of Missing and scored a Top 10 hit. Then U2 asked them to support their US stadium tour, news the duo received while staying in an Australian hotel room so sumptuous it had enough space for a grand piano and offered breathtaking views over Perth.</p><p>It was at precisely this point – when the call came from U2 – that Thorn pulled the plug on EBTG, with the winningly nonchalant phrase: “Actually babe, do you know what? I think I want to stop now.” Always equivocal about the anxiety-inducing task of performing, Thorn was filled with “stomach-churning horror” at the thought of appearing in front of 60,000 U2 fans a night. Moreover, she wanted herself and Watt, a couple since their teens, to start a family. So EBTG turned U2 down, made one more album – 1999’s Temperamental – did a few shows and that was that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/10/everything-but-the-girl-on-their-unlikely-return-this-life-came-into-our-music-we-didnt-have-control-over-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The contestants in Netflix’s addictive new reality show are forced to work together whether they like it or not – and they really do not like it. No wonder all hell breaks loose …</p><p>The 16 contestants selected for new reality show Outlast, who will compete to survive in Alaska’s freezing wilderness for an $11m prize, are “lone wolves”, which I think is American for “introverts with outdoor skills”. Some of them (and I’m naming no names, not least because it is near-impossible to tell them apart under 20 layers of survivalwear apiece) are clearly deluded alpha males, who last about 10 minutes before the medivac team is called in to administer internet and coffee. But the rest – most of whom attest to hardscrabble childhoods spent under the wings of semi-prepper grandpappies, or in impoverished towns surrounded by woodland that offered a more hospitable environment once you’d learned how to purify water and set snares for dinner – are the real deal. Yoga instructor Amber learned a wider set of survival skills during her time as a heroin addict and felon, and after “being shot in the face by the man I loved”. You have to put her in with a chance.</p><p>The twist is that these lone wolves must form teams and work together in order to win. No one who crosses the finish line alone will qualify for the prize. It is the American ideal of togetherness and/or the sadism the country would like to perpetrate upon its introverts. <em>E pluribus unum</em>, whether you like it or not.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/10/outlast-review-a-brilliant-survival-show-that-ends-up-in-full-on-lord-of-the-flies-wildness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>They know our first sympathy must be with Ukraine, as is theirs. But they need our support in this time of repression</p><p>Last April, Masha Moskaleva, a 12-year-old girl from the Tula region south of Moscow, drew a picture in her school art class that <a href="https://en.ovdinfo.org/father-jail-his-daughter-orphanage">upset the teacher</a>.

Her father, a single parent, was arrested, beaten, fined and placed under house arrest. His daughter was taken into state care.</p><p>Moskaleva’s crime was “discrediting the military” – an offence passed into law after the invasion of Ukraine to criminalise dissemination of the truth.

<p>Rishi Sunak has promised to stop people crossing the Channel in small boats but his planned law has been called inhumane and unworkable</p><p>When Rishi Sunak set out his five policy priorities at the start of the year he was attempting not just to relaunch his premiership but to set out a platform that he hoped would enable his party to recover lost supporters. One of those priorities was to set out how he would stop small boats bringing people across the Channel. This week he unveiled that plan: those who cross into Britain outwith ‘safe and legal’ routes would be detained, deported and banned for life from ever achieving citizenship.</p><p>As <strong>Sunder Katwala</strong>, director of <a href="https://www.britishfuture.org/">British Future</a>, tells <strong>Hannah Moore, </strong>this new policy builds on the government’s controversial plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda while their claims are processed. So far not a single person has made that journey after the planned deportations hit legal challenges. The latest iteration has been criticised as inhumane and unworkable and critics suggest that may be the point: is Sunak’s government more concerned with looking tough than in actually solving the problem of tens of thousands of desperate people making that perilous Channel crossing each year?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/mar/10/is-stop-the-boats-a-slogan-without-a-solution-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Liverpool have the chance for strikers to build some momentum, while Antonio Conte is on borrowed time at Spurs</p><p>Antonio Conte’s performance the season he won the league with Chelsea was spectacularly brilliant, but things have moved on since then. No team bar Conte’s Chelsea has won the Premier League playing three at the back; the standard at the top of the table is far higher now than it was then. Of the current top five, only Conte’s Spurs play a plodding, cautious, constipated style that makes watching them an imposition. Much as Conte likes to trumpet his achievement in qualifying Spurs for the Champions League, they were poor last season, it just so happened other teams were worse, and their run in the competition served only to show how far off his team are – despite a summer spend of roughly £150m ­– and how far off he is, having made the last eight once in six attempts. Conte is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/08/predictable-spurs-reach-the-end-in-europe-with-conte-looking-out-of-time">a man out of time</a>, and another poor result this weekend might just mean the end. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p><p><em>Tottenham v Nottingham Forest, Saturday 3pm (all times GMT)</em></p><p><em>Bournemouth v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p><p><em>Leicester v Chelsea, Saturday, 3pm</em></p><p><em>Fulham v Arsenal, Sunday 2pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/10/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>
