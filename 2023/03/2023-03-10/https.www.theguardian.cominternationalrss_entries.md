## Nine teams split by six points: inside Premier League’s tight relegation scrap

<p>From Crystal Palace in 12th to bottom-placed Bournemouth clubs are fighting for survival. We take a team-by-team look at how it shapes up</p><p>With only six points separating the bottom nine, Palace are closer to 20th-placed Bournemouth than 11th-placed Aston Villa. Ominously, Patrick Vieira’s young side have developed downward momentum and have gone nine league games without victory. They are seeking their first win of 2023 and continue to miss last season’s Chelsea loanee midfielder Conor Gallagher. Vieira, ever sensible and intelligent, reacted to the concession of seven goals in two games against Tottenham and Chelsea at the turn of the year by swapping a high press for cagey, deep-sitting counterattacking tactics and the defence has tightened accordingly. Yet too many potentially key individuals, the inconsistent forward Eberechi Eze among them, are struggling for form and the goals have dried up for the top tier’s lowest transfer market spenders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/10/premier-league-relegation-scrap-nine-teams-six-points">Continue reading...</a>

Whoever says it isn’t that exciting doesn’t understand the beauty of the film and its subtext. I’ve never seen such a positive portrayal of Judaism on screen that celebrates the unique lives we lead. When I came home the evening after watching it, I realised the only future that I can ever have is in filmmaking. This is what films are made for, to inspire. Janusz Kaminski’s cinematography is incredible and captures such nostalgia within the frame, and John Williams’ score elevates this into being heavenly. Uncle Boris is my spirit animal, and the Jesus jokes are hilarious. <strong>Jacob Epstein, 19, London</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/10/anything-but-avatar-readers-picks-for-the-2023-oscars">Continue reading...</a>

## Michael Caine might not like it, but Zulu shows cinema’s power to rewrite history | Peter Bradshaw

<p>By turning an armed invasion into a plucky underdog story, the classic war movie propagated a very dubious British mythology</p><p>There’s an urban myth about a scene in Zulu in which a British officer in a red tunic is gruesomely struck in his throat by three successive spears: after a stunned silence in the cinema auditorium, a bloke is said to have shouted from the back: “One hundred and EIGHTY!” (Other versions of the story have an extra on location shouting it – and then getting fired – or even the star himself, Michael Caine.)</p><p>Now the film is contending with more darts. Sir Michael Caine is furious at the news that Zulu, the 1964 film about the battle of Rorke’s Drift that made him an international star, has been named as something that could encourage far-right sympathies by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/02/inside-ricu-the-shadowy-propaganda-unit-inspired-by-the-cold-war">Research Information and Communications Unit</a>, run as part of Prevent, the government’s counter-terror operation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/10/michael-caine-zulu-history-british-mythology">Continue reading...</a>

Everywhere we turn, there are cameras filming. At Royal Challengers Bangalore the ambition is to be as big a brand, with as big a social media footprint, as Real Madrid or FC Barcelona. And at a franchise so well organised and ambitious as RCB, that means 18 cricket players and 20 content creators.</p><p>In India, cricket is its own entity.

<p><strong>(Crammed Discs/Made to Measure)</strong><br />The Belgian genre-hoppers return with a 15-part audio drama that skips from jazz and Latin trance to minimalism and acid house – with surprises at every turn</p><p>The anglophone pop world doesn’t really have a band like Aksak Maboul, and it is our loss. Formed in Belgium in 1977, their work spans multiple registers: a globally minded mix of post-punk, free jazz, electronica and minimalist chamber music. In English terms, you’d have to imagine some improbable fusion of Rip Rig + Panic, Michael Nyman, Cabaret Voltaire and Kate Bush.</p><p>This latest album – only their fifth studio album in half a century – is a 15-part audio drama, written by vocalist Véronique Vincent, which tells a fantastical story of a forest voyage. Vincent’s protagonist – singing, speaking, babbling and “speech-singing” – converses with herons and robins, trees and rocks. She ponders her own mortality and then starts to question the very nature of language itself. Guest vocalists, including Stereolab’s Lætitia Sadier, play other cast members.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/10/askak-maboul-une-aventure-de-vv-songspiel-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Hudson Theatre, New York</strong></p><p>The Oscar winner makes for an exceptional Nora in a visually muted yet emotionally effective remount of Ibsen’s classic drama</p><p>Gone is the elaborate 19th-century home.

Nora Helmer (Jessica Chastain), an infantilized housewife, fraudulently borrows money from disgraced banker Krogstad (Okieriete Onaodowan).
