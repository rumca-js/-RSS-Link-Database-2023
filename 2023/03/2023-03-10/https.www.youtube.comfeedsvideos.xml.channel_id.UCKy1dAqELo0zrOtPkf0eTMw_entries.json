Everything Everywhere All At Once has dethroned the previous holder of that title, The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. The Peter Jackson directed movie earned a total of 101 awards, according to our breakdown. In other news, rapper 50 Cent is developing a new series with Paramount Plus called Vice City. And no, it\u2019s not related to the famed Rockstar Games title of the same name.
