Well, that, and asking Congress for a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/risky-venture-ukraine-zelensky-gets-175757506.html" target="_blank">few more billion dollars</a>. And <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/zelensky-americans-support-ukraine" target="_blank">fear-mongering about World War III</a>. Plus a few <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/portrait-of-bravery-ukraines-first-lady-olena-zelenska" target="_blank">Vogue photoshoots</a>. He's a man of many ventures. </p><p>But for the second year in a row, Zelenskyy has been snubbed by the Oscars. That's right, he went to the trouble of taking time off from dodging bombs in Kyiv just so he could make an appearance. And those selfish Hollywood elites didn't want him. Apparently, WME talent agent Mike Simpson begged the Academy to give Zelenskyy a virtual appearance slot. But it was a fruitless effort. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>Now, you may be wondering why a talent agent is trying to get Zelenskyy a slot at the Oscars. Apparently, it's because Simpson is the agent for Aaron Kaufman, who co-directed the Zelenskyy documentary “Superpower,” with Sean Penn. Yes, Zelenskyy had a documentary made about him. While he's still fighting a war that apparently implicates the entire world. Totally normal. </p><p>During press events for the documentary, Penn called for the U.S. government to step up its military support for Ukraine, including “the delivery and supply of long-range precision missiles." So, come on taxpayers, step it up. Ukraine needs some new missiles, on top of the $72308499 billion they've already gotten from us. (I've stopped counting at this point. Math is hard.)</p><p>Penn has a <em>bit</em> of a history of kissing Zelenskyy's rear end. Last year, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sean-penn-oscarshttps://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sean-penn-oscars" target="_blank">he demanded a boycott</a> of the Oscars if Zelenskyy was snubbed an invite, and even claimed he would melt his trophies in protest. Because nothing sticks it to the Academy like molten metal. And then, last November, Penn actually traveled alllll the way to Ukraine <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sean-penn-zelinksyy" target="_blank">to give Zelenskyy his Oscar.</a> No really, this happened. For what did Zelenskyy deserve an Oscar, you ask? A good question. And one I, unfortunately, don't have an answer for. </p><p>This is bordering on 2020-Fauci levels of creepish hero worship. Next thing we know, Penn will start selling Zelenskyy face pillows. No one give him any ideas. </p>

## Watch As This Uber Based Molecular Geneticist Breaks Down Why Biological Men Can't Be In Women's Prisons

But she did it amazingly well. </p><p>This clip is from a discussion at UC Berkeley held by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELuWMfQ39wc" target="_blank">Peter Boghossian</a>. Boghossian is a philosopher and author, whose bio states he is <em>"executing a blueprint to push back illiberalism,"</em> aimed at restoring free speech as a non-partisan value, and revealing <em>"the implications of far-left ideological takeover."</em> So he sounds like a pretty cool guy. </p><p>Boghossian asked the participants if trans women should be legally treated as women. One participant strongly disagreed, another agreed, and a third disagreed. The one who "strongly disagreed" is a female molecular geneticist and the based hero of the clip. </p><p>She said, <em>"Being male or being female is a developmental process. You can't go backwards. So you can't change your sex [...] And the truth is that currently in California prisons, and prisons in other parts of the country, women are getting impregnated by other 'women'." </em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>She explained how, after World War II, rules were put in place to keep women and men in separate prisons due to the high risk of violence against women. </p><p><em>"It's so sad that women have internalized misogyny to the point where the man's comfort takes precedence over the woman's safety. There's a reason why they don't want to be in men's prisons. Because men beat each other to death." </em></p><p>"Internalized misogyny" has been co-opted as a feminzai term, but I suggest we reclaim it as the definition this lady provided to us. Because that's really what it is - giving away <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-ncaa-victory" target="_blank">privileges</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-riley-gaines-tied" target="_blank">awards</a>, and even <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ncaa-swimmer-choked-up" target="_blank">physical spaces</a> reserved for biological women, to biological men. What could be more anti-woman than that? </p>

## Mike Rowe barbecues troll who tagged him in 'fraud' meme accusing him of s***ing on college graduates

I don't know if "The Southern Gentleman" was expecting <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mike-rowe-troll-conservative-video" target="_blank">Mike Rowe's response</a> over this dumb meme, but Rowe wasn't busy, and TSG got the smoke.</p><p>The bio on this mystery southern gentleman's page reads <em>"politely telling Trump fanatics where they can stick their bigoted opinions."</em> That tells you all you need to know. TSG is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mike-rowe-liberals-suck" target="_blank">your typical leftist troll</a> who believes anyone who expresses an opposing viewpoint or whoever "Trump fanatics" might be fans of (see <em>Pratt, Chris</em>) is their enemy. Hence sharing a dumb meme like this.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="db36b" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=31531025&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The hypothesis behind the meme is that Mike Rowe got a degree in something useless when he was twenty-two. And that now, at sixty, it is fraudulent for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/video-mike-rowe-exposes-the-scam-of-college-and-student-loans" target="_blank">him to point out the scam college degrees have turned into</a> almost forty years since he got one. By tagging Rowe in this post, TSG thought he was really going to stick it to him! Rowe was going to see that some random dude thought he was a fraud, and it was going to ruin his day.</p><p>Instead, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SouthernGentleman1865/posts/pfbid0Bbs2KPF7CWtMfyXvZ9SMNPbWySEUxw4EAHi9NLUGCJMxXvqxhC7TxKcRea2WCqtEl?comment_id=1287084542065444¬if_id=1662517614992645¬if_t=public_figure_l0_comment&amp;ref=notif" target="_blank">Rowe responded</a>, wondering if TSG--who you would assume is a humanities major, hence why he's so boo-boo-faced over the criticism--was ever taught what the word "fraud" means.</p><p><em>"A fraud, as I understand it, is a person who pretends to be someone they aren’t. To my knowledge, I’ve never done that. My entire resume – including my musical and educational background -- are a matter of public record. I’ve done nothing to conceal either. Is it possible that you saw me on the tee-vee, crawling through a sewer or fishing for crabs, and simply assumed you knew everything about me, based on a one-dimensional glance? If so, you’re not alone. A lot of people today struggle with this kind of cognitive dissonance. I’m sure some such people have come here, and concluded that you were trying to pass yourself off as a 'gentleman.'"</em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="35319" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=31531151&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Mike Rowe doesn't defecate on gender studies majors by raising money to help high school graduates who decide they'd like to do something useful for their lives instead. There is a case to be made that he dookies on the system, the cost of that gender studies degree, and the inherent scam in telling kids if they don't go to college they'll be undesirable. Also, all of those things deserve to be pooped on after consuming a generous helping of Taco Bell.</p><p>Also, as far as frauds go, Mike Rowe is his real name. I doubt the troll's parents named him Southern Gentleman when he was born. That would be cruel.</p><p><p>

## Watch: CNN set up trans teen To confront Gov. Youngkin and you've got to hear Youngkin's response

CNN brought in a 17-year-old trans "man" to ask him about the school bathroom situation. Because of course they did. </p><p>The 17-year-old named Niko said, <em>"Your transgender model policies require that students play on the sports teams and use the restrooms that correspond with their sex assigned at birth. Look at me: I am a transgender man. Do you really think that the girls in my high school would feel comfortable sharing a restroom with me?"</em></p><p>Biological female to biological female, I would say yes, they would. But <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/glenn-youngkin-virginia-parental-choice" target="_blank">Youngkin</a> gave a more roundabout, and less satisfying, answer: <em>"What’s most important is that we try very hard to accommodate students. That’s why I have said many, many times we just need extra bathrooms in schools. We need gender-neutral bathrooms so people can use that they in fact are comfortable with."</em></p><p>He also said he was happy that Niko was there with their father, and explained the importance of parents engaging with their children so they can "can make good decisions together". Which in my opinion, leaves much to be desired from the conservative viewpoint. Should parents and children be allowed to decide together that the child gets permanently sterilized? Is that a "good decision"? </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>Anywho, Youngkin <em>did</em> say that the sports issue is very clear-cut, and that biological boys should not play with biological girls. So that was a plus. As he said this, Niko's father shook his head in disappointment, and Niko gave Youngkin a death stare. </p><p>Youngkin seems to be in a tough position where he's trying to appease hardline conservatives and some more moderate centrists at the same time. But this issue is not one to be taken lightly or compromised on. Children's lives are quite literally at stake. </p>

Which was apparently hindered by many, including his parents. </p><p><em>"I know my parents love me. But there were still very problematic things that I went through. I think it's important to show that this can happen in your own home, and how we move forward collectively while addressing the racism that is being perpetuated."  </em></p><p>One example was that his mother didn't want him to get cornrows - in the book, she asked, <em>"He's getting what rolls?"  </em>Kaepernick said she told him, <em>"Your hair's not professional.

<p>Kaepernick explained, <em>"Those become spaces where it’s like, ‘Okay, how do I navigate the situation now?’ But it also has informed why I have my hair long today."</em></p><p>Interactions like this one pushed Kaepernick to find a community of other black people, which he said he found in the NFL. He told the interviewer he would like to return to professional football in the future. </p><p>It doesn't seem conducive to tell your child they look like a thug. But also, no parents are perfect. They're all humans who make mistakes and say things they probably shouldn't and ultimately regret. And it sounds like, overall, Kaepernick's parents were good to him and loved him. So, to me, it seems a <em>tad</em> distasteful for Kaepernick to air their dirty laundry in public to sell some graphic novels and boost his career. But maybe that's just me. </p>

## 'Asinine, silly, and stupid': Charles Barkley shuts down allegations of racism in NBA MVP pick

Because it might go to a white person. <em>*gasp*</em></p><p>Kendrick Perkins, a sports analyst for ESPN, made the <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/02/kendrick-perkins-nikola-jokic-is-winning-mvps-because-hes-white/" target="_blank">claim</a> earlier this month about Nikola Jokic, who plays for the Denver Nuggets. Jokic is making a case for a third-straight MVP award. Perkins pointed out three white players - Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash and Jokic - who have won the award since 1990 without finishing in the top 10 in scoring. </p><p>He said,<em> "What do those guys have in common? I’ll let it sit there and marinate. You think about it.”  </em>He also claimed that 80% of NBA voters for the MVP are white. </p><p>JJ Reddick bashed him on ESPN in a heated exchange over these claims: <em>"What we just witnessed is the problem with this show, where we create narratives that do not exist in reality. The implication, what you are implying, that the white voters that vote on NBA are racist, that they favor white people, you just said that. Yes you did. That is exactly what you implied Kendrick Perkins… We all know what you implied the other day. We all know what you implied just now."</em></p><p>And ESPN eventually had to issue a correction of one of Perkins's statements: <em>"I want to correct something here from yesterday’s show, when Kendrick Perkins said that 80% of NBA voters for the MVP award are white. The NBA publicly announces the voters each year, and after review, it is clear that the panel is much more diverse than what was portrayed by Kendrick Perkins, and we wanted to make sure that we corrected that today.”</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/charles-barkley-ryan-clark-podcast" target="_blank">Charles Barkley</a> has now joined the conversation and said what literally everyone is thinking: <em>"That's asinine and silly. Asinine, silly, and stupid."</em></p><p> He continued to explain why this is the case: <em>"It's a regular season award. It ain't who the best player is. It's who had the best regular season. But every year, ESPN gets these fools on radio and TV to talk about who's the best player [...] Michael Jordan probably was the best player in the NBA for, probably five years, before he won MVP because his team was no good." </em></p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/charles-barkley-responds-audience" target="_blank">Barkley</a> then pointed out that you can probably count the number of white guys who won MVP in the last thirty years on one hand, so Perkins's racial bias argument doesn't make any sense. And Barkley said Perkins probably just made the asinine claim to be provocative. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Stuff like this is so silly and just creates more unnecessary division. Good for Barkley for calling it like it is. </p>

## Team DeSantis returns heavy fire on reporter asking about the "anti-black, anti-woman" governor

I'm not saying that all reporters are bitter, hyper-partisan hacks, But intensity needs to be matched. When the reporter sounds like an enemy acting as nothing more than a stenographer for the Democrat Party, they need to be treated as such.</p><p>Our latest example is Ashley for Channel 9 news. She wanted the governor's office to comment on a rally where "people" say he is a racist sexist. Or maybe a sexist racist. It's hard to keep track of who is ranked higher on the left's pound-for-pound rankings.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The media has done an enormous disservice to people by lying about Florida's educational standards and curriculum transparency efforts.<br /><br />This is the result. <a href="https://t.co/JOHegIfmrx">pic.twitter.com/JOHegIfmrx</a><br />— Bryan Griffin (@BryanDGriffin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanDGriffin/status/1633616467835977729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The reporter asked for comment because of a "rally" where "people" think the governor's "book banning" agenda is "anti-black, anti-immigrant, and anti-woman." I'm wondering if the reporter is new because she left off "anti-gay," a reference to DeSantis' <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-dave-rubin" target="_blank">so-called Don't Say Parental Choice bill</a>.</p><p>The reporter also left off who is organizing the rally. Her email implies normie concerned citizens. But we've seen in the recent past how anti-DeSantis protests <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-college-socialists" target="_blank">are organized by democrats and socialist organizations</a> pretending to be normie citizens when they're really just political hacks.</p><p>Good news for the protesters, though. They can go home. As DeSantis press secretary Bruan Griffin points out, no books are banned and adults are free to purchase any book they desire.</p><p>Though Griffin adds a suggestion for the reporter, "Since these individuals have a free evening, perhaps you can encourage them to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-book-banning" target="_blank">watch today's press conference hosted by our office</a>. We debunk the 'book ban' hoax and redouble our commitment to the commonsense positions that pornography should be prohibited in schools <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-apologizes-team-desantis" target="_blank">and CRT should not be utilized as educational material</a>."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="211bb" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33250978&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>My guess is that the reporter will NOT take Griffins up on his suggestion. And will instead claim that the governor's office would "not provide comment."</p><p><p>

## Matt Taibbi ("Twitter Files") shuts down Democrat questioning his journalistic integrity so hard she won't look at him

Shocking to no one, Democrats were on the side of weaponizing the federal government. It was clear by the disdain they had for "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-execs-censorship" target="_blank">Twitter Files</a>" journalists Matt Taibbi and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-ftc-twitter" target="_blank">Michael Shellenberger</a>. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-files-two" target="_blank">Bari Weiss</a> too, even though she wasn't there. Democrats are so used to having corporate media carry their water for them, they lash out like jilted lovers when a reporter dares go off script.</p><p>This was evident with Rep. Stacey Plaskett calling Taibbi a "so-called" journalist. Taibbi wasn't having it.</p><p>He said in response, <em>"I've been a reporter for thirty years and a staunch advocate of the first amendment. Ranking Member Plaskett, I'm not a 'so-called' journalist. I won the National Magazine award. The I.F. Stone award for independent journalism. And I've written ten books, including four New York Times bestsellers."</em></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">TAIBBI: "I've been a reporter for 30 years...Ranking Member Plaskett, 'I'm not a 'so-called journalist.'" <a href="https://t.co/8JDrfjQXx2">pic.twitter.com/8JDrfjQXx2</a><br />— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1633858290525564931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Prior to the hearing, Taibbi dropped the latest installment of the "Twitter Files."

She wouldn't even make eye contact. The little people are so beneath her when they aren't following orders.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Are we surprised at the ranking Democrat's lack of respect for journalists? No. She's a Democrat. She only has time for journalismers. The leftists who went into "journalisming" out of a hatred towards the right and the belief that the media wasn't biased enough towards the left. Democrats used to at least pretend to deny the media was on their side. These days, Democrats like Rep. Plaskett demand it.</p><p>Keep in mind, neither Taibii nor Shellenberger nor Weiss is conservative in any way. They are all liberals. But they are liberals who believe in intellectual honesty and aren't afraid to call out "their" side. That's why the modern-day extremist democrat party considers them "so-called."</p><p><p>

## Watch: Woman meltsdown smashing 100s of bottles of booze in what should be considered an act of domestic terrorism

But rarely has a video been so triggering. I am literally shaking as I arrange the words in what I hope is a compelling fashion. This is less content as much as a clear act of domestic terrorism. A woman had a meltdown in a liquor store and destroyed bottles of liquor. 100s and 100s of bottles of booze. Dead.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>I should specify, it should be considered an act of domestic terrorism if it didn't take place in the UK. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/buffer-zones-prayer-uk" target="_blank">They are more concerned with people praying there</a>. Though, it could also be New Zealand because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grammar-lesson-british-dude" target="_blank">as has been revealed in the past, I stink with accents</a>.

<p>The only redeemable part of this video is seeing the perpetrator bleeding after falling ass-first on the shattered glass. Though instead of blood, it could be the Merlot. Another option is... let's just say it was a woman, she was obviously in a mood, and I'm not sure when during the month this incident took.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>What I do know is this woman needs to be sent to Gitmo. Or whatever the England/New Zealand version of Gitmo is.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>I don't care what your problem is. I don't care what the issue is. I don't care what reason you think you are saving the world with such a public outburst. Leave. Alcohol. Alone. Alcohol never did anything to you. Alcohol is our friend.</p><p>There's one glaring aspect of this video that stands out. How does this woman get away with smashing one bottle without being stopped? Let alone HUNDREDS OF BOTTLES of booze no longer on the wall? We need a full investigation.</p><p><p>
