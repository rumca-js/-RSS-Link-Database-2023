## The Worst Call Of Duty Guns Ever, Ranked

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104263-callofdutymodernwarfare22.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There have been a lot of Call of Duty games over the years, from classics like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare to bizarre duds like the sci-fi themed Infinite Warfare. And though the campaigns get plenty of attention from fans and critics, we all know that multiplayer is where the series really made its name.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty was the shooter franchise that popularized the concept of persistent multiplayer progression, i.e. locking many of its guns, perks, and cosmetics behind a progression system that incentivized players to keep gaming well into the wee hours. Though the dopamine rush of unlocking a new weapon never quite faded, multiplayer FPS games always have their fair share of overpowered guns, especially early on.</p><p dir="ltr">However, while Modern Warfare 2's akimbo Model 1887 shotguns and Black Ops 1's pre-nerf Famas will go down in the annals of meta-defining weapons, there are quite a few guns from the series that belong on the other side of the ledger. These are the guns that you wouldn't be caught dead using in a serious deathmatch--unless, of course, you wanted to give your opponent a significant advantage.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mini-Uzi, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104264-miniuzicod4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The humble Uzi has become a common weapon in many first-person shooters, but it's rarely worth using compared to other submachine guns, particularly the MP5s and UMPs of the world. The Mini-Uzi from the original Modern Warfare is akin to the famously-inept Klobb from GoldenEye 007--it chews through ammo, it has a downright bizarre recoil pattern, and it barely does any damage. It also has a very bright muzzle flash, which is just unpleasant. Compared to its more viable counterpart, the Skorpion, it's not even worth considering.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>M1 Garand, Call of Duty 1</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104265-m1garand.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Yes, we're taking it all the way back to the original Call of Duty on PC, before most fans had even heard of the series. Despite being one of the most iconic and effective weapons of World War II, the plink-happy M1 Garand just isn't very good in the OG. The familiar Thompson (or "Tommy gun") is much better at close range, the Springfield sniper has the advantage of a scope, and the BAR has the advantage of automatic fire. Unfortunately, there's simply no reason to use the Garand. Fortunately, its later incarnation in Call of Duty: World at War is much better.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dragunov, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104266-dragunov.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Sniper rifles are generally an expert's weapon in the Call of Duty games--when they're done well, at least--but the Dragunov borders on unusable in Modern Warfare 2019. It suffers from fairly serious damage falloff, which makes it less than useful at long range, but its recoil is so severe that two-shotting enemies is significantly harder than it should be. Though it does kill with a headshot at nearly any range, it's so much worse than other snipers in the game (or even standard rifles) that it's not worth considering as a primary weapon.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Uzi, Call of Duty: Black Ops</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104267-uziblackops.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Unfortunately for the iconic Uzi, straddling the line between pistol and SMG almost always puts machine pistols in a weird place, and Black Ops' version is perhaps even worse than COD 4's. While it has plenty of ammo, it lacks in every other category: recoil pattern, accuracy, and especially damage. Close-range combat fans were better-suited to shotguns or other SMGs in this game.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sawed-Off Shotgun, Call of Duty: WWII</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104268-sawedoff.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Speaking of shotguns, they tend to be famine-or-feast weapons in Call of Duty games--either they're so powerful that they need a nerf, or they're not worth using at all. Sadly, while the idea of a shotgun blowing opponents away in one shot at point-blank range is definitely appealing, the Sawed-Off from Call of Duty: WWII fails to deliver on that promise. What's more, its surprisingly lengthy reload time will almost certainly lead to your demise. Several fans have called this the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WWII/comments/7lkcn7/sawedoff_shotgun_is_the_worst_shotgun_in_cod/">worst shotgun</a> in COD history, and we tend to agree.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>China Lake, Call of Duty: Black Ops</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104269-chinalake.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Explosive weapons like COD 4's "noob tube" rocket launcher have led to many frustrated opponents over the years, but the China Lake grenade launcher is more likely to leave you cursing than your foes. Based on a very cool real-life weapon, the pump-action grenade launcher only seems to kill the bad guys if you hit them dead on, and it's not exactly a precision weapon to begin with. There are way better uses of your secondary slot in Black Ops 1, that's for sure.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>F2000, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104270-f2000.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of those weapons that you probably used once back in the day and immediately forgot about, the F2000 assault rifle is the definition of "underwhelming." Not only does it have one of the worst iron sights in the game, but it also has pitiful damage, a bizarre recoil pattern, and one of the slowest reload speeds in its class. As a whole, the F2000 isn't quite as bad as some weapons on this list, but there's no reason to use it when guns like the ACR and the FAMAS exist.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MK14, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104271-mk14.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Once upon a time, the MK14 was considered a decent, but not spectacular semi-auto rifle in Advanced Warfare. After a number of patches, however, the weapon was rendered a footnote in the game's competitive meta thanks to its brutal reload time, low rate of fire, low magazine capacity, and pitiful damage. Though the MK14's ridiculous headshot multiplier means that an expert marksman could theoretically rack up many kills with it, the truth is that it's too situational to use in a real fight, and that's why it's on this list. However, the MK14 is useful in Hardcore mode, where it kills very quickly at any range.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>SO-14, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2022)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104272-so-14modernwarfare2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The newest weapon on this list is also one of the most divisive, with some fans singing its praises on social media. However, you don't have to look very far to find legions of players complaining about its ridiculous recoil, slow single-fire speed, and underwhelming damage. Though the right loadout selection can make the SO-14 viable in certain situations, the fact that it's a semi-auto gun that requires two headshots to kill an opponent makes it a non-starter, and one of the worst weapons in Modern Warfare 2.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Machine Pistol, Call of Duty: WWII</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4104273-machinepistol.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Call of Duty: WWII isn't talked about much anymore, and that's probably why the humble Machine Pistol has remained under the radar to franchise fans. It's an inaccurate automatic pistol with only 10 shots, which means that it's unlikely that it'll be able to kill even a single attacker without the Extended Mags attachment. Oh, and its damage was also nerfed in a patch. Though the Machine Pistol can certainly get kills in a pinch, and it might be useful as a sniper's sidearm, it's undoubtedly one of the worst pistols in the series.</p></h3></p><br />

## 65 Movie Review - More Family Drama Than Wild Dinosaur Adventure
 - [https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/65-movie-review-more-family-drama-than-wild-dinosaur-adventure/1900-6418044/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/65-movie-review-more-family-drama-than-wild-dinosaur-adventure/1900-6418044/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

<p dir="ltr">Based solely on the trailers, I went into 65 thinking it was going to be an epic time travel tale with dinosaurs as the main antagonists. What I ended up getting was a fairly traditional, if not hollow, adventure with a focus more on family than on giant space lizards, which is unfortunate.</p><p dir="ltr">The movie starts 65 million years ago on Solaris, a planet similar to Earth. Though we see nothing more than the beach, the people look like humans. Mills (Adam Driver) is a father who leaves his wife and daughter for two years to take on a special project that will pay him extra--money that will go to his ailing daughter's hospital bills. We are not privy to what that special project is, but it involves Mills flying a spaceship full of cryopods to another planet. During the flight, his spaceship is hit by an asteroid and crashes on an uncharted planet (Earth). Mills is the only survivor until he discovers Koa (Ariana Greenblatt), a nine-year-old girl who survived in the cryopod. She doesn't speak English, her parents are dead, and they have to find the other half of their spaceship, which has the escape module. So there's your story.</p><p dir="ltr">A fairly rote adventure flick follows, with Mills and Koa trying to escape Earth before the asteroid that eradicates the dinosaurs hits the planet. Along the way, Koa has to learn to trust Mills; Mills has to learn to open his heart to Koa; and the pair must dodge dinosaurs and treacherous terrain. The plot is thin and is ultimately little more than a logline. There is no surprise plot device halfway through, nor is there a twist ending. It tells you what it is up front, and delivers exactly that.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/65-movie-review-more-family-drama-than-wild-dinosaur-adventure/1900-6418044/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Sims 4 fan-creators never fail to amaze, and Simmer Isambardy is no exception. As first reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/check-out-bills-town-from-the-last-of-us-recreated-in-the-sims-4">Eurogamer</a>, Isambardy has dedicated their efforts to creating a replica of Bill's Town as seen in the PlayStation-exclusive-turned-HBO-series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us/">The Last of Us</a>--and it's seriously impressive.</p><p>Using a single 64x64 lot, Isambardy first created Bill's house before expanding to include a sizable chunk of Lincoln. This includes a handful of nearby homes, the church, and the town's ultra-fortified exterior, barbed wire and all. According to Eurogamer, Isambardy wanted to add the pit Frank takes a tumble into as well, but lacked room in the area just outside the town's walls.</p><div>          </div><p>Though Isambardy's recreation isn't perfectly to scale, the creator managed to capture many of the town's defining characteristics and locations. The interior of Bill's home is particularly impressive, with furniture and wallpaper that will feel all too familiar to those who (tearfully) watched episode 3 of the hit series. The home also included Bill's underground bunker, complete with surveillance equipment. And yes, there's even room for growing strawberries in the backyard.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-need-to-see-this-iconic-the-last-of-us-location-recreated-in-the-sims-4/1100-6512257/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Pedro Pascal, known for his roles in The Last of Us and The Mandalorian, stopped by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVRwUHbHgt8">Hot Ones</a> to voluntarily torture himself with some of the hottest food he's ever eaten, and share some insights his career and various roles. While eating some spicy, spicy wings, the actor fought back tears and talked about playing the cold, unfeeling male archetype as Joel in the HBO adaptation of the popular video game franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">In response to host Sean Evans' question about how Pascal balances "the noble traits that make a character like Joel heroic, versus the weaker ones that make him human," Pascal joked, "You're smart. I never thought about it that way."</p><p dir="ltr">Then, after thinking for a moment, Pascal added, "There's a funny thing about a very sort of restricted exterior that is typical for these kinds of male archetypes. Don't show your feelings, people will see you're weak, survival is key, don't let anybody in. Developing human connection is not, at least in his mind, key to survival. But then, only to discover that he cannot live without it at any cost."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-star-pedro-pascal-powers-through-painful-wings-discusses-joels-complex-character-on-hot-ones/1100-6512250/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> has had vaults for a while now, but each season tends to move the locations around and change how you obtain the keycards needed for opening them. Chapter 4 Season 2 has done this once again, requiring you to take down a boss to earn a keycard and get your hands on that sweet loot. Here are all of the vault locations in Chapter 4 Season 2 and how to open them.</p><h2>How to open vaults in Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2</h2><p>Opening vaults in Chapter 4 Season 2 will require you to get your hands on a Vault Keycard--except for the one on Loot Island, which just requires you to use two standard keys. The Vault Keycard only drops from defeating the seasonal boss <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-2-highcard-boss-guide/1100-6512151/">Highcard</a>. He spawns near the vault locations we've listed below and is relatively easy to defeat so long as you come prepared with full shields and a decent stock of ammo.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4110659-fortnite_20230310084522.jpg"><img alt="When Highcard goes down, loot the Vault Keycard from him." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4110659-fortnite_20230310084522.jpg" /></a><figcaption>When Highcard goes down, loot the Vault Keycard from him.</figcaption></figure><p>When you've obtained the Vault Keycard, you'll be able to head over to the nearby vault, which will contain a wide variety of healing items, high-tier weapons, and more. If you can't find the vault, simply equip the keycard and the game will direct where to go. This will usually mean you'll have a great opportunity to pick up the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-2-exotic-and-mythic-weapons-all-locations-and-prices/1100-6512149/">Mythic</a> version of the Havoc Pump Shotgun, which is an extremely powerful weapon to have at your disposal--especially when paired with Highcard's Havoc Suppressed Assault Rifle, which you likely already snagged from defeating the boss.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-2-vault-locations/1100-6512256/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

They currently come with two specializations for players to choose between, Devastation and Preservation, with the former focused on dealing ranged magic damage and the latter on healing allies and preventing damage. It's the second class in WoW, alongside Demon Hunter, that only sports two specializations, as opposed to the standard three.</p><p dir="ltr">But fans think a third specialization might be in the cards, based on a datamined quest found on the game's PTR. As reported by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/datamined-quest-hints-at-new-support-evoker-specialization-on-patch-10-1-ptr-331802">Wowhead</a>, an Evoker specific quest titled "Our Destiny" currently features placeholder text that makes references to a "new specialization remembered" and mentions that the mysteries uncovered in the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-return-to-the-forbidden-reach-update-lands-on-march-21/1100-6512141/">10.0.7 patch (which releases March 21)</a> are about to unfold. Later in the quest chain, players are tasked with helping the black dragon Ebyssian subdue a boss-level enemy. Interestingly enough, the quest text mentions that players will need to help Ebyssian by healing or "boosting" him, or can alternatively deal damage to the boss to complete the quest.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-players-think-theyve-discovered-a-third-evoker-specialization/1100-6512255/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actor Keegan-Michael Key voices Toad in the upcoming The Super Mario Bros. Movie, but how did he find the little creature's voice? In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVmbFp843po">Fandango</a>, Key said he tried to channel a friend of his, and brought that to the movie's directors as a jumping off point.</p><p>The idea was to "almost pretend like I was sucking on a helium balloon," with the aim of feeling like he was "pinching" the sound of his voice to make it higher. After testing the voice out, Key received a note that it should be even higher, so he kept going and going.</p><p>"Trying to get as high as we could and still have a certain comfort level within the voice. It was a really fun, exploratory experience to try to find the right spot and try to get those rhythms in a place where it felt like it would be Toad, but kind of a new version of Toad at the same time," Key said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keegan-michael-key-on-finding-toads-voice-for-mario-bros-movie/1100-6512247/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

There are five collectible figures in all featuring the biggest stars from the Mushroom Kingdom: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, and Bowser.

The toys are selling out quickly, so grab them while you can.</p><p>At this time at Amazon, several of the figures are "temporarily out of stock," but you can still get your order in. Once Amazon's stock is replenished, you'll receive an expected delivery date. Even though you won't get them right away, if interested, we'd recommend ordering them as soon as possible.

To achieve the fire effect, you’ll need to add both water and batteries to the King Koopa. You’ll also need to drop a bit more cash, as the giant Bowser figure clocks in at $30.</p><p>The Mario and Luigi poseable plushies cost $30 each.</p><p>Not intrigued by any of the figurines and plushies?

## New Tekken 8 Trailer Shows Paul Phoenix And His Terrible Hairstyle In Action

<p>There are two constants in a Tekken game, and that's the inclusion of Paul Phoenix in the game roster and his incredibly vertical hairstyle. There are three traditions, technically, if you're counting Phoenix being beaten by a bear. For <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-8/">Tekken 8</a>, that tradition is being kept mostly intact, although this time, Phoenix is entering the King of the Iron Fist tournament with a new look that is <em>drastically </em>different from previous incarnations.</p><p>Beyond a new hairstyle that looks like it was stolen from a K-pop boy band, not much has changed when it comes to the punishment that Phoenix dishes out. Using a hybrid mix of karate and judo, Paul delivers powerful and precise blows to finish off opponents. As seen in the trailer, he still has his signature Death Fist attack, which has a long build-up time but delivers devastating damage if it connects.</p><p>Since its reveal at the September 2022 PlayStation State of Play, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-8-is-built-from-the-ground-up-in-ue5-is-a-turning-point-for-the-series/1100-6507585/">Tekken 8's roster</a> has slowly grown. Kazuya and Jin Mishima, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-8-gameplay-trailer-at-the-game-awards-confirms-return-of-jun-kazama/1100-6509823/">Jun Kazuma</a>, Marshall Law, and Nina Williams are all confirmed to appear in the game, which introduces a number of new graphical and technical improvements to the series. The biggest of these new gameplay mechanics is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-8-introduces-new-heat-system-and-a-returning-nina-williams/1100-6511184/">Heat Gauge</a>, which can be used to activate a Heat Burst which gives players more options to be aggressive in battle.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-tekken-8-trailer-shows-paul-phoenix-and-his-terrible-hairstyle-in-action/1100-6512246/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> Chapter 4 Season 2 has finally arrived and that means a brand new battle pass, filled with new cosmetic items for players to earn. In addition to everything available at the start of the season, there is also a new midseason skin drop, with this season featuring Eren Jaeger from Attack on Titan. While you are going to have to wait a bit to pick up this new crossover character, here is exactly when you can expect Eren Jaeger to become available in Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Eren Jaeger be available in Fortnite?</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>Eren Jaeger is set to release 36 days into the season</strong>--roughly April 15--at which point both the skin and its related quests will become available. You can see all of the rewards currently, like the Basement Key Back Bling, Titan Strike Harvesting Tool, Scout Regiment Salute Emote, and of course the Eren Jaeger skin.</p><p dir="ltr">The version shown in the battle pass menu is Eren in his Military Uniform, but it is listed as having multiple styles. Based on the current look of the skin, it could be something as simple as removing his cape, but it could also be a different variant. We won't know for sure until Eren Jaeger is released later this season. Come back here on that date for a complete deepdive on how to complete all of Eren Jaeger's quests.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-2-attack-on-titan-crossover-how-to-unlock-eren-jaeger/1100-6512245/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

I'd seen pictures of him, but I'd never met him."</p><p dir="ltr">She was apparently exiting her trailer when Baker noticed a door fling open.

<p>There are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-2-all-new-and-returning-weapons/1100-6512150/">plenty of guns</a> to add to your arsenal in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-4-season-2-neon-lights-katana-fights-and-more/1100-6512208/">Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2</a>, but if you're a fan of getting up close and personal, you're in for a treat with the arrival of the brand-new Kinetic Blade. This katana can slice and dice through foes for some hefty damage--though you'll have to get in close quarters to make it happen, meaning it also comes with some risk. If you want to know more, keep reading for everything important about this fresh addition to the Fortnite loot pool.</p><h2>Where to get the Kinetic Blade and how it works</h2><p><strong>The Kinetic Blade can be found on the ground, in chests and vaults, or by coming across blade stands found around the map</strong>--so getting this exciting new weapon is mostly just a matter of luck. Just remember that this is a close-quarters combat option, so you'll still want to keep guns on you for engaging foes at range. Even more, it's probably best that you practice with the katana before using it against aggressive foes who may gun you down.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4110528-fortnite_sword_stand.jpg"><img alt="These blade stands are found around the island and are an easy way to snag a Kinetic Blade." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4110528-fortnite_sword_stand.jpg" /></a><figcaption>These blade stands are found around the island and are an easy way to snag a Kinetic Blade.</figcaption></figure><p>Using the Kinetic Blade's basic attack will allow you to slice and dice other players, with its final hit knocking them back. This can make it especially useful for disorienting opponents or knocking someone off a ledge to their death. The other ability allows you to charge up a slash that will propel you forward, damaging an enemy you've lined up in your sights. It's also helpful for staying ahead of the closing storm. It can also be used for mobility, though it's worth noting that it won't grant you nearly the same travel distance as, say, Season 1's Shockwave Hammer.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-kinetic-blade-where-to-get-it-and-how-it-works/1100-6512206/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The Last of Us star Pedro Pascal is showing up in an unexpected place: a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL85b5n6srA">mockumentory short</a> that's an ad campaign for mobile game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/merge-mansion/id1484442152">Merge Mansion</a>. This game has had <a href="https://twitter.com/knoxdotmp3/status/1426370674369601544">viral ads</a> in the past, featuring unexpected plot twists and leaps of logic. One ad campaign starts from a mansion burning down, a woman renovating the mansion, and her grandma apparently getting arrested for some unknown crime. (Free her!)</p><p dir="ltr">Pascal's role in the short film is Detective Tim, a guy trying to figure out what grandma Ursula is hiding. "Honestly, I don't even know where to start," Pascal opens up the video with. "On the surface, you have a perfectly normal family. A young girl. Her grandma. You know, this is apple pie America."</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The video goes on to show lots of knives for an "apple pie America" situation, and a mystery that revolves around the grandma arrested at the end of the original viral video.

<p>As with most deaths in HBO's Game of Thrones, Oberyn Martell's death may rank up there as one of the most gruesome. However, for Pedro Pascal, it was so relaxing that the actor actually fell asleep on set with fake blood and bits of latex skin on his face.</p><p>Pascal's beloved Martell met his end in Game of Thrones when Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson's Ser Gregor Clegane aka The Mountain, gouges Martell's eyes out and then crushes his skull during a duel.</p><p>Talking to Sean Evans on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVRwUHbHgt8&amp;feature=emb_imp_woyt">Hot Ones</a>, Pascal recalled shooting the scene, saying the fake blood that was piped down Björnsson's arm actually cooled him off during an exceptionally hot day of filming.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pedro-pascal-talks-about-what-it-was-like-getting-his-eyes-gouged-out-in-game-of-thrones/1100-6512244/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Only a few more weeks remain before the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> remake, and fortunately, you can kill some time by diving into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-demo-is-out-today/1100-6512184/">official demo that Capcom released</a> this week. Not just a slice of gameplay to help prepare you for the survival-horror that lies ahead of Leon S. Kennedy, this Resident Evil 4 demo also has its very own exclusive difficulty mode.</p><p>Called Mad Chainsaw Mode, it makes the game substantially more challenging and isn't for the faint of heart. To get it, you'll need either luck or patience, as activating this difficulty mode comes down to random chance. If you are lucky, selecting "New Game" will lead you to a screen that offers you Mad Chainsaw Mode for a single playthrough. Alternatively, you can keep restarting Resident Evil and selecting to begin with a new game until you see the prompt on your screen.</p><p>There's no set number for how many restarts you'll need to get Resident Evil 4 to challenge you, and if you decline the invitation to misery, you'll have to wait until the RNG odds are in your favor again before you can attempt a new run with this mode active.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-demo-has-a-secret-ultra-hard-mode/1100-6512238/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2: Highcard Boss Guide

<p>Each new season of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> generally adds a boss on the map for you to find and take down for some sweet loot, and Chapter 4 Season 2 is continuing that trend as expected. This season's big baddie is <strong>Highcard</strong>, and we'll tell you how to take him down and what you'll get for doing so.</p><h2>How to beat Highcard and what you get</h2><p><strong>Highcard spawns near vaults around the map, such as MEGA City and Brutal Bastion, </strong>and he's accompanied by two henchmen in white suits. His location ay be randomized each round--we're actively investigating this. Compared to boss battles from previous seasons, Highcard is a relatively easy and straightforward boss--though you'll still want to approach him with full health and shields, as well as plenty of ammo. Take down his henchmen first, then turn your sights on the main man himself to drop him and get some sweet loot. He won't have any fancy attack patterns, so this is just about taking cover and hitting your shots.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4110382-fortnite_20230310084537.jpg"><img alt="Highcard drops a Mythic version of the Havoc Suppressed Rifle." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4110382-fortnite_20230310084537.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Highcard drops a Mythic version of the Havoc Suppressed Rifle.</figcaption></figure><p>When Highcard is defeated, you'll get the chance to pick up <strong>Highcard's</strong> <strong>Havoc Suppressed Assault Rifle</strong> he leaves behind. This deadly Mythic weapon is fully automatic and silenced, making it an exceptionally powerful option to add to your arsenal. In addition to dropping his gun, he'll also leave behind a Vault Keycard you can use to open the vault in MEGA City.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-2-highcard-boss-guide/1100-6512151/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4110005-battlepasslineup.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> Chapter 4 Season 2 has finally kicked off, bringing tons of new content to the battle royale, including a fresh battle pass, filled with cosmetic items for you to earn. The premium version of the battle pass includes over 100 items, with tons of original skins based around this season's theme, Mega. In addition to that, the midseason skin is <strong>Eren Jaeger</strong> from the popular anime Attack of Titan.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the rewards in the main battle pass, the first two pages are dedicated to the first unlockable skin, <strong>Renzo the Destroyer</strong>, who is referred to as "The galaxy's premier doomfluencer." Renzo is a robot sporting a sleek suit and a purple, ethereal mohawk. Next up is <strong>Imani</strong>, a musician rocking blue and pink glasses. She also has a more anime style to her appearance.</p><p dir="ltr">After that comes <strong>Thunder</strong>, a cool lizard sporting a fresh jacket and chain. His color variant gives him the same design as a Koi fish, with a sushi chef hat. <strong>Mystica</strong>, an ethereal space warrior, is the next skin. Mythic features green and purple armor, inspired by a samurai look. Following that is <strong>Stray</strong>, who appears to be some sort of variant of Drift, with a similar costume design and mask. <strong>Highwire </strong>follows him, a chaotic looking girl dressed in all black with bunny ears. Her variant gives her a wolf mask and the added fur to match.</p><p>The final skin in the main battle pass is <strong>River Empress Mizuki</strong>. Donning a hand fan and fancy dress, her design is inspired by traditional Japanese royalty. Of course, outside of the main battle pass you can find Eren Jaeger, who will arrive later this season.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img

<p>Square Enix's action-RPG Forspoken has seen "lackluster" sales so far, management said during a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/23q3outline.pdf">recent investor briefing</a>. Not only that, but reviews for the game "have been challenging," the company said.</p><p>That said, Square Enix said Forspoken has received praise for its action features, including combat and parkour. Even if Forspoken ends up being a dud, Square Enix said the game could pay dividends down the road. "It has yielded results that will lead to improvement of our development capabilities of other games in the future. Even so, its sales have been lackluster," Square Enix said.</p><p>Forspoken launched at the end of January for PS5 and PC, but Square Enix has never released a sales figure for the title. Asked about the impact Forspoken's launch might have on Square Enix's upcoming business outlook, management said it's too soon to say because the game is relatively new in the market. Square Enix will also roll out "forthcoming promotional initiatives" that could help spur sales, the company said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forspoken-sales-have-been-lackluster-square-enix-says/1100-6512237/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>In a new interview, former Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski spoke about how a first-person perspective was discussed for the fourth game in the series. Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAstG-DKmTw&amp;t=5824s">XboxEra podcast</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cliff-bleszinski-considered-taking-gears-4-first-person-pre-microsoft-acquisition/">VGC</a>), Bleszinski said that prior to Microsoft's acquisition of the franchise in 2014, there was some consideration given towards changing the game from its traditional third-person perspective.</p><p>"Yeah, I can tell you I wanted to actually consider going to first-person with it," Bleszinksi said. "Can you imagine chainsawing a Locust in first-person?"</p><p>According to the developer, Microsoft wanted to return to the horror roots of Gears of War when it bought the IP--which Bleszinski believes came as a result of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-sold-gears-of-war-because-it-didnt-know-what-to-do-according-to-cliff-bleszinski/1100-6508835/">Epic Games not knowing what to do with the series</a>-- and handed it over to a newly formed studio dedicated to the franchise, The Coalition. "That was Phil Spencer's main note when Microsoft acquired the IP," Bleszinksi added. "When talking to Rod Fergusson (former Coalition head, now Senior VP and general manager of Diablo at Blizzard) he said 'let's get back to the horror stuff.'"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-considered-first-person-gears-of-war-4-before-sale-to-microsoft/1100-6512231/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Epic Games is attempting to take marketshare from Steam in part by signing games to be exclusive, at least for a period of time, to the company's Epic Games Store. Titles like The Division 2, Metro Exodus, and Borderlands 3 launched as timed-exclusives for the Epic Games Store. Looking ahead, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said the company will continue this strategy, but he observed that this effort worked best for bigger titles.</p><p>"We're really honing our strategy based on what we observed worked really well in previous launches, and what didn't work really well," Sweeney told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/epic-isnt-done-with-epic-games-store-exclusives-its-just-focused-on-big-ones/">PC Gamer</a>. "A handful of major exclusives really moved the needle … and the smaller games, especially games that had a smaller audience that was typically on Steam, we found that a lot of those players weren't willing to move over."</p><p>Epic Games Store GM Steve Allison said the launch of Borderlands 3 on the Epic Games Store as a limited-time exclusive "crushed" expectations, though specific numbers were not shared.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-epic-games-store-exclusives-are-coming/1100-6512230/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2: Lightfall's First Iron Banner Delayed Due To Invisible Player Glitch

<p>Destiny 2's Iron Banner has become a regular highlight for PvP fans, but the first version of this monthly event is going to arrive a little later than anticipated due to an annoying bug. With the launch of Lightfall, instances of Guardians simply turning invisible have become commonplace and Bungie will be implementing a fix for that issue on March 16. That date is two days after Iron Banner was due to begin, so <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab_03_09_2023">Bungie has instead scheduled</a> the event to start on March 21, a week later.</p><p>The good news is that Trials of Osiris will return on March 17, a week earlier than originally scheduled, and there will only be a one-week break between the first Iron Banner week and the second, which will begin on April 4. In short, the next few weeks will have plenty of PvP events to dig into:</p><ul><li>The return of the Trials of Osiris - March 17</li><li>Iron Banner week 1 - March 21</li><li>Iron Banner week 2 - April 4</li></ul><p>Iron Banner underwent some big changes during the latter half of The Witch Queen year. As part of an effort to make it feel more like a can't-miss prestige event, Iron Banner was only held twice per season and featured new modes. That cadence has since been increased to three times per season, and other tweaks were made to make Iron Banner more rewarding after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-next-iron-banner-event-wont-be-a-huge-grind/1100-6510544/">players criticized the grindy nature</a> of the overhauled event.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-first-iron-banner-delayed-due-to-invisible-player-glitch/1100-6512229/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
