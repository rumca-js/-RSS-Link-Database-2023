Everything Everywhere All At Once is making historical wins well before 2023’s Oscars. We here at IGN did the breakdown and came to the conclusion that the A24 film is now the most-awarded movie of all time, with 158 awards to-date. Everything Everywhere All At Once has dethroned the previous holder of that title, The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. The Peter Jackson directed movie earned a total of 101 awards, according to our breakdown. In other news, rapper 50 Cent is developing a new series with Paramount Plus called Vice City. And no, it’s not related to the famed Rockstar Games title of the same name. And finally, you gotta give it up to Amazon for saving the once canceled Batman: Caped Crusader series.

Resident Evil 4 is one of the most influential games of all time and has gone on to shape the fabric of third-person shooters, survival horror games, and just games in general. Including the upcoming release of the new Resident Evil 4 Remake which has everyone hyped! But IGN's Alan Wheeler has a deep dark secret...he's never played Resident Evil 4.

Fortunately, IGN’s Brian Altano is an RE4 superfan who knows the game forwards and back. So in celebration of the upcoming release of the Resident Evil 4 Remake, we thought we’d pair them together to tackle the original game on original hardware.

For Episode 1, Alan is taking on the intimidating opening sequence of Resident Evil 4 while Brian waxes poetic.

We are playing the original GameCube release of Resident Evil 4 split between a modern television for capture and a CRT to recreate the original experience.

Presented by Resident Evil 4. Coming March  24th on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series Consoles, and PC.
