A self-proclaimed whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/10/tiktok-data-whistleblower-congress-investigators/\">talking </a>to <em>The Washington Post</em> says the social network's plan to protect American users' data, Project Texas, has major flaws. The former Trust and Safety team member claims the $1.5 billion initiative will still let TikTok connect to parent company ByteDance's Toutiao, a well-known Chinese news app. That link could theoretically allow China to access US data. A truly secure approach would require a &quot;complete re-engineering&quot; of the service's infrastructure, the ex-employee says.</p><p>The staffer also claims to have met with the offices of Sen. Chuck Grassley and Sen. Mark Warner to discuss the alleged weaknesses. Representatives for both senators acknowledged that meetings had taken place.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>We've asked TikTok for comment. Unnamed people at the social media giant tell <em>The Post</em> that the claims are &quot;unfounded,&quot; and the Toutiao code only amounts to a &quot;naming convention and technical relic&quot; that doesn't tie the app to China. They also believe that the relocation of US data to Oracle servers undercuts the assertion that Toutiao could affect the US business. The whistleblower was only employed for half a year, and he supposedly left months before Project Texas was finalized. He may not know the full picture, in other words.</p><p>TikTok has repeatedly denied cooperating with the Chinese government, and there's no publicly known evidence to that effect. Douyin, the equivalent app available inside China, has completely separate content.</p><p>The timing of the purported revelation isn't good for TikTok. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/house-committee-approves-bill-that-could-lead-to-a-tiktok-ban-in-the-us-185632229.html\">House</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/senate-bill-would-give-commerce-secretary-the-power-to-ban-tiktok-as-a-security-threat-202139609.html\">Senate</a> bills (Warner co-sponsored the latter bill) could lead to nationwide TikTok bans if they become law, and CEO Shou Zi Chew is set to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-ceo-congress-shou-zi-chew-privacy-security-china-201928160.html\">testify before the House</a> on March 23rd to address security and child safety concerns.

The report states that Boring employees were invited last year to apply for housing, with rents expected to start at around $800 per month for a two- or three-bedroom home. The median rent in nearby Bastrop is around $2,200 a month, so the workers would be paying below-market rates.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Still, employees who lived in the town would be further beholden to Musk. In addition to receiving a salary from his businesses, they'd be paying him rent. They'd have 30 days to leave the home were they to get fired from Boring or otherwise depart from the company, the report notes. Executives have discussed inviting workers from Musk's other companies to apply for Snailbrook housing too \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tesla-texas-gigafactory-10000-model-y-suv-210705243.html\">Tesla's Texas Gigafactory</a> is around a 30-minute drive from the town of Bastrop.</p><p>Plans for the town include converting a home into a Montessori school for up to 15 students, as well as possible incorporation. The latter would allow Musk to set certain rules for the municipality, which would also apparently need to hold a mayoral election.</p><p>Entities in Musk's orbit have snapped up at least 3,500 acres of land in the Austin area over the last few years, records are said to show. Last year, Musk, his architectural designer, former girlfriend Grimes and Ye (aka Kanye West) reportedly discussed ideas for the town several times last year, though nothing was finalized from those talks.</p><p>Meanwhile, nearby residents have raised concerns about the environmental impact of the projects. As the <em>Journal </em>notes, Boring has applied to discharge up to 140,000 gallons of industrial wastewater a day into the Colorado River. Worries have also been expressed about how testing of Boring's tunneling machines may affect groundwater and wells.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-wants-to-be-his-employees-landlord-194916936.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-wants-to-be-his-employees-landlord-194916936.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-10 19:49:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Ring Car Cam hands-on: Amazon's video security ecosystem hits America's highways", "description": "<p>Amazon\u2019s evolution from <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CdXlNb3J0LU9wZW5pbmctQWNjaWRlbnRhbC1XYXJsb3JkLVNob3BvY2FseXBzZS1lYm9vay9kcC9CMEJEVkpZUFE2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLW5zLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMWVmMTBjOC0xYjMyLTRhYmYtODc4Yi1mMWJlNDQ1ZDkzZjAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZK10-2s3P6gpQe82D9WJnbaxKA_LI0SDUUWXj3cu3-r&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBuyMort-Opening-Accidental-Warlord-Shopocalypse-ebook%2Fdp%2FB0BDVJYPQ6\">omnipresent shopping platform</a> to <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS8xOTg0LVNpZ25ldC1DbGFzc2ljcy1HZW9yZ2UtT3J3ZWxsL2RwLzA0NTE1MjQ5MzQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbnMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIxZWYxMGM4LTFiMzItNGFiZi04NzhiLWYxYmU0NDVkOTNmMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeopxmb3tXJyBLqnTZ8doZoYeaoDlcCa1dJkTbCp1Qch&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F1984-Signet-Classics-George-Orwell%2Fdp%2F0451524934\">omnipresent surveillance platform</a> continues apace, having drastically expanded its line of Ring security camera systems in recent years.

One sticking point I could see arising is the camera needs access to a home wi-fi connection during the setup/app pairing sequence. I was able to pull around my driveway until I was at  the exterior of the wall from my house\u2019s router but if you live in an apartment complex, things might get dicey.</p><p>\u201cIf you are unable to connect to your home Wi-Fi during setup, you can set up the device using LTE through Ring Protect Go,\u201d a Ring rep told Engadget. \u201cJust skip the \u2018set up with Wi-Fi\u2019 step in the set up flow and follow the on-screen instructions. Each new customer will have a free 30-day trial of Ring Protect Go, which provides LTE connectivity.\u201d</p><p>I was not at all a fan of the camera\u2019s wired power connection to the vehicle\u2019s OBDII port, which also monitors the battery\u2019s voltage so that the camera can turn itself off before fully exhausting the power supply. For one, that physical requirement limits the vehicles this system can work with to only those with OBD ports located to the left of the steering column. For another, I now have a 6-foot long cable snaking its way across my previously immaculate dashboard, draping down my driver side door panel to connect with the OBDII port just over my brake pedal. Even with the included 3M-adhesive cable stays (which, I might add, were immediately foiled by the tiny crags and crinkles of my dashboard\u2019s surface), I can hear the cord shifting and sliding around during turns, I\u2019m constantly aware of it when swinging my legs out of the car lest I accidentally catch it on a toe and tear the connector from the port. Which I did the very first time I drove after installation \u2014 and then the next as well.</p><figure><img alt=\"images of the Ring Car Cam installed in my car\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/8c63e3a0-ae1b-11ed-9ffe-2197f2963356\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Andrew Tarantola / Engadget</div></figure><p>The other issue is that not every car has an OBDII port located in the passenger cabin and for those vehicles the Ring Car Cam will not work. Neither will any of the vehicles on <a href=\"https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/11964047507732-Car-Cam-Incompatible-Cars\">this rather expansive list of incompatible models</a> for one reason or another \u2014 some cut power to the port when the key is removed and Teslas, for their part, don\u2019t even use the OBDII interface. What\u2019s more, if your dongle is already in use, whether for an insurance tracker or an interlock device, you\u2019re SOL with using the Car Cam. Same if you buy it in <a href=\"https://ratings.freightwaves.com/dash-cam-laws-by-state/\">a jurisdiction that limits the use of dashcams</a> \u2014 except then you also go to jail.</p><figure><img alt=\"Ring Car Camera shots, they're kinda blurry and grainy tbh\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/170c88d0-b179-11ed-baf3-4e1abe77a840\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Andrew Tarantola / Engadget</div></figure><p>At 1080p, the Car Cam\u2019s video quality is just fine for what the average driver would presumably be using it for and the interior-facing IR sensor will ensure that you get a good look at whoever\u2019s rifling through your center console at three in the morning. But, since it\u2019s mounted on the dash itself and not suspended from the rearview mirror like the commercial-grade ones you find in Ubers and Lyfts, you won\u2019t get much of a view of the interior below chest level. Accessing those videos takes a hot second as well, as the clips aren\u2019t transferred directly to your phone (if using Protect Go). They have to first be uploaded and processed in the cloud before you can watch them.</p><p>The camera offers a variety of recording options. You can set it for continuous use, as you would a traditional dash cam \u2014 and if you don\u2019t want it recording you, the unit thankfully incorporates a physical lens cover for the interior-facing camera. You can also use it specifically for traffic stops with the verbal \u201cAlexa, Record\u201d command, in which the system will record uninterrupted for 20 minutes even after the ignition has been turned off. Finally, there\u2019s Parking Protection mode that activates the camera if it detects motion or an impact when the vehicle is parked.</p><figure><img alt=\"Ring Car Camera shots, they're kinda blurry and grainy tbh\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/170c88d1-b179-11ed-bbbe-e60cc77c0527\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Andrew Tarantola / Engadget</div></figure><p>All of the recorded data \u2014 up to seven hours worth \u2014 is saved locally on the device and made available once the camera is back in range of a Wi-Fi connection. Again, that\u2019s not great if a thief or cop rips out the unit before the information can be uploaded. Also, there\u2019s no loop recording so if something important happens when you\u2019ve got 6 hours and 56 minutes of video already saved, you better hope the matter resolves itself in under 4 minutes, otherwise the recording will simply be cut off.</p><p>To get around that, you\u2019ll need cloud access and to spend $6 a month (or $60 a year) for the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b50ccd99-4c85-48e0-a2ed-9c2b9b65422b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ring&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiNTBjY2Q5OS00Yzg1LTQ4ZTAtYTJlZC05YzJiOWI2NTQyMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9yaW5nLmNvbS9wcm90ZWN0LWdvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMWVmMTBjOC0xYjMyLTRhYmYtODc4Yi1mMWJlNDQ1ZDkzZjAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAberW96nsWv4xzU-IxWzW6iNMNyoDQctRd6ziB_ed2UZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fring.com%2Fprotect-go\">Ring Protect Go</a> subscription service for it.

When asked whether safeguards have been put in place to prevent law enforcement from surreptitiously spying through the Car Cam, Ring\u2019s spokesperson noted, \u201cRing builds products and services for our customers, not law enforcement. When parked, Car Cam only records when the smart sensors detect an incident (such as a collision or broken window) or if the device owner or Shared User initiates Live View.\u201d What happens to that data once it's off the device and in Ring\u2019s cloud servers was not made clear.</p><p>Even if I could put aside Ring\u2019s cozy relationship with police, $250 for what the Car Cam offers is a big ask, especially with that $6-a-month cherry on top to get anything to work outside of your driveway. Granted, if you\u2019re already part of the Ring ecosystem, you like what it offers and want to extend that platform to your vehicle, absolutely give the Car Cam a shot.

However, buying a multiple-item charger can be a headache. You not only have to contend with varying levels of support, but different designs as well \u2014 the last thing you want is something that won\u2019t fit on your nightstand. While this space can be confusing, there are plenty of options out there that are worth your money. We\u2019ll walk you through what you need to know while shopping for a multi-device wireless charger, and recommend a few models that belong on your short list.</p><h2>Future-proofing</h2><p>It won\u2019t be shocking to hear that your phone choice influences your choice in chargers. Only iPhone owners will need to consider <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html\">Apple Watch</a> compatibility. Likewise, you\u2019ll need an Android phone if you expect to power a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html\">Galaxy Watch</a>. Buy an iPhone 12 or newer and you can attach your phone magnetically using MagSafe, while the latest Android phones often have some form of fast wireless charging.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>However, it\u2019s not simply a question of getting the fastest charger. You should consider what you might buy in the future. Don\u2019t buy a two-device charger if you have an iPhone and AirPods, but have been eyeing an Apple Watch. And if you think you might switch to Android (or vice versa), you\u2019ll want to get something more generic that doesn\u2019t lock you into any one ecosystem.</p><p>Some chargers include cradles, trays and other features that are heavily optimized for particular products, and might not even account for year-to-year changes. Some vertical stands are too tall for small phones like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html\">iPhone 13 mini</a>, for instance. While you can never completely guarantee that next year\u2019s phone or watch will work, it\u2019s worth buying something more likely to last.</p><p>Having said all this, don\u2019t be afraid to get a charger with vendor-specific features if you\u2019re fiercely loyal to one brand. Apple isn\u2019t expected to ditch MagSafe any time soon, and Samsung will likely keep making Galaxy Watches for a while to come.</p><h2>Where and how will you use it?</h2><figure><img alt=\"Multi-device wireless charger with Android phone and Samsung earbuds\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/b2b575e0-c7fe-11ec-8ee7-4c395c0c840d\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sebastian Bednarek on Unsplash</div></figure><h2></h2><p>You\u2019re probably buying a multi-device charger with one location in mind. It might sit on your nightstand or on your desk. Not everyone buys a charger just for themselves, though; you might want to use one as a shared station for you and a partner.</p><p>If the charger will sit on your nightstand, you\u2019ll likely want a compact, stable unit that won\u2019t swallow all your free space or tumble to the floor. You may also prefer a lay-flat phone pad so your screen is less likely to keep you awake. The Apple Watch and some other smartwatches can double as tiny alarm clocks, so you might want a vertical charging option for any wristwear.</p><p>At a desk, however, you may want a vertical phone stand so you can check notifications. Will the charger sit on a low table? Horizontal pads may make it easier to grab your devices in a hurry. Travel chargers should fold up or otherwise protect the pads while they\u2019re in your bag. And, yes, aesthetics count. You may want something pretty if it\u2019s likely to sit in a posh room where guests will see it.</p><p>If it\u2019s a shared charging station, you\u2019ll want something with multiple generic surfaces, and you\u2019ll probably have to forgo charging more than one watch at a time. In those cases, consider the handful of 4-in-1 chargers on the market, or models with USB ports.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>It\u2019s no secret that wireless charging is typically slower than wired, and powering multiple devices adds a new wrinkle. As these chargers often have to support a wide range of hardware, you\u2019ll have to forget about the fastest, device-specific options from brands like Google, OnePlus and Samsung.</p><p>That\u2019s not to say these will be slow, but there just isn\u2019t much separating them on the speed front. As a general rule, the quickest multi-device chargers tend to top out at 15W for phones. And you\u2019ll need a MagSafe charger if you want to get that full 15W on an iPhone.</p><p>It\u2019s rare that you\u2019ll find a truly slow example, mind you. Even some of the most affordable options we\u2019ve seen will recharge your phone at a reasonable 7.5W or 10W, and the 5W for other devices is more than enough. If you\u2019re only docking overnight or while you work, speed won\u2019t make a huge difference. Just be sure that whatever you buy is powerful enough for a phone in a case. It\u2019s also worth noting that fast charging for other devices is rare, although you\u2019ll occasionally find speedier options for the Apple Watch Series 7.</p><h2>Quality, box contents and small details</h2><figure><img alt=\"Multi-device wireless charger with iPhone and Apple Watch\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/225b4f00-c7ff-11ec-935f-08adfbebb3e6\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Melvin Thambi on Unsplash</div></figure><h2></h2><p>The difference between a good charger and a great one often boils down to little details. You won\u2019t always need to pay extra to get those, but a larger outlay may be worthwhile to avoid frustrations for years to come.</p><p>A textured surface like rubberized plastic or fabric will reduce the chances your expensive gadgets will slide off their charging points. The base should have enough grip and weight that the charger won\u2019t easily shift out of place. Any floating or vertical stands should be sturdy \u2014 steer clear if there\u2019s any wobble.</p><p>You\u2019ll also want to make a note of what\u2019s included in the box. Some chargers don\u2019t ship with power adapters, and we've seen numerous models whose Apple Watch \u201cstands\u201d are merely holders for your existing charging puck.</p><p>Then there\u2019s helpful touches like status lights for confirming correct placement, although you\u2019ll want to make sure they dim or shut off after a certain amount of time. And while it\u2019s still true that cradles and trays can limit compatibility, you do want your devices to stay where you put them. Shelves and lips can prevent your phone or watch from sliding. Oh, and be wary of floating smartwatch mounts, as heavier timepieces might sag.</p><h2>Best premium 3-in-1 charger: Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe</h2><p></p><p>It doesn\u2019t get much better than Belkin\u2019s most advanced model if you\u2019re an Apple devotee.

The base is weighty, covered in rubberized plastic and includes a discreet status light for your earbuds. More importantly, it supports more devices than you might think. Although the Pro pad uses MagSafe, the horizontal layout lets you charge virtually any phone at reduced speeds. We also have to give Belkin kudos for one of the most convenient Apple Watch chargers we\u2019ve seen. It not only works horizontally and vertically, but includes a knob to adjust for different sizes and third-party cases.</p><p>This is quite large compared to some 3-in-1 chargers, so it\u2019s not the greatest choice for a nightstand.

It consumes relatively little space, and the rubberized horizontal and vertical chargers deliver up to 10W while gripping your devices tightly, so both you and your partner can top off.</p><p>It has a few limitations, though. The vertical stand isn\u2019t well-suited to the iPhone 13 mini and other small phones. And while the floating stand works with most Apple Watches, heavier ones tend to sag (such as this author\u2019s steel Series 5 with a Leather Link strap) and might not charge properly. If those aren\u2019t issues, though, your $130 will be well-spent.</p><h2>Best budget 3-in-1 charger: Anker 533 Wireless Charger</h2><p></p><p>You can find plenty of more affordable 3-in-1 chargers.

There\u2019s also a 20W USB-C power adapter in the box, so you won\u2019t have to buy an aftermarket brick (or rely on proprietary cabling) to get started.</p><p>The limitations mostly stem from the cost-cutting measures. You probably won\u2019t have room for a second phone. And like some chargers we\u2019ve seen, the Apple Watch mount is a bring-your-own-cable affair that only supports older USB-A connections. The included cable with your Series 8 or SE won\u2019t work here. At $58, though, this is a good bargain.</p><h2>Another good option: Otterbox 3-in-1 Charging Station for MagSafe</h2><p></p><p>If you\u2019re willing to spend a bit more and live in Apple\u2019s universe, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=bd89df68-d794-46df-9d47-227b1088ae2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=OtterBox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiZDg5ZGY2OC1kNzk0LTQ2ZGYtOWQ0Ny0yMjdiMTA4OGFlMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3R0ZXJib3guY29tL2VuLXVzL21hZ3NhZmUtMy1pbi0xLWNoYXJnaW5nLXN0YXRpb24tZm9yLW1hZ3NhZmUtd2hpdGUvNzgtODA1MzMuaHRtbD8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjkyYWZjY2FkLTdhNmQtNGIzZS1iNzAxLTkxYzYzMDFmZDUyZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQjUDI0L2a6vakib3dS2kcEE9vbXDY4njaTrkAUE9uev&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.otterbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fmagsafe-3-in-1-charging-station-for-magsafe-white%2F78-80533.html%3F\">Otterbox 3-in-1 Charging Station for MagSafe</a> is worth your attention. The extremely small footprint is ideal for nightstands. You can tuck your phone, earbuds and Apple Watch into an area normally reserved for a single device. The company supplies a surprisingly powerful 36W USB-C power adapter in the box that serves as a fast wired option in a pinch.</p><p>The caveats are clear. The floating MagSafe stand rules out Android phones and older iPhones. You\u2019ll need to bring your own Apple Watch cable, and the USB-A port won\u2019t work with the USB-C cables bundled with newer watches. The horizontal-only watch mount also rules out clock functionality. The overall balance of space and utility is still difficult to top for $80.</p><h2>Best 2-in-1 charger: Mophie Dual Wireless Charging Pad</h2><p></p><p>The 2-in-1 field is highly competitive and makes it difficult to choose an absolute winner. However, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Nb3BoaWUtRHVhbC1XaXJlbGVzcy1DaGFyZ2luZy1QYWQvZHAvQjA3WFBEV1pMRj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1vNC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTJhZmNjYWQtN2E2ZC00YjNlLWI3MDEtOTFjNjMwMWZkNTJmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASPn72Yo5yZgMarHkS1lnYRZXcnsirWkFXP4tGCjTBCF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMophie-Dual-Wireless-Charging-Pad%2Fdp%2FB07XPDWZLF\">Mophie\u2019s Dual Wireless Charging Pad</a> hits many of the right marks. It can charge two devices at up to 10W each, making it a great pick for a two-phone household. The fabric surface with rubberized trim should keep your gadgets steady, and the status lights will confirm accurate placement. There\u2019s even a USB-A port to plug in your watch charger or any other wired hardware.</p><p>The complaints are few. You won\u2019t charge at 15W, and we\u2019d rather have USB-C than USB-A. It\u2019s nonetheless a safe choice at $80, and worth buying over less expensive options.</p><h2>Runner-up 2-in-1: Samsung Super Fast Wireless Charger Duo</h2><p></p><p>Multi-device chargers from phone manufacturers tend to be either compromised or highly proprietary, but <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TYW1zdW5nLVdpcmVsZXNzLVVuaXZlcnNhbGx5LUNvbXBhdGlibGUtSW5jbHVkZWQvZHAvQjA5TVYzQlJIQz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1vNC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTJhZmNjYWQtN2E2ZC00YjNlLWI3MDEtOTFjNjMwMWZkNTJmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdp0xhzFkGRaXjZnx_06GxSuHP-iXe7fZfM_69pEIgpT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSamsung-Wireless-Universally-Compatible-Included%2Fdp%2FB09MV3BRHC\">Samsung\u2019s Super Fast Wireless Charger Duo</a> (sometimes known as the 15W Duo Fast Wireless Charger) bucks that trend. It\u2019s compact and delivers high-speed charging for one phone and an accessory, whether it\u2019s a Galaxy Watch or another manufacturer\u2019s earbuds. The status lights will even dim at night, and change color to indicate when your batteries are full.</p><p>This won\u2019t help for two-phone households, and Samsung only guarantees 15W charging for some of its own phones (the Galaxy Note 10, Galaxy S20 and later). You\u2019ll also want to be mindful of which version you buy, as there are variants with and without a power adapter in the box. Neither is cheap at respective prices of $90 and $70. This remains an elegant charger for nightstands and travel, though, and the pads are sufficiently device-agnostic.</p><h2>Best charger for two people: Mophie 4-in-1 Wireless Charging Mat</h2><p></p><p>There are few wireless chargers built with more than one person in mind, but <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9XaXJlbGVzcy1DaGFyZ2luZy1tYXQtd2lyZWxlc3NseS1BZGRpdGlvbmFsL2RwL0IwOExLR1FMUkM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tbzQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjkyYWZjY2FkLTdhNmQtNGIzZS1iNzAxLTkxYzYzMDFmZDUyZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZ5e7GevxI0uXArUjmoMYikNnbxzdKC1iijnNp-ORzaU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWireless-Charging-mat-wirelessly-Additional%2Fdp%2FB08LKGQLRC\">Mophie\u2019s 4-in-1 Wireless Charging Mat</a> is the most well-rounded of the bunch. The pad can handle up to four devices wirelessly at 10W, including two phones and two accessories. There\u2019s also a spare USB-A port for charging earlier Apple Watch models (using the included mount and your own cable) or wired items. A fabric surface, subtle device trays and indicator lights will also take the mysteries out of charging.</p><p>This is a giant charger compared to most, and you might find it limiting if your home has more than one Apple Watch or accessories that won\u2019t fit the smaller charging pads. Even so, Mophie is offering considerable value for $150. The 4-in-1 does more than some 3-in-1  chargers at that price, and it doesn\u2019t suffer the compatibility issues of rivals like Nomad\u2019s Base Station Pro.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-multi-device-wireless-chargers-130020900.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-multi-device-wireless-chargers-130020900.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-10 16:30:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "March Madness Live brings multiview streaming to the web for up to four games", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/march-madness/\"><ins>March Madness</ins></a> will return in just a few days, as the First Four play-in games start on March 14th.

Though we've seen this discount a number of times before, it's still only $5 more than the lowest price we've tracked. We've <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/anker-622-magsafe-battery-pack-irl-143059141.html\">previously recommended</a> the 622 as a worthwhile buy for those who want a wireless power bank that supports MagSafe charging with iPhones. Like all wireless chargers, it won't refill your phone as quickly as a good wired option, and its 5,000mAh capacity is only enough to charge an iPhone 14 to about 80 percent. Still, it's compact, and being able to recharge without any extra cables is convenient on the go. The 622 also has a built-in kickstand, which you can use to prop up your phone while you're at your desk.

A recommendation from our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html#applepencil\">guide to the best iPad accessories</a>, the second-gen Pencil is a consistently responsive and accurate tool for digital artists and heavy note-takers.

The slightly bass-boosted sound should work for most people as well, and the design, while somewhat bulky, should provide a comfortable fit. The five- to six-hour battery life is just okay, however, and there's no multipoint connectivity or wireless charging support. Still, if ANC is your top priority, the is the true wireless pair to get.

You can expect Braking IN.CA.S disc brakes, an \u00d6hlins fork and shock, and Sram components for the chain, shifters and derailleur.

The display, which will be manufactured by Chinese supplier Tianma, &quot;could enable tighter integration with Apple's other hardware products.&quot; That signifies a &quot;significant shift in the company's smart home strategy,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Kuo's prediction echoes earlier reports by <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman that the company is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-smart-home-devices-report-155130684.html\">developing</a> a kitchen accessory that combines an iPad with a speaker. Just this January, Gurman reiterated that Apple is working on a slate of smart home devices in a bid to compete with Amazon's and Google's offerings. One of the products it's reportedly developing is a low-end iPad that can control various IoT devices, such as thermostats and lights, and can be used for video chats. It remains to be seen whether that's also the display that would come integrated with the HomePod.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>By launching a speaker with a smart display, Apple will finally be able to offer a direct competitor to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/googles-second-gen-nest-hub-is-on-sale-for-55-right-now-124656068.html\">Google's Nest Hub</a> and Amazon's Echo Show models. Apple is lagging behind its peers when it comes to smart home devices \u2014 its smart speaker, for instance, came years later than the Echo. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/why-apple-s-homepod-is-three-years-behind-amazon-s-echo?sref=10lNAhZ9\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> said way back in 2017 that it's because Apple's executives had a hard time figuring out where it would fit into its product ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Apple is clearly still in the midst of catching up with its competitors in the space, users can either choose between the HomePod mini and the newer <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-review-2nd-generation-140040630.html\">2nd-gen HomePod</a> that was launched in January for now. The new model has a touch panel at the top, but it has limited capabilities that include adjusting the volume, skipping tracks and summoning Siri.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-rumored-homepod-7-inch-screen-looks-set-to-arrive-2024-123535068.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-rumored-homepod-7-inch-screen-looks-set-to-arrive-2024-123535068.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-10 12:35:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: Microsoft's Bing has over 100 million daily active users, thanks to its chatbot", "description": "<p>Who\u2019d have thought anyone would use Bing in 2023?

Called a connectome, it diagrams the insect's 3016 neurons and 548,000 synapses, <a href=\"https://neurosciencenews.com/neuron-brain-map-22748/\"><em>Neuroscience News</em></a> has reported. The map will help researchers study better understand how the brains of both insects and animals control behavior, learning, body functions and more. The work may even inspired improved AI networks.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;Up until this point, we\u2019ve not seen the structure of any brain except of the roundworm <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-19-3d-map-of-neural-activity.html\">C. elegans</a>, the tadpole of a low chordate, and the larva of a marine annelid, all of which have several hundred neurons,&quot; said professor Marta Zlatic from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. &quot;This means neuroscience has been mostly operating without circuit maps. Without knowing the structure of a brain, we\u2019re guessing on the way computations are implemented. But now, we can start gaining a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>To build the map, the team scanned thousands of slices from the larva's brain with an electron microscope, then integrated those into a detailed map, annotating all the neural connections. From there, they used computational tools to identify likely information flow pathways and types of &quot;circuit motifs&quot; in the insect's brain. They even noticed that some structural features closely resembled state-of-the-art deep learning architecture.</p><p>Scientists have made detailed maps of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-google-brain-connectivity-map.html\">brain of a fruit fly</a>, which is far more complex than a fruit fly larva. However, these maps don't include all the detailed connections required to have a true circuit map of their brains.&nbsp;</p><p>As a next step, the team will investigate the structures used for behavioural functions like learning and decision making, and examine connectome activity while the insect does specific activities. And while a fruit fly larva is a simple insect, the researchers expect to see similar patterns in other animals. &quot;In the same way that genes are conserved across the animal kingdom, I think that the basic circuit motifs that implement these fundamental behaviours will also be conserved,&quot; said Zlatic.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/scientists-create-the-most-complex-map-yet-of-an-insect-brains-wiring-085600210.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/scientists-create-the-most-complex-map-yet-of-an-insect-brains-wiring-085600210.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-10 08:56:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "\u2018Ted Lasso\u2019 returns with a stronger, more focused third season", "description": "<p>I\u2019ve always found the major criticism against <em>Ted Lasso</em>, that it\u2019s too saccharine, to be quite unfair. This is a series in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life\"><ins>Frank Capra</ins></a> mold, where the sunny skies and primary colors sweeten the bitter pills being handed out. For every scene of wish fulfillment designed to get you pumping the air, there are meditations on suicide, betrayal and emotional neglect. It\u2019s also funny \u2013 enough that Emmy voters gave it Best Comedy two years in a row. Now the third and, far as we know, <em>final</em> season of the show will return to Apple TV on March 15th.</p><p>It picks up after the summer break, in the run-up to Richmond\u2019s return season in the Premier League (EPL) after winning promotion by the skin of its teeth last time around. It\u2019s been a long while since the second season aired, the longer gap attributed to behind the scenes issues. Jason Sudekis, who became co-showrunner this time around, <a href=\"https://puck.news/what-the-hell-is-happening-with-ted-lasso/\"><ins>reportedly</ins></a> ordered a ground-up rewrite after becoming dissatisfied with the original direction this season was taking. On the basis of the first four episodes, which Apple made available ahead of broadcast, our patience has been well-rewarded.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Such is the nature of Apple\u2019s restrictive covenant on spoilers that I can\u2019t talk about many specifics about the third season. The first episode is the weakest of the bunch, taking time to re-establish where everyone is after their summer break. (Are placeholder episodes necessary given the nature of streaming these days?) Keeley is finding the rigors of running her own business to be harder than expected, while Rebecca has taken Ted\u2019s pledge of winning the league to heart. Ted, meanwhile, is feeling just as emotionally stunted as he has been previously, moreso after spending a summer with Henry, clearly having not dealt with Nate\u2019s betrayal, or the contrived reasons behind it.</p><p>As part of <em>Lasso\u2019s</em> evolution from a sitcom to a comedy drama, the runtimes of each episode are now firmly measured in hours, rather than half hours. The narrative has broadened out to cover the personal lives of many of the main footballers, as well as giving Keeley a whole new team to work with. We even get our first proper glimpse of Michelle and Henry back home in Kansas, not to mention the storylines featuring Sam and, of course, the dreaded Nate. That\u2019s a lot for a show to handle, especially one that \u2013 similarly unfairly \u2013 was described as <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/tv/columns/ted-lasso-season-2-review-backlash-episode-10-1235071494/\"><ins>unfocused</ins></a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=111c4362-0f7f-48fd-83a0-5cf398008667&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Vox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxMTFjNDM2Mi0wZjdmLTQ4ZmQtODNhMC01Y2YzOTgwMDg2NjciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIyNjQzNTg1L3RlZC1sYXNzby1zZWFzb24tMi10d28tYmFja2xhc2giLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc3ODllMmQyLWYzNGQtNGE3ZC1iODQ2LTcyMzFmODYyNWMwMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAddq78XaAmuYAe5heiJsRP6jbl_6KCq101gofUUkMWOi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fculture%2F22643585%2Fted-lasso-season-2-two-backlash\"><ins>messy</ins></a> in its second season. (Blame must go to Apple for that one, given its late-in-the-day request to add a further two episodes to the order.)</p><p>There are more threads in the storyline, but Ted Lasso has refocused its episodic structure around the Premier League season. And two parallel narratives come to the fore: Ted\u2019s struggle to access his emotions in a healthy way, and the battle over Nate\u2019s soul. Rupert, played with evil relish by Anthony Head, is the devil lurking on the wonder kid\u2019s shoulder, dangling temptation before him at every turn. I probably can\u2019t talk about [ACTOR] playing [CHARACTER], either, a condensed version of every mono-named prima-donna footballer that is often idolized and hated in equal measure.</p><p>I was interested to see how the show\u2019s newfound embrace by the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ted-lasso-afc-richmond-fifa-23-153754365.html\"><ins>football</ins></a><a href=\"https://theathletic.com/4195888/2021/10/04/ted-lasso-agrees-licensing-deal-worth-500000-with-major-world-football-league/\"><ins>establishment</ins></a> would alter its customary lack of grounding in reality. This season sees plenty of filming at some big name stadiums, even down to the retention of the sponsor walls for post-match interviews. But don\u2019t go in expecting a new-found commitment to footballing verisimilitude, with the opposition teams all played by actors with little resemblance to their real-world counterparts. Just remember that this is still Ted\u2019s world, we\u2019re just lucky enough to spend a little time watching it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ted-lasso-season-three-preview-080056592.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ted-lasso-season-three-preview-080056592.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-10 08:00:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta is reportedly building a decentralized Twitter competitor", "description": "<p>Meta might offer a Twitter alternative like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-client-developers-fleeing-twitter-mastodon-130031551.html\">Mastodon</a> in the future, according <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/meta-mulls-a-twitter-competitor-codenamed-p92-that-will-be-interoperable-with-mastodon-10223961.html\"><em>MoneyControl</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/meta-is-building-a-decentralized?publication_id=7976&amp;post_id=107445508&amp;isFreemail=false\"><em>Platformer</em></a>. The social networking giant is reportedly in the early stages of developing an app codenamed P92 that would let users post text-based updates, and it's going to support Mastodon's social networking protocol called ActivityPub. Meta confirmed that a decentralized social network is in the works at the company and told the publications:</p><p>&quot;We're exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates. We believe there's an opportunity for a separate space where creators and public figures can share timely updates about their interests.&quot;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>P92 will carry Instagram's branding and will let users register and log in using their Instagram credentials, according to the sources. It will populate users' profile with their Instagram account details if they use their login on the photo-sharing app. But based on the product brief <em>MoneyControl</em> saw, &quot;data sharing from Instagram to P92 will be minimal, if not none&quot; after the initial sign up.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the app is decentralized, that means users can set up their own servers and set their own rules for content moderation. A source told <em>MoneyControl</em> that the app will allow users to broadcast their posts to those on other servers, but it remains to be seen whether they will be able to follow each other, as well. If the app supports ActivityPub, though, people will likely expect it to be somewhat interoperable with Mastodon and other decentralized apps that use the protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta has a list of features it definitely wants the app to have, including tappable links for posts with previews, shareable images and videos, as well as verification badges. The sources didn't say whether the company will be charging a fee for its badges as well, but it's worth noting that Meta <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-verified-is-a-paid-verification-service-for-facebook-and-instagram-161632996.html\">launched a $12-a-month paid verification</a> service for Facebook and Instagram back in February. Users will have the ability to leave comments and send private messages, but they might not be available in the first version of the app. And at this point, Meta is unsure whether to give people the ability to reshare posts like they can on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>MoneyControl says it's not quite quite clear whether the company has already started building the app, or if it's still in the planning period of development. By the time it launches, it's bound to have several more competitors to contend with, since Twitter rivals have been popping up to offer users an alternative after <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-elon-musk-bought-and-took-over-twitter-180045278.html\">Elon Musk took over</a> last year.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-decentralized-twitter-competitor-071316333.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/meta-decentralized-twitter-competitor-071316333.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-03-10 07:13:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta is 'pausing' bonus payouts for Reels creators", "description": "<p>Meta seems to be phasing out one of the key initiatives that helped Reels creators on Facebook and Instagram get paid.
