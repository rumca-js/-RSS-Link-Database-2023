<p>Sony's PlayStation Showcase aired on May 24, and it certainly brought the goods from both first-party and third-party studios. Alongside expected games like Spider-Man 2, the presentation gave us the surprise return of Marathon, a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, and several live-service multiplayer games coming to PS5 and PC. We also saw a sneak peek at Sony's new hardware--not a console, but a special handheld system--and were very pleasantly surprised by a high-octane Chinese action game with Devil-May-Cry-like flair, Phantom Blade Zero. Here are the biggest games and announcements from the PlayStation Showcase.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater revealed</h2><div>          </div><p>The Metal Gear Solid series was heavily featured during the PlayStation Showcase, and the biggest announcement was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-remake-metal-gear-solid-collection-revealed/1100-6514455/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. A remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 for the PS5, the new game did not get a release date, but the pre-rendered trailer featured Naked Snake in all his glory, along with a look at the wildlife chowing down on each other. Alongside the remake announcement for PS5, the show also revealed the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection containing the original Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2, and Metal Gear Solid 3. It's out this fall. What a thrill!</p><h2 dir="ltr">Spider-Man 2 gets extended gameplay </h2><div>          </div><p>The biggest chunk of time was, as expected, allotted to Marvel's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-trailer-introduces-kraven-the-hunter-symbiote-spider-man/1100-6514451/">Spider-Man 2</a>. The slice we saw focuses on both Peter Parker and Miles Morales, with the former seemingly being influenced by a symbiote, complete with more violent abilities and a raspy voice. At the beginning of the trailer, the villain Kraven, in Predator fashion, selects New York City as his target for a worthy opponent, discovering Peter and Miles from his harrier while they're both trying to stop Lizard's rampage through the city. The gameplay footage gave us a good look at the two Spider-Men's abilities, ranging from an electric attack as Miles to Peter's devastating Venom-like moves. Spider-Man 2 releases for PS5 this fall.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-showcase-may-2023-the-biggest-games-and-announcements/1100-6514540/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## PlayStation Is Returning To Handheld Gaming (Sort Of) With Project Q

<p>Looks like Sony is getting back into the handheld game. Kind of. Announced during the latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-may-2023-start-time-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6514429/">PlayStation Showcase</a>, Project Q is a handheld streaming device for PlayStation 5 games.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike, say, the PSP or PS Vita, Project Q is not a handheld gaming device. It only streams games, which is a <em>huge</em> bummer. To play anything on this new handheld, you have to download what you want to play to your PS5 first and then your console streams your downloaded games to Project Q via Wi-Fi.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">BREAKING: PlayStation unveils a new handheld cloud gaming device, bluetooth earbuds, and more!

## Bungie Announces Revival Of Pre-Halo Sci-Fi Series, Marathon

<p>Bungie, the studio behind Destiny 2 and the original Halo games, has announced it will be reviving one of its oldest series, Marathon. Revealed during PlayStation's May Showcase, Marathon marks Bungie's first big venture since the company released Destiny back in 2014.</p><div>          </div><p>Created in 1994, Marathon (and its subsequent titles, Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinite) was a Macintosh exclusive series that saw players take on the role of a nameless security officer aboard a colony ship called the Marathon. The first-person shooter was notable for being among the first games to allow players to look up and down, as well as for meshing together puzzles, complex plot lines, and survival elements in an innovative way. Many fans also look at the title as a sort of precursor to the Halo series, as it was the studio's first stab at the sci-fi shooters they would become famous for.</p><p>In a blog shared after the showcase, Bungie stated the revival will focus on offering players a PvP experience as they engage one another as "cybernetic mercenaries know as Runners." The studio shared additional information about the game's plot on its <a href="https://www.marathonthegame.com/y3vmGPNRxH3RNTqLkq5PFXZy">official website</a>, writing:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-revival-of-pre-halo-sci-fi-series-marathon/1100-6514533/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Trailer Introduces Kraven The Hunter, Symbiote Spider-Man

<p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-villains-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6514068/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> introduced a new threat for the highly-anticipated sequel: Kraven the Hunter, one of Spidey's oldest foes. The trailer showed Kraven bored with his jungle quarry and seeking a new hunt, only to be told by an underling that maybe he should head to Manhattan.</p><p>Then an extended gameplay sequence showed what Kraven was hunting: not Spider-Man, but Dr. Kurt Conners, aka the Lizard, apparently. Spider-Man popped out of a suburban home talking about protecting Connors and taking out the hunters. But the real twist is that Peter was donning the Symbiote suit, and seemed pretty angry about it. The scene then transitioned to Miles, equipped with a new gliding ability for traversal. Miles was sent to protect Connors and helps dispatch a warehouse of thugs with his own suite of Spidey powers. Notably Miles was accompanied by a drone piloted by his tech-friend Ganke, who hails from the comics.</p><p>The two Spider-Mans eventually reunite in the warehouse, finding Lizard and giving chase across the city while the hunters are in hot pursuit. In a cinematic chase sequence, Miles takes care of hunters on jet skis while Peter goes after the drones. But Symbiote Peter is a little too tunnel-visioned on taking down Kraven, making a critical mistake that forces Miles to save him and fall into the water, where the Lizard is lurking. That leads to another chase sequence, this time as Miles tries to escape the Lizard. It ends Miles showing concern for Peter, who is acting very out-of-character.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-trailer-introduces-kraven-the-hunter-symbiote-spider-man/1100-6514451/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Bungie briefly teased the next Destiny 2 expansion at the latest PlayStation showcase. Entitled The Final Shape, the teaser shows Ikora Ray and a ghostly Cayde-6 catching up in a mysterious realm.</p><p>The trailer begins with Ikora and her ghost sitting on a log next to a blazing campfire. She begins to explain some of the events of past Destiny 2 expansions, over the images of various Guardians combating various foes. She says, "I wish you could have been there," as the camera cuts over to Cayde, holding a ghostly, reconstructed gun. He replies, "I'm here now, wherever here is." The final shot shows Ikora and Cayde overlooking a vast valley, with a river running through it and the massive purple portal from the end of Lightfall hanging in the sky.</p><p>Cayde, notably, has been dead since the Forsaken expansion's release. Bungie has confirmed Nathan Fillion is coming back for The Final Shape to reprise his role, though it's unclear exactly how the story will explain his return.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-teases-the-return-of-cayde-6-in-expansion-the-final-shape/1100-6514535/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Five Nights At Freddy's series is getting a new addition in the form of a sequel to the franchise's thrilling VR game, Five Nights At Freddy's: Help Wanted. Five Nights At Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 was announced at the 2023 PlayStation Showcase with a short teaser trailer.</p><p>The trailer takes place in a structurally questionable elevator which seems to be descending at an alarming speed. "We know how challenging it can be to find a place where you feel that you truly belong, and to find a job that treats you mostly with respect, and infrequently, with contempt," an automated voiceover says over the elevator's intercom. "For that reason, we are excited to inform you that you did an adequate enough job the first time around to have you back. Also, there were no other applicants."</p><div>          </div><p>The elevator's lights flicker, revealing posters that feature two familiar characters from the franchise: Circus Baby and Bonnie. The elevator then crashes--though the player occupying it seems to survive--before the trailer reveals the game's title screen.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-help-wanted-2-announced-for-playstation-vr-2/1100-6514537/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The layout of the world looks way smaller than the past few Assassin's Creed games as well.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Mirage] is going to be a condensed experience," Assassin's Creed Mirage art director Jean-Luc Sala told GameSpot.

<p>During the PlayStation Showcase, Capcom showed off the VR mode for Resident Evil 4 with a harrowing, creepy trailer. The brief look at the upcoming mode showed segments near the beginning of the game, as Leon searches for a missing person and then comes face to face with a hamlet full of monster-infested villagers.</p><p>The VR trailer suggested the first-person perspective may make Leon a little more nimble than using a traditional controller, with a quick knife-motion followed by fluid gunplay that tilted the firearm to the side. It ended with a confrontation with the chainsaw-wielding villager, barely holding it back with a knife.</p><p>The end of the trailer simply said that the mode is in development for PSVR2.</p>

<p>Revenant Hill, the new game from two of the three creators of Night in the Woods, made its debut as part of Sony's latest PlayStation Showcase, sporting a similar look to that of its predecessor.</p><p>The teaser trailer shows a cat first running through the woods, then a series of fields, and finally a bustling town undergoing some kind of protest or labor dispute. At the end, the cat climbs a hill and sits down next to a cast of characters that include a woman, a skeleton, and what looks to be a possum in a hat, as they all look out on a sunny valley. The trailer concludes with the tagline "Rise Together."</p><p>Revenant Hill comes from developer The Glory Society, which was formed in 2019 by two of Night in the Woods original creators. It will be coming to both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, though no release date was given.</p>

<p>Neva is the next game from the developers of Gris and carries that game's mournful, painterly aesthetic forward into what appears to be an environmentalist fable.</p><p>The trailer depicts a white-haired woman tending to a field of pink flowers, accompanied by a massive wolf with large antlers, as well as that wolf's much smaller offspring.

Titled Helldivers II, the sequel appears to have one major difference from the original game.</p><p>Helldivers II is a third-person shooter, with Arrowhead Studios evidently deciding to toss out its predecessor's top-down POV in favor of a more intimate camera angle. But the game still retains plenty of similarities to the original Helldivers, including its setting.</p><p>Set on the same Super Earth as the first game, Helldivers II will see players take part in chaotic, futuristic battles against the enemies of Super Earth, with online multiplayer available for a more social experience.

<p>Phantom Blade 0, a new third-person slasher from Chinese developer S-Game, debuted as part of Sony's latest PlayStation Showcase.</p><p>A moody, dark trailer depicts a lone swordsman with only 66 days to live on a quest to "get his heart back." Along the way he battles a myriad of mask-wearing foes in stylish, Wuxia fashion. Phantom Blade 0's combat looks to be the true star, with fast-and-fluid sword strikes combined with aerial acrobatics like wall-running.</p><div>          </div><p>Phantom Blade is an ongoing series from S-Game, who most recently worked on the Phantom Blade: Executioners for PC and mobile. Given the reveal that this new title is called Phantom Blade 0, it seems it may be a prequel to earlier entries in the franchise. No release date was given for Phantom Blade 0, but it will be coming to PlayStation 5 sometime in the future.</p>

After all, it's been 13 years since the original game launched. In it, we see some of Bright Falls' would-be charming vistas and flashes of ritualistic murder all accompanied by the classic Wake narration, pulling players into its unnerving world. Remedy has said the sequel shifts the series into full-on survival-horror, and it sure looks like it.</p><p dir="ltr">Curiously, it looks as though the game features a second playable character, an apparent FBI agent who can be seen as the star of some gameplay snippets in the trailer. Of course, Alan is still playable, as the trailer also highlights his own gameplay moments.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-deep-guides-season-pass-gear-exotics/1100-6514462/">Season of the Deep</a> has added two new activities to Destiny 2, and in Deep Dive, the game ventures into the methane depths of Titan. Deep Dive offers a quick and challenging matchmade activity for up to three players, and if you keep your eyes open, you can score some terrific loot.</p><p>Like several other Destiny 2 activities, there's a trick to scoring some high-stat gear and unlocking Tier 3 rewards in Deep Dive, one that requires a little bit of teamwork and some keen eyes. Here's how you can get the best loot in Destiny 2's Deep Dive activity. It's worth noting upfront, however, that Bungie has <a href="https://twitter.com/destiny2team/status/1661407206003318785?s=46&amp;t=VClK2mskUB7UBYImaM_JWA">confirmed</a> that there is more to come from this mode in the weeks ahead.

<p>Lies of P releases soon, and ahead of the launch of this dark and twisted adaptation of the tale of Pinocchio, two new videos for the game have gone live. In the first video, which is a deep dive into the making of the game, director Jiwon Choi explains how the project came together.</p><p>According to Choi, developer Round8 Studio wanted to create a game that focused on its Souls-like combat and story equally. "In order to leave a striking impression on our players, we believed that we must deliver an equally striking story that grabs their attention," Choi said. "It occurred to me that we should utilize a well-known story, and turn that story on its head. I decided to choose The Adventures of Pinocchio because it's full of compelling characters and events. But in order to make our game unique, we completely recreated the story into a dark and mysterious one. A story based on Krat, a fictional city, plagued with a petrification disease."</p><p>This tweak to the Pinocchio story has resulted in several other characters from the books being reimagined, with one notable example being the four black rabbits. In the original story, the rabbits are undertakers who work for death, but in Lies of P, they're reintroduced as a group of assassins. As for combat, Choi explained that the studio aimed to create a realistic and detailed action system that exists alongside an in-depth system of character growth.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lies-of-p-trailers-show-off-clockwork-combat-and-a-dark-fantasy-world/1100-6514470/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">While Henry Cavill's departure from Netflix's The Witcher series after Season 3 has been known for quite some time, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/henry-cavill-the-witcher-season-3-exit-end-show/">Total Film magazine</a> has information on how close the show came to ending as a result.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, Cavill issued a statement announcing that his medallion and swords will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-is-leaving-the-witcher-for-season-4-replaced-by-liam-hemsworth/1100-6508734/">taken up by The Hunger Games star Liam Hemsworth</a>. (The announcement came around the time Cavill, in quick succession, announced he would be returning to the role of Superman--before he shared that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-wont-be-returning-as-superman/1100-6510069/">he will, in fact, not</a>.)</p><p dir="ltr">"We had the choice to have Geralt exit and to end the show," said The Witcher showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich.

There's just too many stories left to tell… If we replaced Geralt with another Witcher, we would be going fully away from the books, and I don't think that's what anyone wanted either." Hissrich added, "It was time for him in his life to move on...

## Destiny 2 Fishing Guide: Pond Locations, Focused Fishing, And Rewards

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-deep-guides-season-pass-gear-exotics/1100-6514462/">Destiny 2: Season of the Deep</a> is water-themed, and one of its most notable additions is a very unexpected one: fishing. Yes, the long-running looter-shooter is now home to a full-on fishing minigame, and while you shouldn't expect anything that compares with the in-depth mechanics of a proper fishing game, it does make for a fun distraction. And there are some layers of complexity, such as bait, a Focused Fishing meter, and shifting locations of fishing ponds to account for, which we break down below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How does fishing work in Destiny 2?</h2><p dir="ltr">Fishing is a fairly straightforward activity in Destiny 2, provided you know where to go (more on that below). You'll need to advance through the opening portion of the Season of the Deep questline, at which point you'll get a quest from Hawthorne to go fishing. Fishing ponds appear almost like public events on three destinations--Nessus, the EDZ, and the Throne World--and you'll often see other players congregate on the makeshift docks that emerge when these ponds are active.</p><p dir="ltr">To fish, you simply stand on the dock and hold your Interact button/key to cast a line into the water. When a fish eventually grabs on, you'll see your lure go under the water and a message will appear. Press Interact again--ideally the instant the message pops up in order to secure a "perfect catch." Even if you don't time that correctly, you can still reel in your catch.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-fishing-guide-pond-locations-focused-fishing-and-rewards/1100-6514504/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

But even if you aren't big on dystopian fiction, you'll still want to consider this bundle, as it has some interesting and eclectic games.

Unsurprisingly, the games in this bundle have bleak worlds. There are 14 games total.</p><p>You can grab three games for just $2.49, five games for $4, and seven games for $5 in this special. The standout games in this collection are Cosmic Star Heroine and Golf Club Club Wasteland, a lo-fi golfing experience set to a chill soundtrack and taking place on a future version of Earth that has been ruined by societal collapse. Sure, humanity might have died off and only a select few may have escaped extinction by fleeing to Mars, but it turns out that a post-apocalyptic wasteland is perfect for a few rounds of golf. The game also has a great radio station with some thought-provoking segments, in case you're looking for a different kind of golf tour. Meanwhile, Cosmic Star Heroine is a retro-style JRPG with turn-based combat and a compelling story.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-5-game-bundle-will-take-you-to-7-different-dystopias/1100-6514503/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## WoW Classic Adds WoW Tokens Without Warning, Prompting Community Backlash

<p dir="ltr">World of Warcraft is one of the longest-running success stories in gaming, but it hasn't been a smooth ride in recent years. Now, the WoW Classic community is up in arms after Blizzard added the real-money item WoW Tokens to the "classic" version of the game, leaving many players wondering where exactly the line is for this supposedly old-school experience.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Tokens are a controversial item that gives players a 30-day subscription to the game when used, and it can be sold in the in-game auction house for gold. Because you can buy them with real money, they are basically an official way for players to exchange real cash for in-game gold. In MMO terms, this is called a real money transaction (RMT for short), and it's generally not considered part of the "classic" WoW experience that these players desire.</p><p dir="ltr">The reaction to this news within the WoW Classic community has been dramatic, to say the least. Over on Reddit, the game's community suspended the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/13puu51/rule_4_is_officially_suspended/">long-running rule</a> that prevented players from discussing alternatives to the official WoW Classic game, including private servers and cheats that speed up the game's progression. The existence of such private servers predates the advent of WoW Classic, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/26/11509870/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-nostalrius-server-vanilla-wow-official">directly led to its creation</a> back in 2016 when one of the highest-profile servers was shut down after a Blizzard cease and desist letter.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-adds-wow-tokens-without-warning-prompting-community-backlash/1100-6514501/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Few strategy game franchises manage to accurately convey the scale of ancient warfare the way that Total War does, and for the next game in the series, Total War is off to Egypt.

<p>Actress Florence Pugh made her comic book movie debut as Yelena in 2021's Black Widow, and as it turns out, signing onto that movie led to some people in the filmmaking business to get "really pissed off" at her.</p><p>Pugh told <a href="https://time.com/collection/next-generation-leaders/6278537/florence-pugh-leaders/">Time Magazine</a> that "so many people" in the indie film world were "really pissed off" at her when she made Black Widow. Before Black Widow, Pugh starred in mainly smaller-scale films, and her peers in the space apparently didn't think she would ever come back.</p><p>"They were like, 'Great, now she's gone forever,'" Pugh said. "And I'm like, no, I’'m working as hard as I used to work. I've always done back-to-back movies. It's just people are watching them now. You just have to be a bit more organized with your schedule."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-starring-in-mcu-made-some-people-really-pissed-off-at-florence-pugh/1100-6514498/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actor Pedro Pascal has revealed he got an eye infection after taking so many selfies with fans who wanted to recreate how his Game of Thrones character died on the hit HBO series.</p><p>Pascal's character, Oberyn Martell, died during Season 4 in dramatic fashion. He had his eyes gouged out by The Mountain, and it was one of the show's more gruesome deaths. Despite its stomach-turning nature, fans of the fantasy series came up to Pascal and recreated the scene when taking selfies with the actor, and eventually Pascal got an infection from it.</p><p>"I remember, earlier on, because of Game of Thrones and the way my character died... people were super into taking selfies with their thumbs in my eyes," Pascal told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuqnPFL8-E8">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "And at first, I was so earnest and happy about the success of the character in the show, and I would let them! And I remember getting a bit of an eye infection."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pedro-pascal-got-an-eye-infection-from-people-wanting-game-of-thrones-selfies-inspired-by-his-characters-death/1100-6514496/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Embracer Group Loses Undisclosed $2 Billion Deal Amid "Challenging Year"

The publisher's CEO Lars Wingefors describes the situation as a "challenging year" that was caused by many factors, including a "major strategic partnership" that fell through after months of negotiations.</p><p dir="ltr">The comments do not reveal the other party in this failed deal, but the company describes it as a "grounbreaking strategic partnership agreement that would have set a new benchmark in the gaming industry." The deal was for $2 billion in development revenue over six years, and Embracer says that it had a verbal commitment from the second party back in October 2022.

<p>Destiny 2's second season of 2023 is here, and after Season of Defiance kept the action focused mostly on Earth, Season of the Deep shifts the focus back to Titan and the secrets lurking within its waters.

This new season will run from May 23 through August 22.</p><p>Season 21 introduces a number of updates to Destiny 2, ranging from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dozens-of-destiny-2-exotic-armor-pieces-are-getting-overhauled-in-season-21/1100-6514000/">Exotic armor</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-cool-dubstep-gun-and-several-other-exotics-are-getting-an-upgrade-next-season/1100-6514292/">Exotic weapon overhauls</a>, redesigned enemy shields, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-deep-artifact-perks-sound-like-a-shockingly-good-time/1100-6514349/">new Seasonal Artifact</a> that has some great perks for the Arc subclass.

## Sony Expects To Earn $450 Million From PC Games In Next 10 Months

<p>Sony's relatively recent push into the PC games market has proven successful already, and the company has high hopes for the future. For the current fiscal year that ends March 31, 2024, Sony said in an investor briefing that it expects to make $450 million from PC games.</p><p>This compares to $250 million during the previous fiscal year, $80 million a year before that, and $35 million before that. Sony's latest PC releases, Spider-Man Remastered and The Last of Us Part I, have proven to be successful. Spider-Man Remastered, which was released in August 2022, has sold 1.5 million copies and earned $52 million in revenue. The Last of Us Part I, meanwhile, launched on March 28 and sold 368,000+ copies in under a month, driving $15.5 million in revenue.</p><p>For years, Sony did not release its marquee first-party games on PC, instead keeping them exclusive to console, but that stance has changed. A range of PlayStation games are available on PC now, including Days Gone, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, and more.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-expects-to-earn-450-million-from-pc-games-in-next-10-months/1100-6514491/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## PS5 Players Are Spending Way More Than Last Generation

<p dir="ltr">Sony seems very pleased with how much money PlayStation 5 owners are dropping on video games, add-ons, subscriptions, and accessories for the console. The company boasted that so far--November 2020 through March 2023--people are spending an average of $622.</p><p dir="ltr">That's a considerable increase over what PS4 owners were shelling out over a similar time window (November 2013 through March 2016), according to <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2023/GNS.pdf">a Sony business update</a>. The "average life-to-date spend per active console" on PS4 was $479, meaning there's a $143 difference. To be clear, these numbers don't involve the purchase of the system.</p><figure style="width: 2724px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4142657-screenshot2023-05-24at8.44.47am.png"><img alt="Sony showcases the spending differences between PS4 and PS5 owners.

A large chunk of this presumably comes from free-to-play games with battle passes and cosmetics, such as Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone 2.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-players-are-spending-way-more-than-last-generation/1100-6514489/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2: Season Of The Deep Seasonal Challenges Guide - Week 1

<p>The first week of Destiny 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-deep-release-date-armor-story-and-everything-we-know/1100-6513865/">Season of the Deep</a> has commenced, and like previous seasons, there are new Seasonal Challenges to tackle. These are optional but rewarding challenges that you can tackle which will earn you Bright Dust that can be spent on cosmetics and experience points that can help you level up the season pass more quickly.</p><p>One of the other changes this season is focused on how seasonal bonuses are earned. Previous seasons would give you a chance to earn a rare resource each week which could then be redeemed at a vendor for a specific seasonal bonus, but Season 21 is changing up that approach. Instead, you'll have a selection of Season of the Deep-specific challenges that you can complete. Once you've completed one of these challenges, you'll automatically unlock a perk for your Guardian.</p><p>These perks are familiar to the ones that were available in previous seasons, as you'll be able to earn high-stat armor pieces, extra Deep engrams, and increased vendor reputation. You won't be able to accomplish all of them in one go, but you will be able to work through them at your leisure during Season of the Deep.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-deep-seasonal-challenges-guide/1100-6514465/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The PlayStation VR 2 has had something of a quiet launch, with the headset only available directly through Sony until it began to be stocked by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psvr-2-will-soon-be-available-at-major-retailers/1100-6513655/">major retailers in May</a>. According to sales numbers released by Sony for an investor update, this hasn't stopped the PSVR 2 from outselling the original PSVR in its first 6 weeks of launch.</p><p>As picked up on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/psvr2-has-sold-600k-units-8-over-psvr1-in-the-same-period-of-time.722320/">Resetera</a> from a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2023/GNS.pdf">Sony business update</a>, the company revealed the PSVR 2 sold 600,000 units in its first 6 weeks of launch, beating the PSVR's launch sales by 8%. This is despite a bit of a quiet launch, with Sony initially selling the headset through its own storefront, and only opening up to retailers like Amazon and Best Buy over two months after launch.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-2-is-apparently-selling-really-badly-report/1100-6512820/">early report</a> claimed that the PSVR 2 was selling poorly, but the new data shows that the headset ended up selling roughly two times what was estimated by Bloomberg analysts. It's unclear whether Sony ended up shipping the 2 million units it aimed to sell in the PSVR's launch quarter, however.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-vr-2-sold-better-at-launch-than-original-psvr/1100-6514486/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Logitech G Pro X 2 Wireless Gaming Headset Review - Top-Tier, Top-Dollar

<p dir="ltr">Iterations on tech and peripherals tend to fall in this weird spot where incremental improvements aren't significant enough to warrant the jump if you've already invested in previous models. There may be tangible upgrades to the tech, but if your current setup isn't falling apart or having issues then there often isn't a reason to make the jump. That's somewhat the case with the Logitech G Pro X 2, the newest version of Logitech's flagship <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-headset/1100-6486018/">wireless gaming headset</a>. Don't get it twisted though, the Pro X 2 is a fantastic headset that proves Logitech is still at the top of its game with some notable improvements on paper.</p><p dir="ltr">A combination of features make the Pro X 2 great all around--sound quality, comfort, and ease of use come together for a gaming headset with very few, if any, flaws. Lightspeed wireless connectivity still offers a virtually lagless audio experience, the microphone still sounds decent enough, and easy Bluetooth connectivity plus a 3.5mm jack still make it versatile. The big technical revamp is with Logitech's new 50mm graphene drivers, built with a type of material that minimizes distortion and offers cleaner and more accurate audio. If there are any drawbacks to point at, it'd come down to individual preference for the headsets design. However, coming in with an MSRP of $250 USD is a tough ask no matter which way you cut it, but if you fall into that mix of wanting a new high-end wireless gaming headset and willing to ball out for one, the Logitech G Pro X 2 should be on your radar.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Packaging and Features</h2><p dir="ltr">In the packaging, you get the headset along with the Lightspeed wireless USB dongle, a six-foot USB-C charging cable, a six-foot 3.5mm audio cable, the detachable microphone, and a soft neoprene case. The Pro X 2 itself still rocks the sleek, minimalist look of its predecessor, and I'm a big fan of this design as it looks like a premium product without unnecessary flair (if RGB lighting is your jam, you won't find it here).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/logitech-g-pro-x-2-wireless-gaming-headset-review-top-tier-top-dollar/1100-6514485/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Planet Of Lana Review - Mutual Dependency

<p dir="ltr">Planet of Lana begins in the quaint fishing village its titular protagonist calls home. As you chase after your older sister, stumbling at times--which elicits laughter from big sis--you're afforded time to get to grips with the game's 2D platforming, jumping and climbing over the wooden docks, platforms, and rooftops that make up this small but dense town. After passing through a bustling market where people are selling strawberries and freshly-caught fish, you sneak past a chef chopping up vegetables amid plumes of steam before passing by empty boats moored in the crystal-clear waters the town is built upon. It's a moment of serenity that could be mistaken for a rural location on Earth, were it not for the all-encompassing moon dominating the sky. As you gradually make your way out of town and into the verdant hilltops nearby, this fleeting tranquility is shattered by the ominous sight of dozens of drop pods tumbling into the planet's atmosphere.</p><p dir="ltr">Darting back through the village in the opposite direction is a harrowing experience, as an apocalyptic army of tinted-black robots begins rounding up any signs of life. The peaceful sound of waves crashing against the shore is violently replaced by people screaming and the unnatural bleeps of faceless colonizers, establishing a sharp contrast between tranquility and chaos. With her entire world turned upside down, Lana sets out on a seemingly impossible quest to rescue her captured sister and village, taking you on an enchanting four-hour adventure that's inspired by cinematic puzzle-adventure games like Another World, Inside, and the Oddworld series. You can see bits and pieces of each of these games reflected in Planet of Lana's gameplay, from its deliberate platforming to its logic and physics-based puzzle-solving. Yet it's the animated movies of Studio Ghibli that serve as the primary influence for Swedish developer Wishfully--something that's apparent right from the game's first few seconds.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Opening up on a shot of the daytime sky, the vivid hand-painted art style immediately pulls you in and evokes movies such as Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro without trying to replicate their exact style. Objects closer to the screen are coated in finer detail, for instance, while the vibrant backgrounds use broader, thicker brush strokes, creating a layered image that makes it feel like you're inside an interactive painting. Just glancing at screenshots sells the game's gorgeous aesthetic, but it looks equally stunning in motion, with trees swaying in the breeze, critters scurrying out of sight as you traverse through woodland, and ancient structures whirring to life after being dormant for decades--the world feels alive. The sense of scale is noteworthy, too, not just from a visual standpoint, but because of the way it gives perspective to the scope of Lana's task. The giant robot mothership that initially looms in the distance gradually consumes more and more of the horizon as you inch closer to its foreboding structure, providing a visible landmark for your journey's progress.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/planet-of-lana-review-mutual-dependency/1900-6418069/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
