It features a 24.1-megapixel sensor, eye-tracking dual pixel autofocus, and a very compact size for $479.99 body-only, launching in July. It will also be sold for $599.99 in a kit with the RF-S 18\u201345mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STM lens or $829.99 in a two-zoom kit with that same slow lens plus an RF-S 55\u2013210mm f/5-7.1 IS STM telephoto.
