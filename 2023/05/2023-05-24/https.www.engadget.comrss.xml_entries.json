[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Ron DeSantis had trouble announcing his presidential bid because Twitter's servers were 'kind of melting'", "description": "<p>Ron DeSantis was supposed to take to Twitter Spaces today to officially announce his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Unfortunately, for the governor of Florida, it appears Twitter was not prepared for the influx of people who were waiting to listen to the announcement. Shortly after the Space went live, the call dropped and DeSantis had to wait before he could say he was running to become the president of the United States of America. \"We've got so many people here that I think we are kind of melting the servers, which is a good sign,\" said Republican megadonor and Elon Musk confidant David Sacks said during a moment when the Space briefly returned before dropping again. The announcement eventually got underway after Twitter moved the Space to Sacks' account because Musk's \"account was breaking the system.\" Sacks said the Space, with more than 500,000 people tuned in to listen at one point, was the largest group that had \"ever met online,\" a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1661502529207775236\">claim that was quickly ridiculed</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\"When Elon Musk stepped up to purchase Twitter he paid a lot of money for it. And I'm sure because he's a good businessman \u2014 Elon, I'm sure you'll end up making money off it \u2014 but bottom line is you had to put your money where your mouth is,\" DeSantis said of Musk's purchase of Twitter after the Space finally got underway.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Musk\u2019s decision to personally give DeSantis a platform should put to bed any questions about his politics. Since his takeover of the platform last October, the billionaire has repeatedly engaged with and enabled fringe far-right voices. At the start of December, Twitter<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-restores-andrew-anglins-account-192658758.html\"> reinstated the account of Andrew Anglin</a>, the creator of the white supremacist website The Daily Stormer. Before that, Musk elevated conspiracy theories about the attack on<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/10/30/elon-musk-paul-pelosi-tweet-rumor\"> Paul Pelosi</a>. More recently, he has publicly attacked<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-anthony-fauci-viral-tweet-backlash-health-experts/\"> Anthony Fauci</a> and<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1658291808592629761?s=20\"> George Soros</a>. In helping DeSantis announce his presidential bid, Musk is aligning himself with a politician who has<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9kZXNhbnRpcy1mbG9yaWRhLWJpbGxzLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjViZGViYmVjLThkMzgtNDE0MC04YjYwLWUyZGJmYjRjMmIzYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAft6JkKFqU0H8HFvBHTakzzJXnPZSTGjiCrIfMImT79S&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Farticle%2Fdesantis-florida-bills.html\"> signed legislation</a> that has restricted access to abortion and banned transition care for minors.</p><p>Before today, Twitter, under its previous leadership, had never so directly engaged with a presidential candidate. At most, the platform's user-facing political outreach involved an<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-introduces-election-hub-170040996.html\"> election hub</a> that pointed people to information on how to vote and<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-21-twitter-to-livestream-presidental-debates.html\"> livestreams</a> devoted to debates between presidential candidates. Now the company plans to give former Fox News pundit<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/09/tucker-carlson-fox-news-twitter-show\"> Tucker Carlson a platform</a>.</p><p>During Donald Trump's years as president, the public got used to seeing a US leader use Twitter as a personal megaphone. The former president was banned from the website in 2021 in the aftermath of the January 6th US Capitol riot. Last November, Musk appeared to make the decision to reinstate Trump\u2019s account on the results of a Twitter poll. The company reinstated Trump\u2019s account on<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-donald-trump-unbanned-elon-musk-023043690.html\"> November 19th, 2022</a>, but even with some attempted public coaxing from Musk, the former president has not tweeted since before his ban.</p><p>The fact Twitter ran into technical difficulties should come as no surprise. Under Musk's leadership, the company has cut the majority of the workforce it had in place under former CEO Parag Agrawal, including much of the team responsible for its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-has-reportedly-laid-off-more-of-its-infrastructure-team-192330953.html\">critical infrastructure</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>This is a developing story.

According to the <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/take-your-first-look-at-ghostrunner-2-coming-to-ps5-this-year/\">PlayStation Blog</a>, <em>Ghostrunner 2 </em>is set one year after the events of the first game. Players will once again play as Jack, but by the sounds of it, they can expect a more expansive experience this time around. Publisher 505 Games says the game will feature more challenging combat and platformer sections, with levels that allow for more player freedom.

Perhaps most significant, though, Parker is wearing the iconic black Venom suit \u2014 for those less familiar with Spider-Man lore, the Venom suit gives Parker a ton of wild additional powers. But, it's also an alien symbiote that quite possibly could be affecting Peter's best judgement. How he ends up with the suit remains a mystery, but I wager it'll be a big part of the new game.</p><div id=\"86d57dd053d545eb96f32bc087e7bdb6\"></div><p>The preview also showed an extended action sequence where gameplay seamlessly flips between controlling Parker and Morales. A lot of the gameplay feels familiar, particularly in the hand-to-hand fighting area, but the new suit clearly offers a ton of new moves, while a wild chase through Queens gives a good sense of the kind of action we can expect outside taking down hordes of bad guys. We also got to see a new trick for Miles, as he now has a sort of &quot;wingsuit&quot; glider that lets him float over extended distance. This trick wasn't part of the <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> game from 2020 where we first got to control the younger Spidey.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It also looks like the game's map will be bigger than ever before \u2014 the first game covered most of Manhattan, but from this preview we've also seen Queens, and a huge portion of the chase sequence took place on the water, as well.

We'll get the chance this fall, though there's still no official release date.

The 2023 Smart Monitor M5, M7 and M8 will be available in June, including new 27-inch models. The headlining M8 starts at $650 for the 27-inch version, and $700 for its 32-inch counterpart. It boasts a new, slim design (about 0.45in thick) and can now rotate to portrait mode for reading long documents. The 4K screen is the most capable of the trio with a 400-nit typical brightness, HDR10+ support, an included webcam and a built-in SmartThings hub.  You'll also get far-field Alexa and Bixby voice control as well as HDMI 2.0 input, a USB-C port with 65W laptop charging and two USB-A ports.</p><p>The Smart Monitor M7 is aimed at users who want the M8's design without as many extras. It drops the included webcam (though you can still add it later) and SmartThings hub, and you'll have to be content with 300-nit brightness and regular HDR10. You get a 4K resolution and other luxuries from the M8, however. The prices are also more palatable, beginning at $550 for the 27-inch model and $600 for the 32-inch equivalent.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>A Smart Monitor M5 is also available for those who just want the basics. It's a 1080p display with a 250-nit brightness, no far-field mics and a simpler design without pivot or tilt. Input is likewise limited to two HDMI 1.4 jacks and a pair of USB-A ports. It's definitely more affordable, though, starting at $280 for a 27-inch panel and climbing to $300 for the 32-inch edition.</p><p>All of the Smart Monitors have new software tricks. They can detect nearby compatible smartphones (such as the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-specs-price-photo-and-video-take-center-stage-140034341.html\">Galaxy S23</a> series) through Bluetooth and wake up to show calendars, photos and other helpful content. You can now use a mouse and keyboard in many of the smart TV apps, and Multi View lets you juggle the built-in browser and Microsoft 365 apps in full screen. Screen mirroring is available for Apple devices (via AirPlay) in addition to Android.</p><p>These aren't intended as high-end gaming monitors given their 60Hz refresh rates, and you'll want to turn to the 5K-capable Viewfinity S9 if you want a more pro-oriented screen. As before, they're primarily appealing if your monitor doubles as your TV, or if the looks of the M7 and M8 stand out in a sea of generic designs.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-2023-smart-monitors-arrive-in-june-starting-at-280-133952508.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-2023-smart-monitors-arrive-in-june-starting-at-280-133952508.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-24 13:39:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Hasbro's augmented reality 'Twister' lets you play by yourself", "description": "<p>You know about Twister.

So when I got wind that Neural DSP's latest collaboration was with Rage Against the Machine guitarist I knew I'd have to put it through its paces. <a href=\"https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/archetype-tom-morello\">Archetype: Tom Morello</a> turns the company's meticulous modeling ears to the sounds that defined not just Rage but Audioslave as well, just like it has for <a href=\"https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/archetype-gojira\">Gojira</a>, <a href=\"https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/archetype-petrucci\">John Petrucci</a> and <a href=\"https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/archetype-rabea\">Rabea Massaad</a> previously. The result is a stunningly accurate recreation of Morello's tone, and one of the simplest entries in the Archetype series yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Where as most of the other Archetype plugins have multiple amp sims, racks of effects and even a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/neural-dsp-archetype-rabea-hands-on-guitar-synth-143016796.html\">synthesizer</a>, Morello's is a single amp and five core effects pedals, with a few extras tossed in. That shouldn't be that shocking, though. Morello has played more or less the same exact rig since the earliest days of Rage Against the Machine through to this very day on stage. Neural DSP modeled his specific amp, a beat up Marshall JCM800 50-watt head, that he famously has his tone literally etched in. The dials basically don't move. You can set them to whatever you want in the plugin, but why would you?</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Neural DSP Archetype: Tom Morello\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/018305d0-f9ee-11ed-afd6-f2363cb10905\" style=\"height: 1856px; width: 2374px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>His pedal board hasn't changed much over the years either. The core here comes down to five effects: an EQ, a phaser, a delay, a wah and \u2014 of course \u2014 a Whammy pedal (or simply &quot;wham&quot; here for trademark purposes). There's also a dive bomb pedal, though I'm fairly certain the effects its being used to create here were done on Tom's guitar with the tremolo arm or with the Whammy. Which I think is evidenced by the fact that none of the Morello-designed presets make use of that effect.</p><p>There's a bonus delay and reverb pedal, plus an EQ section (separate from the EQ pedal) and you can mic the virtual cabinet with 10 different virtual mics, change their position and distance from the speakers or even load your own IRs (impulse responses). While the later is a nice bonus, it will lead you away from the stated goal here \u2014 to make you sound like Tom Morello.</p><p>Well, there's good news and bad news on that front. Bad news is: you will never sound like Tom Morello. (Unless you are Tom Morello. In which case, welcome.) Morello's playing is as much about his unique style and carefully crafted technique as it is his gear. But, I will say that Neural DSP can get you like 75 percent of the way there. The raw tone from the amp sim is spot on. I always struggle when I decide I feel like banging out some Rage songs because I can't get anything even remotely close to the required punishing grooves out of my Yamaha THR 10 or Fender Blues Jr. But with Archetype: Tom Morello I was able to match the raw sound of his riffs.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Neural DSP Archetype: Tom Morello\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/94ea5030-f9ee-11ed-bf7e-11993f6d256d\" style=\"height: 1856px; width: 2374px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Since Morello relies heavily on digital delay and pitch shifting, those effects relatively easy to recreate in a plug in. Even his trademark phaser, which is analog, is pretty accurately captured here. The one effect that doesn't quite land is the wah. It's a bit harsher and nasal than what I hear on Rage records.</p><p>It's important to note, that to really get the most out of this plugin though, you'll need a MIDI expression pedal. Trying to play Morello's iconic Whammy heavy solos without an expression pedal is like trying to cook without salt. It might be technically possible, but the results will be... unpleasant. This is where I ran into a small problem. I do not have a MIDI expression pedal amongst my piles of gear. I have an analog expression pedal, and I was able to connect it to my computer through Arturia's new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-arturia-keylab-essential-mk3-is-full-featured-eco-friendly-and-reasonably-priced-151520351.html\">KeyLab Essential mk3</a>, but the results were uneven.&nbsp;</p><p>Ableton sometimes failed to recognize the full sweep of the pedal and I'd be unable to make the full two octave jump while playing the &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; solo. And when bypassing my DAW and using Archetype: Tom Morello as a standalone app, it inverted the sweep of the expression pedal, even when I reversed the polarity. So I had to go heel down when I would normally go toe down playing the wah guitar in &quot;Bulls on Parade,&quot; which was a bit tough to adjust to.</p><figure><img alt=\"Neural DSP Archetype: Tom Morello\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/94ea5030-f9ee-11ed-997e-2e5e11b4b64a\" style=\"height: 1856px; width: 2374px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>I also found that some of the presets, even the Morello-designed ones, needed a little EQing to sound their best. Especially the &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; and &quot;Like a Stone&quot; ones, where rolling off some of the high end was necessary to keep the highest Whammy notes from driving my dog insane.</p><p>Minor hiccups like that aside, channeling my inner teenager \u2014 wildly flicking my pickup selector on and off while creating cascades of high-pitched digital noise was insanely fun. Obviously, personal taste will play a major role here. But Rage Against the Machine and Morello were very important to my development as a guitarist. I will never be as talented, creative or famous as Tom Morello. But for an afternoon I could role play as a chaotic good master of riffs. At least until my five year old asked why the man on the stereo kept shouting &quot;fuck you, I won't do what you tell me.&quot;</p><p>Neural DSP's <a href=\"https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/archetype-tom-morello\">Archetype: Tom Morello</a> is available now for $119.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"92a6671c69a5445d90945b774473ce99\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tom-morellos-iconic-guitar-rig-is-now-a-119-plugin-130054959.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/tom-morellos-iconic-guitar-rig-is-now-a-119-plugin-130054959.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-24 13:00:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "AMD\u2019s RX 7600 graphics card promises smooth 1080p gaming for lower $269 price", "description": "<p>AMD has just announced its latest entry-level graphics card, the RX 7600.

Hopefully, the new card will be less of a mess than the 6600, especially at the lower price. As we saw in our review, the RTX 6600 had lackluster ray tracing and limited upscaling abilities.

In addition, it supports F-Log2 with up to 13-plus stops of dynamic range (DR), where the X-S10 was limited to F-Log with a stop less DR.</p><p>It offers a much higher 360Mbps bit-rate thanks to support for faster UHS-II cards, though there's still only a single card slot. You can also record 12-bit Apple ProRes and Blackmagic RAW video at 6.2K 30p and 5.2K/30p externally, either to Atomos or Blackmagic recorders. Finally, Fujifilm is offering an optional external cooling fan that allows for 6.2K video recording for up to 80 minutes, compared to 40 minutes without the fan.&nbsp;</p><p>Fujifilm flattered Sony by imitation with its dedicated &quot;Vlog&quot; function on the mode dial. This new setting gives you direct access to a vlogging touch menu that offers functions like product priority focus mode, background defocus, high-speed recording, face/eye detection and more. Much like Sony's V-series models, product priority mode disables face/eye detection so the camera will focus on a product placed in front of it, while background defocus opens the lens aperture as wide as possible for more background blur.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Fujifilm's X-S20 goes hard on content creation with 6.2K video and a vlog-specific dial\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/00aac1e0-fa28-11ed-b74f-f77d63efb456\" style=\"height: 1373px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Fujifilm</div></figure><p>Also new is UVC/UAC support that lets the camera work directly as a webcam by just plugging it into your PC. You can also stream 4K/60p video live online using OBS studio.</p><p>For photography, the X-S20 can fire bursts at up to 8 frame per second in mechanical shutter mode, or 20 fps in electronic mode. The buffer supports over 1,000 JPEG or compressed RAW images in mechanical mode \u2014 considerably more than before. However, it's limited to 35 frames for uncompressed RAW images, about double the X-S10. In electronic mode, the buffer can handle 79 compressed RAW images before filling, or 28 uncompressed RAW shots.&nbsp;</p><p>As before, it comes with five-axis in-body stabilization, though Fujifilm has boosted the power from six stops to seven with supported lenses. It also has a fully articulating 3-inch display, with resolution boosted to 1.84 million dots, up from 1.04 million. The OLED electronic viewfinder has 2.36 million dots of resolution and a 100 fps refresh.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"392bf86baca6485da5262d3416f08e16\"></div><p>It retains much the same body design with a slightly larger grip, and 491 gram weight that's a touch heavier \u2014 but it's still pretty light for such a powerful camera. Other features include microphone/headphone and HDMI micro ports, and yes, the pop-up flash is back.&nbsp;</p><p>The X-S20 is priced at $1,300 (body) only, which is considerably more than the $1,000 launch price of the X-S10. You can also grab it in a kit with XC15-45mm f/3.5-5.6 lens for $1,400, or with the XF18-55mm f/2.8-4 lens for $1,700. Shipping starts on June 29th.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with the camera, Fujifilm unveiled the XApp designed to control X- and GFX-series camera for remote shooting, file transfers and more. The company said it &quot;listened carefully to user feedback&quot; when developing the app, so here's hoping it's a large step up from the previous (dreadful) app. Fujifilm also unveiled the ultra-wide-angle XF8mmF3.5 lens ($800) shipping on or around June 29th, 2023.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Fujifilm's X-S20 goes hard on content creation with 6.2K video and a vlog-specific dial\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/b7a1e630-fa28-11ed-bffc-3da86b3fe090\" style=\"height: 943px; width: 2400px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Fujifilm</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-fujifilm-x-s20-puts-vlogging-right-on-it-its-dial-120841586.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-fujifilm-x-s20-puts-vlogging-right-on-it-its-dial-120841586.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-24 12:08:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Virgin Orbit gets stripped for parts as the company shuts down", "description": "<p>Once-successful Virgin Orbit has been sold for parts at auction after the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/virgin-orbit-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-as-it-seeks-a-buyer-094236877.html\">company declared bankruptcy</a> in April.

While the company's previous slates have found a niche as affordable, kid-friendly mobile entertainment devices, the Max 11 is going for a more grown-up audience. The Fire Max 11 seems solid value.

It's \"designed for new, first-time mirrorless camera or existing interchangeable camera users who previously enjoyed EOS Rebel or EOS M cameras,\" the company said. For that price, though, it's missing some key features that you'd expect on a modern mirrorless camera.&nbsp;</p><p>The EOS R100 has a 24.2-megapixel APS-C sensor, and and offers slowish 6.5 fps burst speeds and Dual Pixel AF with face and eye detection. To frame your subjects, it offers a basic but respectable 2.36 million dot OLED electronic viewfinder.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"The EOS R100 is Canon's cheapest R-series mirrorless camera yet\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/0bf3cc50-fa09-11ed-bef3-85d03ac232b3\" style=\"height: 1292px; width: 2200px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Canon</div></figure><p>The 1.04 million dot rear LCD display is where Canon really cut corners to make that price point, though. It doesn't even tilt, let alone articulate, and is a non-touch screen. That means you'll need to set the focus point using the D-Pad and navigate menu choices via the buttons. The EOS M50 II, by contrast, had a fully articulating touch display for $120 more at launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the M50 II, you can shoot 4K video at up to 24 fps, though it has a significant crop and you only get contrast-detect autofocus at 4K. 1080p can be shot at up to 60fps and does use the Dual Pixel AF system. Canon didn't specify the crop, but it's a significant 1.5X on the M50 II.&nbsp;</p><p>Other features include support for a single SD-UHS I memory card, microphone and HDMI micro inputs, Bluetooth/WiFi and a tiny 356 gram (12.56 oz) weight.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"add10e4f5ceb4012bb5bcdae4ac3cdbf\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>As Canon mentions, the main advantage compared to a smartphone is the ability to use multiple lenses. To wit, the company also unveiled a new pancake lens, the full-frame $300 RF28mm f/2.8 that should be great for tourism and street photography. If fixed to the R100, the latter would still be lighter than most mirrorless cameras at about 480 grams.&nbsp;</p><p>The R100 is as basic as it gets, but if you're looking for a new mirrorless camera, it's the cheapest one by far at $480. What's more, you can get it in a kit with the RF-S18-45mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STM lens for $600, still cheaper than the EOS R50, or $829 with that lens and the RF-S55-210mm f/5-7.1 IS STM. Neither has stellar quality, but would give beginners a solid range of focal lengths plus the R100 for less than the price of most camera bodies. That being said, if you can afford $200 more, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/canons-eos-r50-announced-specs-availability-pricing-040058410.html\">Canon's EOS R50</a> is a much better choice.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Canon EOS R100 mirrorless camera\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/6e934bb0-fa09-11ed-bfff-498aa2150842\" style=\"height: 1328px; width: 1984px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Canon</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-eos-r100-is-canons-cheapest-r-series-mirrorless-camera-yet-084049616.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-eos-r100-is-canons-cheapest-r-series-mirrorless-camera-yet-084049616.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-24 08:40:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sony says it sold 600,000 PS VR 2 units in six weeks", "description": "<p>Apparently, the PlayStation VR2 sold way better than its predecessor in the weeks after it became available.

That's around 8 percent more than its PS VR sales for the same time window. As <a href=\"https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2023/05/psvr2-sales-at-600000-six-weeks-after-launch-sony-confirms\"><em>PushSquare</em></a> notes, that number only covers sales until the beginning of April, so Sony has most likely already crossed the 600,000 threshold. Especially since the headset is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playstation-vr2-is-finally-available-at-retailers-170200109.html\">now available at retailers</a> after being exclusively sold for two months at Sony's website.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to announcing PS VR2's successful launch, Sony has also shared some information on its future plans. Apparently, the company intends to put more and more money into developing new franchises for the PlayStation over the next few years. By fiscal year 2025, it's aiming for a 50-50 split of PlayStation Studios investments' between old and new IPs. Based on the graph it presented, it's mostly been focusing on well-known franchises for the console, such as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-162534113.html\"><em>God of War</em></a> and <em>Horizon</em>, these past years. In 2019, for instance, it only put 20 percent of its investments on the development of new properties. For fiscal year 2023, its focus is still on current IPs, though not by much: 40 percent of its PlayStation Studios investments will go towards new franchises.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>One other area that Sony intends to put more money in is live service games like <em>Destiny 2</em> and <em>MLB: The Show</em>. By fiscal year 2025, it expects 60 percent of its PS5 investments to go towards live services and 40 percent towards traditional games. Further, the company expects sales from add-on or downloadable content to keep growing in the future. Sony has also revealed that it expects the PS5 to overtake the PS4 on all key metrics very soon. It believes the PS5 would have more monthly active users playing more hours on the newer console by February 2024. To note, Sony <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-over-384-million-ps5s-following-a-record-breaking-year-080509020.html\">sold more PS5 units</a> than it predicted for fiscal year 2022 after it solved its supply chain crisis to release more consoles.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sony-says-it-sold-600000-ps-vr-2-units-in-six-weeks-081130103.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/sony-says-it-sold-600000-ps-vr-2-units-in-six-weeks-081130103.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-24 08:11:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Logitech's Pro X 2 gaming headset promises longer battery life", "description": "<p>If you\u2019ve been looking to get <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html\">a new gaming headset</a>, or your very first, Logitech has a few new options. The company is today updating <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/logitech-g-pro-x-wireless-gaming-headset-130014108.html\">its Pro gaming headset</a> with a few notable changes that not only makes it a better gaming headset, but potentially a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html\">great set of all-purpose headphones</a>.</p><p>First and foremost, the new Pro X 2 headset features a new 50mm Pro-G Graphene audio driver. Why is that important? Graphene drivers are typically more power efficient, which is likely why Logitech claims the new headset nets up to 50 hours on a single charge. That\u2019s over twice the battery life compared to the outgoing model\u2019s 20 hours.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The headset is more versatile as well. In addition to Logitech\u2019s own proprietary Lightspeed wireless codec, the Pro X 2 now supports Bluetooth audio and a wired connection over the standard 3.5mm audio connector (previously, you had to choose whether you wanted a wired or wireless headset, not both). The headset also now supports the standard <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-dts-sound-unbound-spatial-audio-pc-games.html\">DTS headphone:X 2.0 spec</a>, for an immersive surround sound experience.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a headset if we didn\u2019t talk about microphones. The Pro X 2 features a detachable 6mm cardioid microphone with Logitech\u2019s own Blue \u201cVO!CE\u201d filters to help reduce background noise for crisp and clear vocals. The filters are available via the same G Hub software as the original headset.</p><p>The Pro X 2 features an aluminum and steel frame with swappable earpads. The earpads are made out of both leather and velour, making them a great choice for long term use. Swappable earpads are great as it makes it super easy to replace them if they\u2019re starting to peel.</p><p>The Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed retails for $249 and will be available <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vbG9naXRlY2hnLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFhMmU4NTFjLTNjYjktNGRiNy1iNDFmLTc2MzAxMDU4ZmNkMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcK4rlqwi3pQeLdRWQ0Kr7hzzqt6bHjZ2MlC6SyH9usu&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Flogitechg.com%2F\">starting today</a> in the US and Canada.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/logitechs-pro-x-2-gaming-headset-promises-longer-battery-life-070129596.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/logitechs-pro-x-2-gaming-headset-promises-longer-battery-life-070129596.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-24 07:01:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "SpaceX wants to join the FAA as defendant in environmental groups' Starship lawsuit", "description": "<p>While SpaceX completed the first fully integrated flight test for its Starship vehicle in April, the event wasn't exactly a complete success. The company blew up the spacecraft on the launch pad due to a separation failure, and that caused debris to shoot out across hundreds of acres of land that contained sensitive habitats. It also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-launch-caused-a-fire-in-a-texas-state-park-165630774.html\">started a 3.5-acre fire</a> on state park land. In response, environmental and wildlife nonprofit groups filed a lawsuit against the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), accusing the agency of failing to assess the Starship program's environmental impact around SpaceX's Texas launch site in Boca Chica. And now, SpaceX has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/22/spacex-joining-faa-to-fight-environmental-lawsuit-over-starship.html\">filed a motion in court</a>, requesting to be allowed to join the agency as a defendant.&nbsp;</p><p>If you'll recall, the groups suing the FAA claimed that the agency had violated the National Environment Policy Act when it allowed SpaceX to launch its super heavy-lift vehicle without conducting an environmental impact statement (EIS) assessment. The FAA did <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/faa-extends-environmental-review-spacex-boca-chica-072946680.html\">conduct</a> an environmental review of SpaceX's launch site and asked SpaceX to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/faa-wants-dozens-of-changes-before-space-x-expands-texas-launch-site-004321062.html\">make more than 75 changes</a>, but it didn't push through with an EIS assessment, which is a much more involved and in-depth process that could take years to finish.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In its motion, SpaceX detailed the lawsuit's potential impact on the company.  The plaintiffs, after all, are requesting for its launch license to be revoked and for the FAA to push through with an EIS assessment. SpaceX said &quot;further licensing of the Starship/Super Heavy Program could be significantly delayed&quot; by the lawsuit, which could also damage &quot;substantial national interest.&quot; SpaceX has existing contracts with NASA and the military, and a Starship variant is expected to take Americans to the moon.&nbsp;</p><p>The company also argued that the FAA &quot;does not adequately represent [its] interests,&quot; so it has to step in and defend itself.
