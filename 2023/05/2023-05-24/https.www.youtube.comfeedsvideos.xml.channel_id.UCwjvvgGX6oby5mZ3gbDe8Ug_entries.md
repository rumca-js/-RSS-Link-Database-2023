At the summit, the "elements of the Tang Dynasty" were evident everywhere, from the flags and palace lanterns, the palace maids who guided the heads of state, to the cultural performances on the red carpet in the garden. People who aren't familiar with ancient Chinese culture may find it a bit exotic. For many Chinese audiences, it may remind them of the ancient scenes of the red light district.
Chinese Premier Li Qiang was not called to Xi'an. On May 17th, Li Qiang met with Tajikistan's President in Beijing, and on May 19, he met with Kyrgyzstan's President in Beijing. So the representative of the government department, the Chinese Premier, doesnâ€™t need to be part of the royal family. Letting the party leader enjoy it alone is more in line with the CCP's understanding of the emperors in history.
