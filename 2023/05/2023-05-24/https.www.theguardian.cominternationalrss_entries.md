## Kenneth Anger, underground film-maker and Hollywood Babylon author, dies aged 96

<p>The pioneering movie-maker had a major influence on queer culture and the 60s counterculture, and is also remembered for authoring the cult film history book </p><p>Kenneth Anger, the artist and film-maker whose work offered a distinctively radical mix of paganism and homoeroticism, has died aged 96. Art gallery Sprüth Magers confirmed his death, saying: “Through his kaleidoscopic films, which combine sumptuous visuals, popular music soundtracks, and a focus on queer themes and narratives, Anger laid the groundwork for the avant garde art scenes of the later 20th century, as well as for the visual languages of contemporary queer and youth culture.”</p><p>Anger’s films, which included Fireworks (1947), Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954), Scorpio Rising (1963) and Lucifer Rising (1972), made him a key figure in the counterculture over four decades, and later a hero to subsequent generations of film-makers grappling with similar themes. While he never found commercial success through his films, his book Hollywood Babylon – a compendium of often sleazy and largely unverifiable gossip about the film industry – became famous after first being published in 1959; it was followed by a sequel in 1984.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/kenneth-anger-underground-film-maker-and-hollywood-babylon-author-dies-aged-96">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gun violence disproportionately affects Black and brown people, but some activists from those communities report being marginalized by peers</p><p>Nurah Abdulhaqq was 12 when she lost a family friend to gun violence – an experience that inspired her to make a change. After the student-led protests against gun violence in 2018 following the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, she got involved as a violence prevention organizer. “I knew that I could lend a different perspective as someone who not only has lost someone close to me to gun violence, but who also lives in an area affected by the school-to-prison pipeline and poverty,” she said.</p><p>But instead she often found her viewpoint sidelined, especially in the large national-facing violence prevention groups she found herself interacting with, said the Atlanta-based activist, now 19. “There was really not a discussion on Black and brown youth,” she said, or of the fact that gun violence has been the leading cause of death for Black male <a href="https://wisqars.cdc.gov/data/lcd/home?lcd=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%3D%3D">teenagers and young adults</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/24/advocacy-groups-marginalize-black-latino-minority-members">Continue reading...</a>
