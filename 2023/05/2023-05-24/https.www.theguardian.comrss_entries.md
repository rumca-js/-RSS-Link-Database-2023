## A Brighter Tomorrow review – Nanni Moretti’s new film is bafflingly awful

<p>In competition at Cannes, the Italian director’s comedy-drama about a failing film-maker is full of non-comedy and anti-drama – a complete waste of time</p><p>Nanni Moretti is the Italian director who will always have a place in our hearts, not least for his masterly The Son’s Room (2001), in my view <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/11/palme-dor-winners-ranked-cannes-film-festival">the greatest Cannes Palme d’Or winner of the century so far</a>. And more recently his cinephile comedy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/24/mia-madre-review-nanni-moretti">Mia Madre (2015)</a> was tremendous.<br /><br />But his new film in competition is bafflingly awful: muddled, mediocre and metatextual – a complete waste of time, at once strident and listless. Everything about it is heavy-handed and dull: the non-comedy, the ersatz-pathos, the anti-drama.<br /><br />It is effectively a film within a film, both as dull as each other. Moretti himself plays Giovanni, a high-minded film director with a failing marriage who is struggling to shoot his passion project about the Italian Communist party standing up to the Soviets over the Hungary invasion of 1956 – although a smirkingly ironic and evasive final title card indicates that A Brighter Tomorrow can’t even commit to deciding if all that was worth celebrating or not.<br /><br />Giovanni’s wife and longtime co-producer Paola (Margherita Buy) is paying the household bills with a side hustle producing a crass gangster flick for a crude up-and-coming film-maker, and this pains Giovanni so deeply that he actually trespasses on location when this film’s grisly mob execution is about to be filmed and stops everything to lecture them on how crass it is and why what they’re doing isn’t as good as the murder scene in Kieslowski’s A Short Film About Killing. Is he supposed to be a shrill, self-important idiot who deserves to be booted off the set? Well no: this presumably is a comic hero whose unfashionably high standards and chaotic midlife angst are supposed to be adorable. Meanwhile, Paola is seeing a therapist and confesses she’s thinking of leaving him.<br /><br />Mathieu Amalric phones in a grinning, sweaty performance as Giovanni’s dodgy producer Pierre, who is wheeler-dealing behind the scenes to raise the cash. There is a lot of perfunctory sub-Fellini circus business and a lot more peevish and redundant grumbling from Giovanni about the state of the cinema business today, featuring an easy-target scene in which Giovanni is forced to take a meeting with blockheaded Netflix suits who complain that his movie doesn’t have enough WTF moments. Actually this is one long WTF moment, for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />There is also the now traditional scene in which an ageing cinephile attempts to show a classic movie to his teen kid who isn’t interested – although it’s incidentally pretty baffling that Giovanni goes on about his other idea, to make a movie version of John Cheever’s short story The Swimmer, without mentioning the classic Eleanor and Frank Perry version starring Burt Lancaster.<br /><br />Moretti tries for some unearned sentimental endorsement by featuring classic Italian songs, and on the same everything-including-the-kitchen-sink basis, gives us a wacky walk-on from architect Renzo Piano in the Woody Allen/Marshall McLuhan style, and a final parade of movie-legend cameos which only make the film look blandly self-congratulatory. I’m sure the future will be brightened by another, better Moretti film – this one is best forgotten.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/a-brighter-tomorrow-nanni-morettis-review-cannes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Binoche and Benoît Magimel serve this Belle Époque tale of meaningful meals very well, but some may wish for a pinch of salt</p><p><br />Here is a beautifully shot movie from that estimable film-maker Tran Anh Hung – but it’s in a genre about which I am agnostic, the “foodie” vein, in which we are supposed to swoon over all the endless gastronomic detail and mouthwatering fare, and in which food tends to be somewhat glibly presented as a metaphor for sharing, for family and for friendship. (A recent conversation with a friend ended with him saying “foodie” films are no worse than the “filmie” films I roll over for, with their endless love-letter-to-the-cinema shots of the projector beams in the darkness and well-loved movie theatres poignantly closing after 80 years etc. Fair enough: <em>chacun à son goût</em>.)</p><p>The Pot-au-Feu, starring Benoît Magimel and Juliette Binoche, set in the Belle Époque, is adapted by the director from the 1924 novel The Life and Passion of Dodin-Bouffant, Gourmet by the author, gourmand and <em>boulevardier</em> Marcel Rouff. Magimel plays Dodin, a passionate gourmet living in some style, partly based on the legendary real-life gastronome Jean Brillat-Savarin. Dodin is not running a restaurant – he’s just rich enough to do nothing all day but think about and eat top-quality food, and is looking pretty svelte on it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/the-pot-au-feu-review-juliette-binoche-foodie-romance-is-an-invitation-to-drool">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on carers: those who do the caring deserve care themselves  | Editorial

<p>There remains a vast tension between the importance of care work, both paid and unpaid, and how little recognition it gets</p><p>Westminster rarely serves up good news, so let us celebrate when it does. Millions of employees are about to get a new statutory right: they can take up to a week’s extra leave to care for elderly, sick or disabled relatives. The law on carers’ leave was introduced by the Liberal Democrat MP Wendy Chamberlain and cleared its final parliamentary hurdle last week. All that awaits is royal assent. The Lib Dems describe the new act as <a href="https://www.libdems.org.uk/news/article/carers-leave-bill-to-become-law" title="">a “first step”</a>; what they want next is paid leave for carers. In this week’s announcement on the NHS, <a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Mission-Public-Services.pdf" title="">Sir Keir Starmer made the same commitment</a> for Labour.</p><p>There is much fertile political ground here, for any party that wants to claim it. There are around 5 million unpaid carers in the UK, looking after parents or family members. Without them, a lot of unwell and elderly people would have no lifeline, and local authorities and the NHS would come under huge strain. Many caregivers would never dream of taking money for their labours, but that doesn’t mean their work is valueless. Far from it: researchers at the University of Sheffield put the total value of <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/cost-unpaid-care-england-and-wales-now-exceeds-nhs-budget#:~:text=The%20value%20of%20unpaid%20care,156%20billion%20for%202020%2D21" title="">unpaid care in England and Wales at £162bn</a> a year, or the equivalent of the entire NHS in England.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/24/the-guardian-view-on-carers-those-who-do-the-caring-deserve-care-themselves">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arsenal winning the title in his memory was a fanciful thought, but in the end this team showed me something more valuable</p><p>“Come to see the Arsenal … you’ve only come to see the Arsenal …” The refrain continues, as it always will, repeated in the treasured memories of watching Arsène Wenger’s fabulous team with my father, Ray, in their glory years. But we’re not singing along. Ray is most likely succeeding in not showing his delight after another goal is rattled in, while sharing a knowing look with my brother, Adam, and I. Meanwhile our poker faces will have undoubtedly left a little to be desired. How we basked in the choir’s production, almost silent partners muddled in with hapless home supporters safe and smug in the simple truth that we had, indeed, only come to see the Arsenal.</p><p>Growing up as Arsenal fans in Telford made these clandestine trips a necessity. My brother and I fell in love with the club thanks to our dad’s passion and to an individuality built quickly through standing together in a playground crammed with Manchester United fans. Originally from Essex, Ray’s career dictated frequent moves before we settled in Shropshire, where our north London outpost felt like it would be forever stationed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/24/arsenal-didnt-win-the-title-for-you-dad-but-watching-them-try-helped-me">Continue reading...</a>

Navigating high-school hierarchies requires tactics and courage, knowing which battles to fight as well as when to retreat.</p><p>For Jin Wang (Ben Wang), the goal is to win the war to be seen as normal, maybe get a minor place at the cool kids’ table and perhaps even go on a date or two. As a second-generation Chinese American in a predominantly white environment, this is not without its additional difficulties. He finds himself having to thank schoolmates for telling him their favourite band is the South Korean boyband BTS and assure them that it is OK to laugh at Asian American stereotypes on TV because the show is being “ironic”.

Geographer who championed the idea of ‘defensible space’ in order to improve on the problematic designs of some high-rise estates<p>The geographer Alice Coleman, who has died aged 99, set out to prove that British modernist high-rise council estates were failing because their layout lacked “defensible space”, and that their problematic design reduced social interaction while encouraging crime and anti-social behaviour.</p><p>In her book Utopia on Trial: Vision and Reality in Planned Housing (1985) Alice condemned such estates as failed idylls, criticising authoritarian and paternalistic planners within the Ministry of Housing, local government and the Department of the Environment.

On a disused train platform, a gathering of giant toads, lizards and salamanders are causing quite a stir. Groups of schoolchildren stand and point, tourists pose for selfies and sleepy commuters squint in bafflement. It’s fun standing on the platform and clocking the expressions on passenger’s faces as they trudge down the stairs of London’s Gloucester Road tube station only to be confronted by their new amphibian travel companions.</p><p>“Normally my work is linked to bad taste and disarming humour,” says <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/monster-chetwynd-12108">Monster Chetwynd</a>, the artist behind the sculptures. “But these look oddly delicate, almost like Wedgwood porcelain.” While Chetwynd’s trademark childlike charm is present in the works, they’re less outrageous than some previous pieces.

In other words, working someone’s nerves for days on end isn’t going to persuade them to get the job done. But if they do somehow get it done, be sure to throw them a fish. Or something. It’s all about reward: less stick, more carrot. I get that. But the bit I can’t remember is how to get the seal to balance the ball on its nose in the first place.

Only that week he had found himself “pledging” to do more washing-up.

Speeding kills. It is the attitude that my life is more valuable than the life of anyone else on the road. The offence is further confirmation of the tinpot arrogance shown by a succession of this government’s second-rate ministers of state. Braverman needs a driving awareness course rather than points, and<em> </em>a tour of a hospital to see what speeding does to people.<br /><strong>Graham Murphy</strong><br /><em>Liverpool</em></p><p>• Simon Jenkins trivialises speeding. Exceeding the limit, although it is indeed rife, is serious and a major cause of deaths and serious injuries on the road. A limit of 20mph is an entirely sensible measure, and the idea that “London drivers now have eyes only for their speedometers” is nonsense. Anyone driving should have an idea of their speed without continually monitoring it, and if they haven’t, they are not safe to be on the road risking other people’s lives.<br /><strong>Dr Richard Carter</strong><br /><em>Putney, London</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/24/suella-braverman-plays-fast-and-loose-with-road-safety">Continue reading...</a>

## Pay attention to Rachel Reeves: her economic thinking is a return to sanity | Martin Kettle

<p>The shadow chancellor has a vision for social democracy in an age of economic shocks and uncertainty – New Labour this isn’t</p><p>The mythology of political history insists that politicians’ speeches are important. A lifetime in political journalism tells me different. Political speeches have got to be made, and some politicians are good at them – Michael Heseltine, the best I have ever heard – but most speeches are events of the moment. They are decorative, not determinative. Most do not matter much and are rightly forgotten, even the good ones.</p><p>There are, though, occasional exceptions. Rachel Reeves’ speech to the Peterson Institute in Washington DC on Wednesday has a claim to be one of those with a longer shelf life. Not because it was an oratorical tour de force stuffed with smart lines. It wasn’t. Some of Reeves’ terminology, such as her embrace of what she calls “securonomics”, is a distracting barrier to understanding what is otherwise a key idea. But that’s a small point. This speech matters a lot. It matters because the ideas and commitments it contains are serious – and because it addresses something indisputably important.</p><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/24/rachel-reeves-economic-thinking-social-democracy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Coverage of this year’s Cannes premieres has been dominated by how many minutes attendees are on their feet but the results are often meaningless</p><p>Art isn’t maths, on that we can all agree: there’s no scientific way to quantify its ambitions or its success. Yet in film, in particular, we never stop finding ways to organise it by numbers. People pore over Rotten Tomatoes scores, box office figures and Oscar tallies, citing records and precedents as neat bars of achievement. Such considerations might be deemed crass at the august Cannes Film Festival, an institution that prides itself on an art-for-art’s-sake stance – while, of course, housing a heaving international market and a celebrity-swarmed red carpet.</p><p>But Cannes attendees can’t resist finding different, festival-specific metrics by which to measure even the most esoteric works. Every day, people pick up the daily edition of the UK trade publication Screen International and flip to the back page, where the “Screen grid” monitors how the films selected in that year’s competition are faring with its panel of film critics by collating their star ratings: currently, the Finnish veteran Aki Kaurismaki’s charmer Fallen Leaves is tops with a 3.2 average, a fraction of a point ahead of new films by Todd Haynes and Justine Triet. (It seems unlikely that any title this year will match the 3.8 record set five years ago by Lee Chang-dong’s Burning.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/cannes-film-festival-standing-ovations">Continue reading...</a>

Trump, who has established himself as the dominant early front-runner.</p><p><strong>Debt ceiling</strong> negotiations between Biden and Republican House speaker <strong>Kevin McCarthy </strong>are continuing.

<p>Chris Billam-Smith fights Lawrence Okolie for a world title on Saturday, but how will it be for his loved ones outside the ring?</p><p>“It’s always been his dream,” Mia Billam-Smith says on a tranquil morning in Bournemouth as she describes the motivation she and her husband, Chris, will feel on Saturday night in their home town. Chris Billam-Smith fights Lawrence Okolie for the WBO world cruiserweight title in a fascinating yet dangerous clash between two boxers who worked alongside each other for years under their joint trainer Shane McGuigan. Okolie has since left McGuigan’s gym and, at last, Billam-Smith has the chance to fight for a world title.</p><p>“We were lying in bed around four in the morning, when you have those silly chats,” Mia says as she remembers how she and Chris first shared their deepest hopes soon after they met in 2014. “I asked him: ‘If you were on your deathbed, what would be the one thing in your life you would want to have achieved?’ For me my number one goal was to be a mum. I was desperate to start a family. Chris said: ‘I want to be world champion. If I’ve done that, then I’m going to be happy on my deathbed’.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/24/mia-billam-smith-watch-chris-get-punched-boxing-lawrence-okolie">Continue reading...</a>

## Britain isn't a nation of slackers – we're on the clock 24/7 and we deserve the 'right to disconnect' | Owen Jones

<p>Imagine your boss being fined for calling you after hours. In some European countries, that’s already a reality, and Labour wants us to follow suit</p><p>The idea of a clear demarcation between work and life is, for most people, an absurd joke: your life is being invaded, and you have no line of defence to protect yourself. Even if they are thousands of miles from their desk, a worker may still feel chained to it. Text messages and emails can arrive at ungodly hours, demanding prompt replies. Parents may find the nightly ritual of putting their kids to bed is interrupted by a panicked phone call from their boss. Almost as stressful is the idea that, as you collect your belongings to leave the office, you know you can never really leave: somehow, wherever you are, you remain at work.</p><p>Here is why “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_disconnect#:~:text=The%20right%20to%20disconnect%20is,messages%20during%20non%2Dwork%20hours.">the right to disconnect</a>” has become one of the great emancipatory causes for workers, and could be headed for Labour’s next manifesto. For example, Portugal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/18/portugal-bosses-work-hours-right-to-disconnect">introduced a law</a> at the beginning of last year that imposes a legal duty on bosses not to contact their workers outside of defined working hours. There is one exception – circumstances of force majeure – but otherwise, companies could be fined up to €9,690 (£8,400). In part, this is a response to the phenomenon of working from home: in Britain, 37% of employees now report working from home at least some point in the previous week. While this trend has been liberating for many workers, the Portuguese authorities found it could be exploited by bosses disregarding the idea that a remote worker ever clocked off.</p><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/24/britain-nation-slackers-right-to-disconnect-labour">Continue reading...</a>

According to Yasmin Khan, it derives its name from the Greek <em>menemnos</em>, “meaning to ‘flood’ or ‘overflow’”, which, as she observes, “makes sense when you see a pan of menemen with its eggs flooded in juicy, sweet tomatoes, just waiting for you to scrape up with some freshly baked <em>pide ekmek</em>”. But, as Somer Sivrioglu explains, though it’s a famous breakfast dish in Turkey, “no one can agree on the perfect version. It varies from village to village and from house to house – even in the Aegean town called Menemen, which is not necessarily its place of origin.” With that in mind, take today’s recipe as my humble contribution to the debate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/24/how-to-cook-the-perfect-menemen-recipe-turkish-eggs-breakfast-peppers-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At war with the establishment, putting themselves in reckless danger and succumbing to terrible habits, these unreliable figures are dependably entertaining</p><p>Cops. Good ones, bad ones, corrupt ones, ones with hunches, ones that fight the system, ones that drink, ones that have unhappy home lives, ones that have an unsolved case haunting them. They come in all varieties in crime fiction – though sadly for the most part they are still all men – and apart from solving the case in hand they have to entertain us en route. Their foibles are part of the deal. The cop who listens to classical music, who spends half his hours drinking real ale in a cosy pub, the cop who reads philosophy in his spare time. Every cop needs a gimmick.</p><p>Unlike the private eyes and Sherlock Holmes-type geniuses, most cops have two battles to fight. The battle to catch the criminal and the battle within their own force. It’s not often a cop in fiction happily rubs along with his boss and co-workers. Dealing with the hierarchies and complications of station life is often as important a part of the story as finding out the butler did it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/24/top-10-cops-in-fiction-alan-parks">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up here</a></strong></li></ul><p>When I got my first job on a games magazine, there were a few games on constant rotation at my grubby office, and at after-pub gatherings in the even grubbier flats my colleagues and I lived in: Pro Evo, Bomberman, and Street Fighter. Unfortunately, I sucked at all of them. Street Fighter was especially embarrassing for me, as an eager-to-prove-myself 16-year-old, because I could just never get my hands around the movesets and controls for all the different characters. I was a perennial button-masher, and I was humiliated so regularly that it put me off fighting games for life.</p><p>That said, I have always greatly admired<em> </em>Street Fighter, and its players. It is a stunningly energetic game full of stylish caricatures whose movement and swagger are fascinating to look at, especially in the hands of skilled competitors. I have watched fighting game tournaments in awe, and seen winners demolish opponents with deft combinations of reaction speed, on-the-fly strategising and seemingly unnatural powers of foresight. It is the perfect esport: matches are easy to follow, over in just a few minutes, and thrilling to behold. The stylistic flourishes that Capcom is so good at – flamboyant animation, moving backdrops, <em>the outfits – </em>only add to the spectacle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/24/pushing-buttons-street-fighter-6-preview">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Accor Arena, Paris<br /></strong>It’s not just the dependable hits that delight the audience as the venerable prog-popper rolls out his first set of fresh material for 21 years</p><p>It is 51 years since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/peter-gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> elevated Genesis from a burgeoning cult band to the stuff of music press covers by unexpectedly taking the stage at a Dublin gig clad in his wife’s Ossie Clarke dress and a fox’s head. It was a long time ago – “when dinosaurs roamed the earth and me and Tony both had hair,” as he puts it tonight, casting a glance in the direction of bassist Tony Levin’s shining pate – but clearly a lesson from that evening stuck with him. If you’ve got a tough sell on your hands – and tricky 22-minute songs played by reticent public schoolboys were never likely to elbow Bowie and Marc Bolan from the front pages in 1972 – it helps to dress it up.</p><p>So it is with Gabriel’s current tour. It’s not so much that the show is long, although the two sets top out at more than two hours. It’s that half of the 20 songs he performs are new, the contents of his first album of fresh material in 21 years, i/o, which may or may not come out at the end of this year. Some of them have trickled out online – Gabriel has been releasing a new song every full moon – but half of them have not.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/24/peter-gabriel-review-haunted-new-songs-have-fans-punching-the-air">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Netflix’s latest reality romance show focuses solely on women and non-binary people. It’s refreshingly trope-free TV – and its contestants bring a totally new flavour of chaos</p><p>Within the first two minutes of Netflix’s new series The Ultimatum: Queer Love, you already know exactly what sort of brazen reality TV shtick is going to unfurl. “You guys <em>slept together?</em>” asks one woman, her eyes narrowing as dramatic music thumps in the background. Another replies, indignantly: “Uh, she led my hand … to her vagina.”</p><p>The next few episodes can best be summed up as follows: endless tears and cocktails, jealous glances across the fire pit and that very specific grim vocal tone usually reserved for long-term couples engaging in arguments they have rehearsed many times before. This time, though, each person is being watched: by viewers, multiple cameras and nine other emotional contestants, all packed on to the same outdoor patio with a bar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/24/the-ultimatum-queer-love-review-this-lesbian-and-bi-dating-show-is-absurdly-watchable">Continue reading...</a>

## Clarence Thomas should resign from the supreme court, for the good of the court | Steven Greenhouse

<p>By acting as if Thomas has done nothing wrong, chief justice John Roberts looks pathetic and enabling of unethical behavior</p><p>After ProPublica and other news organizations exposed one damning revelation after another, it has become unarguably clear that Clarence Thomas is hugely corrupt, has brazenly and repeatedly violated disclosure laws and has shown utter contempt for the most elementary ethical standards. It’s deeply troubling that so few of our political leaders have called for the obvious moral response to this ever-widening scandal: Thomas should resign.</p><p>There’s been far too much shilly-shallying about all this. It’s not nearly enough to call on Thomas to belatedly comply with disclosure laws or to repay Harlan Crow, the billionaire rightwing activist who has showered $1m in favors on Thomas and his family. Thomas’s myriad violations are too serious, his contempt for ethics and conflict-of-interest rules too blatant, for us to accept half measures or slaps on the wrist. He has disgraced the court. It is time for him to go.</p><p>From 2003 to 2007, Thomas repeatedly failed to disclose that his wife, Ginni, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/clarence-thomas-wife-ginni-680k-side-income-1747449">was paid $686,589</a> by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which often files amicus briefs to the court.</p><p>In 2008 and 2009, Thomas failed to disclose that Crow paid <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-school-tuition-scotus#:~:text=Paoletta%20confirmed%20that%20Crow%20paid,would%20amount%20to%20roughly%20%24100%2C000.">roughly $100,000</a> in private school tuition for a grand-nephew Thomas was raising<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-school-tuition-scotus#:~:text=Paoletta%20confirmed%20that%20Crow%20paid,would%20amount%20to%20roughly%20%24100%2C000.">.</a></p><p>In 2011 and 2012, Thomas failed to disclose <a href="">at least $80,000 in payments to his wife</a> that Leonard Leo – the leader of nationwide efforts to install conservative judges – had secretly arranged to be paid by an organization that filed amicus briefs to the supreme court.</p><p>In 2014, Thomas failed to disclose that one of Crow’s companies <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-real-estate-scotus">paid $133,363</a> for three Georgia properties owned by Thomas and his family.</p><p>For at least two decades, Thomas has taken free luxury travel and vacations from Crow on yachts and private jets <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow">(valued at more than $500,000</a>) – and repeatedly failed to disclose those favors.</p><p>Even though Ginni Thomas repeatedly texted Donald Trump’s White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to urge more aggressive efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Clarence Thomas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/us/supreme-court-clarence-thomas-recusal.html">failed to recuse himself</a> from cases involving Trump and January 6. Indeed, Thomas was the only justice to back Trump in a case in which all the other justices rebuked Trump and backed releasing White House records about the January 6 attack.</p><p><em>Steven Greenhouse, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, is a longtime American labor and workplace journalist and writer, and the author of Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/24/clarence-thomas-should-resign-from-the-supreme-court-for-the-good-of-the-court">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A young escort searches for security among the leisured wealthy in Cline’s clever study of precarity and excess</p><p>Like Emma Cline’s celebrated 2016 debut <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/12/the-girls-emma-cline-review" title="">The Girls</a>, The Guest has a deceptively simple premise, and its achievement is to wring much nuance, tension and contradiction from it. It is a novel of precarity and excess, moving chaotically from beach to beach and pool to pool over the course of a late-summer week on what seems to be Long Island. This watery setting is navigated by a curiously liquid protagonist, Alex, a 22-year-old escort, as she improvises and adapts to survive.</p><p>Alex is introduced as a guest of Simon, a rich man 30 years her senior, whom she has recently begun dating in “the city”. She was losing clients, had got terminally behind on rent and had just stolen a large amount of money from a regular, when she met Simon and saw an opportunity. When Simon asks her to spend August at his summer house, she abandons her room and her debt and sets about making herself a permanent part of his luxurious life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/24/the-guest-by-emma-cline-review-a-stylish-follow-up-to-the-girls">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former Manchester United striker has pulled Sky Blues back from the brink and is, says one player, ‘a brilliant manager’</p><p>On Coventry City’s last visit to Wembley five years ago, the air conditioning on the team coach conked out en route, hardly ideal preparation for players and staff suited and booted in 33C heat for the biggest game of the season, if not longer. Most removed their ties and opened the collar on their shirts. Mark Robins debated taking his team off the bus but thankfully the iconic arch was on the horizon. For Robins, it represented just another hurdle to overcome, but small fry compared with the events that would follow. Regardless, it is the sort of hiccup Coventry could do without when they take on Luton Town on Saturday for a place in the Premier League.</p><p>Robins has grown accustomed to contending with adversity, be it groundshares, pitch problems or protracted takeovers since returning to the club six years ago, though a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/10/doug-king-completes-coventry-city-takeover-deal-signed-off-efl">takeover by Doug King</a> in January finally abated the sense of never-ending uncertainty. Coventry have played home games at Northampton, Birmingham and Burton over the past 10 years, at Burton last August because 65 rugby sevens matches across three days of Commonwealth Games action put paid to their pitch. Coventry were bottom of the Championship in October but ended the regular season fifth, their best finish since dropping out of the Premier League in 2001.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/24/mark-robins-rouses-reconstructed-coventry-to-brink-of-premier-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As England’s men and women prepare to take on Australia, nothing builds the anticipation like some well-aimed barbs</p><p>May creaks into June. The first block of the County Championship is in the can, the sun’s meek rays gather a little more strength and the damp English loam begins to sweat. So too the collective palms of the English cricket fan. A conjoined pulse quickens as thoughts, daydreams, hopes and fears become inordinately focused on that first ball at Edgbaston in three weeks’ time. That’s for the men. England’s women get under way at Trent Bridge seven days later – a first five-day Test on home soil. Two Ashes ding-dongs running side-by side. Twice the action and for now, double the chatter.</p><p>We’ve had Ollie Robinson talk about handing Pat Cummins’s boys a “good hiding” and Lauren Winfield-Hill declare that Meg Lanning’s Australian side – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/27/dominant-australia-hailed-as-best-ever-after-sixth-womens-t20-world-cup-triumph">one of the greatest teams in modern sport</a> – have “scars too”, adding for good measure that: “They can wobble, they can be fractured.” The response from Australian quarters has been disconcertingly muted. Even Glenn McGrath was seen to heavily caveat his customary 5-0 pre-series prediction this time around.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/24/cricket-spin-slurs-slights-of-pre-ashes-phoney-war">Continue reading...</a>

## No rhyme or reason: why is poetry missing from the new Caffè Nero book awards?

<p>Despite rising sales in the UK, there is no poetry category in the new writing prize. The reason isn’t a lack of audience but a lack of imagination</p><p>When I first saw the news that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/23/caffe-nero-launches-major-book-awards">Caffè Nero is establishing a new set of writing prizes</a>, I was thrilled. Since the Costa book awards came to an untimely end last year, it’s been obvious there is a gap that needs filling, a mechanism to celebrate titles which have the potential to reach a bigger than expected audience. As a judge in the final edition of the Costas, selfishly I was pleased too: the experience of reading across genres I wouldn’t always look at was enormously nourishing for me.</p><p>Alas, the thrill quickly wore off when it became apparent that one category had not made the transition from Costa’s prizes to Nero’s. While there will be awards for children’s books, debut fiction, fiction and nonfiction, poetry has not made the cut.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/24/no-rhyme-or-reason-why-is-poetry-missing-from-the-new-caffe-nero-book-awards">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Why would anyone put themselves through this?’ Melati Suryodarmo’s 12 hours of hell – review

<p><strong>Ikon, Birmingham</strong> <br />Whether hand-crushing charcoal in break-free stints or dancing on bricks of butter, the Javanese performance artist engages full-on with soul crushing and seemingly futile punishment</p><p>Wearing a white smock, a woman stands on a field of charcoal lumps. All day, Indonesian artist Melati Suryodarmo has been crushing charcoal to dust with a heavy, stone rolling pin, leaning over a stone block mounted on an iron table. The whole scene is black and white and grey under the gallery lights. She’s made no discernible inroads, though the black dust soils her smock and hangs in the air as it spills to the floor. The residue has blackened her hands and arms. It smears her face and clogs her hair. Thin black rivulets run from her nostrils. The artist began performing – if performance it is – at 10am, and continues for 12 hours, with no intermissions, no toilet breaks, no water, as she goes about her task. She doesn’t wear a mask. Suryodarmo’s I’m a Ghost in My Own House, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_5Wkfqlb0">which she has been performing since 2012</a>, is compelling, though the work she’s doing is horrible and hazardous.</p><p>The audience comes and goes through the long day. Some stay, willing Suryodarmo on, or waiting for her to drop. We watch in silence, to the sound of crushing and sifting, the noise of her feet crunching over the charcoal, the repeated stamp of the roller as she breaks up the bigger, fist-sized lumps. I’m struck by how close it is to hard labour, the futile, soul-breaking punishment tasks given to Victorian prisoners ‑ climbing the treadmill, turning the crank, moving rocks from one side of a room to the other, then back again. I feel like a voyeur.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/24/melati-suryodarmos-12-hours-hard-labour-hell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The NBA’s all-time leading scorer alluded to retirement after the Lakers’ playoff exit this week. Only he can decide if continuing is worth it</p><p>When LeBron James broke <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/08/lebron-james-tribute-scoring-record-kareem-abdul-jabbar">the NBA’s individual scoring record in February</a>, he was unusually reflective. He described his two decades in the league <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/08/lebron-james-tribute-scoring-record-kareem-abdul-jabbar">as a rollercoaster</a>: “Like one of the great rides. You get off just wanting to do it again. My career has been like that. Your stomach drops at times, you’re yelling, sometimes you can’t breathe. But you always want to do it again.” He later clarified that: “I’m not going nowhere. But [I know] it sounds like I am. I’m gonna go get something to eat, I’m gonna drink some wine, then I’m gonna drink some Lobos, and I’m probably not gonna sleep tonight. So I will see y’all when I see y’all, and I hope you had a great time too.”</p><p>Much of what happened to James after that record-breaking night was surprising. At the trade deadline, the Los Angeles Lakers, who started the season 2-10, shipped off Russell Westbrook and revamped their roster. They then staged <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/apr/29/los-angeles-lakers-season-turnaround-contenders">one of the most impressive turnarounds</a> in recent NBA history and carried their newfound momentum all the way to the Western Conference finals, where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/22/denver-nuggets-la-lakers-nba-playoffs-scores">they were swept 4-0 by the Denver Nuggets</a>. The Lakers were better than the result suggests: James and his teammates put up a valiant effort against the championship-favorite Nuggets, losing the four down-to-the-wire games by a combined total of just 24 points. The Nuggets’ nearly flawless roster and boundless energy proved too much for an exhausted Lakers team that had been battling hard for months just to qualify for the playoffs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/24/lebron-james-retirement-comments-los-angeles-lakers-nba-playoffs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Laure Calamy plays a woman forever racing between maternal and work duties in an acutely relatable story that grips </p><p>Anyone who has ever broken into a sweaty panicked run to make it in time for school pick-up will instantly get why the French Canadian director Eric Gravel has chosen to shoot this film about motherhood frazzle as a gripping thriller. I was on the edge of my seat in one scene, watching to see if a woman running to catch her commuter train home makes it. Her name is Julie, and she’s a divorced mum of two who’s feeling the grind: work, kids, mortgage arrears, crappy ex. It’s such an authentic and relatable film – so meticulously observed, in fact, that to be perfectly honest, I assumed it had been made by a woman.</p><p>Laure Calamy plays Julie; she’s in her early 40s, with a couple of children under eight. Every morning, Julie’s alarm clock goes off like a starting pistol. In the dark she walks her kids to the childminders, carrying her sleepy little boy. Then it’s a sprint from the suburbs into Paris where she works in a fancy hotel as head chambermaid. It’s a high-stress job. “The guests are demanding. They pay to be.” Then it’s back to the suburbs to pick up her kids in time for bed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/full-time-review-school-run-thriller-turns-into-high-stakes-motherhood-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A howl of scholarly frustration at a prime minister out of his depth </p><p>Boris Johnson has been accused of many, many things over the years. But the parties and the lies, the sleaze and the juicier scandals don’t seem to interest historians Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell much. Their central complaint in this utterly scathing account of his time at No 10 is the more fundamental one that, as they put it, he “never understood how to be prime minister, nor how to govern”; that he didn’t know what he was doing, barely bothered learning, and was so lacking in moral seriousness that even when he tried he couldn’t transcend the limitations of his “base self”. It’s a lofty charge, but a grave one nonetheless.</p><p>A career headmaster and stickler for detail who has published report cards on each prime minister back to Tony Blair, Seldon was never likely to warm to the overgrown schoolboy Johnson, and so it proves. The story really begins with Johnson’s response to his side winning the Brexit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis">referendum</a>: far from celebrating, they write, he paced the house looking “ashen-faced and distraught”, panicking aloud that: “Oh shit, we’ve got no plan. We haven’t thought about it. I didn’t think it would happen.” What weighed most heavily in his choosing leave over remain, they suggest, was his own personal ambition. From this unfolds a tale of power pursued without much purpose, or latterly dignity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/24/johnson-at-10-by-anthony-seldon-and-raymond-newell-review-the-great-pretender">Continue reading...</a>

Last Saturday, Sinn Féin became the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/20/sinn-fein-poised-to-become-biggest-party-in-northern-ireland-councils">largest party of local government in Northern Ireland</a>. The party now has 144 seats across local councils, as opposed to the Democratic Unionist party’s 122. This comes on the back of last year’s local assembly election when Michelle O’Neill, deputy leader of Sinn Féin, became Northern Ireland’s first minister-designate. The nationalist vote outpolled the unionist vote for the first time. Now, Belfast city council, a traditional unionist stronghold<strong>,</strong> has only 17 unionist councillors out of 60 seats. Historic is the only word for it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/24/unionism-crisis-in-northern-ireland-sinn-fein-election-winning-machine">Continue reading...</a>

A literary La Haine, owing more to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/27/wiley-where-to-start-in-his-back-catalogue" title="">Wiley</a> than to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/25/peter-ackroyd-interview-foundation-england" title="">Peter Ackroyd</a>, it presented the capital as noise: Lon‑din, a city contaminated by an imperial past, a place where “constant, punishing memories are left to spill into one another”.</p><p>The follow-up, Mister, Mister, also begins and ends in London, and has as its backdrop a series of Islamist terror attacks across mainland Europe.

<p>Her attempt to comfort me seemed ridiculous at the time. But years later it showed me how I could be there for my own daughter</p><p>The first night back from the hospital, I tried not to cry. In the dark, I squinted at the wall clock. The thick black hand hovered around the three. I lay propped up against pillows and towels. My baby’s body was hot and furious. Her little head fit in the palm of my hand. I was convinced I was holding her wrong. That if I could do it right, she would feed and rest and grow up healthy and strong. But my grip felt weak and wobbly. This might have been because I’d had a C-section and they’d cut through several layers of my flesh. Or because I am generally clumsy. She wept and wept.</p><p>I thought about how much I loved her and how uncertain I had been about becoming a mother. Achy, bloated and exhausted, I was not sure I’d made the right choice. This had nothing to do with her and everything to do with me. I did not feel cut out for the task of mothering. I had the support of my family. My partner’s work had given him generous paid leave. Entering parenthood, I had as much safety and stability as anyone could. Despite all these advantages, I was failing to give my daughter the two things she needed: food and sleep.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/24/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-was-in-my-20s-and-depressed-then-my-mother-moved-into-my-bed">Continue reading...</a>

I think I would stop pausing when burrito places ask me if I want guacamole, but unlearning that behaviour would take a while.</p><p>I think there is a limit to how much wealth a human being can spend interestingly, and mine caps out just short of the £2m mark.

<p>A deserting Nazi private and a local farmer’s daughter enact bloody revenge on plundering troops in this tightly-staged switch-your-brain-off entertainment</p><p>This Netflix-backed action-driven story is effectively a spaghetti western that just happens to unfold in Germany in the last days of the second world war. (A sauerkraut or currywurst western?) Director Peter Thorwarth strives for that same pulpy-elegiac blend that made the films by Sergios Leone and Corbucci, Franco Nero and all the rest so compelling and repellent, with their squelchy violence and operatic conflict. Per the title, there’s indeed a lot of blood.</p><p>It starts with Heinrich (Robert Maaser), a lowly private in a small platoon about to be hanged for desertion because he’s disgusted by his side’s actions and just wants to go home and find his kid. But, counter to the German stereotype of ruthless efficiency, the troops just drive off and leave him to die instead without making sure the job is finished. He’s cut down from the tree by plucky farmer’s daughter Elsa (Marie Hacke), who is protecting her homestead as well as her brother Paule (Simon Rupp). Paule has an unspecified learning disability, and Elsa has managed to shield him from being sent to the death camps like so many “defective” people were under the Nazis. But soon Heinrich and the siblings must defend the farm against troops who come looking for plunder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/blood-and-gold-review-second-world-war-spaghetti-western-is-good-pulpy-fun">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Queen Elizabeth II ate jam sandwiches daily, so I’m not alone in craving the same food time after time. If only I could persuade my wife that spuds are the perfect meal</p><p>Variety may be the spice of life, but have you tried a baked potato? In my opinion, a jacket potato with cheese and peas is the perfect meal. It’s tasty, it’s moderately healthy, it’s super-easy and it’s cheap. Well, it used to be cheap until food prices went berserk. Do you know how much one moderate-sized potato costs in my local supermarket? One dollar (81p)! And it’s not just my Philadelphia grocery store where spuds are so expensive: potato prices have spiked around the world, thanks, in part, to <a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-driving-the-potato-chip-shortage-and-when-will-it-pass-198667">extreme weather ravaging crops</a>.</p><p>Anyway, this wasn’t meant to be about the food system’s vulnerability to climate crisis. Nor was it meant to be a reflection on how the cost of living is out of control and there doesn’t seem to be any sort of plan, in either the UK or the US, on how food prices can be brought down. (Instead of a plan, there are patronising comments from people such as Ann Widdecombe on how nobody has a God-given right to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/17/ann-widdecombe-dont-have-cheese-sandwiches-cant-afford-them">eat delicacies such as cheese sandwiches</a>.) No, this was meant to be about my passion for potatoes: an extremely versatile vegetable. Much to my wife’s dismay, I would gladly eat a baked potato for dinner every day. To be clear, I have never done this: my streak is probably three days in a row. But if it wouldn’t ruin my marriage, I would.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/24/id-eat-a-jacket-potato-every-day-if-it-wouldnt-end-in-divorce">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is red wine good for you? Is it healthier to drink a little than not at all? Is there such a thing as hangxiety? It’s time to sort fact from fiction</p><p>Birds do it, when they eat berries that have fermented in the first frost. Bees do it, when they suck on tree sap. Educated fleas don’t do it, obviously – but “many kinds of monkeys”, noted Charles Darwin in The Descent of Man, “have a strong taste for … spirituous liquors”. There is evidence that humans were brewing their own booze even before the wheel caught on, but how much do we know about how it works on our brains and bodies? <br /><br />Well, quite a bit. Recent decades have seen dozens of studies validate some old sayings, debunk others, and give the medical establishment a much clearer understanding of how alcohol affects us and how much it is <em>really</em> OK to drink.

Rogen is Will, a recently divorced brewery owner with a hipster bar, who is trying to be content with “selling quality product made with integrity to people on Hinge dates and pretty well-to-do alcoholics”, but is given to kicking over any electric scooters he passes and finding excuses to contact his ex.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/24/platonic-review-rose-byrne-and-seth-rogen-might-just-have-made-the-perfect-modern-buddy-comedy">Continue reading...</a>
