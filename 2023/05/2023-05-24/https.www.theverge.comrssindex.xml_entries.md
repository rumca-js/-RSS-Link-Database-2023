  <p id="WrNjT2">Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced his 2024 presidential campaign to screeching audio feedback and technical difficulties in a Twitter Space with Elon Musk on Tuesday. </p>
<p id="ArIsdE">DeSantis eventually did launch his campaign, but the event was mired with problems from the very beginning — and DeSantis didn’t manage to use the initial Space hosted by Musk. When moderator David Sacks, a venture capitalist and former PayPal product lead, first unmuted himself to start the talk, the Space was filled with loud, echoing feedback sounds before quickly going silent. The accounts of DeSantis and Sacks popped in and out of the initial room, muting and unmuting themselves before leaving entirely.</p>

  <p id="XYVaHV">At its PlayStation Showcase event, Sony revealed that <em>Beat Saber</em>, the hit music VR game, would be launching on Wednesday for the PlayStation VR2. We already knew that <em>Beat Saber</em> was in the works <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23539817/psvr2-ces-gran-turismo-7-vr-upgrade-beat-saber">for Sony’s new VR headset</a>, but the sudden launch is a surprise. If you already own <em>Beat Saber</em> for the original PSVR, you’ll get a free upgrade to the PSVR 2 version, according to the description <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZWucnG12gc">in Sony’s YouTube trailer for the game</a>. Alongside the release, Sony also revealed that you’ll be able to buy a Queen-themed music pack for the game.</p>
<p id="uSdSKA"><em>Beat Saber</em> wasn’t the only piece of VR news from the event. Sony showed off footage of the in-development <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/23/23612535/resident-evil-4-remake-trailer-the-mercenaries-vr-mode-demo">VR mode</a> for the recently released (and very good) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake</a>.

  <p id="Ae0ccz">PlayStation is launching its own pair of wireless earbuds. During the PlayStation Showcase on Wednesday, Sony showed off its first pair of Bluetooth-enabled buds that you can use with the PlayStation 5, PC, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23736595/sony-project-q-playstation-handheld-official-showcase">with its new Project Q handheld device</a>.</p>
<p id="730ahj">Sony says the earbuds will feature “new wireless technology developed by SIE” later this year to make them capable of delivering lossless audio with low latency. The company didn’t reveal too much about the wireless buds but says that additional details will come “in the months ahead.” While Sony already has a number of well-regarded wireless earbuds, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review">like the Sony WF-1000XM4</a>, Bluetooth support alone isn’t good enough to use them directly with your PS5 for gaming.</p>

  <p id="L59VTs">Sony shared new details about <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> at its PlayStation Showcase on Wednesday. The game’s central villain will be Kraven the Hunter — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraven_the_Hunter">this guy</a> — and the lengthy new gameplay footage showed off Peter Parker utilizing new powers with a symbiote suit. Suffice to say, it seems much darker than the first game. We also got a look at Miles Morales, who will be playable in the new game. The sequel doesn’t have a specific release date, but it’s launching sometime this fall.</p>

<p id="I3pxnx">Bungie has only dropped a teaser and <a href="https://www.marathonthegame.com/y3vmGPNRxH3RNTqLkq5PFXZy">website</a> so far, but <em>Marathon </em>is currently in development for PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC with full cross play and cross save.

More details will be shared tomorrow, May 25th, according to a prerecorded message that employees received. Over 6,000 employees were present on today’s call — <em>The Verge</em> spoke with several of them — but the consolidation measures could end up impacting numbers far beyond that. </p>

It’s a competitive multiplayer title with a focus on heists.</p>
<p id="9Kzmyz">“Fairgames will give you an opportunity to break the rules as a modern-day Robin Hood, a thrill seeker, or just someone who wants to collect cool loot,” creative director Mathieu Leduc <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-fairgame-a-competitive-heist-experience-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/">wrote on the PlayStation blog</a>. “Trespass inside forbidden locations around the world, fill your pockets like a kid in a candy store and unravel the nefarious plans of untouchable billionaires.”</p>

  <p id="3ufz4V">For many years now, a group of researchers and activists have warned about the potential dangers of children using social networks. The warnings resonated with me emotionally, since so many people I know — young and old — have struggled with their own relationships to apps like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. It seems logical that what many people experience as a kind of icky feeling after too much scrolling manifests as something much more serious in others — particularly in young people.</p>
<p id="0F8jR2">Anxiety over this state of affairs has contributed to a significant uptick this year in state-level regulation aimed at getting kids off their phones. (The other reason, of course, is a total failure of Congress to act.)</p>

  <p id="qKX3BB">The first trailer for <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2023/films/2079701">A24’s <em>Problemista</em></a><em> </em>from director Julio Torres plays like a dizzying work-related stress dream — one you actually want to pay attention to because it’s about someone else’s existential crisis.</p>
<p id="ANJ64f"><em>Problemista</em>’s story revolves around Alejandro Martinez (Torres), a talented and aspiring toymaker from El Salvador who makes his way to New York City hoping to make it big by realizing some of his more experimental, unconventional playthings. Though Alejandro knows in his heart that he belongs in NYC chasing his dreams, with time running out on his current work visa, there’s a very solid chance he could be forced out of the country, putting him in a very difficult position.</p>

  <p id="LJ0Zea">After more than three years without a fully staffed Federal Communications Commission, President Joe Biden nominated longtime telecom attorney Anna Gomez to become the agency’s next commissioner this week. The news comes months after his first pick, Gigi Sohn, withdrew her name from consideration following a grueling 16-month political battle. And where Sohn became a lightning rod for controversy, Gomez’s nomination has so far seemed to defuse it. </p>
<p id="LI7emq">Gomez has a long history of working in both the public and private sectors.

  <p id="FjjnDU">Once upon a time, phones such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Droid">original Motorola Droid</a> had interchangeable batteries. You could keep an extra charged battery on hand and swap them out when needed. It was a lot more convenient and lightweight than dragging around a heavy battery pack, and it kept the phone going strong over the course of the busiest workday.</p>
<p id="8RwBdI">But as phone designs changed over the years, swappable batteries were abandoned by phone manufacturers to keep their phones sleeker and accommodate wraparound screens. Improved battery technology means that most phones will get you through at least a full day’s use — unless you are watching a lot of videos or your device is a year or two old. </p>

<p id="ErzPzE">Aria lives within Opera’s sidebar on the left side of the screen, and clicking its icon reveals a panel where you can interact with it. Unlike the standard version of the ChatGPT chatbot, Opera’s browser AI can surface up-to-date information from across the web.

  <p id="6oEqb5">AMD has unveiled the Radeon RX 7600, a $269 entry-level graphics card powered by the company’s RDNA 3 architecture. Announced on Wednesday, the RX 7600 is designed to hit 60fps while running games at 1080p, providing an affordable GPU option for gamers who aren’t chasing 4K performance.</p>
<p id="wkqDG4">This is the first desktop GPU in the Radeon RX 7000 lineup with a price below $300 — not only is it cheaper than the $329 RX 6600 at launch, but <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-rx-7600-to-launch-with-269-e299-msrp"><em>VideoCardz</em> reports</a>, and <em>The Verge’s</em> own Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23734022/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-amd-rx-7600-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">confirms</a>, that AMD cut the price at the last minute from a $299 figure originally shared with press and influencers. That updated pricing probably isn’t a coincidence considering AMD revealed the Radeon RX 7600 just days after Nvidia announced the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/18/23728149/nvidia-rtx-4060-4060-ti-release-date-price-specs">$299 RTX 4060</a>,...</p>

  <p id="zUMzhN">We still have a few weeks until Samsung officially reveals its upcoming Galaxy Watch 6 lineup, but leaked images suggest that it might have resurrected a fan-favorite feature per <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-6-pro-gets-a-physical-rotating-bezel/">previous rumors</a>. A familiar rotating bezel — which Samsung <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/22/23037285/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-rotating-bezel">tragically dropped</a> from the Galaxy Watch 5 series — can be seen on leaked renders of the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic shared by <a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-classic-with-rotating-bezel-coming-soon-5k-render-leak-exclusive/"><em>MySmartPrice</em></a> and reputable leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1661255713174462464">OnLeaks</a>.</p>
<p id="sKZlcS">If the renders are legit then the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is almost visually identical to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos">Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</a>. They depict the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic in an all-black design, featuring a brushed metal casing and a silicone wristband with a magnetic clasp.

  <p id="uhn3wR">At some point a few weeks ago, I decided I couldn’t deal with Fujifilm’s Camera Remote app anymore. So I threw in the towel and bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Lightning-Card-Camera-Reader/dp/B0198HIF7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">an SD-to-Lightning adapter</a>, which lets me reliably get photos from my Fujifilm cameras onto my iPhone without any fuss. But it also makes me feel like a damn caveman. It’s supposed to be better than this in 2023.</p>
<p id="TY1WaQ">I’ve been using Fujifilm’s mirrorless cameras since the days of the X-T1. But like many others, I’ve had mixed experiences with the company’s mobile app. Just look at those reviews on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fujifilm-camera-remote/id793063045">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fujifilm_dsc.app.remoteshooter&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Google Play</a>. </p>

## Fujifilm’s X-S20 camera has a new processor and a $300 higher asking price

  <p id="FodZ9I">Fujifilm has a new entry-level-ish camera for its X line of APS-C mirrorless cameras, hoping to find a sweet spot for hybrid photo and video creators. It’s introducing the new $1,299 X-S20 camera, $799 XF 8mm f/3.5R WR super-wide lens, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23498875">new X App</a> at its ongoing X Summit Bangkok. While the new app will try to pick up the pieces and outdo <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fujifilm-camera-remote/id793063045">its predecessor’s</a> abysmal App Store review score on May 25th, the camera and lens are both set to launch around June 29th.</p>
<p id="HHxhCP">That sweet spot, in Fujifilm’s eyes, for the X-S20 means the latest processor of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23344081/fujifilm-xh2-xh2s-mirrorless-camera-xf50mm-gf2035mm-lens-hands-on-impressions">X-H2</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/31/23143007/fujifilm-xh2s-xf150600-xf18120-xh2-price-specs-availability">duo</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23435734/fujifilm-xt5-mirrorless-camera-price-specs-features">X-T5</a> is combined with the same sensor as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21517015/fujifilm-x-s10-camera-vlogging-price-specs-features">last-gen X-S10</a>.

  <p id="6seMR2">Logitech is announcing a new G Pro X 2 Lightspeed gaming headset today that features graphene audio drivers. You’ve probably heard of graphene, the miracle form of carbon that has been promised by many over the past 20 years to change the world of technology. While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16927224/graphene-materials-les-johnson-joseph-meany-book">we haven’t seen graphene</a> used to create space elevators or make the internet run faster just yet, Logitech is using it to create headphone drivers that are lightweight.</p>
<p id="7DWhdq">“With our use of graphene, we can create a driver that is both incredibly rigid and, at the same time, almost impossibly lightweight,” says Chris Pate, principal product manager for the Logitech G Pro series of products. “This delivers high fidelity sound with extremely low distortion, giving pros the...</p>

  <p id="cGytEB">Logitech has announced the Logi Dock Flex, its latest all-in-one USB-C docking station designed to alleviate some of the frustrations of hot desking and hybrid working. The Logi Dock Flex kinda resembles an Amazon Echo Show smart display, featuring an 8-inch touchscreen that allows users to reserve rooms and monitor desk availability via Zoom Workspace, Microsoft Teams, or Logitech’s new desk booking software.</p>
<p id="1Ll2GK">A built-in display is a strange addition to a docking station, but Logitech has still managed to cram the Logi Dock Flex with plenty of ports to support a standard office setup. There are two USB-C ports and a single USB-A port located below the screen on the front of the Logi Dock Flex. On the rear, you’ll find two additional...</p>

  <p id="FNuUry">The Canon EOS M mirrorless system may be dead, but one of its cameras is being exhumed and reincarnated into a new model for the ongoing EOS R series. The EOS R100 is the latest of Canon’s APS-C mirrorless offerings. It features a 24.1-megapixel sensor, eye-tracking dual pixel autofocus, and a very compact size for $479.99 body-only, launching in July. It will also be sold for $599.99 in a kit with the RF-S 18–45mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STM lens or $829.99 in a two-zoom kit with that same slow lens plus an RF-S 55–210mm f/5-7.1 IS STM telephoto. Launching alongside the R100 is a Canon RF 28mm f/2.8 STM pancake lens for $299.99 that’s compatible with crop or full-frame cameras and only a bit larger than a body cap.</p>

But in just a few years, you might instead be playing a lot of new PlayStation franchises — and a lot of live service titles.</p>

In the 2025 fiscal year, for example, it estimates that 50 percent of its PlayStation Studios investments will be in new IP, which a major jump from years past: according to a slide, in its 2019 fiscal year, only 20 percent of its investments were in new franchises.
