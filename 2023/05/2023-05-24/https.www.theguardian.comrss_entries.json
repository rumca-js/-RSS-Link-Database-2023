And more recently his cinephile comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/24/mia-madre-review-nanni-moretti\">Mia Madre (2015)</a> was tremendous.<br /><br />But his new film in competition is bafflingly awful: muddled, mediocre and metatextual \u2013 a complete waste of time, at once strident and listless. Everything about it is heavy-handed and dull: the non-comedy, the ersatz-pathos, the anti-drama.<br /><br />It is effectively a film within a film, both as dull as each other. Moretti himself plays Giovanni, a high-minded film director with a failing marriage who is struggling to shoot his passion project about the Italian Communist party standing up to the Soviets over the Hungary invasion of 1956 \u2013 although a smirkingly ironic and evasive final title card indicates that A Brighter Tomorrow can\u2019t even commit to deciding if all that was worth celebrating or not.<br /><br />Giovanni\u2019s wife and longtime co-producer Paola (Margherita Buy) is paying the household bills with a side hustle producing a crass gangster flick for a crude up-and-coming film-maker, and this pains Giovanni so deeply that he actually trespasses on location when this film\u2019s grisly mob execution is about to be filmed and stops everything to lecture them on how crass it is and why what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t as good as the murder scene in Kieslowski\u2019s A Short Film About Killing. Is he supposed to be a shrill, self-important idiot who deserves to be booted off the set? Well no: this presumably is a comic hero whose unfashionably high standards and chaotic midlife angst are supposed to be adorable. Meanwhile, Paola is seeing a therapist and confesses she\u2019s thinking of leaving him.<br /><br />Mathieu Amalric phones in a grinning, sweaty performance as Giovanni\u2019s dodgy producer Pierre, who is wheeler-dealing behind the scenes to raise the cash. There is a lot of perfunctory sub-Fellini circus business and a lot more peevish and redundant grumbling from Giovanni about the state of the cinema business today, featuring an easy-target scene in which Giovanni is forced to take a meeting with blockheaded Netflix suits who complain that his movie doesn\u2019t have enough WTF moments. Actually this is one long WTF moment, for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />There is also the now traditional scene in which an ageing cinephile attempts to show a classic movie to his teen kid who isn\u2019t interested \u2013 although it\u2019s incidentally pretty baffling that Giovanni goes on about his other idea, to make a movie version of John Cheever\u2019s short story The Swimmer, without mentioning the classic Eleanor and Frank Perry version starring Burt Lancaster.<br /><br />Moretti tries for some unearned sentimental endorsement by featuring classic Italian songs, and on the same everything-including-the-kitchen-sink basis, gives us a wacky walk-on from architect Renzo Piano in the Woody Allen/Marshall McLuhan style, and a final parade of movie-legend cameos which only make the film look blandly self-congratulatory. I\u2019m sure the future will be brightened by another, better Moretti film \u2013 this one is best forgotten.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/a-brighter-tomorrow-nanni-morettis-review-cannes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/a-brighter-tomorrow-nanni-morettis-review-cannes", "date_published": "2023-05-24 21:36:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Harry Maguire\u2019s place in England squad under threat, admits Gareth Southgate", "description": "<ul><li>Defender\u2019s lack of game time at Manchester United \u2018concerning\u2019</li><li>Southgate unhappy over Ivan Toney\u2019s punishment</li></ul><p>Gareth Southgate has admitted his loyalty to Harry Maguire will be difficult to maintain if the England defender continues to remain on the sidelines at Manchester United.</p><p>England\u2019s manager, who has omitted Raheem Sterling for next month\u2019s Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia, described Maguire\u2019s situation as \u201cconcerning\u201d.

While this trend has been liberating for many workers, the Portuguese authorities found it could be exploited by bosses disregarding the idea that a remote worker ever clocked off.</p><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/24/britain-nation-slackers-right-to-disconnect-labour\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/24/britain-nation-slackers-right-to-disconnect-labour", "date_published": "2023-05-24 11:14:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "A walking minotaur and Cardiff crash tributes: Wednesday\u2019s best photos", "description": "<p>The Guardian\u2019s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2023/may/24/a-walking-minotaur-and-cardiff-crash-tributes-wednesdays-best-photos\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2023/may/24/a-walking-minotaur-and-cardiff-crash-tributes-wednesdays-best-photos", "date_published": "2023-05-24 11:13:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "NSW police officer charged over alleged Tasering of 95-year-old woman in aged care home", "description": "<p>Senior constable Kristian White faces three charges over alleged incident which left Clare Nowland fighting for her life</p><ul><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p>The New South Wales police officer who allegedly Tasered a 95-year-old woman at an aged care facility has been charged with three offences.</p><p>Senior constable Kristian White, 33, will appear in court for the offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault and recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, which can carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/24/nsw-police-officer-charged-over-alleged-tasering-of-95-year-old-woman-in-aged-care-home\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/24/nsw-police-officer-charged-over-alleged-tasering-of-95-year-old-woman-in-aged-care-home", "date_published": "2023-05-24 11:04:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Turkish peppers, tomatoes and eggs: how to cook the perfect menemen \u2013 recipe | Felicity Cloake's How to cook the perfect\u2026", "description": "<p>There are myriad ways to make Turkey\u2019s traditional tomatoey scrambled eggs \u2013 our in-house perfectionist distils them all into one perfect brunch recipe</p><p>Being good Guardian readers, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all familiar with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/16/yotam-ottolenghi-shakshuka-recipe\"> shakshuka</a> \u2013 the north African egg dish that first conquered Israel, and then brunch menus around the world (with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/16/yotam-ottolenghi-shakshuka-recipe\">a little help from one Yotam Ottolenghi</a>), but you may be less familiar with the (arguably superior) Turkish version, <em>menemen</em>, for which the eggs tend to be stirred into the sauce, rather than simply cooked on top.</p><p>\u201cQuick, simple and tasty,\u201d<a href=\"https://app.ckbk.com/recipe/clas40117c07s001r005/vegetable-ragout-with-eggs\"> Ghillie Basan writes</a> in her Classic Turkish Cooking, this chunky, tomato-rich stew is something you\u2019ll find in \u201cbus stations, train stations and ports anywhere there is passing trade\u201d.

Unfortunately, I sucked at all of them. Street Fighter was especially embarrassing for me, as an eager-to-prove-myself 16-year-old, because I could just never get my hands around the movesets and controls for all the different characters. I was a perennial button-masher, and I was humiliated so regularly that it put me off fighting games for life.</p><p>That said, I have always greatly admired<em> </em>Street Fighter, and its players. It is a stunningly energetic game full of stylish caricatures whose movement and swagger are fascinating to look at, especially in the hands of skilled competitors. I have watched fighting game tournaments in awe, and seen winners demolish opponents with deft combinations of reaction speed, on-the-fly strategising and seemingly unnatural powers of foresight. It is the perfect esport: matches are easy to follow, over in just a few minutes, and thrilling to behold.

It\u2019s a lofty charge, but a grave one nonetheless.</p><p>A career headmaster and stickler for detail who has published report cards on each prime minister back to Tony Blair, Seldon was never likely to warm to the overgrown schoolboy Johnson, and so it proves. The story really begins with Johnson\u2019s response to his side winning the Brexit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\">referendum</a>: far from celebrating, they write, he paced the house looking \u201cashen-faced and distraught\u201d, panicking aloud that: \u201cOh shit, we\u2019ve got no plan. We haven\u2019t thought about it. I didn\u2019t think it would happen.\u201d What weighed most heavily in his choosing leave over remain, they suggest, was his own personal ambition. From this unfolds a tale of power pursued without much purpose, or latterly dignity.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/24/johnson-at-10-by-anthony-seldon-and-raymond-newell-review-the-great-pretender\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/24/johnson-at-10-by-anthony-seldon-and-raymond-newell-review-the-great-pretender", "date_published": "2023-05-24 08:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018Worthless\u2019: Chevron\u2019s carbon offsets are mostly junk and some may harm, research says", "description": "<p>Exclusive: investigation finds energy giant\u2019s efforts to offset its huge emissions rely on schemes with little impact</p><p>A new investigation into Chevron\u2019s climate pledge has found the fossil fuel company relies on \u201cjunk\u201d carbon offsets and \u201cunviable\u201d technologies, which do little to offset its vast greenhouse gas emissions and in some cases may actually be causing communities harm.</p><p>Chevron, which reported $35.5bn in profits last year, is the US\u2019s second-largest fossil fuel company with operations stretching from Canada and Brazil to the UK, Nigeria and Australia.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/24/chevron-carbon-offset-climate-crisis\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/24/chevron-carbon-offset-climate-crisis", "date_published": "2023-05-24 08:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Man to appear in court over TikTok videos of people entering London homes", "description": "<p>Bacari-Bronze O\u2019Garro, 18, charged  with failing to comply with a community protection notice </p><p>An 18-year-old man is to appear in court after an investigation into TikTok \u201cprank\u201d videos showing people entering homes in London without permission.</p><p>Bacari-Bronze O\u2019Garro was charged on Tuesday evening with failing to comply with a community protection notice, the Metropolitan police said.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/24/man-court-tiktok-videos-people-entering-london-homes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/24/man-court-tiktok-videos-people-entering-london-homes", "date_published": "2023-05-24 07:23:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Bears, burlesque and Phil Collins: the Disney songs that ruled our youths", "description": "<p>As Disney celebrates its centenary \u2013 and a decade of Frozen shows no sign of dimming Let It Go\u2019s hold on tots \u2013 we remember the cursed cats, R&amp;B hounds and self-actualisation anthems that defined our childhoods</p><p>\u201cLook \u2013 for \u2013 the\u201d \u2013 and then the pub-piano <em>thump</em> of that first chord triggers a singalong reflex I\u2019ve been unable to suppress these 50 years \u2013 \u201cbare necessities, the simple bare necessities / Forget about your worries and your strife!\u201d The Dixieland parp of brass and jangle of banjo strings, with Phil Harris\u2019s easygoing delivery, lasered into my seven-year-old mind.
