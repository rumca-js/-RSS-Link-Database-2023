But Microsoft is testing another feature users want: The ability to ungroup and badge your apps and windows on the taskbar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;d like to say that Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows 11 Insider preview build 23466 for the Dev Channel includes some the nifty new <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1927896/microsoft-confirms-tweakable-widgets-will-arrive-in-windows.html\">Windows features that Microsoft announced this week</a>, including RGB lighting controls, improved Widgets, and so on. It doesn&rsquo;t. Instead, there&rsquo;s even <em>more</em> &mdash; but the Taskbar update is there, thankfully, as is the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1923887/microsoft-will-restore-your-pcs-layout-plus-your-data-on-a-new-pc.html\">new PC migration / restore feature</a>. (Sorry, the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html\">Windows Copilot AI-powered tool</a> will debut in June.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, Microsoft is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/541452/make-windows-11-look-like-windows-10.html\">making Windows 11 more like Windows 10</a> through the ungrouped badging option (called &ldquo;never combined mode&rdquo;) on the Taskbar. Let&rsquo;s face it: Windows 11 shows a tiny little progress bar-like icon on Windows 11 to indicate how many windows or instances of a given application are available, and it&rsquo;s impossible to parse. Badging and ungrouping the windows, like so, solves this problem. (So does<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1786965/bring-back-windows-11s-missing-features-for-free-with-explorer-patcher.html\"> Explorer Patcher</a>, a fantastic free program that restores many missing Windows 11 features.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Never combined&rdquo; mode was one of the most requested features, Microsoft said, probably for good reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"meet-windows-backup\">Meet Windows Backup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft is also launching a new Windows Backup app, taking the migration process that Microsoft detailed earlier and making it a formal application. Windows Backup is designed to not only store your apps and data in the cloud, but also preserve the layout for migrating all of your data to a new PC. Files, folders, apps, and credentials will all be stored in the cloud, tied to your Microsoft account. (If you want to test this out, Microsoft recommends that you either set up a new build on a second PC or use a virtual machine.) It is <em>not</em> a replacement for <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html\">traditional backup software</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Windows Backup app\" class=\"wp-image-1930146\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Windows-Backup.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=994\" width=\"994\" /></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/05/24/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23466/&amp;xcust=2-2-1930130-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft also detailed numerous tweaks and changes in its <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/05/24/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23466/&amp;xcust=2-2-1930130-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a>, some of which we&rsquo;ve included here:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Voice access text authoring:</strong> You can now say &ldquo;correct that&rdquo; or &ldquo;spell that&rdquo; or &ldquo;click that&rdquo; to guide your voice interactions with your PC.</li><li><strong>Turn off specific notifications:</strong> If you typically ignore notifications from an app, Windows will detect that and offer to turn them off entirely.</li><li><strong>Start menu reorganization: </strong>&ldquo;We are trying out a different model for ranking the most recently used files in the Start menu&rsquo;s Recommended section that considers when the file was last used, the file extension, and more,&rdquo; Microsoft said. &ldquo;This means you may not see files purely in reverse chronological order of when they were last used.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>View your Wi-Fi password:</strong> Forgotten your Wi-Fi password?

Or is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, our initial <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/539183/windows-11-review-an-unnecessary-replacement-for-windows-10.html\">review of Windows 11</a> called Microsoft&rsquo;s latest operating system &ldquo;unnecessary.&rdquo; Windows 10 was such a strong entrant within the Windows succession that we saw no need to move on to something new. It&rsquo;s time now, however, that we think you should start seriously considering it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because the landscape has changed. Microsoft now provides some very good reasons to move to Windows 11, some of which weren&rsquo;t available at launch. Some PCWorld staffers have switched full time to Windows 11, and the goal of this story originally set out to convince you that it was time to switch to Windows 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem. Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t seem as determined to convince you to upgrade to Windows 11 as it once did. Our arguments that you should switch had too many caveats attached. So we decided to contrast the two strategies: why you should switch to Windows 11, and why you should remain on Windows 10. After all, it&rsquo;s all about what&rsquo;s best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note: </strong>Now that Microsoft has said <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801718/windows-10-wont-receive-any-more-feature-updates.html\">Windows 10 will no longer receive any new features</a>, we wanted to resurface this piece breaking down whether you should upgrade to Windows 11.

All new PCs now ship with Windows 11, and any options to buy a Windows 10 PC instead have largely gone away. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upgrading your existing PC gives you flexibility a new PC doesn&rsquo;t offer. After upgrading from Windows 10 to 11, you have 10 days to revert. After that, if you&rsquo;ve upgraded from a Windows 10 device, you can reinstall Windows 10 via a clean installation.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Surface Laptop 5\" class=\"wp-image-1440830\" height=\"979\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/straight-on-unedited.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Buy a new laptop, and you&rsquo;re going to get Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you buy a Windows 11 laptop, you may have the option to downgrade to Windows 10, but not always. You&rsquo;ll likely need to contact that laptop manufacturer and inquire if those rights are available, which basically means that the laptop manufacturer has committed to supplying hardware drivers for Windows 10. Without them, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the clean installation will work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, you have an opportunity to try out Windows 11 now, rather than being forced into it. Why not try it out, then revert back to Windows 10 if it&rsquo;s still not for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"windows-10-is-dead\">Windows 10 is dead</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801718/windows-10-wont-receive-any-more-feature-updates.html\">Windows 10 will no longer receive any new features</a>, which for some may be a key reason to move to Windows 11.

But for those who <em>like</em> new features&hellip; well, don&rsquo;t expect many to arrive on Windows 10 anytime soon. The last two feature releases have basically passed over Windows 10, relegating the new features to Windows 11 only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, Microsoft isn&rsquo;t exactly issuing major revisions of Windows 11 with every new feature update, either. Windows 11&rsquo;s 2022 Update marked a return to the annual update cadence, with Microsoft seemingly spending more time updating its apps and services as opposed to the operating system itself.  But it&rsquo;s clear that Microsoft&rsquo;s time and attention is being spent on Windows 11, and not Windows 10.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 22H2 Snap Bar\" class=\"wp-image-830031\" height=\"587\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Snap-Bar-dark.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Windows Snap may be a new twist on an old feature, but it&rsquo;s still an excellent addition to Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/827065/windows-11-22h2-review-subtle-improvements-but-not-where-it-should.html\">review of Windows 11&rsquo;s 2022 Update</a> (aka Windows 11 22H2) indicated some key improvements: Snap Bar/Snap Groups, live captioning of recorded video, Voice Access, and more. Windows 11 itself initially shipped with significant upgrades to the Settings app. Say what you want about these features (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/830006/my-favorite-feature-in-windows-11-22h2-is.html\">the updated Snap is our favorite</a>) but none of these have arrived on Windows 10. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of those new features is Bing Chat, the AI chatbot link that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1522426/windows-11-february-update-adds-bing-ai-chat-tabbed-notepad-iphone.html\">Microsoft added via its Windows 11 Feb. 2023 Update</a>. Bing Chat appears in Windows 11&rsquo;s Search feature, but not in Windows 10. We can&rsquo;t make <em>too</em> much of this, as the &ldquo;feature&rdquo; is really just a shortcut to the Bing site, which opens within Edge. Still, it&rsquo;s a feature that&rsquo;s exclusive to Windows 11. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"windows-11-has-exclusive-new-apps\">Windows 11 has exclusive new apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s many development teams continue to work on parallel tracks: on the operating system itself, on Office, services, and more. While not all of Microsoft&rsquo;s new applications seem to be reserved for Windows 11 (like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477261/windows-11s-old-photos-app-is-still-better.html\">updated, <em>worse</em> Photos app</a>, for example) a couple are: the spiffy new Windows Media Player, for example. If you try downloading it on Windows 10, the OS will try to load the legacy Groove Music app instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A better example would be Windows&rsquo; new Android apps, once just a few hundred and now into the thousands, according to Microsoft and Amazon. Granted, the Amazon Android app store works best on tablets, and for those who like mobile games. But it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re not going to find on Windows 10. Android 13 should be arriving soon, as it&rsquo;s available as an upgrade for Windows Insiders.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows Media Player Windows 11\" class=\"wp-image-1475772\" height=\"876\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Windows-11-Windows-Media-Player.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Windows 11 doesn&rsquo;t ship with too many exclusives, but the new Media Player is one.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"you-can-solve-windows-11s-problems-through-utilities\">You can solve Windows 11&rsquo;s problems through utilities</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not going to sit here and defend <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/549576/the-windows-11-taskbar-is-an-annoying-step-backward.html\">Windows 11&rsquo;s flaws</a>. We continue to dislike Windows 11&rsquo;s implementation of the Start menu, for example; and while the centered taskbar allows plenty of space for icons on a 4K or widescreen display, not everyone has one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows 11 does allow for ways around these limitations, though. I personally launch apps by typing the Windows key, then the first letters of the app itself, or simply <strong>Alt-Tab</strong> through available windows. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394988/fix-windows-11s-start-menu-with-stardocks-simple-new-app.html\">Stardock&rsquo;s Start11</a>, however allows you to redo the Windows 11 Start menu to make it look like Windows 10 or earlier operating systems, and align the taskbar in various portions of the screen. It&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.stardock.com/products/start11/download?irgwc=1&amp;xcust=2-2-1471886-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">$5.99 utility</a> that makes Windows 11 feel familiar and more productive.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Start11 taskbar grouping\" class=\"wp-image-623994\" height=\"677\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Start11-taksbar-grouping.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Start11  allows you to solve some of Windows 11&rsquo;s greatest flaws.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Stardock</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-you-should-stay-on-windows-10\">Why you should stay on Windows 10</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we think that those are valid reasons to upgrade to Windows 11, we just can&rsquo;t help but think that Microsoft isn&rsquo;t entirely committed to pushing you towards Windows 11. Or if it is, its own business models contradict those efforts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these arguments, however, boil down to simple ease of use&mdash;such as the first.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"why-stay-on-windows-10-familiarity\">Why stay on Windows 10? Familiarity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s something to be said about stumbling into your office after a long night, booting your PC, and feeling your way through the beginning of the day. With those first few mornings on Windows 11, you may have to consciously think about what to do. An operating system that you&rsquo;re familiar with is one that you&rsquo;re more productive in. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows 10 desktop\" class=\"wp-image-1407331\" src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/features/3806955/comprar-windows-10.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /><figcaption>If you know Windows 10, why not stick with it?</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While we&rsquo;re not claiming that Windows 11 is radically different than Windows 10, upgrading comes with its own potential hassles, unexpected tweaks to Settings and other preferences, and so on. The new interface is very similar, but also very different. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just easier to stick with the tried and true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we noted above, too, Microsoft&rsquo;s declaration that it won&rsquo;t add any more new features to Windows 10 may be appealing to some. You&rsquo;re guaranteed a consistent experience until Windows 10 runs out of support in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"windows-10-will-get-new-apps-via-subscriptions-anyway\">Windows 10 will get new apps via subscriptions anyway</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Windows 11 does offer some exclusive new apps, but not <em>that</em> many. And there&rsquo;s another catch, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has referred to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/694088/nadella-windows-is-the-socket-for-subscriptions.html\">Windows as a &ldquo;socket&rdquo; for Windows services</a>, and while it&rsquo;s fair to say that the company is prioritizing Windows 11, Microsoft loves subscription revenue even more. Microsoft&rsquo;s More Personal Computing Business (Windows and Xbox) has steadily lost money over the past year, as sales of PCs and Xbox consoles have slowed. But sales of Microsoft&rsquo;s Productivity and Business business have increased, primarily because the business unit makes money on Office subscriptions for consumers and corporations. It makes sense, then, that Microsoft would continue doubling down on what makes it money, subscriptions, and make those subscriptions available to as many people as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these applications, like Clipchamp and Designer, are web &ldquo;apps&rdquo; specifically designed to run on both Windows 10 and Windows 11. Both, however, come with subscriptions: Clipchamp&rsquo;s &ldquo;professional&rdquo; offering, and Designer by being part of Microsoft 365. Add to that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Microsoft 365 itself&mdash;heck, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/422732/microsoft-wants-you-to-pay-for-solitaire-again-in-windows-10.html\">even Solitaire had a subscription to eliminate ads</a> before it was added to Game Pass. All of these subscriptions will work on both Windows 10 and Windows 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"will-your-pc-even-run-windows-11\">Will your PC even run Windows 11?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Quite frankly, the transition to Windows 11 has always been surrounded by a &ldquo;will they or won&rsquo;t they approach&rdquo; to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394763/windows-11-system-hardware-requirements.html\">Windows 11&rsquo;s hardware requirements</a>. For a while, the restrictions that Microsoft put on the available supported processors made Windows 11 desirable; no one likes being told that they <em>can&rsquo;t</em> upgrade, especially when they&rsquo;ve paid good money for an existing PC. Then there were the exceptions, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/542121/microsoft-reveals-how-to-bypass-windows-11s-strict-hardware-requirements.html\">the workarounds</a>. In the end, the hassle of upgrading an older PC to Windows 11 might make some people ride out Windows 10 until they get a new PC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one, least of all Microsoft, wants PC users to be hacked. But it&rsquo;s to Microsoft&rsquo;s credit that no major exploit really plagued Windows 10 <em>or</em> Windows 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"is-windows-11-faster-than-windows-10-no\">Is Windows 11 faster than Windows 10? No</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, there&rsquo;s another compelling reason to move to Windows 11: performance. If you&rsquo;re running a laptop with an Intel Core CPU inside of it (and more than 80 percent of laptops sold during 2022 included an Intel chip inside) Microsoft and Intel teamed up to offer Thread Director, a software API that controls how the various performance and efficiency cores of Intel&rsquo;s Core architecture interact with the operating system. Intel&rsquo;s Thread Director is supposed to work on both Windows 10 and Windows 11, but with improvements that would make Windows 11 faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, our recent tests don&rsquo;t bear that out. Simply put, there just <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448055/do-you-really-need-to-update-to-windows-11.html\">isn&rsquo;t any measurable performance difference between Windows 10 and Windows 11</a> right now. In fairness, Windows 11 is a little faster, but just not that much to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, you can&rsquo;t help but be a bit suspicious of DirectStorage, the next-generation storage accelerator that Microsoft is promising. In 2021, Microsoft promised that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394868/microsoft-directstorage-windows-10-after-all.html\">DirectStorage would be made available to both Windows 10 <em>and</em> Windows 11 users</a>, good news for those who don&rsquo;t want to upgrade. In 2022, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/623036/microsoft-releases-directstorage-the-future-of-fast-loading-pc-games.html\">Microsoft began shipping DirectStorage</a>, a technology that promises to speed up games by improving how the SSD interacts with the GPU to improve data transfers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/626171/626171.html\">watch DirectStorage slash game loading times down to a second</a> on the first game to support it, <em>Forspoken</em>, which releases on January 24.  But the demo video showed how DirectStorage compared to an existing hard drive and M.2 / SATA SSD&hellip;not Windows 10. Our guess is that if you own the right hardware, which operating system you run won&rsquo;t make that much of a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"you-can-procrastinate-on-switching-to-windows-11\">You can procrastinate on switching to Windows 11</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All that, though, is pretty in the weeds for most people. For many, the question will simply boil down to: Do I really <em>need</em> to upgrade? The answer, simply put, is no&mdash;not yet. Windows 10 ends support on October 14, 2025, meaning that if you really can&rsquo;t deal with the added pressure of upgrading&mdash;as relatively simple as it is&mdash;then don&rsquo;t! Windows 11 will still be there in a year or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1471886/why-switch-to-windows-11.html", "date_published": "2023-05-24 16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Intel slashes Arc A750\u2019s already-great price to just $199", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel&rsquo;s Arc discrete graphics cards aren&rsquo;t unseating Nvidia or AMD for pure performance any time soon, but they are some of the best GPUs on the market in terms of value. In fact, the Arc A750 is our pick for the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html\">best 1080p graphics card for ray tracing</a>. And that was before a recent price drop: Initially $289, the A750 was permanently dropped to $250 <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499123/intel-slashes-arc-a750-price-to-249-touts-substantial-gaming-improvements.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a few months ago</a>. Today it looks like the card has another big price drop, all the way down to $199.99. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-a750-8gb-limited-edition-is-now-available-for-just-199&amp;xcust=2-1-1929783-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">VideoCardz.com reports</a>, that new price comes from the official <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/intel-arc-a750-21p02j00ba/p/N82E16814883002?Item=N82E16814883002&amp;xcust=2-1-1929783-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Intel store on Newegg</a>, and it&rsquo;s now been mirrored <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fintel-arc-a750-limited-edition-8gb-gddr6-pci-express-4-0-graphics-card%2F6543537.p%3FskuId%3D6543537&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">on the Best Buy online listing</a> as well. We&rsquo;re talking about the &ldquo;official&rdquo; Intel reference card here, cards from third-party manufacturers haven&rsquo;t seen the price drop yet (though they&rsquo;ll probably follow along soon enough). It isn&rsquo;t clear if this is another permanent price drop or a limited-time promotion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, it&rsquo;s the first time we&rsquo;ve seen an Arc A7xx-series card drop below the $200 price threshold. And if you&rsquo;re in the market for a budget GPU, it&rsquo;s worth serious consideration. Intel&rsquo;s cards frequently outperform their rivals at the same price point. In terms of pure performance, the A750 is around the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525621/intel-arc-a750-vs-amd-radeon-rx-6600-which-250-gpu-should-you-buy.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">same level as the AMD Radeon RX 6600,</a> which is around the same street price, but the Intel card smashes it in ray tracking performance. Initially Intel&rsquo;s drivers might have been a deal-breaker, but they&rsquo;ve been <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1799919/intel-arc-gpus-how-much-improvement-has-intel-made-in-6-months.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">steadily and consistently improving</a> ever since release. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928214/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">brand-new Radeon RX 7600</a> is probably a better bet for those with a bit more budget flexibility at a retail price of $269 (which might be why the A750 is discounted right now). But the Arc A750 is still a ridiculous deal if you&rsquo;re short on cash and overdue for a desktop GPU upgrade. We don&rsquo;t know how long the discount will last, so get on it if you&rsquo;re in the market. </p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1929783/intels-arc-a750-gpu-is-now-down-to-just-200.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Buy Intel Arc A750 at Best Buy</a></p>\nGraphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1929783/intels-arc-a750-gpu-is-now-down-to-just-200.html", "date_published": "2023-05-24 15:17:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "AirJet\u2019s radical solid-state cooling supercharges Zotac\u2019s new mini-PC", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Computex is just around the corner, and when it arrives, we can expect to see scads of wonderful PC hardware. But you don&rsquo;t have to wait until the start of the show next week. Zotac&rsquo;s already kicking off the party with the reveal of its latest mini-PC, which is cooled by <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1476932/is-airjets-solid-state-cooling-the-future-of-pc-thermals.html\">Frore Systems&rsquo; revolutionary AirJet technology</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We first saw this radical solid-state cooling back at CES, which uses vibrating membranes to spread air over a heat spreader. This method cools components without the noise or bulk of a traditional fan. Our second look at AirJet dove more into its possible application in devices like laptops, and Zotac&rsquo;s mini-PC is a similar idea. Small space, lower wattage CPU&mdash;you just don&rsquo;t get a monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Zotac was so kind to show us, its PI430AJ mini-PC gets a big lift in performance thanks to AirJet. The previous model was passively cooled, with its thick, finned aluminum chassis only capable of dissipating heat for a two-core Atom processor. But with two mini AirJet modules added to the mix, the PI430AJ takes a leap up to an Alder Lake processor with eight efficiency cores while also shedding weight&mdash;and staying very quiet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirJet modules pull in air through side vents and push it across the heat spreader, which is mounted directly to the CPU. The hot air then exhausts out the back. In the video above, we point a thermal imager at the system to see the flow. Without a fan, the only sound you hear is the movement of air if you&rsquo;re within a few inches of the machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This design allows the processor inside the mini-PC to pull more energy&mdash;that is, stretch its legs further. Frore Systems demonstrated this in a faceoff between an PI430AJ with its AirJet cooling on and another PI430AJ with its AirJet cooling turned off (i.e., left passively cooled). During a Furmark torture test, the actively cooled unit pulled down 6.9W versus the passively cooled (and thermally throttling) unit&rsquo;s 2.2W. And the whole time, the actively cooled system stayed at chill 58.6 Celsius. The passively cooled system hit 67.3 Celsius, with its exterior significantly hotter when touched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zotac says the PI430AJ will start at a price of $500, with availability in Q4 of 2023. (In the meanwhile, check out <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1523642/tour-the-labs-making-airjet-solid-state-coolers-that-will-replace-your-pc-fans.html\">our Frore Systems lab tour to see how AirJet is made</a>.) This mini-PC won&rsquo;t be the only fun thing we&rsquo;ll see this month, though. Expect to see more incredible hardware when Computex opens next week, including more items incorporating Frore Systems&rsquo;s impressive new tech.

PowerToys also added Peek, which allows you to preview a number of different files that Windows&rsquo; own File Explorer doesn&rsquo;t support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both utilities are packaged within PowerToys 0.70.0. (At press time, Microsoft had published the release notes for version 0.70, though the utility itself balked at upgrading to that version.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mouse Without Borders has been around for a long time &mdash; since 2018, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407999/hands-on-how-one-mouse-can-control-multiple-pcs-with-microsofts-mouse-without-borders-app.html\">when it was originally released</a> as a Microsoft Garage incubator project. Five years later, Microsoft has polished the app up to .NET 7 standards and brought it into PowerToys, which <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/563788/seven-ways-in-which-microsofts-powertoys-improves-my-life.html\">includes over a dozen utilities</a> that Windows itself doesn&rsquo;t. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mouse Without Borders may have some real benefits in a world where workers work from home on both a work and personal PC. The concept is simple enough. Provided that both PCs allow you to load the Mouse Without Borders app, you can simply mouse from one PC to the other. When you drag the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen, a PC with multiple monitors simply moves the cursor from one display to the next. With Mouse Without Borders, the cursor moves from one <em>computer</em> to the next. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Furthermore, you can also share the Windows clipboard between PCs, even transferring small files (under 100MB) between them!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Microsoft PowerToys Mouse without Borders\" class=\"wp-image-1928484\" height=\"850\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Mouse-without-Borders-PowerToys.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>Mouse  Without Borders may look a little geeky to use, but it&rsquo;s effective when set up.</figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/mouse-without-borders&amp;xcust=2-1-1928482-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mouse Without Borders requires you to set a security key, enter it on the other PCs, then &ldquo;arrange&rdquo; them like you would multiple monitors. You may need to adjust any firewall settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, we&rsquo;ve seen this before. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1488129/samsung-flow-is-a-killer-app-youll-only-get-with-samsung-devices.html\">Samsung Flow is a nifty twist</a> on Mouse Without Borders, with not just multiple PCs but phones and tablets brought into the mix. Logitech also has its own proprietary version, too, also called <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407999/hands-on-how-one-mouse-can-control-multiple-pcs-with-microsofts-mouse-without-borders-app.html\">Logitech Flow</a>. Still, Mouse Without Borders is a tool that&rsquo;s worth installing, just for when you&rsquo;re feeling lazy. All you&rsquo;ll need is for both PCs to powered on and connected to the same wireless network. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peek is just as simple. You&rsquo;re probably familiar with the File Explorer preview pane; Peek is simply a preview window. By tapping the activation shortcut (<strong>Ctrl + Space)</strong> you&rsquo;ll get a sneak peek of the image or file in then Peek pane. Unfortunately, Microsoft&rsquo;s documentation doesn&rsquo;t list which file types are currently supported, but that should come soon.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"PowerToys Peek\" class=\"wp-image-1928483\" height=\"619\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PowerToys-Peek.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Peek can preview images without the need to open an application.</figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/peek&amp;xcust=2-1-1928482-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, make sure you download PowerToys regardless.

Better yet, while Nvidia continues to push either <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html\">stagnant generational performance upgrades</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">exorbitant prices</a> for its rival GeForce RTX 40-series graphics cards, AMD&rsquo;s budget champion delivers a massive step-up in frame rates for $60 less than its predecessor&rsquo;s launch price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Budget gaming requires compromise, and the Radeon RX 7600 isn&rsquo;t good at ray tracing, especially since image upsampling technologies like FSR 2.0 and Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS don&rsquo;t look great at 1080p resolution. Don&rsquo;t get it twisted though; other than the ferociously powerful (and pricey) <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\">RTX 4090</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html\">Radeon RX 7900 XTX</a> flagships, this modest GPU is the first of this generation worth paying attention to&mdash;and the first new sub-$300 graphics card to get excited about since the pandemic threw the world into chaos. Seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Radeon RX 7600 is the graphics card that gamers on a budget have been begging for forever. Go buy it&hellip;unless you want ray tracing.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"what-are-the-amd-radeon-rx-7600s-specs-and-features\">What are the AMD Radeon RX 7600&rsquo;s specs and features?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD built the Radeon RX 7600 using the same RDNA 3 graphics cores that debuted in the flagship <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431755/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-radeon-rx-7900-xt-review-rdna-3.html\">7900-series GPUs</a>. This new architecture offers dedicated AI accelerators, AV1 encoding, DisplayPort 2.1 (RTX 40-series has 1.4a), second-generation ray tracing and Infinity Cache hardware, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One difference between this and the RX 7900-series? While the more advanced GPUs use a cutting-edge chiplet design that flanks the main die with memory controllers, this budget chip sticks to a traditional single 6-nanometer die (204mm2) that packs everything in.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Radeon RX 7600 specs\" class=\"wp-image-1928231\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/specs-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=993\" width=\"993\" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the Radeon RX 7600 packs in more hardware for a lower price than the older (still-good) <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/543823/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-finally-a-true-1080p-graphics-card.html\">Radeon RX 6600</a>. Memory and GPU clock speeds are up, stream processor and RT accelerator counts are up, and AI accelerators make their debut as part of AMD&rsquo;s AI push. Spoiler alert: The Radeon RX 7600 delivers a proper generational performance upgrade, unlike <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html\">Nvidia&rsquo;s $400 GeForce RTX 4060 Ti</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the 4060 Ti (and the Radeon RX 6600 before it), the Radeon RX 7600 is outfitted with 8GB of GDDR6 memory and a narrow 128-bit bus. That means this graphics card really is built for 1080p gaming&mdash;a reasonable expectation for an affordable graphics card like this. You can certainly play at 1440p resolution if you dial back some settings, but it may hit its limits quickly with the way modern games have been <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh7kFgHe21k&amp;xcust=2-1-1925928-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html\">gobbling up VRAM</a>. AMD&rsquo;s on-die Infinity Cache helps keep things humming at 1080p as well. Bumping up to 1440p will result in more data being sent over that pokey 128-bit bus. You won&rsquo;t want that. (We delve into a wonky discussion about memory capacity, bus widths, and on-die cache configurations in the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html#toc-1\">specifications section of our RTX 4060 Ti review</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Radeon RX 7600 should play the vast majority of games at Ultra settings and high frame rates just fine at 1080p resolution, but some especially memory-hungry games may require minor graphics tuning to fit inside the 8GB memory buffer. PCWorld contributor <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/KeithPlaysPC&amp;xcust=2-3-1928214-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Keith May</a> has been testing the custom Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7600 and reports that <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and <em>The Last of Us&mdash;</em>two of the worst VRAM offenders&mdash;soar at High settings while still looking spectacular.

(RTX 4060 Ti and obligatory banana for scale.)</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about the 8GB capacity, AMD&rsquo;s Aaron Steinman said, &ldquo;We still believe (and testing supports) that even the most demanding modern games deliver a very good experience for 1080p gaming. And memory is expensive.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This GPU draws down slightly more juice than its predecessor but delivers much higher performance and the best idle power use we&rsquo;ve ever seen&mdash;it&rsquo;s wonderfully efficient. Power is supplied via a single 8-pin connector, without needing to use an ugly 12VHPWR adapter like you do on the 4060 Ti. The reference card AMD sent over isn&rsquo;t only a reasonable two-slots thick, it&rsquo;s also adorably tiny at just 8 inches long.

We test with PCIe Resizable BAR (also known as Smart Access Memory on Ryzen systems) active, as most modern gaming PCs released in the last four years support the performance-boosting feature, either natively or via a motherboard firmware update. Nvidia also recommends turning on the optional &ldquo;Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling&rdquo; option in Windows to let the RTX 40-series stretch its legs to the fullest, so we&rsquo;ve made that tweak as well. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the storage ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AMD Ryzen 5900X, stock settings</li><li>AMD Wraith Max cooler</li><li>MSI Godlike X570 motherboard</li><li>32GB G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4 3800 memory, XMP active</li><li>Corsair <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-HX1500i-Platinum-Ultra-Low-Connectors/dp/B0B3S8GMCK&amp;xcust=2-3-1928214-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HX1500i power supply</a> (and optional <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Accessories-%7C-Parts/PC-Components/Power-Supplies/600W-PCIe-5-0-12VHPWR-Type-4-PSU-Power-Cable/p/CP-8920284&amp;xcust=2-3-1928214-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">$20 12VHPWR 600 cable</a> for Nvidia GPUs)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3440740/sk-hynix-gold-s31-review-a-great-sata-ssd-from-the-largest-vendor-youve-likely-never-heard-of.html\">1TB SK Hynix Gold S31 SSD</a> x2</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 9, 11, DX12, and Vulkan), to try to represent a full range of performance potential. Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark, sanity checked by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/frameview/&amp;xcust=2-3-1928214-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nvidia&rsquo;s FrameView tool</a>, at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex. We&rsquo;ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test. Outside of esports, we&rsquo;ve limited our benchmarks to 1440p and 1080p resolutions. With this memory configuration, the Radeon RX 7600 is a 1080p graphics card, but it&rsquo;s worth showing what you get at 1440p as well, both for practical reasons and to see how the GPU&rsquo;s performance scales as you ramp up resolution. We test features like ray tracing and DLSS in a separate section, as upscaling features like DLSS and AMD&rsquo;s rival FSR tweak the look of games to help them run faster.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually we present our data in a series of per-game bar charts, but given some severe time restraints, we&rsquo;re running our data in raw charts today and supplementing it with additional performance commentary instead.

If you exclude <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>&rsquo;s ludicrously high frame rates, the Radeon RX 7600 averages 107fps across our suite, a properly generational 35 percent increase over its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s new $400 RTX 4060 Ti is faster than the RX 7600 by another 20 percent on average if you&rsquo;re looking to push a high-refresh rate 1080p monitor even further, but costs $130 more than AMD&rsquo;s offering. The Radeon RX 7600 offers plenty of performance for a whole lot less money&mdash;and it holds the lead in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>performance here!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note, however, that thanks to its 8GB memory capacity, you may need to reduce graphics from Ultra to High in particularly VRAM-intensive modern games, such as <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and <em>The Last of Us</em>. Games still look great on High and that compromise is much more welcome in a $269 graphics card than a $400 one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"amd-radeon-rx-7600-1440p-gaming-performance\">AMD Radeon RX 7600 1440p gaming performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up: Higher resolution.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Radeon RX 7600\" class=\"wp-image-1928228\" height=\"246\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1440p-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Radeon RX 7600 can definitely be used to play games at 1440p, as our testing shows&mdash;it averages 75fps+ across our suite, only dipping below 60fps in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>and <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em>. But the 8GB of VRAM and tiny 128-bit bus means you&rsquo;ll already need to drop graphics settings in a lot of modern games (including <em>Watch Dogs</em>), and memory demands are only getting higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note how the Radeon RX 6700 XT (which has 12GB and a 256-bit bus for $350 on the street) overtakes the new 7600 in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> by about 10 percent after falling behind it at 1080p. Averaged overall, the 6700 XT was 12 percent faster than the 7600 at 1080p but leaps up to a 20 percent lead at 1440p.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RTX 4060 Ti, the only other modern sub-$500 GPU available thus far, is once again much faster than the 7600 for much more money, but since it has a similarly skimpy memory configuration, it shouldn&rsquo;t be considered for 1440p gaming either.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"amd-radeon-rx-7600-ray-tracing-and-fsr-performance\">AMD Radeon RX 7600 ray tracing and FSR performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&rsquo;t want to use the Radeon RX 7600 for ray tracing, or activate FSR to increase performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, this GPU packs in AMD&rsquo;s second-gen RT accelerator hardware, which shined in the monstrous Radeon RX 7900 XTX, but as you can see in the benchmarks below, it pretty much sucks down here on more affordable hardware, especially without an assist from FSR image upscaling. That said, ray tracing is more of a &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; than a &ldquo;must have&rdquo; in budget GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you shouldn&rsquo;t use FSR (or DLSS) on a 1080p graphics card, in my opinion. As I <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html#toc-5\">detailed in-depth in my RTX 4060 Ti review</a>, image upscaling works wonders at higher 1440p and 4K resolutions, but upscaling games to 1080p from an internal 720p (or worse, in the case of the Balanced preset tested below) resolution results in jagged, blurry visuals. It&rsquo;s ugly and not worth the extra frames.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Radeon RX 7600 RT and FSR\" class=\"wp-image-1928230\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/rt-and-dlss.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p><br /></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We included FSR/DLSS data above for you to reference, but recommend leaving both ray tracing and upscaling off on this card. You can enable it at lower settings in more lightly ray traced games like <em>F1 22</em> and <em>Hitman</em> if you&rsquo;d like, but we don&rsquo;t think the hit to performance is worth the visuals ray tracing provides at Medium settings. Also note that only RTX 40-series cards support DLSS 3, and <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> lacks FSR support, hence the various &ldquo;Not applicable&rdquo; fields above.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given AMD&rsquo;s poor ray tracing showing and our advice to skip upscaling at this resolution, the $400 GeForce RTX 4060 Ti might actually be worth considering if you <em>need</em> those cutting-edge lighting effects&mdash;though we&rsquo;d recommend waiting to see how the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1921195/nvidia-unveils-3-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-gpus-dlss-3-goes-mainstream.html\">$300 RTX 4060 handles when it launches in July</a> instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"how-are-the-radeon-rx-7600s-power-and-thermals\">How are the Radeon RX 7600&rsquo;s power and thermals?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the RTX 4060 Ti, they&rsquo;re excellent, though not as excellent as Nvidia&rsquo;s efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We test power draw by looping the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we&rsquo;ve benchmarked everything else (to warm up the GPU) and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you&rsquo;re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Radeon RX 7600 power temps\" class=\"wp-image-1928227\" height=\"581\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/power-temps.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the Radeon RX 7600 consumes about 15 percent more power than its predecessor at peak under load, but it delivers a whopping 35 percent average performance increase in return&mdash;a superb result. By contrast, the RTX 4060 Ti is only faster than the RTX 3060 Ti by single digit percentage points. And while we thought the ultra-low idle power measurements of the RTX 4060 Ti were bonkers, AMD does slightly better here. You love to see it from both camps!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We test thermals by leaving GPU-Z open during the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;power draw test, noting the highest maximum temperature at the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tiny AMD reference RX 7600 hits much higher temperatures than the other GPUs we tested, but don&rsquo;t be fooled: 75 degrees Celsius is still plenty cool for a graphics card, and in exchange for the higher temps, AMD gives you damned near utterly silent noise levels. The reference Radeon RX 7600 ran quieter than any other GPU we tested here and was virtually inaudible over the rest of our system fans. Quiet fans offer a much better day-to-day experience than unnecessarily low heat levels, and the reference card&rsquo;s diminutive design can fit into a lot more PCs than the other, longer cards. I&rsquo;ll take it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"should-you-buy-the-radeon-rx-7600\">Should you buy the Radeon RX 7600?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a graphics card with low power and enough <em>oomph</em> to power a high refresh rate 1080p monitor, the $269 Radeon RX 7600 is a spectacular option. It&rsquo;s an excellent affordable graphics card. It can handle 1440p gaming as well, but the 8GB VRAM capacity and tiny memory bus width means it will struggle more at that resolution as games become more demanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some games are <em>already </em>too demanding, with titles like <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em> already blowing past the 8GB memory capacity even at 1080p. In our experiential testing, dropping settings to High results in a highly playable experience that looks and runs great. That&rsquo;s acceptable on an affordable GPU like the RX 7600, but <em>unacceptable</em> on a $400 graphics card like Nvidia&rsquo;s new RTX 4060 Ti, which offers a similar memory configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 1080p resolution, the RTX 4060 Ti runs about 20 percent faster than the Radeon RX 7600 on average, but for 48 percent more money. Considering that the Radeon RX 7600 delivers already-exceptional 1080p gaming performance, it&rsquo;s a no-brainer.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Radeon RX 7600\" class=\"wp-image-1928233\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AMD-radeon-rx-7600-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you want to play ray traced games. The Radeon RX 7600&rsquo;s second-gen RT accelerators offer mostly unplayable performance on this budget card. Considering that image upsampling technologies like FSR and DLSS look terrible at 1080p resolution, you can&rsquo;t use those to claw back performance after flipping on ray tracing&mdash;your game will look worse even with those fancy rays flying around, though ray tracing is more of a &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; than &ldquo;must have&rdquo; at this price. If you want ray tracing and DLSS 3&rsquo;s Frame Generation capabilities, you might consider the 4060 Ti, but I&rsquo;d counsel waiting to see how the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1921195/nvidia-unveils-3-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-gpus-dlss-3-goes-mainstream.html\">$299 RTX 4060 performs when it launches in July</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, if you don&rsquo;t care about DLSS 3 and ray tracing, but want a beefier memory setup for better future-proofing and the ability to dabble in more 1440p games, the last-gen <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394249/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review.html\">Radeon RX 6700 XT</a> offers 12GB and a big 256-bit for just $350 on the street these days. That&rsquo;s $80 more than the budget-friendly Radeon RX 7600, however (though it&rsquo;s faster as well). If you need to save even more money, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/543823/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-finally-a-true-1080p-graphics-card.html\">Radeon RX 6600</a> remains a fine option for 1080p/60Hz gaming at around $200. Both last-gen cards lack the newer GPU&rsquo;s AV1 encoding, AI accelerators, and DisplayPort 2.1 capabilities, if that matters to you, but otherwise offer feature parity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after years of wandering in a GPU wasteland, and months of tolerating Nvidia&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html\">stagnant</a>-to-<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html\">downright</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">exorbitant</a> RTX 40-series releases, the Radeon RX 7600 is a breath of fresh air. It offers a truly generational performance uplift (35 percent) for less money than its predecessor (18 percent), along with modern features like AV1 encoding and DisplayPort 2.1, all wrapped in a tiny, silent, affordable package. It&rsquo;s the only GPU we&rsquo;ve been excited about this generation aside from flagships selling for quadruple digits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Radeon RX 7600 is the graphics card that gamers on a budget have been begging for forever.

These likely come from unscrupulous sellers distributing shared or stolen accounts, and and even if they work, you won&rsquo;t be able to use them with your existing Microsoft account.</li><li>Avoid buying from international sellers, and watch out for the shipping price.

Sign into your Microsoft account on that site and apply the code. If you already have an active subscription, Microsoft will simply push back your renewal date by 12 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this process, Microsoft might also offer you a bonus month if you turn on auto-renew; you can turn it back off right after signing up and still get the extra month tacked on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember to repeat this process once per year and you should be able to enjoy Microsoft 365 at a deep discount for years to come.
