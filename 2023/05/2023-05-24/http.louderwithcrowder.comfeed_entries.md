	I'm sure you have seen some version of this meme shared by your leftist friends on Facebook. Take a moment to study each photo.

	The theory is that if you at any point in the past fifty years were entertained by men dressing as women, you have no right to get upset that children are being taken to drag shows -- or forced to be exposed to them in school - now. And you sure as hell aren't allowed to support legislation banning children from these adult performances the same way they aren't allowed to go to strip clubs.
</p><p>
	Now watch this latest example of family-friendly entertainment that dropped today.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

	This isn't Klinger trying to get out of the Army. It's not Robin Williams trying to see his kids, or Dustin Hoffman trying to land a soap opera role, or a homeless Tom Hanks needing a place to stay in a women-only apartment building. It's also not Bugs Bunny being attractive by putting on a dress and pretending to be a girl bunny (party on, Garth).
</p><p>
	People don't have a problem with guys dressing as girls IN A NON-SEXUAL WAY - for comedic purposes. They have a problem with kids being exposed to guys dressing like slutty women and shaking their asses around five-year-olds. Americans have specific examples in mind of what they oppose.
</p><p>


</p><p>
	Very specific examples.
</p><p>


</p><p>
	"Mommy Mommy, why does that man want me to lick him where he pees?"
</p><p>


</p><p>
	This one is so sick, Twitter slapped a warning on it.
</p><p>


</p><p>
	The Left is willfully lying about the issue because a) that's what they do (see <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/larry-hogan-ron-desantis" target="_blank">Don't Say Gay</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-apologizes-team-desantis" target="_blank">AP History</a>, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-book-banning" target="_blank">Book Banning</a>), and b) they know that the more people who learn what conservatives are fighting, the more people who would join us and OPPOSE the Democrat Party's agenda to sexualize children.</p><p>If Mrs. Doubtfire made money on the side gyrating in front of children, it would rated R. It also wouldn't be funny. It would be sick and gross. Just like anyone who finds this stuff suitable for kids.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Landlord burns apartment down while blasting Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire," sets irony ablaze

Why? I'm guessing BUD LIGHT DRAMA, UKRAINE WAR, HE CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE!</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p><a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/local-news/complaint-duluth-landlord-played-we-didnt-start-the-fire-at-scene-of-arson/?utm_campaign=snd-autopilot&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter_KSTP" target="_blank">KSTP-TV has the report</a>. A tenant was woken at 3:00 in the morning to the sounds of landlord Scott Travis Carlson breaking things and smashing glass. This went on for twenty minutes before Carlson knocked on the tenant's door to say "The house, the house, the house is on fire."</p><p>Witnesses saw Carlson wearing a helmet and smashing his own windows. He also came from under his truck with gas cans. Suddenly, a fireball flashed in his apartment.</p><p>First responders arrived around 4:00 am, and one of them started humming "doo, doo doo doo, doo, doo doo" without noticing why. Another told that guy to knock it off, and that Billy Joel sold out after "An Innocent Man." The first first responder wasn't having it, arguing that "Donwneaster Alexa" and "And So It Goes" are both solid songs. That's when they noticed Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire" blaring while staring a fire someone ackshually started. </p><p>This is according to court documents, local news, and some details I made up.</p><p>Bail has been set at $75000. Carlson faces charges of first-degree arson and could see between four and twenty years in prison. Though prosecutors argue, and I know this will shock you, there may be some mental health and/or drug-related concerns.</p><p>Unclear is what led to the flaming incident. It could have been drug or mental health related. Could be for the insurance money. Maybe Carlson's girlfriend left him for the drummer in a Billy Joel cover band. Or maybe he heard "Piano Man" one too many times at karaoke and blacked out. All are viable motives.<br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

She should have been fired, but instead, she was defended by university groups. When a New York Post reporter visited her home to ask her about the incident, she threatened him with a machete. </p><p>Like, an actual machete.

She was fired for that. Indoctrinating and bullying college students is fine in the CUNY school system. You just can't threaten reporters.</p><blockquote>“Hunter College strongly condemns the unacceptable actions of Shellyne Rodriguez and has taken immediate action,” school spokesman Vince Dimiceli told The New York Post.</blockquote><p>But the machete was just the latest in a long line of the professor's radical extremism. Crowder and the gang did a DEEP dive on today's show.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

Conservatives have been signaling out <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-target-lockdown-merch" target="_blank">the retail chain's</a> "pride" collecting targeting children. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12116323/Target-CEO-DEFENDS-marketing-tuck-friendly-womens-swimwear.html" target="_blank">Depending on the region, the company is in a panic</a>. Most attention has been focused on their "tuck-friendly" bathing suits. "Tucking" is something you do if you have a weiner you don't want to have but aren't committed to the gimmick enough to chop it off. But the collection doesn't stop there!</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@becky_weiss_" target="_blank">Fitness YouTuber Becky Weiss</a> shared a video on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CsJeCTUrFl2/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> to highlight some of the other items available for you (and your kids) to signal your virtue over.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">And you wonder why Target is in a state of emergency... <a href="https://t.co/XLCLyAWw5y">pic.twitter.com/XLCLyAWw5y</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1661345364882890752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>If I were to do POWER RANKINGS?</p><p>3. <strong>The Queer x 4 shirt.</strong> The shirt that says "Say Gay" is lazy <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-dave-rubin" target="_blank">and sooooo 2022 Pride</a>. Not that Quad Queer shows that much more originality. But I'm fascinated that it's a good word now. For the longest time, it was a bad word. Like, and Homer Simpson "that's our word for making fun of you, we need it" bad word. I'm unclear how or when that changed. Or maybe it's only a good word depending on context. The rules are confusing.</p><p>2. <strong>"I'm Proud of You Always" bib</strong>. Unintentionally hilarious, because anyone who buys that isn't buying it for their baby. They are buying it to impress all the other woke liberal women who come to the monthly book club. This month they are reading "Rogue Justice" by Former Governor Stacey Abrams.</p><p>1. <strong>No Validation Needed</strong>. I have to agree with Becky, this shirt is the best. You are wearing a shirt that says "no validation needed." By wearing the shirt, you are by definition needing validation.</p><p>I should point out it's not the entire company that is in a panic. I'm sure these are selling like hotcakes in New York City and Los Angeles. And as Target CEO Brian Cornell says, these items "are just good business decisions, and it’s the right thing for society, and it’s the great thing for our brand."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">You’re making a big difference.

At least for the month of June. I find it hilarious that corporations are desperate to proclaim how much they love Ls, Gs, Bs, especially the Ts, Qs, As, Is, other Is, Ps, and whatever the hell the +s are for one only and only one month out of the year. July through May? Meh.<br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: John Fetterman's "special assistant" caught exposing how Democrats treat reporters as cheap prostitutes

One is the Associated Press way, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/john-fetterman-hoodie-shorts" target="_blank">where you claim the senator dressing like a homeless man is a good thing</a>. The other is the O'Keefe Media Group way, where you go on dates with his special assistant and expose what Fetterman and his staff really think. Luke Borwegan, you might want to call your office. If you still have one.</p><p>Borwegan is the guy who stands between Fetterman and the rest of his staff (or claims to when he's trying to get into a date's pants). He carries the special iPad that records everything said around Fetterman since Fetterman can't understand the words himself. And if it sounds like the AP article about Fetterman Fashion was planted by his staff, per this video it most likely was.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">ANOTHER ONE: Special Assistant to <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnFetterman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JohnFetterman</a> says his boss is “okay with overturning the Second Amendment” and handpicked journalists like <a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@karaswisher</a> “will say exactly what you f***ing want them to. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RealJohnFetterman?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RealJohnFetterman</a><a href="https://t.co/vVhlPaZ4EA">pic.twitter.com/vVhlPaZ4EA</a><br />— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1661138075802828805?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The gun stuff isn't all that surprising. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/justin-trudeau-2010-vs-2023" target="_blank">The left isn't slick and we know what their true agenda is</a>. If you asked Fetterman for his opinions on gun control, his response would be "Bananas are my friends." Having the Fetterman Whisperer translate for you is helpful.</p><blockquote>He’s 100 percent for gun control. Banning automatic weapons, all that sh*t. He’d be OK with overturning the Second Amendment, probably. I think he’d much rather prefer that nobody have guns at all.</blockquote><p>But where this video truly shines is the attacks on the media. I will never grow tired of seeing Democrats tell journalismers that the money is on the nightstand as journalismers bend over and take it with no Vaseline.</p><blockquote>Like, reporters, we can tell them to go f*ck themselves and they can't do anything, because they need us more than we need them. because everyone wants a f*cking story about John Fetterman. I only pick reporters who we know will paint the narrative the way we want.</blockquote><p>Exhibit Q:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Translation: I was caught doing PR for the Democratic Senator from Pennsylvania ... and plagiarism because I posted a quote without attribution to his office<br /><br />But other than that . . . <a href="https://twitter.com/washingtonpost?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@washingtonpost</a> baby!!!!<br />— Obnoxious Boston Fan (@realOBF) <a href="https://twitter.com/realOBF/status/1658900408213950464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Borwegan singled out Kara Swisher as a journalismer who is extra obedient. Which is hilarious, because Swisher is the one who <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/kara-swisher-shuts-down-nonsense-192619197.html" target="_blank">lashed out at NBC News last October</a> for doing an actual journalism and admitting, "You know, I don't think this Fetterman guy understands things too good."</p><p>Call me crazy, but I think someone else is going to be holding Fetterman's special laptop for now on.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Vanity Fair loses its mind, lashes out as it compares Elon Musk to David Duke for interviewing Ron DeSantis tonight

Even though I gave away the reveal in the headline.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Looks like Babylon Bee has some competition for satire<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1661215600843325440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Ron DeSantis is expected (wink wink, nudge nudge) to announce his presidential campaign tonight, in a move political observers have <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-pennssylvania-speech" target="_blank">been expecting since as far back as May 2021</a>. The announcement -- I'm sorry, the "expected" announcement -- is going to be made during a live Twitter Spaces as the governor is interviewed by Elon Musk. Hence the journalisming content creators at Vanity Fair having a nutty over it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">They’re losing their position as gatekeepers … and they can’t handle it. <a href="https://t.co/abDoPpgIIm">https://t.co/abDoPpgIIm</a><br />— Christina Pushaw 🐊 🇺🇸 (@ChristinaPushaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1661202315674628097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>David Duke is a former politician who is also a former Grand Wizard of the Democrat-created Klu Klux Klan. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/flashback-when-hillary-praised-someone-in-the-kkk" target="_blank">Democrat senate stalwart Robert Byrd a KKK official too</a>. Duke is also a man who is only relevant when leftists are desperate for a name they can use to accuse someone who has a single opposing viewpoint than them of an -ism.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Is this real? This is absurd and offensive. People can say what they want about <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a> but to compare him to David Duke is not only ridiculous but offensive to those of us who knows what real racism from people who think like David Duke feels like.<br />— Darvio Morrow (@DTheKingpin) <a href="https://twitter.com/DTheKingpin/status/1661204321608843265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The opening paragraph is really all you need to know.</p><blockquote>After many months of refusing to confirm what so many people already suspected, Ron DeSantis will reportedly announce on Wednesday that he is running for president. And that’s not all: He is said to be planning to formally jump into the 2024 race during a conversation on Twitter with Elon Musk, because apparently other neo-Nazi sympathizers weren’t available.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="74efe" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33734360&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Honestly? I think DeSantis's move to announce via Twitter Spaces is brilliant. Holding rallies is his opponent's schtick. Talking to corporate media is out of the question. We've been watching them lie <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/larry-hogan-ron-desantis" target="_blank">about the Parental Rights in Education bill</a>, that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-apologizes-team-desantis" target="_blank">single AP history class</a>, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-book-banning" target="_blank">the "book bans" that aren't banning books</a> for well over a year. Twitter Spaces gives DeSantis direct access to voters.</p><p>AND there will be a live Q&amp;A. That's going to include direct questions about Trump. As opposed to going to corporate media, where they would <em>only</em> ask about Trump. Trump, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-reporter-runs-away" target="_blank">and The Little Mermaid</a>.</p><p>I'm excited about a primary between DeSantis vs. Trump because I believe iron sharpens iron. I also don't sweat it being a "bruising" primary when someone is going to be "bloodied." Remember when Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist who probably sexually assault his aide? </p><p>Biden doesn't.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
