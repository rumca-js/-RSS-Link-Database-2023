Our thief friend, we'll call her Becki, picked the wrong store to rob on the wrong day because Boss Babe had enough. She had a fully charged iPhone and no f*cks left to give.<br /></p><p>It wasn't even enough to get Becki arrested. Boss Babe made sure Becki was ridiculed with all due disrespect and broadcasted it throughout all of the internets how badly she sucks at life.</p><p>What I don't understand from the video is why Becki didn't realize she was screwed, give Boss Babe all the stolen goods back, and get off at the next bus stop. You were caught. There was no getting out of this. Take the L and wait for the local cops coming by in the next thirty minutes. Instead, besides being a criminal, Becki was also a nincompoop. She let Boss Babe follow her to her house, where police were waiting.  </p><p>Now, Becki is all over the internet, bringing shame to her family for generations to come. Decades from now, kids are going to be showing their friends this clip and saying, \"Hey, check out my idiot great-great-grand cousin.\"</p><p>Unclear from the video is what city this takes place in. If it's LA or NYC, Becki is already out on bail.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
