Sure, its horror may not land too well for some players\u2014it didn\u2019t for me\u2014but the experience itself was a lot of fun. Even joining online games with strangers never gets boring or frustrating, and playing with other people is always a good way to lower the tension if the game gets too scary for you.\n\nAside from its co-op, however, The Outlast Trials doesn\u2019t do much new, and if you\u2019re not a fan of the kind of horror game where you can\u2019t fight back, you likely won\u2019t find much to enjoy here. If slow-paced gameplay where you\u2019re essentially helpless against horrifying monstrosities but still have to complete missions sounds appealing to you, The Outlast Trials will be something you want to keep an eye on.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqeW-fcr5V4", "date_published": "2023-05-20 19:30:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Why Immortals of Aveum May Be One of the Biggest Games of the Year", "description": "Immortals of Aveum\u00a0has been in development for five years at this point (which is surprised, considering the fact that until December, we hadn't head a single peep about it), so clearly, Ascendant Studios has been chipping away at it for a while as it looks to realize its vision of a single player magic shooter. Meanwhile, the fact that the developer has also said that it hopes to turn this into a franchise of its own tells you all you need to know about how high its hopes for its debut projects are. \n\nOf course, very rarely will you find a developer that\u00a0doesn't\u00a0big up its game in similar fashion before launch, but from what we've seen of it so far, Immortals of Aveum\u00a0certainly seems to be a game that may very well end up vindicating said bigging up.
