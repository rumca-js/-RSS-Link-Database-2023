  <p id="toi3PJ">Neeva, which for a while looked like one of the startups with a real chance to challenge the supremacy of Google Search, announced on Saturday that it is shutting down its search engine. The company says it’s pivoting to AI — and may be acquired by Snowflake, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/snowflake-nears-acquisition-of-search-startup-neeva"><em>The Information</em> reported</a> — but mostly seems to believe it failed.</p>
<p id="hHqTBk">“Building search engines is hard,” Neeva co-founders Sridhar Ramaswamy and Vivek Raghunathan wrote in <a href="https://neeva.com/blog/may-announcement">a blog post announcing the shutdown</a>. (Ramaswamy in particular is part of the reason Neeva seemed promising — as the longtime head of Google’s ad business, few people are better equipped to know how to build and monetize search than he is.) But Neeva did it, he said. It built a good, competitive search engine. It was...</p>

  <p id="Di5psD">After more than 2,000 hours in <em>Dota 2</em>, I’ve finally been sent to gamer jail for the first time. It’s worse than I ever imagined, which makes it an extremely effective<em> </em>deterrent in a competitive game where teamwork is essential. But now that I’ve been punished, I see that there’s a better way to administer multiplayer justice.</p>
<p id="RZmWTV">I had been proud of my perfect player conduct score since Valve introduced the rating system in 2019. (By the way, that’s a score of 10,000, and it comes with a reassuring green smiley face when you’re doing well.) The score is a loose measure of whether you’re an upstanding member of the player community. If you’re reported a lot by your teammates or abandon games before they’re finished, your score goes down.

  <p id="6Lc1PW">Apple’s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is expected to be one of its biggest yet. After years of rumors and leaks, Apple could finally take the wraps off of its mixed reality headset, entering the company into a new product category and giving the world a first look at its attempt to prove that virtual reality is worth investing in.</p>
<p id="bjnX1n">There’s also certain to be a lot more: operating system updates, new apps and features, and possibly some new hardware, too. Here, we’ve pulled together details on how and when you can watch the main WWDC keynote as well as some of the announcements that we expect from Apple.</p>
<h2 id="HjlUYV">When is the WWDC 2023 keynote?</h2>

## I took my own advice and bought a last-gen iPhone — I regret nothing

  <p id="IxL45S">I spent an exciting, exhausting week last September with the new Apple iPhone 14 in hand before it went on sale. I did everything I could over the course of that week — navigating, web browsing, recording video, gaming, selfies, ferry rides, <a href="https://youtu.be/hZP_i6BZpR8?t=174">selfies on the ferry</a>, you name it — to try to answer the $800 question: should you buy it? </p>
<p id="c0cN8H">The answer then, which I stand by now, is “probably not.” It’s a great phone, but it’s not meaningfully better than the iPhone 13. Sure, it makes sense to pick the 14 if your carrier is giving you a great deal or you spend a lot of time out of cell range where the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23457970/iphone-14-emergency-sos-satellite-ios-16">new Emergency SOS might be a literal lifesaver</a>.

## El Niño could take a $3 trillion bite out of the world economy

  <p id="oVnSgG">El Niño is on its way, and when the warm weather pattern arrives, it could take a $3 trillion toll on the global economy, according to new <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2983">research</a>. That estimate is based on damages inflicted by El Niño in previous years, plus forecasts pointing to a potentially supercharged event this year. </p>
<p id="zcrBQw">El Niño influences weather across the world when it forms — potentially fueling more severe floods in places while worsening drought in others. Within the US, for example, it can trigger a wetter winter in the southern half of the country but more hot and dry weather farther north. Earlier this week, a warning came from the World Meteorological Organization that this year’s El Niño, combined with climate change, could “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/17/23725705/el-nino-weather-record-heat-climate-change-world-meteorological-organization">push global temperatures into...</a></p>

<p id="T1NutO">In its filing, AT&amp;T argues that SCS, or “supplemental coverage from space,” should not inhibit terrestrial wireless service and that the FCC “must prioritize” protecting terrestrial networks, and that T-Mobile and SpaceX’s proposals don’t have enough information about potential interference. “The Applicants’ technical showings are woefully insufficient regarding the risk of harmful interference posed by their planned SCS deployments,” AT&amp;T said. “SpaceX and T-Mobile’s applications fall far short of meeting the threshold for waiver and...</p>
