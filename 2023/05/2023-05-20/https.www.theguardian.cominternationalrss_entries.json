After a 38-year silence, the recovery of the English folk singer\u2019s vocal powers was at first tentative, but here she sails through an array of traditional song with all the brio an 87-year-old might muster. Her voice is not the joyous thing it was \u2013 to remind us of her sprightly younger years, a live 1980 performance is included \u2013 but its weathered tones come with unforced gravitas. Collins has always maintained that a song is more important than its singer, and the narratives here unfold easily.</p><p>Among them are numbers originally learned and played with her late sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/22/dolly-collins-shirley-collins-mass-missa-humana-debut\">Dolly</a>, such as Hares on the Mountain and Fare Thee Well My Dearest Dear, the latter a tale of cross-dressing that ends in drowning (a common cause of death in folk music).

The title cut is a poem by her father about a beloved Sussex peak, given an atmospheric treatment by arranger Ian Kearey, who along with fellow members of Collins\u2019s Lodestar Band provide discreet, exquisite accompaniments.
