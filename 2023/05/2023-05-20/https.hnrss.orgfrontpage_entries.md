## Meticulous (YC S21) is hiring founding engineer to build AI for testing
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36011172](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36011172)

<p>Hey HN!<p>I'm Gabriel, CEO and co-founder of Meticulous.<p>Our mission is to radically accelerate the pace of software development for every company in the world. We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href="http://meticulous.ai/">http://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href="https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d" rel="nofollow">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable.

## Show HN: Mapname – anonymous social network for organising points of interest
 - [https://map.name](https://map.name)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage
 - date published: 2023-05-20 11:53:07+00:00

<p>Hello HN,<p>with mapname you can create a unique name for any particular point of interest as in prefix(id).group(optional).suffix.<p>Once a mapname created then this can be used as an address, discovered and socialised.<p>Mapname is free and has no advertisements. At onboarding pick a unique prefix. That is all about onboarding.<p>Users can also organise collection of places with just two words, for example coffee shops i like at NY is abc.1 or I have visited Melbourne last year where you can see at abc.melbourne<p>Mapname designed as an anonymous Social Network where users particular perspective engage with like minded users, instead of their persona. Personal Images are not promoted.<p>Here is one minute user guide <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G42THV9YcY4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G42THV9YcY4</a><p>More mapnames are on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/NameYourWay" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/NameYourWay</a><p>You can consider this as "Pinterest of coordinates"<p>Another way to think this; mapname(s) to coordinate(s) is similar to domain name(s) to ip address(es).<p>Instead of hard to remember IP Addresses we use domain names. Similarly instead of coordinates or map list urls a mapname can be in use.<p>Between mapname and a coordinate 1->1 or N->1 or 1->N relationships are possible.<p>Whenever a mapname visited, the most relevant what3words attached to it so that you may communicate whichever is more relevant.<p>Mapname is trying to reduce friction while describing addresses and organising points of interests, for transportation, navigation, directions uses integrations.<p>A mapname can be viewed in your favourite maps (Google Maps, Apple Maps, Yandex Maps, Bing Maps, Baidu Maps) or with what3words, citymapper, waze.<p>it is available on android & ios, feel free play with it, any feedback or question is appreciated.<p>What other location/navigation/map integration would you benefit?</p>

## Tell HN: OpenAI's billing features and customer support are barely functional

<p>Thought I'd give a small warning to people thinking of paying for ChatGPT Plus.<p>You're forced to use an intercom chat widget to open up customer support tickets, but the response times are abysmal. Currently I have this[1] issue, where an account doesn't get upgraded after going through the payment flow. It's been over a week with no reply. I paid money for a service that I'm not receiving. When/if they do respond, I have no idea if they'll reimburse the days I paid for nothing, who knows, there's no comms about it on their page.<p>Note that it's a known problem, given they have a dedicated page for it on their help docs, and there's a massive thread[2] about it on their forums.<p>Their refund policy[3] goes through the same chat flow, so one could end up paying for two months before they're finally issued a refund.<p>I know they're scaling up, but I'm shocked at how bad this is, especially given they're using stripe for payments. Normally, even when in a move-fast type environment, billing logic/flow is one thing you have to get right before shipping a product to prod. They're breaking all sorts of consumer rights (especially here in Australia where they are strong).<p>Between broken billing and their recent IAM issues, right now I'd jump at a competitor that can deliver these.<p>1. https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7232905-why-is-my-plus-subscription-not-appearing<p>2. https://community.openai.com/t/paid-for-chatgpt-plus-but-still-getting-free-version/129073/1<p>3. https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7232895-how-do-i-request-a-refund</p>

<p>yt-fts is a simple python script that uses yt-dlp to scrape all of a youtube channels subtitles and load them into an sqlite database that is searchable from the command line. It allows you to query a channel for specific key word or phrase and will generate time stamped youtube urls to the video containing the keyword.</p>
