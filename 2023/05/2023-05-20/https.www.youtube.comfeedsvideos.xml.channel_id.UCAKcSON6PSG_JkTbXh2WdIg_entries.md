Perseverance is paying off for Jason Singer of the band Michigander. Having sunk to what he describes as one of the lowest points in his life following a broken leg — not to mention a global pandemic — Singer and his band are back on the road touring in support of their latest EP, "It Will Never Be the Same."

Now reconnecting with fans and playing sold-out rooms, it may never be the same for Michigander — and that’s a good thing. The band visited The Current studio to perform tracks from the EP, after which lead vocalist and songwriter Jason Singer sat down for a friendly chat with host Mac Wilson.

Watch and listen to the complete studio session above.

Prior to the pandemic, Robyn Hitchcock had never spent a protracted time off the road. While at home in Nashville, Hitchcock found he couldn’t stop writing songs. 

One of the results of those efforts is the new album, "Shufflemania!," released in late 2022. Hitchcock, touring once again, visited The Current studio to play songs from that album. Watch Hitchcock performing "The Inner Life of Scorpio" during that session at The Current.
