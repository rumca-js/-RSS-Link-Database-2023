With co-writer Eric Roth, Scorsese crafts an epic of creeping, existential horror about the birth of the American century, a macabre tale of quasi-genocidal serial killings which mimic the larger erasure of Native Americans from the US. It places in the drama\u2019s foreground a gaslit marriage of lies and poisoned love. It echoes Scorsese\u2019s earlier work about mob violence, mob loyalty and the final, inevitable sellout to the federal authorities, whose own bad faith gradually emerges. But in the end, this film is about what all westerns are about, and perhaps all history: the brutal grab for land, resources and power.</p><p>Lily Gladstone gives a performance of tragic force as Mollie Burkhart, a Native American woman from the Osage tribe who, like all her people, has become unexpectedly wealthy because the apparently stony and unpromising land in Oklahoma on which the authorities allowed the Osage to settle turned out to have huge reserves of oil. But they are still subject to a racist and infantilising condition of \u201cguardianship\u201d: to claim the income and spend it, Osage individuals need a white co-signatory. And there is something else: Mollie and her family are deeply disturbed by mysterious illnesses which have been killing off Osage people, one by one. Later the bodies of Osage murder-victims are found, including Mollie\u2019s wayward sister Anna (Cara Jade Myers), whose autopsy is bizarrely carried out in the open air, at the crime scene itself.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/killers-of-the-flower-moon-review-martin-scorsese-leonardo-dicaprio\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/killers-of-the-flower-moon-review-martin-scorsese-leonardo-dicaprio", "date_published": "2023-05-20 19:45:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "How Rico Lewis helped harden up Manchester City\u2019s treble challenge | Jamie Jackson", "description": "<p>Guardiola believes advent of the teenage talent sowed seeds of change that turned his side into champions again</p><p>Mid-January, the Etihad Campus.
