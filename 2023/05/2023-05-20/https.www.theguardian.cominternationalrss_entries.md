<ul><li>Manager says win against Inter is required to seal greatness</li><li>‘I’m in agreement with people saying we have to win in Europe’</li></ul><p>Pep Guardiola has said his Manchester City side must win the Champions League before they can be regarded as one of the greatest teams of all time, despite their superb domestic record since his first Premier League title in 2018.</p><p>A treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League would make them only the second team in English history to win all three trophies in the same season. It would, however, be the second time Guardiola has managed a side to the treble, after Barcelona’s triumph in La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League in 2008-09.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-legacy-champions-league">Continue reading...</a>

## Mikel Arteta laments defensive lapses that finished off Arsenal’s title hopes

<ul><li>‘We are not at that level,’ admits manager about Manchester City</li><li>‘We can’t put the guilt on someone. We should have been better’</li></ul><p>Mikel Arteta lamented the defensive shortcomings of recent weeks as he tried to come to terms with the disappointment of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/nottingham-forest-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">1-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest</a> that confirmed Manchester City would win the title. A blunt Arsenal became the first side in 16 games to fail to score against Forest, but a league they led for a record 248 days was not lost on Saturday. Arsenal, rather, were undone by a run of two wins in eight games that began with throwing away a 2-0 lead <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/09/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">away at Liverpool</a>.</p><p>“We conceded a lot of goals in those games, 16 goals,” Arteta said. “16 goals – it’s a lot.” Against a rival like City, that is too many. “You have to be exceptional in everything,” he went on. “They [Forest] are not a team that gives you any margins and we have extended those margins too far. Today we gave them a goal and chances for another goal. We can’t put the guilt on someone. We should have been better as a team and in the last few weeks we have fallen short.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/mikel-arteta-defensive-lapses-arsenal-falter-title-race">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Marquee signing has suffered since joining from Manchester City but hopes a new manager’s arrival will herald a fresh start</p><p>When Raheem Sterling returns to Manchester City on Sunday afternoon and sees John Stones floating into midfield, their creative players servicing Erling Haaland and everyone in light blue going into overdrive when possession is lost, it will bring home the difference between a team that obey their manager’s every command and one who have spent an entire season in a state of self-imposed flux.</p><p>Sterling is all too aware of the standards required to reach and stay at the top. Everybody in the City dressing room had to understand that Pep Guardiola’s vision was sacrosanct. Doing so allowed City to flourish and individuals to take their game to new heights. By the time Sterling left last summer, he had 131 goals and 74 assists in all competitions and won four league titles at the club.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/raheem-sterling-ready-to-get-back-to-basics-after-stalling-at-chelsea">Continue reading...</a>

## About Dry Grasses – Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s absorbing, Chekhovian drama of a teacher-pupil crisis

<p>The latest film from the Turkish film-maker is a studied, literary film about a schoolteacher accused of abuse by a female student</p><p>Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan has delivered another of his expansive, ruminative and distinctly Chekhovian character-driven dramas. Again it is spread out across the landscape of western Anatolia, and again there is Ceylan’s emphasis on still photography and portraiture. This film does however have one very atypical touch: a very startling and Brechtian meta-moment when we are reminded this is a film we’re watching, and the tiny and flickeringly firelit interiors are created on a soundstage.</p><p>It certainly does however have a very typical title: that is, forbidding and slightly disconcerting. In About Dry Grasses’s final section, its lead character is to ponder the fact that the gauntly beautiful terrain of Anatolia seems to have only two seasons. The first is the snow-covered winter in which we get Ceylan’s signature shot of a lonely figure plodding towards the camera in the snow. This suddenly gives way to bright summer, ahe ground will reveal itself to be covered in a featureless dry grass, which has a mysterious fascination in its austere beauty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/about-dry-grasses-nuri-bilge-ceylans-absorbing-chekhovian-drama-of-a-teacher-pupil-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

## Shirley Collins: Archangel Hill review – brio and unforced gravitas

<p>(Domino)<br />The veteran folk singer’s renaissance continues with this gem of weathered vocals and exquisite accompaniments</p><p><a href="https://www.dominomusic.com/releases/shirley-collins/archangel-hill/exclusive-limited-lp">The third album</a> since Shirley Collins’s renaissance at 81 turns out to be the finest. After a 38-year silence, the recovery of the English folk singer’s vocal powers was at first tentative, but here she sails through an array of traditional song with all the brio an 87-year-old might muster. Her voice is not the joyous thing it was – to remind us of her sprightly younger years, a live 1980 performance is included – but its weathered tones come with unforced gravitas. Collins has always maintained that a song is more important than its singer, and the narratives here unfold easily.</p><p>Among them are numbers originally learned and played with her late sister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/22/dolly-collins-shirley-collins-mass-missa-humana-debut">Dolly</a>, such as Hares on the Mountain and Fare Thee Well My Dearest Dear, the latter a tale of cross-dressing that ends in drowning (a common cause of death in folk music). There’s a nod, too, to Collins’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/31/america-over-the-water-by-shirley-collins-review-alan-lomax">1959 expedition to the US</a> with the songwriter Alan Lomax on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhhezIZR--Q">High and Away</a>, and on an Appalachian instrumental. The title cut is a poem by her father about a beloved Sussex peak, given an atmospheric treatment by arranger Ian Kearey, who along with fellow members of Collins’s Lodestar Band provide discreet, exquisite accompaniments. A tonic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/20/shirley-collins-archangel-hill-review-brio-and-unforced-gravitas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The OpenAI CEO says his industry needs government intervention. Whether it’s a ploy or a plea for help, we should be concerned</p><p>Watching the opening day of the US Senate hearings on AI brought to mind Marx’s quip about history repeating itself, “the first time as tragedy, the second as farce”. Except this time it’s the other way round. Some time ago we had the farce of the boss of Meta (neé Facebook) <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/some-senators-in-congress-capitol-hill-just-dont-get-facebook-and-mark-zuckerberg/">explaining to a senator</a> that his company made money from advertising. This week we had the tragedy of seeing senators <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?528117-1/openai-ceo-testifies-artificial-intelligence">quizzing Sam Altman</a>, the new acceptable face of the tech industry.</p><p>Why tragedy? Well, as one of my kids, looking up from revising O-level classics, once explained to me: “It’s when you can see the disaster coming but you can’t do anything to stop it.” The trigger moment was when Altman declared: “We think that regulatory interventions by government will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models.” Warming to the theme, he said that the US government “might consider a combination of licensing and testing requirements for development and release of AI models above a threshold of capabilities”. He believed that companies like his can “partner with governments, including ensuring that the most powerful AI models adhere to a set of safety requirements, facilitating processes that develop and update safety measures and examining opportunities for global coordination.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/20/when-the-tech-boys-start-asking-for-new-regulations-you-know-somethings-up-ai-chatgpt">Continue reading...</a>

## Bryan Mbeumo’s second-half double inspires Brentford’s fightback at Spurs

<p>For Tottenham there was, in the end, more pain, more frustration and another defeat. That is five now in their last seven games and they were worryingly bereft of answers as, after a bright start, Brentford turned the game on its head and ripped the points from their grasp in the second half. Bryan Mbeumo scored twice and Yoane Wissa grabbed a late third as the Bees won for the fourth time in five matches to haul themselves to just a point behind Spurs with a game to play.</p><p>The turnaround was dramatic, but in the circumstances not entirely unexpected. “This has been an immensely difficult season. We made footballing decisions over recent seasons based on ambition and a desire to bring success to our club and they have not delivered what we have hoped.” So began the message from the Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, in the matchday programme. Before kick-off a mural of Harry Kane was unveiled opposite the ground; for this Spurs side, poised for a summer of transformation – “We shall spend the period ahead of next season working relentlessly to position our club for on-pitch success,” Levy wrote – the writing is on the wall.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/tottenham-brentford-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>
