<p>Todd Haynes’ tale of merging identities is too knowing and too glossy to drive its message home</p><p>Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore play actor and subject in <em>May December</em>, the enjoyable tale of a fraught creative collaboration that finally promises more than it delivers. Director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/todd-haynes" title="">Todd Haynes</a> adores playing with the pieces of traditional Hollywood cinema, like a kid with a train set, or his mum’s makeup box, to the point where the artifice becomes the main thrust of his story. If <em>May December</em> is guilty of making hysterical mountains out of molehills, then, this is partly the point. That’s Hollywood movies for you. They turn every crisis into a pre-packaged drama.</p><p>Moore co-stars as Gracie Atherton, a 60-year-old southern belle with a sun-bright smile and a brittle coating of frost. More than two decades ago she fell in love with Joe Yoo, a 13-year-old schoolboy, sparking a nationwide scandal that people remember to this day. Portman is Elizabeth, the actor set to play Gracie in the big-budget film of her life. “You look taller on television, but we’re basically the same size,” Gracie marvels, welcoming the star to her seafront Georgia home. Elizabeth agrees: “We’re basically the same.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/may-december-review-fraught-drama-starring-natalie-portman-and-julianne-moore-promises-more-than-it-delivers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When <strong>Nina Wan</strong> found herself drifting apart from her husband, art came to imitate life – reminding her of what was real</p><p>In the 12th year of my marriage I began to write a novel, about a woman named Primrose whose life unravelled in the wake of her husband’s cancer battle. The story was about the wreckage left by the illness, about how two people united by a traumatic experience could somehow slip away from each other, become strangers under one roof.</p><p>The premise was inspired by my own story, as several years earlier my husband had found himself in a blood cancer ward, fighting for his life. The ward was a place where prognoses were delivered in hushed voices, where bags of chemo drugs arrived at the bedside, wearing Grim Reaper hoods to protect them from the light. People passed their days staring out of the seventh-floor windows as if they were floating away from the world. And in a sense, they were, because no one who entered the place came out quite the same.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/21/the-moment-i-knew-i-dreamed-up-a-character-to-cure-my-writers-block-he-saved-my-marriage-too">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone star in this macabre western about serial murders among the Osage tribe in 1920s Oklahoma, which reflects the erasure of Native Americans from the US</p><p>Martin Scorsese’s western true-crime thriller is about the US’s Osage murders of the early 1920s, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/03/killers-of-the-flower-moon-by-david-grann-review">based on the nonfiction bestseller by David Grann</a>. With co-writer Eric Roth, Scorsese crafts an epic of creeping, existential horror about the birth of the American century, a macabre tale of quasi-genocidal serial killings which mimic the larger erasure of Native Americans from the US. It places in the drama’s foreground a gaslit marriage of lies and poisoned love. It echoes Scorsese’s earlier work about mob violence, mob loyalty and the final, inevitable sellout to the federal authorities, whose own bad faith gradually emerges. But in the end, this film is about what all westerns are about, and perhaps all history: the brutal grab for land, resources and power.</p><p>Lily Gladstone gives a performance of tragic force as Mollie Burkhart, a Native American woman from the Osage tribe who, like all her people, has become unexpectedly wealthy because the apparently stony and unpromising land in Oklahoma on which the authorities allowed the Osage to settle turned out to have huge reserves of oil. But they are still subject to a racist and infantilising condition of “guardianship”: to claim the income and spend it, Osage individuals need a white co-signatory. And there is something else: Mollie and her family are deeply disturbed by mysterious illnesses which have been killing off Osage people, one by one. Later the bodies of Osage murder-victims are found, including Mollie’s wayward sister Anna (Cara Jade Myers), whose autopsy is bizarrely carried out in the open air, at the crime scene itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/killers-of-the-flower-moon-review-martin-scorsese-leonardo-dicaprio">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The south coast club are not the only case where a manager inherits a legacy that proves crucial for the success he builds</p><p>Imagine that Thomas Tuchel had not been sacked by Chelsea at the beginning of September and that Graham Potter had not been lured from Brighton to replace him. Potter, presumably, would still be in charge at the Amex. Would Brighton’s situation now be better or worse? Would they be heading into Sunday’s game against Southampton sixth in the Premier League table and likely to qualify for the Europa League?</p><p>Brighton had begun this season well, taking 13 points from the first six games – which, of course, is why Potter was appointed by Chelsea. Would Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali have been drawn by his years of steady progress culminating in last season’s ninth-place finish? It seems unlikely. It is indicative of how large a part chance plays that had Boehly realised at the end of last season that Tuchel was not the man for him, the obvious candidate to take over would have been Brendan Rodgers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/20/serendipity-of-de-zerbi-and-brighton-underlines-footballs-great-complexities">Continue reading...</a>

<p>And with that it was done. A title race that had promised so much came to its formal and premature end in bright spring sunshine as Arsenal’s failure to defeat Nottingham Forest ensured that, for the fifth time in six seasons, the Premier League was won by Manchester City, who have three games still to play. But if that side of the equation was ultimately anti-climactic, for Forest there was ecstasy: they will be playing Premier League football again next season.</p><p>For others, next week’s trip to Crystal Palace, blithely mid-table, might seem the perfect final-day fixture for a team in need of points. Palace’s job is already done, their suitcases are already packed; they have no need for a dogfight. But Forest’s away form is so poor – just seven points gathered in 18 games on the road this season – there was an awareness they could do with securing survival before then. Offered the opportunity by Everton’s draw at Wolves earlier in the day, they seized it eagerly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/nottingham-forest-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Final: Leinster 26-27 La Rochelle</li><li>Colombe inspires French side to second successive triumph</li></ul><p>It was a grey day in Dublin, a blank canvas awaiting a few vivid splashes of colour. One need not have worried. This was as sensationally good a finale as the tournament has seen and, by the end, it was all yellow. For the second year in succession La Rochelle hoisted the Champions Cup while Leinster’s drive for a record-equalling fifth title was denied.</p><p>And what a spectacle it turned out to be. Expectations had been high but they were comfortably exceeded inside the first 40 minutes. Great games of rugby are not always reserved for the greatest of stages but this one had pretty much everything. From 17-0 down inside the first dozen minutes La Rochelle staged one of the all-time great comebacks, clinched with a 72nd-minute close-range try from their vast replacement prop Georges-Henri Colombe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/20/leinster-la-rochelle-champions-cup-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The titan of literary science fiction on AI hype, writing his ‘anti-memoir’, and his take on Cormac McCarthy’s The Road</p><p>M John Harrison, 77, is the author of seven story collections and 12 novels, including <em>Nova Swing</em>, which won the Arthur C Clarke award for science fiction in 2007, and <em>The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again</em>, winner of the Goldsmiths prize in 2020. His new book, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/12/wish-i-was-here-by-m-john-harrison-review-a-masterly-anti-memoir">Wish I Was Here</a></em>, is a fragmentary work of autobiography about reading, writing and, among other topics, rock climbing, a longtime pursuit that inspired <em>Climbers</em> (1989), which Robert Macfarlane has called “the best novel ever written” on the subject. Harrison, speaking from his home in Shropshire, told me he took up the activity in his 30s to “blast myself out of writing and into what I thought of as the real world. Because if you let go from 50ft up, the consequences are real. The mistake I made was to immediately sit down and write about it.”</p><p><strong>Wh</strong><strong>at drew you to the subtitle “An anti-memoir”?</strong><br />I wanted to talk about how I perceive memory, and especially the writing down of memory, to be a failed device. You make a note about something you want to remember and all you end up with is a fiction or a hyperbolic representation of what happened. And the moment you use it for any purpose, it goes through further transformations, and by the time you’re finished with it as a 77-year-old author, the memory you have when you look at the note isn’t really a memory at all. But you can’t really call it a fiction – it’s a hybrid thing. That’s what I wanted to produce. Calling it anti-memoir isn’t a form of trolling; it’s saying, let’s think a bit more about this complex business of relating what we think of as a self to what we think of as a past.</p><p><em>Wish I Was Here</em> by M John Harrison will be published by Serpent’s Tail on 25 May (£16.99).

<p>Actors and real people re-enact the past to understand why two daughters left Tunisia to fight for IS in Syria, leaving the rest of the family behind</p><p>There is real emotional warmth and human sympathy in this otherwise somewhat flawed film, a docudrama experiment in getting actors to play some of the real people in a tragic news story from Tunisia. Olfa Hamrouni, a divorced woman from the coastal town of Sousse, made the headlines seven years ago when two of her four daughters, Rahma and Ghofrane, broke her and their sisters’ hearts by vanishing from the country to become fighters and wives for Islamic State in Syria. Now director Kaouther Ben Hania re-enacts key parts of Olfa’s family life, featuring the remaining sisters Eya and Tayssir playing themselves, but performers playing the vanished fugitives: Ichraq Matar is Ghofrane and Nour Karoui is Rahma.</p><p>Despite the fact that she hasn’t vanished, and is in fact a vivid and formidable onscreen figure, Olfa is also played by an actor, Hend Sabri, so the procedure is already in fact slightly muddled, though no less intriguing. The performers and real figures are interviewed together, and then scenes are played out, with Olfa coming on to say where they’re going wrong. The actor Majd Mastoura plays Olfa’s distant and abusive father, and the film shows how weirdly upset he becomes to embody a vicious character from the real world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/four-daughters-review-fact-and-fiction-mix-in-mothers-heartbreak-over-islamic-state">Continue reading...</a>

For most of the contest they were on course to do so, Villa ahead and containing Jürgen Klopp’s team with ease, but even the 110<sup>th</sup> goal of Firmino’s Liverpool career did not radically change the picture. Both require only a point from their two remaining games to finish in the top four.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/liverpool-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Manchester United on verge of top-four spot after Casemiro sinks Bournemouth

<p>Mission accomplished for Erik ten Hag. Well, almost. One more point from their final two games against Chelsea and Fulham will be enough to confirm Manchester United’s place in the top four and Champions League qualification for next season after Casemiro’s instinctive overhead kick was enough to secure a vital victory against Bournemouth.</p><p>That it was achieved once more in the absence of their top scorer, Marcus Rashford, will have been particularly satisfying for their Dutch manager, who watched his side dominate possession here without ever looking fully secure. But while Gary O’Neil’s side may have offered stiffer opposition had their Premier League status not already been assured, Ten Hag will be delighted that United have overcome their late wobble to come within touching distance of achieving their main objective for the season with two games to spare.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/bournemouth-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Everton earn priceless point after Yerry Mina’s last-gasp equaliser at Wolves

<p>Might Everton look back on the moment Yerry Mina prodded in to salvage an unlikely point deep into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time as a significant step in their fight for Premier League survival? Everton were desperate for something, anything to add to their points tally. Jordan Pickford had gone up for a corner moments earlier.</p><p>A blue haze, from flares lit by the travelling support, fell over this ground and the noise booming from the away end at full-time suggested this might just prove a priceless point. Relegation is still a distinct possibility but for Leeds and Leicester, who play over the next 48 hours, this result marks a major blow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/wolves-everton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Wellcome Collection’s show has art and history, biology and ecology,  public health, politics – and the dangers of ice-cream</p><p>It’s good, sometimes, to think long and hard about the really basic things in life – or, at least what may <em>seem</em> like the really basic things in life – and at Milk, a (free) exhibition at the Wellcome Collection in London, this happens seemingly without any effort on the part of the visitor. Suck it up quickly, as if through a straw! For here, in a (metaphorical) pint bottle, are art and history, biology and ecology, and public health and politics. I guarantee you’ll never think the same way again about your morning cup of tea, nor even – if you’re of a certain age – about those memories, almost a cliche now if written down, of the milk you were forced to drink at school as a child (ugh).</p><p>It opens with a huge udder, as vast and foreboding as a black cloud (a hanging sculpture by the contemporary German artist, Julia Bornefeld), and an irresistibly cheery collection of 18th- and early 19th-century Staffordshire cow-shaped creamers – a pairing that sets the tone for the peculiar combination of comfort and anxiety ahead. People are ever more fundamentalist about food, but its production is complicated, and so, increasingly, are its effects, whether on the land or our bodies. If I felt mournfully admiring of a 20th-century Ministry of Health that improved infant mortality rates via a promotion of milk – if only our present government were half so proactive in the matter of the obesity crisis – equally, the Wellcome’s displays forced me to think about some of the ethical problems associated with dairy farming, several of which, I will admit, I hadn’t really considered before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/20/an-exhibition-about-milks-complicated-history-has-me-rethinking-my-morning-cuppa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Inspired by “a very long, cold and wet winter”, the <a href="https://saatchiyates.com/">Saatchi Yates</a> gallery has curated an exhibition celebrating the joy of bathing, bringing together masters such as Picasso and contemporary artists including Lynette Yiadom-Boakye and Peter Doig. Gallerists Phoebe Saatchi Yates and Arthur Yates say that, historically, bathers were depicted in religious and mythological scenes, but that “Cezanne changed this by showing real people in a vision of Arcadia”. Ever since, artists have approached the theme in myriad ways: “Hockney painted two male lovers embracing in a pool, Picasso, a naked woman on the beach before the invention of the bikini, and now, [Ethiopian artist] Tesfaye Urgessa paints a man with his feet in a blood bath.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://saatchiyates.com/">Bathers is at Saatchi Yates, London, 1 June-15 August</a></li></ul><p></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/may/20/the-waters-lovely-art-that-celebrates-bathing-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Netflix documentary Victim/Suspect examines a broken system that too often turns women from victims of sexual assault to suspects of false claims</p><p>In November 2016, Emma Mannion, a freshman at the University of Alabama, called her mom in distress. She had been going to bars with friends, she said, and something happened that she didn’t want to happen. Her mother advised her to go to the hospital. While receiving a vaginal exam as part of a “rape kit,” Tuscaloosa police arrived; they took an initial statement while she was still in her hospital gown.</p><p>Three days later, Mannion responded to a request for a formal interview at the police station. She again stated what she could remember: that she had met a few guys while out with friends; that while intoxicated, two guys put their arms around her and forced into the backseat of a car in a gravel parking lot; that one stood outside while the other raped her. As seen in interview footage, investigator Jared Akridge pointed to “inconsistencies” in her account – he has security footage, he says but does not provide, that shows her making out with her alleged perpetrator. “You’re not being honest with me,” he says. “I do not believe you. I do not believe you at all.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/netflix-documentary-victim-suspect-women-rape">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The star athlete, Hollywood pioneer and civil rights icon, who died on Thursday aged 87, was the paragon for an unflinching brand of masculinity that remained undiluted to the end</p><p>100 Rifles is a spaghetti western that begs for judgment in its own time. Burt Reynolds smirks through his starring role as a biracial Native American hero. Raquel Welch, the full-blooded indigenous damsel in distress, adopts a horrific Mexican accent. But the thing that really offended sensibilities was Jim Brown getting top billing as the swashbuckling hero who not only gets the girl, but roughs her up in a squally love scene.</p><p>This was heady stuff for 1969, a time when Black actors could scarcely appear on screen with white peers without sparking a national controversy. But Brown would not be chastened by Hollywood’s open racism or Martin and Malcolm’s assassinations or Jim Crow-era laws explicitly designed to keep him in place. He was resolute, uncompromising, always his own man and the most intimidating presence in the room, to boot.

The lawyer and author, 61, talks about family tragedies, legal role models, bigoted cops and the Camden trance scene<p><strong>I grew up</strong> the son of an immigrant in inner city Birmingham – aged six, I wore a brand new parka to school and when I got home, it was entirely covered in spit. We lived near a football ground: on Saturdays, I wasn’t allowed out. Dad said don’t bother reporting it to the police, they don’t care. Access to justice, I learned, wasn’t available to everyone.</p><p><strong>My parents wanted</strong> me to see Pakistan. When I was eight, they drove us there in a Ford Transit van. On the way back, my cousin, who was the same age as me, fell ill. She died in Belgium. My mother put her in my arms and I held her on the four-hour ferry to Dover. We arrived and I realised what had happened. There and then I decided nobody would die on my watch again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/may/20/this-much-i-know-nazir-afzal-prosecutor-by-day-dj-by-night-that-was-me-in-the-90s">Continue reading...</a>

## Beyoncé review – a spangled supernova of joy

<p><strong>Principality Stadium, Cardiff</strong><br />The megastar’s 2022 album, Renaissance, celebrated Black beats and queer culture, and its live show turns that tribute into next-level liberation for all</p><p>It begins with what looks like an old-fashioned TV test card but is in fact the colours of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/57607955">Progress Pride flag</a>, arrayed across the back of the giant stage. It ends with a photo of Beyoncé’s mother and her “godmother” – <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a40755552/who-was-beyonces-uncle-johnny/">her late Uncle Jonny</a>, to whom <em>Renaissance</em>, Beyoncé’s seventh album, is dedicated; a gay man who was HIV-positive. In between is a two-and-a-half-hour assault on the senses, in which the word “shiny” ceases to have meaning. Somehow, Beyoncé has taken a mirrorball and multiplied it by tinsel, then lacquered it in liquid titanium and thrown a post-marathon aluminium foil blanket on it for good measure. The result is a set of outfits – and a wider spectacle – so dangerously gleaming that the many thousand people in this Cardiff stadium really should be watching the third night of the <em>Renaissance</em> world tour through a pinhole projector, as one might view an eclipse. Beyoncé herself occasionally sports shades.</p><p>Roughly a year on from its release, <em>Renaissance</em> has been conspicuous by its relative absence. No videos have been forthcoming. Tonight more than makes up for that. Maximalism is expected in stadiums, and especially from stars like Beyoncé, 20 years into a solo career that has only become more opulent, more emotionally gripping and more overtly political as it has gone on. But this banging, progressive, LGBTQ+-embracing, Afrofuturist extravaganza is a masterclass in refined excess.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/20/beyonce-renaissance-tour-principality-stadium-cardiff-review-a-spangled-supernova-of-joy">Continue reading...</a>

## Depp comes up smelling of roses despite defamation trial’s catalogue of misogyny

<p>The actor who joked about drowning and burning his then wife Amber Heard has been the toast of Cannes and has snagged $20m to hawk perfume</p><p>Johnny Depp seems to be on top of the world. Almost one year after he won a messy defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife, Amber Heard, the actor’s career is going gangbusters. His latest movie, Jeanne du Barry, opened the Cannes Film and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/19/johnny-depp-return-to-cannes-exposes-french-split-over-metoo">received a seven-minute standing ovation</a>. His face is plastered all over Paris billboards advertising the film. And, to top things off, he’s just signed a <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/johnny-depp-dior-biggest-mens-fragrance-deal-1235611017/">record three-year, $20m deal</a> to remain the face of the Dior men’s fragrance Sauvage. To put this deal into context, Robert Pattinson got $12m to serve as a spokesperson for Dior Homme, according to Variety – and most A-listers with fragrance deals reportedly earn about $2m-$4m a year. So Depp is very much the king of cologne.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/20/johnny-depp-sauvage-cannes-misogyny">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Leading art museums are reassessing their works after a Belgian journalist traced how a fascist sympathiser acquired a Jewish dealer’s collection</p><p>In August 1940, Samuel Hartveld and his wife, Clara Meiboom, boarded the SS Exeter ocean liner in Lisbon, bound for New York. Aged 62, Hartveld, a successful Jewish art dealer, left a world behind. The couple had fled their home city of Antwerp not long before the Nazi invasion of Belgium in May 1940, parting with their 23-year-old son, Adelin, who had decided to join the resistance.</p><p>Hartveld also said goodbye to a flourishing gallery in a fine art deco building in the Flemish capital, a rich library and more than 60 paintings. The couple survived the war, but Adelin was killed in January 1942. Hartveld was never reunited with his paintings, which were snapped up at a bargain-basement price by a Nazi sympathiser and today are scattered throughout galleries in north-western Europe, including Tate Britain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/20/fears-looted-nazi-art-may-still-be-hanging-in-belgian-and-british-galleries">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Enraging, bracing and sublime, the 76th edition of the French film festival kicks off with a controversial visit from Johnny Depp and gallops through films from Pedro Almodóvar, Catherine Corsini, Steve McQueen and more</p><p>On the opening night of the Cannes film festival the guests gather for the premiere of <em>Jeanne du Barry</em>, a historical romp. It is the tale of a courtesan (played by the film’s director, Maïwenn) who catches the eye of a libidinous king and thereby flies in the face of propriety and good taste. The palace, we learn, is a place thick with intrigue, byzantine protocols and ridiculous rules that make no discernible sense. “It’s grotesque,” says one character. “No, it’s Versailles,” says another.</p><p>The royal court has its troubles – and so too does Cannes, where the traditional grand unveiling was all but derailed by the arrival of Johnny Depp, a Hollywood star dogged by allegations of domestic abuse whose performance as King Louis XV is his first leading role in a little over three years. Most critics were outraged but the festival was unmoved. Cannes shrugs off cancel culture and tends to lean into a fight. It figures that controversy is good for business and keeps us all on our toes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/cannes-2023-week-one-roundup-from-depp-to-godard-the-chaotic-circus-rolls-on">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It wasn’t just luck that steered the Guardian columnist to Oxford and into a media career ... She reflects on the subtle mechanics of class (and an early encounter with a naked future PM)</p><p>Children know. They breathe it in early, for there’s no unknowing the difference between nannies, cleaners, below-stairs people and the family upstairs. Children are the go-betweens, one foot in each world, and yet they know very well from the earliest age where they belong, where their destiny lies or, to put it crudely, who pays whom. Tiny hands are steeped young in the essence of class and caste. In nursery school, in reception they see the Harry Potter sorting hat at work. They know. And all through school those fine gradations grow clearer, more precise, more consciously knowing, more shaming, more frightening. Good liberal parents teach their children to check their privilege – useful modern phrase – but it swells up like a bubo on the nose. There’s no hiding it.</p><p>I can summon up the childhood shame at class embarrassments. Aged seven like me, Maureen, with her hair pinned sideways in a pink slide, lived in a pebble-dashed council house by the water tower. They were at the other end of Lindsey, more hamlet than village, half a mile down the road from my father’s pink thatched cottage set in the flat prairie lands of Suffolk, where I spent half my time, the other half in London, shuttling between divorced parents. I envied Maureen for what looked to me like a cheerful large family tumbling noisily in and out of their ever-open front door. They never asked me in, so I would hang about the door waiting for Maureen to come out and play.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/20/polly-toynbee-what-my-privileged-start-in-life-taught-me-about-the-british-class-system">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Grand theatre, Leeds; Wigmore Hall, London<br /></strong>Opera North’s latest concert staging goes big on pearls, with commitment to match. And the peerless Takács Quartet give a masterclass in delayed gratification</p><p>Less than a fortnight since the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/07/eno-chief-says-liverpool-and-manchester-strong-contenders-for-new-home">latest edict about English National Opera</a> – the shortlisted destinations for the company’s enforced move out of London are now officially Birmingham, Bristol, Greater Manchester, Liverpool and Nottingham – the crowds spilled across the pavement outside the Grand Theatre in Leeds. Concerns that the north is somehow already opera-saturated have been aired repeatedly amid the grim wranglings of recent months. Greater Manchester and Nottingham are both Opera North turf. What’s more, lest we forget, the company started life as English National Opera North. But the opening night of its new production of Bizet’s <strong><a href="https://www.operanorth.co.uk/whats-on/the-pearl-fishers/">The Pearl Fishers</a></strong> looked very much like business as usual – and good business too, if the mostly packed stalls were anything to go by.</p><p>Directed by Matthew Eberhardt and conducted by Matthew Kofi Waldren, <em>The Pearl Fishers</em> is the latest in Opera North’s decade-long series of <a href="https://www.operanorth.co.uk/explore-opera/what-is-a-concert-staging/">concert staging</a>s.

It has a coarse, sandy, crumbly texture from the semolina, and is held together by a fragrant, floral, sticky syrup. It’s a favourite sweet teatime and festive treat that’s baked at home or bought by the kilo in pastry shops; it’s also enjoyed during <em>iftar</em> in the months of Ramadan. The garden at my pub, <a href="https://www.parkersarms.co.uk/">the Parkers Arms</a>, is flanked by elderflower trees, and our eagerly awaited annual harvest makes the best fragrant cordial for the glaze.

## ‘Our red line is: are they funny?’: free speech comedy clubs and the battle over onstage offence

<p>Graham Linehan and Dapper Laughs walk into a club ... It sounds like the setup to a bad joke, yet platforming comics who may cause offence is a winning formula. But can a night run by a GB News host claim to be anti-establishment?</p><p>It is a blustery evening in early April, and a crowd has gathered in east London’s Bethnal Green to watch a comedy show. They seem like a fairly typical audience: white, but not exclusively so; male, but not overwhelmingly. Slightly older than average, perhaps, but I still spot plenty of young couples, and even a teenager or two.</p><p>But don’t be fooled. This is not your run-of-the-mill comedy night; this is Comedy Unleashed: a rebellion against the “safe, tramline orthodoxy” of the contemporary comedy circuit, according to its website, and a haven for “free-thinking comedians who leave their self-censorship button at the door”. Notably, that includes “cancelled” figures who have faced censure for their comic material or social media posts, among them standup Andrew Lawrence and Father Ted writer Graham Linehan – both on the bill tonight – as well as Daniel O’Reilly (otherwise known as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/11/dapper-laughs-tour-cancelled-itv2" title="">Dapper Laughs</a>), Mary Bourke and Leo Kearse. Comedy Unleashed is also clear about what it won’t tolerate: “nodding along to sermons with wisecracks is out”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/20/comedy-unleashed-joe-rogan-graham-linehan-dapper-laughs-cancelled-comedians">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Sheffield:</strong> I was astonished by the nest they made last year, and I’m still hoping they will come back again</p><p>Our garden is a tiny patch of green in the urban landscape around. Most gardens up and down our street are paved and walled, an uninviting sight for any wildlife. But wildlife does come to us. The thick ivy hedge at the bottom of our garden is home to two feathered visitors every year. The blackbirds, who we have named Steve and Stevetta, arrive in early spring to gorge on fallen crab apples and start nest-building. Using the “wattle and daub” method, they weave grass into a rough bowl and plaster it with mud. It takes around two weeks to build and the result is an unusually solid nest. After a while we hear chirps and cheeping and know that the chicks have hatched. Then the parents are a constant sight, darting in and out of the hedge.</p><p>This year we found an old nest; it astonished me that an animal that’s so small with no hands could make anything so intricate and beautiful. It was plastered with dirty leaves and mud but each piece of grass was carefully tucked in and nothing was random or out of place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/20/young-country-diary-holding-out-for-the-blackbirds-steve-and-stevetta">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As more couples rip up the rulebook, attitudes towards romantic relationships are becoming less clear-cut – and fiction reflects that. Should we be celebrating a new kind of happily ever after?</p><p>In January, I attended my first ever wedding. Later, I mentioned the event in passing at my publisher’s office. “Wait,” someone said. “You wrote a whole book about a wedding before you’d been to one?”</p><p>At that stage I had signed off on the final proofs of my second novel, The Happy Couple. Matrimony structures the plot; the first chapter opens with the couple getting engaged, and we follow them as the ceremony draws near. Why choose this setup when I’d never attended a wedding? Because I thought it would make a good book. To me, marriage is like extreme sports: I’m thrilled for those who partake, and have zero interest in joining them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/20/reader-i-lived-with-him-why-a-happy-ending-doesnt-have-to-mean-marriage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 2021, a mysterious couple sat down for dinner at the Michelin-starred Atrio in rural western Spain. When they left, 45 bottles of wine – including a priceless 1806 vintage – had vanished. Who were these thieves with such impeccable taste? </p><p>Wasn’t it a little odd, thought the night manager, that the woman in room 107 should be peckish so soon after finishing the hotel’s 14-course tasting menu, a paean to the pig featuring tuna belly with red lard, scallops and pig’s trotters, pork jowl pudding with caviar, and Iberian meatballs with cod tripe that had concluded, inevitably, with chocolate and coffee served with aged ham. In the eight years he had spent in the elegant gloom of Atrio, a luxury restaurant and hotel in Cáceres, three hours’ drive south-west of Madrid, the night manager could recall only two similar requests. “People sometimes ask for a herbal tea, or a coffee, or a glass of something,” he would recall in court later. “But asking for something to eat? That was very, very odd.”</p><p>The night manager said he was sorry, but the kitchen was closed. Three times the guest asked if he couldn’t rustle up a little something and three times he politely refused. “But then I thought: ‘This is a five-star hotel, I must serve her.’” The hungry woman accepted his offer of a salad and asked how long it would take. Fifteen minutes, he told her, then he left reception and went to the kitchen. It was 2.10am on Wednesday 27 October 2021.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/20/those-bastards-stole-the-most-special-stuff-the-inside-story-of-a-16m-wine-heist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Standing up against Trump and fighting against air pollution has made Sadiq Khan a target for the far right.

If you had never set eyes on him before you’d guess he was a politician within five seconds. Ten, and you’d have him down as mayor.

It’s the same level of protection the prime minister and the king receive,” says the former Labour MP and current mayor of London.

<p>The bestselling author of Babel and the the Poppy War trilogy on her new satire of the publishing industry and why she won’t write in the same genre twice</p><p>“If I were a debut writer, I wouldn’t have dared to write this book,” Rebecca F Kuang says from her home in Boston. Then again, she wouldn’t have been able to. Her new thriller, Yellowface, could only have been written by an author familiar with the idiosyncrasies of the publishing industry: its petty politics, its bad faith, its best intentions gone hilariously awry. In the novel, which tells the story of a white writer who claims a dead Chinese friend’s manuscript as her own, the industry’s dark side is satirised with delicious cynicism: how authors are questionably packaged and marketed; how bestsellers are often selected in advance and boosted with money long before they hit the shelves; and how marginalised authors and staff are ignored, belittled and underpaid. An Instagram post earlier this year shows the 26-year-old author holding up an early copy of the book, showing its eye-catching lemon yellow cover; it is captioned “in 2023 we get mad spill the beans and don’t care”.</p><p>Kuang first made her name with the Poppy War trilogy, an award-winning fantasy series that explores the idea, as she puts it, “what if Mao had been a teenage girl?” Set in a country resembling medieval-era China, it tells the story of Rin, an ambitious girl from the southern peasantry who enters the nation’s most prestigious military academy. Many events in the trilogy are inspired by 20th-century Chinese history: like her historical counterpart, Rin battles occupiers from a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/30/chinas-war-with-japan-review" title="">neighbouring island in the east</a>; builds a guerrilla peasant insurrection, complete with a long march through the country; and spars with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/something-wrong-something-good-taiwan-grapples-with-remembering-chiang-kai-shek" title="">more established rival</a> backed by western powers. That was followed by the bestseller – and runaway <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/08/babel-the-booktok-sensation-that-melds-dark-academia-with-a-post-colonial-critique" title="">BookTok hit </a>– Babel, which follows a group of language students at Victorian-era Oxford University who get drawn into the first opium war. There’s magic, there’s intrigue, and there’s imperial England, grand, glittering and increasingly troubling to some of the students, who find themselves struggling to simply go to the balls and sip the champagne.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/20/rebecca-f-kuang-who-has-the-right-to-tell-a-story-its-the-wrong-question-to-ask">Continue reading...</a>

<p>La Rochelle’s head coach has built their confidence and a collective strength to defend their title over Irish rivals</p><p>Ronan O’Gara is one of the few people I’m still in touch with from the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour. I got on well with him and I really enjoy chatting to him about his rugby philosophy and how he sees the game. I remember seeing him the day before La Rochelle beat Leinster in last season’s final and it’s easy to say in hindsight but there was a real confidence in him about what his team can achieve. I suspect it’ll be similar this season too.</p><p>I’ve chatted to him sporadically over the last couple of years and I’ve been blown away by his aspirations, what he demands of himself and the things he thinks he can go on to do. I’m not surprised because I think he’s capable but it’s just the clarity and the confidence that he has. When you are the head coach or the leader and you have confidence, which isn’t manufactured but inherently how you feel, then it is so much easier to pass that message on and for it to filter down to your squad.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/20/leinster-need-to-the-find-answer-to-hefty-challenge-of-ronan-o-gara-la-rochelle-big-men-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Farcical thriller Cocaine Bear – about a drugged-up bear on the loose – follows in the knowingly naff footsteps of Snakes on a Plane, Sharknado and more</p><p>There are some films that feel like a mere addendum to their trailer, and <strong>Cocaine Bear</strong> is one: an idea that sounds so good and so funny as a quick synopsis that it’s almost immaterial whether the finished film makes much of it or not. Whether or not you’ve seen Elizabeth Banks’s farcical, nominally fact-based thriller, released in cinemas in February, you’re probably aware of its one-line pitch: there’s a bear, you see, that somehow ingests a massive stash of cocaine and goes on an almighty rampage. Chaos ensues. What more do you want from a film?</p><p>As it happens, <em>Cocaine Bear</em> is a likably ludicrous romp – ideally suited, now that it’s <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/cocaine-bear">available on VOD</a>, to a Friday-night watch on the couch with a takeaway. (Perhaps you thought the premise sounded just too silly to justify a cinema trip.) But it never quite matches the zippy energy and gonzo hilarity of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuWEEKeJLMI">its trailer</a>, and it doesn’t really try. It’s a one-joke film that considers its work done when you’ve been sufficiently amused to sit down and watch it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/streaming-cocaine-bear-and-the-best-so-bad-theyre-good-films">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Newer peptide-based serums assist natural growth, and are much gentler</p><p>This column on lash growth serums was planned for last month, but I had to delay it because a major TikTok craze caused my planned product picks to sell out. Lash growth serums aren’t new. But the way they’re made is changing. Old-school versions mostly use the lipid prostaglandin, which has hormone-like effects. This essentially helps lashes grow for longer, artificially delaying their shedding cycle. Because these hung on to lashes way beyond their natural residency, it was not unusual to end up with the lash equivalent of needing a bloody good haircut. Ends were gnarly, a bit chewed looking, like slept-in falsies after a big night.</p><p>The newer peptide-based serums assist the natural growth process, conditioning lashes and providing silky, strengthened quality for only a fraction less quantity. And they’re much gentler.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/may/20/a-new-breed-of-lash-serums-give-a-boost-on-a-budget">Continue reading...</a>

The typical Hudsonite’s story is: “I was a corporate lawyer in the city for years, and then I moved to Hudson and became a flower farmer/doll maker/antiques dealer/chef/arborist/alcoholic, and I never looked back.” Narrator Greta works as an audio transcriber for a sex therapist who employs new agey methods such as gong baths and calls himself Om; as he tells Greta, “Everything in Hudson is a little on-the-nose.”</p><p>Hudson is also small enough that everyone runs into everyone everywhere, and Greta regularly hears voices she recognises from her transcribing work; on a typical visit to a coffee shop, she will involuntarily peg one customer as the man who is sleeping with his sister-in-law, and another as the guy who describes his penis as “Darth Vader in a turtleneck”. This has dramatic consequences when Greta becomes infatuated with one of the people she’s transcribing, Flavia, a Swiss woman recovering from a brutal assault. Flavia has a voice “like a blade”, a husband unable to give her an orgasm, a silver wolf-dog of unearthly beauty, and the habit of walking him in the same dog park where Greta walks her beloved Jack Russell.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/20/big-swiss-by-jen-beagin-review-fluffy-sex-comedy-with-a-dark-underbelly">Continue reading...</a>

## Poker Face: Natasha Lyonne’s perfect detective show turns up the fun-o-meter until it explodes

<p>A PI who can spot liars a mile away, and a cast clearly having a hoot, inject the classic murder-of-the-week format with wit, charm and irresistible energy</p><p>Whatever happened to fun? We used to have it, didn’t we? Mr Blobby bursting through things, stuff like that. But in recent years, it feels, fun has receded a bit, and we’ve replaced it with other things that don’t hit as hard: overearnestness or mawkishness or choreographed sentimentality. Someone really trembling while they deliver a series-closing monologue about their emotions. You couldn’t have Del Boy falling through a bar these days, could you? That’s because we’re in a fun drought, the dust of it whirling round us like old glitter.</p><p>Thank goodness then for Poker Face, the enormously successful mystery-a-week show that debuted in the US earlier this year and has finally come over to Sky Max (from Friday), and which remembers throughout what fun is. First there is the casting of Natasha Lyonne, who is always fun – her own vibrating beacon of freestanding fun, even – but is especially fun when she just plays the character of Natasha Lyonne, which is exactly what she is doing here. Then there’s that little tweak to the “unlikely detective” trope – Lyonne’s Charlie Cale has the innate ability to sense when someone’s telling a lie (her catchphrase is just “bullshit”, which is – you guessed it) – and uses it to unpuzzle strange murders and bizarre crimes on a run-from-the-mob-boss road trip across the US.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/20/poker-face-natasha-lyonnes-review-sky-max-peacock-rian-johnson">Continue reading...</a>

## The Little Mermaid’s Halle Bailey: ‘As a child, seeing a black Ariel would have changed my life’

<p>From tween YouTube sensation, to pop star, to Beyoncé’s tour mate … now the actor and musician is about to star in the live-action remake of the Disney classic. She talks about overcoming self-doubt, her soulmate sister Chlöe, and a racist backlash</p><p></p><p>Inside Halle Bailey’s apartment, in West Hollywood, the 23-year-old singer and actor is glowing in the early morning sunlight. This is not interview hyperbole: she really looks as though she is glowing. Rob Marshall, the director of The Little Mermaid, said he cast her as Ariel because she had an “otherworldly sensibility”, and, instantly, you can see what he means. Yesterday, an important package arrived. It contains a collection of Disney merchandise: branded water bottles, shirts, Ariel dolls. This stuff, with her face on it, will soon to be in the homes of countless parents with small children all across the world. “I was <em>astounded</em> at how cool all of it is,” she says, sweetly. “Like, insane.”</p><p>Bailey is a Disney star cut from old-fashioned cloth. She is impossibly polite, awestruck by her new life as a Disney princess, ignoring the negativity – more on that later – and seemingly utterly lovely and unflappable, or at least well media-trained, or probably both. She offers opinions, but is careful to balance them out: she misses her home town of Atlanta, Georgia she says, but, equally, she loves Los Angeles. Somehow, despite the imminent release of a reported $150m-200m blockbuster that will ultimately rise or fall on her performance as a character already beloved by millions, she is perfectly calm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/halle-bailey-the-little-mermaid-interview-as-a-child-seeing-a-black-ariel-would-have-changed-my-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>George HW Bush was the most sportsmanlike modern president but Gerald Ford was the best athlete, author says</p><p>From The Big Lebowski to Alice on The Brady Bunch, depictions of bowling abound in American pop culture. The sport’s real-life adherents included Richard Nixon, who installed bowling lanes in the White House and was known to play between seven to 12 games late at night. Characteristically, he played alone. This is one of many athletic accounts from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in a new book, Power Players: Sports, Politics, and the American Presidency, by the longtime political journalist Chris Cillizza.</p><p>Bowling solo personified “Nixon the loner”, Cillizza says. “He didn’t play tennis or golf with friends. He did enjoy bowling by himself.

<p>How to transform a batch of old apples into a tasty apple-pie-spiced spread</p><p>When I was growing up as a vegetarian teenager, I discovered my love of whole foods from healthfood shops which, back in the 1970s usually had a wonderfully complex aroma of spices, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Shelves lined the walls from floor to ceiling, all full of ingredients from the mainstream to the obscure. One product I came across back then was apple butter, a creamy, apple jam with a wonderful texture that I presume was the result of the natural pectin in the apples. It is a rare find these days, but fortunately it’s very easy to make, and stores well, too, preserving floury, past-their-best apples for a rainy day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/20/how-to-turn-old-floury-apples-into-a-glorious-spiced-fruit-butter-recipe-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>
