Many home buyers can no longer afford their mortgages, and more and more people are defaulting on their monthly payments. This trend is growing. But, we have noted that the \"Lehman moment\" hasn't happened in China. Why is that? In 2008, a wave of defaulted mortgages in the United States triggered a financial tsunami. Yet, in China, we haven\u2019t seen any large-scale bank failure. It seems to be a good thing on the surface. But if one looks deeper, one will feel sorry for the Chinese people. They have borne the heavy burden of decades of government mistakes and the huge risks the state is facing. And many, many Chinese have been driven to their breaking point.\n\nHave questions?
