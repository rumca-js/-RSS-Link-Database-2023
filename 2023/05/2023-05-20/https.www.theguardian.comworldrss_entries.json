It was meant to be held this week in Sydney, but US president <strong>Joe</strong> <strong>Biden</strong> cancelled because of domestic issues \u2013 the Republicans are not making it easy for the government debt ceiling to increase and that is a pretty big deal. So after the G7, Biden will be on his way back to the US.</p><p>But with Japanese prime minister <strong>Kishida</strong> <strong>Fumio</strong> hosting the G7, with Indian prime minister <strong>Narendra</strong> <strong>Modi</strong>, Biden and <strong>Anthony</strong> <strong>Albanese</strong> attending (Australia was invited despite not being in the G7) the sidelines of the G7 set up the perfect opportunity to have the meeting and keep the Quad kicking along.</p><p>I will never forget the very warm and generous welcome that I had after my election. I can\u2019t think of any better way to begin a prime ministership than a gathering of such important friends from our region. One year on I\u2019m absolutely delighted to be amongst close friends again here in Japan to continue our important work. Standing together for an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.</p><p>A region where sovereignty is respected, and all countries large and small benefit from a regional balance that keeps the peace. Respect for the leadership of regional institutions including ASEAN, the Pacific Island Forum, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association is central to our approach.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/may/21/anthony-albanese-g7-japan-quad-meeting-voice-information-program-labor-election-anniversary\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/may/21/anthony-albanese-g7-japan-quad-meeting-voice-information-program-labor-election-anniversary", "date_published": "2023-05-20 22:52:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "title": "New York Christian university fires two staff for including pronouns in emails \u2013 reports", "description": "<p>Former employees at Houghton University say administrators claimed pronouns in signatures violated new school policy</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> Christian university terminated two employees for putting pronouns in their respective email signatures, these former workers allege, according to reports.</p><p>Raegan Zelaya and Shua Wilmot, who were residence hall directors at Houghton University, said that administrators told them to take the words \u201cshe/her\u201d and \u201che/him\u201d off of their email signatures.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/20/new-york-christian-university-staff-fired-pronouns\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/20/new-york-christian-university-staff-fired-pronouns", "date_published": "2023-05-20 20:04:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "title": "NSW police footage shows officers used two sets of handcuffs on 81-year-old woman with dementia", "description": "<p>Exclusive: footage from body-worn camera shows police restraining confused dementia patient Rachel Grahame in 2020</p><ul><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p>Six police officers used two sets of handcuffs on a distressed and frail 81-year-old woman with dementia after she took a lanyard from a staff member at her Sydney nursing home.</p><p>Body-worn camera footage shows Rachel Grahame, who has advanced dementia and weighs just 45kg, howling in distress as a team of police surround and handcuff her late at night at St Basil\u2019s aged care home in Randwick on 31 October 2020.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\">email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/21/nsw-police-footage-shows-officers-used-two-sets-of-handcuffs-on-81-year-old-woman-with-dementia\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/21/nsw-police-footage-shows-officers-used-two-sets-of-handcuffs-on-81-year-old-woman-with-dementia", "date_published": "2023-05-20 20:00:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "title": "US rapper Post Malone helps Scottish musician fund downpayment for house", "description": "<p>Local musician Gregor Hunter Coleman was playing in Glasgow pub when star made \u2018life-changing\u2019 offer</p><p>The US rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/post-malone\">Post Malone</a> helped a Scottish musician fund the downpayment for his first home, according to reports.</p><p>The Sunflower crooner\u2019s viral, widely reported act of kindness unfolded at a pub in Glasgow, Scotland, named Wunderbar last week.
