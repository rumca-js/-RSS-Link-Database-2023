<p>A software update Hewlett-Packard released earlier this month for its OfficeJet printers is causing some of those devices to become unusable. Since about the second week of May, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2gzMDQzNC53d3czLmhwLmNvbS90NS9QcmludGluZy1FcnJvcnMtb3ItTGlnaHRzLVN0dWNrLVByaW50LUpvYnMvYmx1ZS1zY3JlZW4tZXJyb3ItY29kZS04M0MwMDAwQi90ZC1wLzg2ODQwNDQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjI2YTg5ODRmLWVmODAtNDg2YS1iOTQ5LTdiMTE1YjhiZTcyMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAV3Ngs6B44bl19XPCX7YrbC81WjQU9Izest25uI-6r6N&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fh30434.www3.hp.com%2Ft5%2FPrinting-Errors-or-Lights-Stuck-Print-Jobs%2Fblue-screen-error-code-83C0000B%2Ftd-p%2F8684044"><ins>HP support forums</ins></a> have been rife with complaints of OfficeJet printers bricking after they automatically installed the company’s most recent firmware update.</p><p>After downloading the faulty software, the built-in touchscreen on an affected printer will display a blue screen with the error code 83C0000B. Unfortunately, there appears to be no way for someone to fix a printer broken in this way on their own, partly because factory resetting an HP OfficeJet requires interacting with the printer’s touchscreen display. For the moment, HP customers report the only solution to the problem is to send a broken printer back to the company for service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Among the affected printers are OfficeJet 902x models, including the Pro 9022e, Pro 9025e, Pro 9020e All-in-One and Pro 9025e All-in-One variants. If you own an OfficeJet printer, for the time being, your best bet is to disconnect your printer from the internet so that it doesn’t automatically download the buggy update.</p><p>On Saturday, HP acknowledged the issue and told <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/hp-rushes-to-fix-bricked-printers-after-faulty-firmware-update/"><em><ins>Bleeping Computer</ins></em></a> it was working on a fix. “Our teams are working diligently to address the blue screen error affecting a limited number of HP OfficeJet Pro 9020e printers,” the company said. “We are recommending customers experiencing the error to contact our customer support team for assistance: <a href="https://support.hp.com/"><ins>https://support.hp.com</ins></a>.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time one of HP’s recent software updates has created a headache for its customers.

## Western Digital promises to release firmware update for failing SanDisk Extreme SSDs

<p>Western Digital says it will release a firmware update to address a reliability issue with its SanDisk Extreme and Extreme Pro SSDs. Over the past few months, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datarecovery/comments/106s7n3/sandisk_extreme_pro_external_4tb_ssd_failing_to/"><ins>Reddit</ins></a>, the <a href="https://forums.sandisk.com/c/portable-ssd/extreme-portable-ssd/235"><ins>SanDisk forums</ins></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vjeranpavic/status/1646224103173681154?s=20"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> have been littered with people complaining of their recently purchased 4TB and 2TB Extreme V2 and Extreme Pro V2 portable drives suddenly erasing the data they had on them and, in some cases, becoming unreadable. The issue is seemingly limited to drives manufactured since the end of 2022 and appears to affect 4TB models primarily.</p><div id="a877931f586b46a79da38b005d89d6f2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Do not buy these SanDisk drives. They've been faulty for months and they're trying to clear inventory with steep discounts <a href="https://t.co/Rax0FNOhod">https://t.co/Rax0FNOhod</a></p>— V (@vjeranpavic) <a href="https://twitter.com/vjeranpavic/status/1646224103173681154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>On Friday, Western Digital shared its first public statement on the issue since it was discovered months ago, telling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/sandisk-extreme-ssds-keep-abruptly-failing-firmware-fix-for-only-some-promised/"><em><ins>ArsTechnica</ins></em></a> it had a software update ready for 4TB Extreme and Extreme Pro variants. “Western Digital is aware of reports indicating some customers have experienced an issue with 4TB SanDisk Extreme and/or Extreme Pro portable SSDs (SDSSDE61-4T00 and SDSSDE81-4T00 respectively),” the company said. “We have resolved the issue and will publish a firmware update to our website soon. Customers with questions or who are experiencing issues should contact our Customer Support team for assistance.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Western Digital did not say when the update would arrive, nor if it was also working on a fix for 2TB models. According to <em>ArsTechnica</em>, the company did not answer questions if it would offer refunds to customers who lost their data after one of their Extreme or Extreme Pro SSDs failed. Western Digital did not immediately respond to Engadget’s request for comment and more information. If you own a SanDisk Extreme or Extreme Pro SSD you bought before the end of 2022, chances are your drive is fine, and you don’t need to worry about it abruptly failing. Still, Western Digital’s slow response is disappointing, especially since SanDisk drives are generally known for their reliability.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/western-digital-promises-to-release-firmware-update-for-failing-sandisk-extreme-ssds-211924180.html?src=rss

## iMessage Contact Key Verification could arrive with iOS 16.6

<p>At the end of last year, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-advanced-data-protection-imessage-contact-key-183819737.html"><ins>announced iMessage Contact Key Verification</ins></a>, a tool the company said would allow those who face “extraordinary digital threats” to safeguard their conversations from malicious actors. At the time, the company promised the safety feature would arrive sometime in 2023.

A new option within the Settings app indicates Apple is working on the tool, but, for the time being, enabling Contact Key Verification doesn’t appear to activate the feature. <em>MacRumors</em> speculates that could be because the company has yet to fully implement iMessage Contact Key Verification.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once it arrives, iMessage Contact Key Verification will, provided everyone in an iMessage conversation has the feature enabled, send an automatic alert when Apple detects someone has added a rogue device to an account. The company envisions the feature protecting activists, government officials and journalists from state-sponsored hackers. It’s one of the last features Apple is expected to add to iOS 16 before the company shifts its full attention to iOS 17.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/imessage-contact-key-verification-could-arrive-with-ios-166-194345936.html?src=rss

Of those, it rejected 1,679,694. Surprisingly, the majority of submissions, more than 1 million, didn’t make it to the App Store for failing to comply with Apple’s performance guidelines.

## DoorDash faces lawsuit accusing it of charging iPhone users more for delivery

<p>DoorDash has been charging iPhone users more than Android users for identical deliveries, according to a lawsuit seeking class action status. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cc8a75f0-b695-4a6a-a33c-41019f4bfaa4&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Scribd&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYzhhNzVmMC1iNjk1LTRhNmEtYTMzYy00MTAxOWY0YmZhYTQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2NyaWJkLmNvbS9kb2N1bWVudC82NDY3MzA0NjAvRG9vckRhc2gtbGF3c3VpdCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDRjOTBkNDktMzcxNC00NGY3LTllM2YtYWYzNmI1Yzc4NmY1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWpDKIun-ThHWUmRHEbZovX-nYWdnhU03zkJTf14ww9i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F646730460%2FDoorDash-lawsuit">court documents</a> (PDF, via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/19/doordash-charges-iphone-users-more-than-android-users-lawsuit-alleges/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>) submitted for the case included screenshots showing how iPhone users are charged an extra fee for "expanded range." On the <a href="https://help.doordash.com/consumers/s/article/What-fees-do-I-pay?language=en_US">company's website</a>, it said the fee "helps DoorDash preserve [customers'] access to the available merchants farthest from [them]." However, the lawsuit said the fee is tacked onto iPhone users' bills more often than Android users' "likely because studies reveal iPhone users earn more."</p><p>In addition, it accuses DoorDash of adding the extended range fee onto the total of DashPass subscribers as a way "to subsidize lost revenues from discounted fees." DashPass is the company's $10-a-month subscription service that delivers orders over $12 for free. A couple of screenshots in the court documents show the extended range fee only being added to the account with DashPass and not to the one without, even though they were identical orders made for the same address.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>"DoorDash uses this deceptive practice to trick consumers into believing Dashers receive the 'delivery-related' fees when, in reality, each and every 'delivery fee' is retained in total by DoorDash," the lawsuit states. Other screenshots also showed orders made from iPhones having bigger base delivery fees than orders submitted from Android devices.&nbsp;</p><p>The lawsuit, filed by Ross Hecox and his minor children in the United States District Court of Maryland, is asking for monetary damages of no less than $1 billion "for all consumers who fell prey to DoorDash's illegal pricing scheme over the past four years."</p><p>A DoorDash spokesperson denied the allegations and told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lawsuit-iphone-users-pay-more-doordash-orders-than-android-users-2023-5"><em>Insider</em></a> in a statement:</p><p>"The claims put forward in the amended complaint are baseless and simply without merit. We ensure fees are disclosed throughout the customer experience, including on each restaurant storepage and before checkout. Building this trust is essential, and it's why the majority of delivery orders on our platform are placed by return customers. We will continue to strive to make our platform work even better for customers, and will vigorously fight these allegations."</p><p>This isn't the first time the delivery service's business practices have been called into question. In 2020, the company, along with GrubHub, Postmates and Uber Eats, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-food-delivery-laws-idUSKCN21V2C1">were sued</a> for exploiting their dominant position in restaurant deliveries to impose fees on users even during the pandemic. Chicago <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chicago-sues-doordash-grubhub-210424254.html">sued the company</a> for advertising delivery services from restaurants that never consented to be added to its platform. The attorney general for the District of Columbia also filed a lawsuit against DoorDash, accusing it of using tips to cover part of drivers' base pay instead of adding it on top of what they're supposed to get. DoorDash <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-settle-dc-lawsuit-045945934.html">agreed to pay $2.5 million</a> to settle that lawsuit with Washington, DC.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/doordash-faces-lawsuit-accusing-it-of-charging-iphone-users-more-for-delivery-140017302.html?src=rss

## The tech industry's accessibility-related products and launches this week

<p>Every third Thursday of May, the world commemorates Global Accessibility Awareness Day or GAAD. And as has become customary in the last few years, major tech companies are taking this week as a chance to share their latest accessibility-minded products. From Apple and Google to Webex and Adobe, the industry’s biggest players have launched new features to make their products easier to use. Here’s a quick roundup of this week’s GAAD news.</p><h3>Apple's launches and updates</h3><p>First up: Apple. The company actually had a huge set of updates to share, which makes sense since it typically releases most of its accessibility-centric news at this time each year. For 2023, Apple is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-assistive-access-simplifies-ios-16-for-people-with-cognitive-disabilities-120012723.html">introducing Assistive Access</a>, which is an accessibility setting that, when turned on, changes the home screen for iPhone and iPad to a layout with fewer distractions and icons. You can choose from a row-based or grid-based layout, and the latter would result in a 2x3 arrangement of large icons. You can decide what these are, and most of Apple’s first-party apps can be used here.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The icons themselves are larger than usual, featuring high contrast labels making them more readable. When you tap into an app, a back button appears at the bottom for easier navigation. Assistive Access also includes a new Calls app that combines Phone and FaceTime features into one customized experience. Messages, Camera, Photos and Music have also been tweaked for the simpler interface and they all feature high contrast buttons, large text labels and tools that, according to Apple, "help trusted supporters tailor the experience for the individual they're supporting." The goal is to offer a less-distracting or confusing system to those who may find the typical iOS interface overwhelming.</p><div id="014635e20eca471ab78bb7f8065613d8"></div><p>Apple also launched Live Speech this week, which works on iPhone, iPad and Mac. It will allow users to type what they want to say and have the device read it aloud. It not only works for in-person conversations, but for Phone and FaceTime calls as well. You'll also be able to create shortcuts for phrases you frequently use, like "Hi, can I get a tall vanilla latte?" or "Excuse me, where is the bathroom?" The company also introduced Personal Voice, which lets you create a digital voice that sounds like yours. This could be helpful for those at risk of losing their ability to speak due to conditions that could impact their voice. The setup process includes "reading alongside randomized text prompts for about 15 minutes on iPhone or iPad."</p><p>For those with visual impairments, Apple is adding a new Point and Speak feature to the detection mode in Magnifier. This will use an iPhone or iPad's camera, LiDAR scanner and on-device machine learning to understand where a person has positioned their finger and scan the target area for words, before reading them out for the user. For instance, if you hold up your phone and point at different parts on a microwave or washing machine's controls, the system will say what the labels are — like "Add 30 seconds," "Defrost" or "Start."</p><p>The company made a slew of other smaller announcements this week, including updates that allow Macs to pair directly with Made-for-iPhone hearing devices, as well as phonetic suggestions for text editing in voice typing.</p><h3>Google's new accessibility tools</h3><p>Meanwhile, Google is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-can-now-answer-your-questions-about-uncaptioned-images-153852833.html">introducing a new Visual Question and Answer (or VQA)</a> tool in the Lookout app, which uses AI to answer follow-up questions about images. The company's accessibility lead and senior director of Products For All Eve Andersson told Engadget in an interview that VQA is the result of a collaboration between the inclusion and DeepMind teams.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Google Lookout image question and answer using AI" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/2559f640-f58d-11ed-bbfd-cc871a1750e9" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>To use VQA, you'll open Lookout and start the Images mode to scan a picture. After the app tells you what's in the scene, you can ask follow-ups to glean more detail. For example, if Lookout said the image depicts a family having a picnic, you can ask what time of day it is or whether there are trees around them. This lets the user determine how much information they want from a picture, instead of being constrained to an initial description.&nbsp;</p><p>Often, it is tricky to figure out how much detail to include in an image description, since you want to provide enough to be helpful but not so much that you overwhelm the user. For example, "What’s the right amount of detail to give to our users in Lookout?" Andersson said.  "You never actually know what they want." Andersson added that AI can help determine the context of why someone is asking for a description or more information and deliver the appropriate info.&nbsp;</p><p>When it launches in the fall, VQA can present a way for the user to decide when to ask for more and when they've learned enough. Of course, since it's powered by AI, the generated data might not be accurate, so there's no guarantee this tool works perfectly, but it's an interesting approach that puts power in users' hands.&nbsp;</p><p>Google is also expanding Live Captions to work in French, Italian and German later this year, as well as bringing the wheelchair-friendly labels for places in Maps to more people around the world.&nbsp;</p><h3>Microsoft, Samsung, Adobe and more</h3><p>Plenty more companies had news to share this week, including Adobe, which is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobes-new-ai-automates-pdf-accessibility-tags-130019203.html">rolling out a feature that uses AI to automate the process of generating tags for PDFs</a> that would make them friendlier for screen readers. This uses Adobe's Sensei AI, and will also indicate the correct reading order. Since this could really speed up the process of tagging PDFs, people and organizations could potentially use the tool to go through stockpiles of old documents to make them more accessible. Adobe is also launching a PDF Accessibility Checker to "enable large organizations to quickly and efficiently evaluate the accessibility of existing PDFs at scale."&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft also had some small updates to share, specifically around Xbox. It's added new accessibility settings to the Xbox app on PC, including options to disable background images and disable animations, so users can reduce potentially disruptive, confusing or triggering components. The company also expanded its  support pages and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-xbox-web-store-now-includes-accessibility-filters-160002677.html">added accessibility filters to its web store</a> to make it easier to find optimized games.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-updates-its-galaxy-buds-2-pro-with-enhanced-ambient-sound-controls-130029355.html">announced this week</a> that it's adding two new levels of ambient sound settings to the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, which brings the total number of options to five. This would let those who use the earbuds to listen to their environment get greater control over how loud they want the sounds to be. They'll also be able to select different settings for individual ears, as well as choose the levels of clarity and create customized profiles for their hearing.</p><p>We also learned that Cisco, the company behind the Webex video conferencing software, is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/webex-meetings-will-use-ai-tools-to-help-speech-impaired-users-communicate-120047102.html">teaming up with speech recognition company VoiceITT</a> to add transcriptions that better support people with non-standard speech. This builds on Webex's existing live translation feature, and uses VoiceITT's AI to familiarize itself with a person's speech patterns to better understand what they want to communicate. Then, it'll establish and transcribe what is said, and the captions will appear in a chat bar during calls.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we also saw Mozilla <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-browser-just-got-even-202528503.html">announce that Firefox 113 would be more accessible</a> by enhancing the screen reader experience, while Netflix revealed a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj00blVwekhQbHh4SSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWE1OGE3MjktNTExNi00YjgxLWI0OWEtZTU4Y2Q4ZTE4MDM1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWnwci_TWIHOLFABGGtjQgtoyX-tPBlruuGws79zlVk7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4nUpzHPlxxI">sizzle reel showcasing some of its latest assistive features</a> and developments over the past year. In <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/continuing-our-work-on-accessibility">its announcement</a>, Netflix said that while it has "made strides in accessibility, [it knows] there is always more work to be done."</p><p>That sentiment is true not just for Netflix, nor the tech industry alone, but also for the entire world. While it's nice to see so many companies take the opportunity this week to release and highlight accessibility-minded features, it's important to remember that inclusive design should not and cannot be a once-a-year effort. I was also glad to see that despite the current fervor around generative AI, most companies did not appear to stuff the buzzword into every assistive feature or announcement this week for no good reason. For example, Andersson said "we're typically thinking about user needs" and adopting a problem-first approach as opposed to focusing on determining where a type of technology can be applied to a solution.</p><p>While it's probably at least partially true that announcements around GAAD are a bit of a PR and marketing game, ultimately some of the tools launched today can actually improve the lives of people with disabilities or different needs. I call that a net win.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-tech-industrys-accessibility-related-products-and-launches-this-week-130022115.html?src=rss

## San Francisco is reportedly investigating Twitter over possible building code violations

<p>San Francisco authorities have opened a new investigation into Twitter after six former senior employees filed a lawsuit against the company, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-hotel-lawsuit-san-francisco-5feff6a002e077b106db32e102f3bc9a"><em>AP</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/s-f-opening-new-twitter-investigation-ex-workers-18107633.php"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></a>. The plaintiffs are accusing the company of breaking local and federal laws and of violating building codes in its effort to turn some of the rooms in its headquarters into bedrooms for employees.&nbsp;</p><p>The city's authorities first launched an investigation into the company in December 2022 following a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2022/12/05/elon-musk-twitter-bedrooms/?sh=5a73f80dd791"><em>Forbes</em></a> report that it converted some its conference rooms so its staff would have somewhere to rest. If you'll recall, Elon Musk asked remaining employees after a series of mass layoffs to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-hardcore-twitter-ultimatum-111506466.html">commit to an &quot;extremely hardcore&quot;</a> Twitter that expects them to work &quot;long hours at high intensity.&quot; The employees were reportedly given no context about the bedrooms. But one could come to the conclusion, based on his ultimatum, that Musk expected employees to work very long hours that they'd need somewhere to rest in or sleep in overnight.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is Joseph Killian, the former lead project manager of global design and construction at Twitter. He said Musk's team instructed him to violate building codes, including removing motion-sensitive lights because they were bother the staff trying to sleep. The company's landlord apparently rejected the request, but he still had to hire an electrician to disconnect the lights without permission.&nbsp;</p><p>Killian also said that he was told to install cheaper locks for the sleeping quarters that don't automatically unlock in case of emergency, even though he warned the team that they'd prevent first responders from accessing the rooms. He reportedly quit that day, though somebody else installed the locks afterward. In addition, Killian accused the company of telling him not to divulge those planned changes to city inspectors visiting Twitter HQ. The inspectors only saw the beds and new furniture and had no idea about the violations, the lawsuit stated.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from Killian's complaints, the lawsuit also accuses Twitter of not paying their promised severance. The new leadership under Musk, it said, &quot;deliberately, specifically, and repeatedly announced their intentions to breach contracts, violate laws, and otherwise ignore their legal obligations.&quot; Regarding Twitter not paying rent, for instance, Musk adviser Pablo Mendoza allegedly told former Twitter real estate division lead Tracy Hawkins: &quot;Elon told me he would only pay rent over his dead body.&quot; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-accuses-microsoft-of-violating-its-data-use-policy-052356286.html">Alex Spiro</a>, Musk's personal attorney, also allegedly and &quot;loudly opined that it was unreasonable for Twitter’s landlords to expect Twitter to pay rent, since San Francisco was a s—hole.&quot; The California Property Trust, which owns the building where Twitter's HQ is located, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-sued-for-not-paying-san-francisco-office-rent-165530970.html">sued the company</a> for failing to pay $136,250 in rent back in January.&nbsp;</p><p>San Francisco previously <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-to-twitter-fix-your-building-permit-within-17754741.php">gave Twitter 15 days</a> to fix its building permit to be able to keep their beds after <em>Forbes</em>' report came out, but the <em>Chronicle</em> says permits haven't been granted yet. This new investigation is reportedly being conducted by the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection, though it has yet to issue an official statement. As for Twitter, the company hasn't had a communications team in a while.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/san-francisco-is-reportedly-investigating-twitter-over-possible-building-code-violations-113721801.html?src=rss

## AT&T opposes the Starlink and T-Mobile satellite-to-phone service plan

<p>AT&amp;T doesn't think that the satellite-to-phone service T-Mobile and SpaceX's Starlink are planning should be approved as it is, and it has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/att-tries-to-block-starlink-t-mobile-plan-for-satellite-to-phone-service/">informed the FCC</a> of its opinion in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-23-338A1.pdf">filing</a> (PDF). As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-19/spacex-t-mobile-plan-for-satellite-phone-calls-draws-at-t-flak?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> notes, the carrier has raised concerns that the companies' service, in its current proposed state, could interfere with existing wireless services. &quot;[I]t is paramount that operations do not jeopardize or inhibit the delivery of terrestrial wireless services,&quot; AT&amp;T wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>In August last year, T-Mobile and SpaceX <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-starlink-partnership-012539605.html">announced</a> a collaboration that would allow the carrier's subscribers to connect to Starlink's second-gen satellites for coverage even if they're in the most remote locations. The companies are gearing up to begin testing this year, and the FCC started <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-23-338A1.pdf">seeking comments</a> (PDF) in April on their request to establish supplemental coverage from space (SCS). AT&amp;T's filing is a response to that call.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The carrier wrote that FCC's rules &quot;do not permit SpaceX’s proposed use of T-Mobile’s terrestrial spectrum&quot; and that the companies &quot;fail to even request — much less justify — rule waivers that would be necessary to authorize their proposed SCS authorizations.&quot; It added: &quot;More broadly, the Applicants' technical showings are woefully insufficient regarding the risk of harmful interference posed by their planned SCS deployments. SpaceX and T-Mobile’s applications fall far short of meeting the threshold for waiver and cannot be granted in their current state.&quot;</p><p>AT&amp;T has plans for a satellite service of its own in partnership with communications specialist AST SpaceMobile. The companies successfully <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-completes-the-first-space-based-voice-call-using-a-standard-smartphone-120012437.html">conducted</a> the first two-way satellite audio call on AT&amp;T's network in Texas to a Rakuten number in Japan on a Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphone in April. The carrier assured in its filing that consistent with its comments, &quot;AT&amp;T and AST intend to provide the demonstrations necessary to show that they will not cause interference to any authorized terrestrial system.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/att-opposes-the-starlink-and-t-mobile-satellite-to-phone-service-plan-090021432.html?src=rss
