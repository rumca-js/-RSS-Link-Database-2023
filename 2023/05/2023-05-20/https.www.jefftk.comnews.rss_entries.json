[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Running Sound for Yourself", "description": "<p><span>\n\nThe way sound amplification normally works at a contra dance these\ndays is that the dance series arranges to have sound equipment and\nsomeone to set it up and adjust levels.  Sometimes, though, you're\nplaying for an event where the band is bringing and running sound, and\nthere's no one to do levels.  Setting up sound yourself when you're\nalso playing isn't that bad, it's just more hassle, but how do you\nset levels when you're playing?\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nIdeally you don't.  Often if you ask the organizer they can find\nsomeone with a decent ear to help you get things balanced in the hall.\nWhile this is a bit risky (maybe the person they pick has strange\njudgement or wants to play with EQ settings) this has generally worked\nout better for me than not having it.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf you're in a larger band, one option that can work is taking turns\nhaving musicians go out into the hall and set levels.  For example, in\nthe <a href=\"https://www.freeraisins.com/\">Free Raisins</a> (fiddle,\nmandolin, piano) when we ran our own sound we'd start the first set\nwith just fiddle+piano, with the mandolin player (me!) in the hall\nchecking fiddle-vs-piano and caller-vs-band, plus getting the caller\nEQ dialed in.  When that was sounding good I'd get back on stage and the\nfiddle player (<a href=\"http://www.audreyknuth.com/\">Audrey</a>) would\ngo out and set the mandolin level with the piano as reference.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn a duo, though, what do you do?  One option is for the fiddle player\nto use a wireless electric violin, which lets them go out into the\nhall and hear exactly how it all sounds together.  This seems ideal,\nbut <a href=\"https://thinkns.com/artists/ns-design-artist-edward-howe/\">Ed\nHowe</a> is the only person I've seen do that.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhat I do instead is set up the board where I can reach it from where\nI'm sitting.  Then I take the main speaker farthest from me and rotate\nit on its speaker pole until it's pointed at me.  With all the other\nspeakers (monitors and the other main) off I set levels, but I do this\nvery differently from usual.  Normally my approach is:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Set a rough input gain for each instrument by eye, using the input\ntrims and the pre-fader-listen LEDs\n</li>\n<li>Turn up instruments in the monitor as needed until everyone is\nhappy.\n</li>\n<li>Turn up instruments in the mains until it sounds right\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThat doesn't work well when running sound while playing, so instead I:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Set each instrument's mains levels to 50%\n</li>\n<li>Set each instrument's monitor levels to 50%, with the monitor\nmaster all the way down\n</li>\n<li>Set input gains for instruments by ear, based on how they sound in\nthe single main speaker\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWhen running our own sound I need the monitor levels to be an accurate\nguide to the mains levels: if something sounds wrong in the monitor,\nit probably sounds wrong in the mains too.  I will adjust mains or\nmonitors separately during the gig, but each time I do it I think hard\nabout whether there's a good reason why they shouldn't be moving\ntogether (ex: a loud instrument on stage doesn't need to be in the\nmonitors as much).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis is not perfect, and works better if the musician running sound\nplays entirely electric or electronic instruments (I have a hard time\nsetting the level for my <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/playing-with-a-talk-box\">talkbox</a>, and I think it was\nslightly too loud at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02hQNBcdV5xZEFcygya3AkhRRQuxv4KVS28Fpn45ZYeYpJ7jP7Avo4tu6fKK2eMb5ol\">Porchfest</a>).\nEven if you don't have someone in the hall setting levels for you, if\nthere's someone who can signal if you're way off that's helpful.\n\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/running-sound-for-yourself", "date_published": "2023-05-20 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
