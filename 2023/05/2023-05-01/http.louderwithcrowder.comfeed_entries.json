First, Kiss's Paul Stanley came out with a common sense statement <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/paul-stanley-kiss-twitter-statement\" target=\"_blank\">about the dangerous fad of adults letting children choose their own pronouns and chop their genitals off</a>. Now, Stanley has backup. Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider has his back!</p><p>Three things you should know. One, Dee Snider is responsible for the mantra that got me through junior high and high school, \"if it's not metal, it's crap.\" Two, \"The Price\" is a highly underrated song. Three, Snider is NOT on our side politically in the slightest. He's anti-MAGA using his hit \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" and pro-gun-control zealots using it.</p><p>It's possible the only issue he agrees with the right on is that maaaaaaaaybe trans activism has been allowed to go too far.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">You know what?

There was a point in American history when dudes would dress like girls and still manage to bag an above-average amount of chicks. The 80s were a strange time.</p><p>Here's the Paul Stanley statement Snider agrees with:</p><blockquote>Normalizing it as some sort of natural alternative or believing that because a little boy likes to play dress up in his sister\u2019s clothes or a girl in her brother\u2019s, we should lead them steps further down a path that\u2019s far from the innocence of what they are doing. With many children who have no real sense of sexuality or sexual experiences caught up in the \u2018fun\u2019 of using pronouns and saying what they identify as, some adults mistakenly confuse teaching acceptance with normalizing and encouraging a situation that has been a struggle for those truly affected and have turned it into a sad and dangerous fad.</blockquote><p>In a world where finding common ground was a thing, or a world where there even was any common ground to find, a statement like this would be it. Let adults do what's right for adults. Leave kids alone. Cutting off your genitals should be treated at least on the same level as getting your driver's license or buying a pack of cigarettes.</p><p>Welcome to 2023. Where it's newsworthy that two metalheads were brave enough to say out loud they believe letting a preteen get life-altering, irreversible surgery might be ill-advised.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

On the <em>Brotherly Love</em> podcast he does with brothers and fellow actors Joey (whoa) and Andrew, the <em>Boy Meets World</em> star talked about a role he lost and getting dropped by his agent over it.</p><p>It was because he wouldn't let himself get sexed up by the director.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Former child star Matthew Lawrence says a Marvel Studios director propositioned him for sex in exchange for a role in the MCU. <br /><br />Lawrence declined, and was then fired by his agency. <a href=\"https://t.co/tI81BS5UD8\">pic.twitter.com/tI81BS5UD8</a><br />\u2014 Dataracer (@Dataracer117) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dataracer117/status/1652512218133721088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>I've lost my agency because I went to the hotel room -- which I can't believe they would send me to -- of a very prominent Oscar award-winning director, who showed up in his robe, asked me to take my clothes off and said he needed to take Polaroids of me and then if I did X, Y and Z I would be the next Marvel character.</blockquote><p>It's weird. In 2000, a coworker had told me a story about his uncle who worked as an engineer in a recording studio. And how a now legendary rock star only got his record deal because of sucking someone's d*ck. I called bullshit. There was no way that could be true. There was no way it could be kept a secret. </p><p>This would have taken place in the 80s and could be dismissed as a seedier time. The first Marvel movie, <em>Iron Man</em>, was released in 2008. If Lawrence's story is as he says, this story would have taken place in only the past decade or so. Where auditioning in SOMEONE'S HOTEL ROOM is common practice in the entertainment industry.</p><p>You can see in Lawrence's expression as he shares the story how ridiculous it sounds to say out loud. But it's standard practice. The actor didn't want to take his clothes off. He lost the role AND he got fired from his agency which put him in that position to begin with.</p><p>Hollywood is what we say it is. A cesspool.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Just like there is a big difference between teaching acceptance and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/parental-rights-congresswoman-penthouse\" target=\"_blank\">assigning Penthouse forum letters as reading assignments</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-private-school-dean-students\" target=\"_blank\">leading debates in class \"Anal Sex: Spit vs.Lube.\"</a> Granted those aren't life-altering surgery, but it all falls under the same spectrum.</p><p>Stanley went on to agree that there are individuals WHO AS ADULTS may decide reassignment is their needed choice. But some parents are turning this into a game.</p><blockquote>Normalizing it as some sort of natural alternative or believing that because a little boy likes to play dress up in his sister\u2019s clothes or a girl in her brother\u2019s, we should lead them steps further down a path that\u2019s far from the innocence of what they are doing. With many children who have no real sense of sexuality or sexual experiences caught up in the \u2018fun\u2019 of using pronouns and saying what they identify as, some adults mistakenly confuse teaching acceptance with normalizing and encouraging a situation that has been a struggle for those truly affected and have turned it into a sad and dangerous fad.</blockquote><p>In a world where finding common ground was a thing, or a world where there even was any common ground to find, a statement like this would be it. Let adults do what's right for adults. Leave kids alone. Cutting off your genitals should be treated at least on the same level as getting your driver's license or buying a pack of cigarettes.</p><p>We don't live in that world.
