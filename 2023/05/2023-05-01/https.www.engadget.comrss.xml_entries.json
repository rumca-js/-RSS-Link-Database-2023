The firm's sales haven't met expectations, in other words. Vorwerk is promising cloud and repair support to Neato customers for &quot;at least&quot; five years, so your robovac should continue to run for a while longer.</p><p>The move will affect 98 jobs, Vorwerk says. Users started worrying weeks ago, when users <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NeatoRobotics/comments/12ie29z/loginneatorobotics_not_working/\">noticed </a>a broken customer sign-in page. Neato's Facebook and Twitter accounts vanished, and support staff fell silent. Vorwerk is fixing the login issues and says they're not connected to the shutdown.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Neato emerged in 2005 and soon became one of the main competitors to iRobot's Roomba series. It stood out by pushing the limits of robot vacuum technology, such as by adding WiFi in 2011 and LiDAR mapping in 2020. Vorwerk bought Neato in 2017, but continued to run the brand independently. Neato ran into trouble, and restructuring efforts didn't turn the company around.</p><p>The closure isn't surprising. iRobot has long dominated robovacs, and claimed 46 percent of the market in 2020 <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/934089/worldwide-robotic-vacuum-cleaner-market-share/\">according</a> to Statista. Neato, by comparison, had roughly 3 percent in preceding years and was already fading away by 2020. Competitors like Anker's Eufy brand, Roborock and Shark have entered the field and sometimes undercut Neato on price.</p><p>A shutdown may not be good news for iRobot, though. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/politicians-want-ftc-to-oppose-amazon-irobot-acquisition-144534035.html\">American politicians</a> are already concerned about the potential harm of Amazon's proposed iRobot acquisition to the competitive landscape, and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazons-irobot-purchase-reportedly-faces-eu-investigation-194049962.html\">European regulators</a> are reportedly close behind. Neato's demise further reduces that competition, even if it hasn't been a heavyweight for a while.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/robot-vacuum-maker-neato-is-shutting-down-amid-stiff-competition-204959296.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/robot-vacuum-maker-neato-is-shutting-down-amid-stiff-competition-204959296.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-01 20:49:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "'The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom' spoilers flood the internet after pre-launch leak", "description": "<p>If you were hoping to avoid spoilers before playing Nintendo's highly anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild, that goal just got a lot harder: <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-hands-on-preview-a-sequel-with-endless-creative-potential-130047291.html\"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> has been leaked. Physical copies of the game appeared on sites over the weekend, apparently selling for up to $300 each. Now, digital copies of the game have shown up online. Some who have downloaded the pirated files have streamed footage of the game's intro and gameplay.</p><p>How this all happened still isn't completely clear. According to a thread on the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/\">GamingLeaksAndRumors subreddit</a>, players who received the physical game early posted scattered images.

More recently, a hacker acquired a test build of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rockstar-grand-theft-auto-6-leak-155755703.html\">the next <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game</a> and released more than an hour of footage from the build. And indeed, this has happened to Nintendo before: The Wii U version of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> was leaked before launch back in 2017.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't commented on the situation yet, but it's likely they'll pursue legal action if they can identify the leaker. The company recently subpoenaed Discord for information on users who leaked a Tears of the Kingdom art book earlier this year. There's also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gary-bowser-sentencing-220648450.html\">the case of Gary Bowser</a>, a hacker for Team Xecuter who developed and sold devices that enabled people to play pirated games on the Nintendo Switch \u2014 he was jailed in 2022, and has been ordered to pay 25-30% of his monthly gross income to Nintendo in restitution for the rest of his life.</p><p>Curious what to expect from the new game without having to delve into leaks and spoilers?

Whether you're chatting with a loved one who's oceans away, or collaborating with teammates across timezones, sitting in front of a webcam or holding up your phone is an inescapable reality. That's why many companies have developed products meant to make video calls feel more natural \u2014 like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-broadcast-eye-contact-144555050.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAISHWmDPt5u7L2XAI4M9P8Mxmsi0AQNOmNGsvk5YQlawzpikXZvG62EGcleJZbpq5RSuUZx7Kv4JEJE9oAbVNSyoJWZs3vVjU55ETxMVbCmoiqpJWlQqWlMTmOKffxnUsFsPwbN_U1yVi_ntsV9cHJUsKEa5BS8XUxTVa62S-XJp\">NVIDIA's Broadcast tool</a> to make it look like you're maintaining eye contact even if you aren't and Google's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-project-starline-191228699.html\">experimental 3D telepresence or holographic booths</a>. But Logitech is introducing something that uses dead simple technology to make video chats more like the real-world experience. The company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23577918/logitech-steelcase-project-ghost-video-chat-booth-starline\">announced Project Ghost in January</a>, and recently invited us to check out a functioning version in New York.&nbsp;</p><p>The premise is straightforward. Instead of futzing around with holograms or algorithms that make your pupils look like you're staring at a camera, Logitech simply embedded its existing Rally Plus video conferencing system into a booth it teamed up with furniture maker Steelcase to create. The result is a booth that's like a larger business class seat (but not quite first class), with walls about 5 feet 10 inches tall. Light brown wooden slats line the exterior, matching the panels inside. On one side sits a hollow wall that's almost two feet thick, with a screen inside it and a mirror below that, placed at a perpendicular angle. Facing the TV is a light pink couch, a side table with a touchscreen control panel on it and some green plants behind that.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>With its warm colors, soft curves, pink couch and greenery, the booth felt very inviting. I quickly collapsed onto the sofa and was slightly surprised to see a woman staring back at me. She appeared life-sized and it felt as if our eyes met, even though she was sitting in a similar booth all the way in Boston. Since the camera is embedded behind the display, it was easy for me to peer into her face and on the other end of the call it would look like I was staring right at her.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"0d2be0d9bc014ec99e1445672ac95d91\"></div><p>Though Logitech executives at the demo told me the video quality was capped at 1080p and was more likely streaming at 720p or lower, I initially thought the woman I was calling was rendered in 4K. But the clarity and realism that I had assumed was a result of high resolution was more likely because I wasn't used to talking to someone on such a large screen. Normally, I take my calls on a 13-inch laptop, and even when I'm in a meeting room with my colleagues' faces plastered on a 40-inch TV, I didn't get the sense that they were right in front of me.</p><p>The only time I felt like there was some distortion was when I heard feedback of my voice during parts of the demo. I couldn't tell where the speakers and mics were embedded in the space, so I didn't get to adjust or learn how to move to avoid the echoes. But for the most part, the meeting was smooth, and when the company's executives finally left the space for me to be alone with the caller, I was able to relax. Though I was only looking at the person's upper body, I was able to note small changes in body language like posture. It's not a perfect replacement for a real-world conversation, but possibly because I wasn't on my laptop, I was a  lot more focused than I normally am on calls.</p><p>Much of that sense of realism and privacy might have to do with the setup of the booth. Behind the couch is a black wall, while above the TV box is a horizontal light with a filtered effect, and together they make the caller look well lit and in focus. The fact that both me and the person I'm talking to are staring at our upper bodies and heads with nothing else in the background removes any distraction.</p><figure><img alt=\"A rendering of the couch and side table inside the Project Ghost booth.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/10bbb320-e7ca-11ed-9ebf-76d56949b907\" style=\"height: 2025px; width: 3600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Logitech</div></figure><p>Of course, you could achieve something similar by investing in a tripod, a backdrop, a dedicated camera and spend a lot less money, but this product isn't meant for the average consumer. Logitech said it received a lot of interest from companies wanting to order the booths for their office spaces, and that it was looking into iterating on the design to make them more suitable for different scenarios.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to bigger setups for multiple people (the current couch is designed for one person), Logitech said it could also come up with something people could buy for home use. I could see Ghost being incredibly useful for calls with my therapist, telehealth appointments or even just as a dedicated livestreaming station. But considering Logitech estimates selling each unit for about $15,000 to $20,000 depending on the size or style, this is probably something I can only look at in envy. If you have that sort of money to spare, the company said it would be ready to sell these in the fall.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/logitech-made-googles-project-starline-video-conferencing-booth--minus-holograms-163058592.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/logitech-made-googles-project-starline-video-conferencing-booth--minus-holograms-163058592.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-01 16:30:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon is making over 100 Prime Video originals available for free", "description": "<p>Amazon has announced it's making over 100 Prime Video original series and movies available on Freevee, its free streaming service.

The researcher is concerned that Google is giving up its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-imagen-text-to-image-ai-unprecedented-photorealism-144205123.html\">previous restraint</a> on public AI releases in a bid to compete with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html\">Bing Chat</a> and similar models, opening the door to multiple ethical problems.</p><p>In the near term, Hinton is worried that generative AI could lead to a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html\">wave of misinformation</a>. You might &quot;not be able to know what is true anymore,&quot; he says. He's also concerned it might not just eliminate &quot;drudge work,&quot; but outright replace some jobs. Going forward, the scientist is concerned about both the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-02-pentagon-draft-ai-ethics-guidelines.html\">fully autonomous weapons</a> and the tendency of AI models to learn odd behavior from training data. While some of these issues are theoretical, Hinton fears an escalation that won't be checked without regulations or the development of effective controls.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Hinton says his stance began changing last year, when Google, OpenAI and others began creating AI systems that he believes are sometimes superior to human intelligence. AI has developed rapidly in just the past five years \u2014 it's &quot;scary&quot; what could happen in the next five, the researcher suggests.</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, Google's chief scientist Jeff Dean says his firm is still dedicated to a &quot;responsible approach&quot; and on guard for &quot;emerging risks.&quot; The search giant recently released a rough version of its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html\">Bard chatbot</a> in March following months of rumors the company is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-chatgpt-ai-chatbot-search-170007802.html\">worried about the competitive threat</a> of generative AI. Before then, it refused to publicly release AI models like its art-oriented Imagen over the potential for toxic content and copyright violations.</p><p>Hinton has devoted his career to studying the neural networks that are often key to AI, but is best known for developing an object recognition system in 2012. His breakthrough neural net could use training images to help recognize common objects. Google bought Hinton's DNNresearch startup in 2013, and the underlying concept of his invention helped foster a surge of development that led to today's generative tech.</p><p>Hinton isn't alone. A number of influential academics and tech luminaries, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, recently signed an open letter calling for a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tech-leaders-and-ai-experts-demand-a-six-month-pause-on-out-of-control-ai-experiments-114553864.html\">six-month pause</a> on AI development to address ethical and safety problems.

The main upgrade is the addition of an integrated food thermometer. This should help you monitor the internal temperatures of foods, especially proteins, with more accuracy.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As with other dual-zone fryers, the DZ550 has two independent, nonstick baskets, allowing you to cook two foods simultaneously, such as a main and a side. You can have different settings for each basket or match the settings across both \u2014 a handy option if you're cooking two batches of the same thing. The Smart Finish feature, meanwhile, is designed to make sure the food in each basket is ready at the same time.</p><p>The DZ550 has six functions: air frying, air broiling, roasting, baking, reheating and dehydrating. There's also a wide temperature range that runs from 105 to 450 degrees. Additionally, Ninja claims its air fryer can cook food faster than a traditional oven. It says the DZ550 can cook two six-pound chickens 30 percent faster than a regular oven and make frozen food crispy in 30 minutes.</p><p>You'll need to set aside plenty of counter space for the DZ550: it's 17 inches wide and 14 inches deep. It weighs just under 20 pounds as well. Still, if you have the room for the DZ550, it could prove a helpful addition to your kitchen, and the lower price makes it that much more appealing.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ninjas-updated-dualzone-air-fryer-is-50-off-right-now-144531253.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ninjas-updated-dualzone-air-fryer-is-50-off-right-now-144531253.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-01 14:45:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "TP-Link WiFi extenders are up to 39 percent off at Amazon", "description": "<p>You don't have to buy a whole new router if your existing WiFi network coverage isn't quite cutting it.

The dongle plugs into the TV\u2019s HDMI port and, on most sets, stays hidden behind the screen. The Roku interface is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html\">straightforward</a> and the remote can even be used for voice commands. In addition to supporting most streaming services available, Roku also has its own set of channels with free live TV, movies, shows, sports and news. <em>\u2013 Amy Skorheim, Commerce Writer</em></p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Apple Watch Series 8</h2><p></p><p>If your grad is an iPhone user, an Apple Watch could end up being their favorite phone accessory.

It has a comfortable, simple design that you can jazz up with funky bands of all materials, and it does a great job of keeping you connected to your phone even when you don\u2019t want to whip it out. Call, text and app alerts from your phone are delivered directly to your wrist, and that\u2019s while the Watch passively monitors your activity all day long. It\u2019s a fantastic workout wearable as well, giving you access to a bunch of trackable activities, and of course, it works well with Apple Fitness+ classes, too. Performance is solid, even if not that much better than the Series 7 that came before it, and the Series 8 supports crash detection, ECG measurements and blood oxygen monitoring. <em>\u2014 Valentina Palladino, Senior Commerce Editor</em></p><h2>YouTube TV subscription</h2><p></p><p>Regardless of whether or not your giftee has a Chromecast, we think a <a href=\"https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/\">YouTube TV subscription</a> will make an excellent present for them. The service essentially replaces cable or satellite, and your graduate can easily use their phone, laptop or connected TV to access it. The platform offers pretty much all the standard network and cable offerings including sports channels like ESPN, so they won\u2019t have to worry about missing their favorite team\u2019s game.

Their Adaptive Sound Control feature automatically changes the level of noise cancellation depending on your location and what you\u2019re doing, blocking out as much of the world as necessary without the user needing to do much work. There's also multi-device connectivity, so your graduate can seamlessly go from listening to music on their laptop to taking a call from their smartphone. <em>\u2014 V.P.</em></p><h2>Chipolo One</h2><p></p><p>Losing stuff is a bummer for anyone, grads included.

That\u2019s because it simply does what it\u2019s supposed to do without hassle: help people locate their keys and let them know when they\u2019ve been left behind. Chipolo One doesn\u2019t have the massive, community-enabled (and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-convinced-my-dog-is-stalking-me-143100932.html\">potentially</a><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/police-arrest-suspect-in-killing-of-cash-app-founder-bob-lee-160204361.html\">creepy</a>) location tracking of Apple\u2019s FindMy, but it rings loud with a tap from your phone and sends alerts about forgotten items faster than any other tracker we tried. <em>\u2013 A.S.</em></p><h2>Instant Vortex Mini air fryer</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9JbnN0YW50LVBvdC1VbHRpbWF0ZS1QcmVzc3VyZS1EZWh5ZHJhdGUvZHAvQjA4WVM2MTRSSj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby12ZC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTU4Y2U0ZGQtMTQ1Zi0zMGFhLTgwNDYtMTUwOTBmYThmNGMwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATyq9YdrcV5214AwYwlKiZ7RlzE-88IiQyK882_W9zHg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FInstant-Pot-Ultimate-Pressure-Dehydrate%2Fdp%2FB08YS614RJ\">Instant Vortex Mini</a> is a powerful little air fryer that any new graduate should be able to fit into even the most cramped of kitchen setups. It has an easy to use touchscreen with a few different cooking modes, but we expect most graduates will use it to cook snacks like mozzarella sticks and reheat leftovers to crispy perfection. We recommend checking out our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-air-fryers-133047180.html\">air fryer guide</a> if you want to give them something a little bigger that can cook more food at once \u2014 but if you\u2019re only looking out for your grad and maybe their partner or favorite roommate, the Instant Vortex Mini will feed them well. <em>\u2014 V.P.</em></p><h2>Apple iPad Air</h2><p></p><p>If your grad needs a new tablet for checking emails, reading e-books or binging YouTube, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlWM0hOMUtDP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXZkLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxNThjZTRkZC0xNDVmLTMwYWEtODA0Ni0xNTA5MGZhOGY0YzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbF4SZ7rZWqHtn1NzLY4UXk0NYjBn5x2w8K0fav4whO-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HN1KC\">iPad Air</a> is the best mix of price and long-term performance.

The Brio 500 shoots 1080p video and they can customize aspects of their feed, including brightness, contrast and additive filters, by using the free Logi Tune software. But most of the time, the cam will do the hard work for them: it has remarkably good auto-light correction, which will help them look better in dark environments, noise-reducing dual microphones and auto-framing with RightSight.

The automated command should have immediately caused an explosion, but tumbled around for a bit first, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8yOS9zY2llbmNlL2Vsb24tbXVzay1zcGFjZXgtc3RhcnNoaXAuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDFkMjBkNmMtNzc2Mi00MWE3LTg4MDgtODY4ZGVjYzM1Y2Y3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAViVCE575wyYBFQpWcE4_oD6siooTFpc1bVrQgstlHbI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F04%2F29%2Fscience%2Felon-musk-spacex-starship.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p><p>In one of many spins on the day's failures, Musk claimed it was because \"the vehicle\u2019s structural margins appear to be better than we expected.\" While SpaceX previously said the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-full-static-fire-test-results-221636780.html\">only goal was that initial takeoff</a>, a lot clearly went wrong.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The delayed self-destruction wasn't the only issue following the launch from SpaceX's facility in Boca Chica, Texas.

After over a decade at the company, in 2019, Williams left Apple to co-found Nuvia, a chip design firm later acquired by Qualcomm in 2021. When the tech giant first sued Williams, it accused him of \u201csecretly\u201d starting Nuvia and recruiting talent for his startup while he was still an Apple employee. Williams disputed Apple\u2019s claims and accused the company of spying on his text messages. The case was dismissed, mired in a lot of legalese and multiple court documents.</p><p>Apple requested to dismiss the suit against Williams earlier this week. The request does not state the company\u2019s reason for dropping the case, but in March, Apple wanted the recusal of Judge Sunil Kulkarni, because its legal team added lawyers from a company that Judge Kulkarni had previously worked at. So, conflicts of interest, initiated by Apple recruiting more legal firepower.

Brazilian authorities wanted the app suspended after Telegram failed to hand over a full set of data on a pair of neo-Nazi groups on the app accused of inciting violence against schools. According to <em>Reuters</em>, judge Fl\u00e1vio Lucas ruled that a complete suspension of the messaging app was \u201cunreasonable\u201d given that thousands of people in Brazil rely on the platform. At the same time, he upheld the daily $200,000 fine on Telegram for failing to provide local authorities with the data they requested. This isn\u2019t the first time Telegram has been briefly banned in Brazil. In 2022, the country\u2019s highest court suspended the app for failing to freeze accounts accused of spreading disinformation ahead of the country\u2019s recent presidential election. Similarly, that ban was lifted just days later.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/brazilian-court-lifts-nationwide-telegram-ban-put-in-place-over-data-demand-183423449.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-ch720n-review-160032871.html\">Sony WH-CH720N headphones review</a></h2><h3>Budget-friendly headphones with premium sound.</h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-ch720n-review-160032871.html\"><figure><img alt=\"TMA\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/fa272d40-e807-11ed-baf7-67e50cbfb3d2\" style=\"height: 450px; width: 675px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>On paper, the 2023 edition of Sony\u2019s midrange headphones should continue the company\u2019s reputation for solid headphones \u2013 and a viable alternative to the pricey flagship WH-1000XM5.
