It's a weird thing to think about, but all around the world there are towns at the bottom of lakes. Many are from reservoirs and dams built to generate power or clean water for cities, but some were from insane natural disasters. Here we talk about some of the most interesting sunken towns in the world, and a potential disaster on the horizon in California called ARkStorm that could sink hundreds of towns and threaten millions of lives.
