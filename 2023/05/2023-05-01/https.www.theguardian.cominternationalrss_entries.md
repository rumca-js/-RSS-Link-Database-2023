## The pledge of allegiance to the king is nonsense – and seems designed to incense everyone | Zoe Williams

<p>People will give voice to this absurd word salad and a chorus will go up from those of us who have been silent about the royals for years. The only thing I swear? There will be tears after this homage</p><p>The problem with the royal family is that there is no “don’t care” option. The default, I believe, is to love them. Monarchists always give you some reason for it: they love all the tourists the family attracts; or they love having a neutral head of state, because that definitely keeps the politicians on the straight and narrow; or they love the way their coats always match their handbags, which is actually just the natural consequence of having so many coats and so many handbags.</p><p>You have to admire all these rationales as feats of reverse-engineering, because the real thing royalists love is that there isn’t a reason: there is absolutely no basis in reality for having any feelings for this remote and illegible family at all – and isn’t that the purest kind of love there is? Well, I’m guessing here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/01/the-pledge-of-allegiance-to-the-king-is-nonsense-and-seems-designed-to-incense-everyone">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The particles could be linked to cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s</p><p>Researchers at the University of Vienna have <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/13/8/1404">discovered</a> particles of plastic in mice’s brains just two hours after the mice ingested drinking water containing plastic.</p><p>Once in the brain, “Plastic particles could increase the risk of inflammation, neurological disorders or even neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s,” Lukas Kenner, one of the researchers, said in a statement, although more research is needed to determine the relationship between plastics and these brain disorders. In addition to potentially severe degenerative consequences, the researchers also believe that microplastic contamination in our brains can cause short-term health effects such as cognitive impairment, neurotoxicity and altered neurotransmitter levels, which can contribute to behavioral changes.</p><p>Adrienne Matei is a freelance journalist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/01/plastic-is-already-in-blood-breast-milk-and-placentas-now-it-may-be-in-our-brains">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘A budget is a moral document’: why does the NYPD need $29m a day?

<p>The Museum of Broken Windows aims to explore what New York City could be like if funds were diverted from the police</p><p>Whatever a New Yorker’s grievance of choice with the city may be – our shambolic farce of a transit system, overdrawn social services on their way to complete collapse, the rapid vanishing of state-subsidized third spaces – everybody’s really talking about the same thing.</p><p>The issue at the heart of every societal ill is budgeting, and the issue at the heart of budgeting is the misallocation of funds to the staggeringly swollen coffers of the New York Police Department. Burning through upwards of $10bn annually, the NYPD’s waste causes vaster, more insidious damage than the program of person-to-person violence and systemic harassment that’s sparked protests of greater frequency and passion in recent years. By hoarding such a hefty fraction of the taxpayers’ money, they’re sending the people and city they claim to protect into the poorhouse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/01/museum-of-broken-windows-new-york-police-budget">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Excessive loyalty’: how Republican giant George Shultz fell for Nixon, Reagan … and Elizabeth Holmes

<p>The great secretary of state’s biographer, Philip Taubman, balances cold war achievements with costly political failures</p><p>“Without Reagan the cold war would not have ended, but without Shultz, Reagan would not have ended the cold war.” This quotation of Mikhail Gorbachev – from the preface of In the Nation’s Service, a biography of George Shultz – now has a bittersweet taste. Reagan died in 2004, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/obituaries/george-p-shultz-dead.html">Shultz in 2021</a> (at 100) and Gorbachev in 2022. The cold war is having a renaissance that threatens the legacies of all three.</p><p>Vladimir Putin has returned Russia to authoritarianism, suspended its participation in the last US-Russia arms control pact and, with the invasion of Ukraine, put the risk of catastrophic confrontation between major powers back on the table.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/01/george-shultz-nixon-reagan-elizabeth-holmes-philip-taubman">Continue reading...</a>
