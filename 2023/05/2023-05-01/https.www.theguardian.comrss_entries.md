## Iwobi rescues point but Everton and Leicester remain in relegation trouble

<p>This was a frenetic, see-sawing and at times truly silly game of football that embodied the emotions of a relegation scrap. Dominic Calvert‑Lewin’s second goal of the season earned Everton an early lead but from there this match descended into chaos and when James Maddison missed a penalty to give Leicester a two-goal buffer after goals by Caglar Soyuncu and Jamie Vardy there was always scope for Sean Dyche’s side to cling on.</p><p>And so they did, Alex Iwobi striking an equaliser in the second half. So amateurish was the defending in parts, it was hard not to feel neither team deserved to walk off the pitch victorious and in the end, after four fraught minutes of second-half stoppage time, they had to settle for a point that does little for either side.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/01/leicester-everton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Andrew: The Problem Prince review – a deliciously vicious reminder of the dire state of the monarchy

<p>This gripping documentary unpacks the dodgy truth about the king’s paedophile-affiliated brother. Is this really the sort of thing you want to pledge allegiance to?</p><p>Context is all, they say. And when you broadcast a documentary about the king’s paedophile-affiliated brother five days before the former’s coronation, they may be right. Context is certainly the greatest ally of Channel 4’s Andrew: The Problem Prince. It is based on an anatomisation of the before, during and after of the now and probably for ever infamous interview that Prince Andrew gave to Emily Maitlis on Newsnight in 2019. I know. Four years ago. And still the memory of him claiming to be unable to sweat as a result of trauma in the Falklands, and taking the kids to Pizza Express in Woking on the evening he was alleged to be having sex with a trafficked 17-year-old, is as crystal-clear as it ever was. Time has not done its gentle work. If it catches you unawares, you still jack-knife unstoppably in horror as it unleashes all the rest of its vicarious humiliation. “It was a convenient place to stay.” “A very ordinary shooting weekend.” “I’m too honourable.” Amazing.</p><p>The same disbelief clearly still attends the even more extensive recollections of Maitlis and her producer, Sam McAlister. The latter received the first approach from Amanda Thirsk, the prince’s chief of staff, in 2018, which was before Jeffrey Epstein – though by then a convicted sex offender – had come into UK public consciousness. When Newsnight declined the offer of what was essentially a puff piece, word came back that they were open to “a wider discussion”. He would talk about anything except his friendship with Epstein. Newsnight didn’t fancy being dictated to, so declined again. “Best decision ever,” says McAlister. It is clear that, quite rightly, the joy will never leave her. The prince and the “playboy” – AKA man-arrested-for-20-years-of-sex-trafficking-in-plain-sight – became headline news and Andrew became determined to use the interview to clear his name. It is not overtly stated but it is obvious that from then on, the main task of McAlister and Maitlis was to tread softly and not shatter the man’s illusions.</p><p>Andrew: The Problem Prince is on Channel 4.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/andrew-the-problem-prince-review-a-deliciously-vicious-reminder-of-the-dire-state-of-the-monarchy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On the exterior of the redecorated Emirates stadium, Arsenal’s quadruple-winning women’s team of 2006-07 heave on red ropes, pulling up the former UWCL trophy. A trophy no other English team has won. That achievement is given equal billing opposite the men’s “Invincibles” team who are similarly raising high a gold Premier League trophy.</p><p>Inside the stadium, the depleted Gunners battled valiantly but could not pull themselves into their second Champions League final, losing 3-2 to the two-times European champions Wolfsburg, with the winner coming deep into extra time. There was no Beth Mead, no Vivianne Miedema, no Kim Little, no Caitlin Foord and no Leah Williamson and, ultimately, there wasn’t enough in the absolutely outstanding legs that remained, legs that gave everything for a record 60,063 fans that urged them onwards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/01/arsenal-wolfsburg-womens-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Building a healthier, more prosperous country will mean addressing the problem of low-paid, precarious employment </p><p>What’s the best way to fix Britain’s economy? According to <a href="https://twitter.com/UKLabour/status/1650050625365762051" title="">Labour</a> and the Conservatives, the answer is growth. Yet this focus overlooks another fundamental reason for Britain’s sluggish productivity. The UK is unwell. Every year, 2% of its GDP – or £43bn – is lost due to poor health, according to <a href="https://www.ippr.org/files/2023-04/1682577258_healthy-people-prosperous-lives-april-2023.pdf" title="">new findings</a> from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR).

So long as this persists, calling for growth will be like attempting to compete in a race while being too sick and exhausted to run.</p><p>The reasons for Britain’s ill health have been <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/publications/reports/the-marmot-review-10-years-on" title="">widely discussed</a>. Poverty is a major cause. Those on low incomes are more likely to live in overcrowded housing and struggle to afford life’s essentials. If social housing was plentiful, nutritious food subsidised and heating permanently affordable, poverty would not be as harmful to health. But a decade of cuts to public services has left those on low incomes even more exposed. Meanwhile, Whitehall has focused its energies on the NHS, viewing medical treatment as the job of the state and prevention as the responsibility of individuals. Broader health has not been a government priority – a fact signalled by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-scrapping-public-health-england-not-just-wrong-but-highly-risky" title="">cynical decision</a> to scrap Public Health England in 2020.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/01/the-guardian-view-on-work-in-britain-insecurity-is-making-people-sick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Departing the club he joined at 16 is tough but the wing admits joining La Rochelle is about wages and greater medal prospects</p><p>To witness their romp to a third successive Champions Cup final it was not hard to see why Jack Nowell is poised to join La Rochelle next season. Ronan O’Gara has built a formidable side and they have an ardent support base to match. As the son of a Cornish fisherman it helps for Nowell, too, that La Rochelle are based on the Atlantic coast – “as much as I would love to be in Paris, I love the sea”.</p><p>Equally, there is a financial reality to Nowell’s move. The reduced Premiership salary cap, coupled with the fact that when Covid hit the Chiefs made the admirable decision not to enforce wage reductions – unlike other clubs – has had an undeniable impact. Throw in a golden generation of England internationals, whose value and therefore salaries grew as they established themselves as Test players, and it becomes clear why so many Exeter players are moving to pastures new.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/01/jack-nowell-leaving-exeter-chiefs-was-one-of-the-hardest-positions-i-have-ever-been-in-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An interrogative exhibition at the New-York Historical Society examines the social, cultural and civil rights impact of development and devastation</p><p>“I want people to understand that the environmental crisis is bound up inextricably in our cultural world and how we relate to each other,” Dr Wendy Nālani E Ikemoto is discussing <a href="https://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/nature-crisis-consequence">Nature, Crisis, Consequence</a>, which she curated for the New-York Historical Society. The show juxtaposes classics of 19th-century American naturalism with works by artists from communities largely left out of the historical narratives that these works have been central in enshrining. “It’s not just a problem of science and numbers, it is indivisible from the way we treat each other. How is the environmental crisis also a civil rights crisis?”</p><p>Running through 16 July, Nature, Crisis, Consequence emerged from a request made of Ikemoto to create a show to feature the NYHS’s 19th-century Hudson River school paintings. Among the Society’s most popular holdings, the Hudson River school works show a romanticized, pastoral version of well-known landscapes upstate from New York City, now thoroughly marked by human development and activity. “They wanted them back on view because they’re so popular,” said Ikemoto, “but I didn’t want to just put these paintings back on the wall.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/01/environment-civil-rights-exhibit-new-york-historical-society">Continue reading...</a>

The asylum seekers I have met have been polite, charmingly grateful for our help and eager to get on with their lives. This means working to improve their English – at college, as soon as they are eligible – and, since asylum seekers are not allowed to earn money, keen to volunteer their services to charities and other organisations. The parents are as concerned for their children’s wellbeing as any UK parents, care for them lovingly and encourage them to work hard at school.</p><p>Meanwhile, they are coping with the trauma of lives disrupted by violence, the turmoil of their journeys to get here and the stresses of living, usually in one room, in a strange country where they are dependent on the kindness of strangers for clothing, shoes and all the necessities of life. In my view, the UK will benefit immeasurably from their presence and the skills and values they bring. <br /><strong>Vicky Woodcraft</strong><br /><em>Trustee, Herts Welcomes Refugees</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/01/tory-policies-not-migrants-are-endangering-social-cohesion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Football is a fight for club’s legendary manager so who better to install the ‘balls, blood and mentality’ they need to survive?</p><p>“I couldn’t sit at home with my arms crossed,” José Bordalás said, and so there he was standing in the pouring rain, soaked and angry again, glasses no good to him now.

Where, officially just 27 hours into the job, he watched drenched as his team – well, it is now – lost 1-0 to Espanyol, their third consecutive defeat and a sixth game without winning dropping them deeper into the relegation zone. Which wasn’t the way he wanted it but was exactly why he was there, back for another battle.</p><p>And, boy, is it a battle: possibly the <em>best</em> La Liga has seen at the bottom, although that might not be the word they would use. It wasn’t supposed to be this way, at least not for Getafe. Survival last season, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/getafe-real-madrid-crystal-palace-la-liga-blog">inspired by Crystal Palace</a>, was a miracle considering how it started but was secured early, they strengthened in the summer and although they began badly, three home wins running across February and March – against Valencia, Girona and Sevilla – had lifted them five places and three points above relegation.

<p>Affordability checks will hit revenues but there is a world of difference between online slot machines and sports betting</p><p>A couple of hours after the government’s White Paper on gambling reform was finally published last week, Julie Harrington, the British Horseracing Authority’s chief executive, was asked whether the proposed legislation took into account the fundamental difference between betting – on racing and other sports – and gaming, on fixed-margin casino products.</p><p>“There is some good language in there, accepting that there is a difference between sport and evidence of faster losses on those casino-based games,” Harrington said. “I think on a more detailed reading, you’ll see that it may not be the headlines, but the language below really does differentiate that, so it’s clear that that has landed.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/01/gambling-reform-sports-betting-online-gaming-government-white-paper">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Although his heart was never in it, the American artist was a prolific – and highly experimental – fashion photographer. A new exhibition explores the surrealist’s side hustle</p><p>Man Ray’s first fashion shoot was a disaster. It was 1922, and the artist had just arrived in Paris from New York with one suitcase, $100 and the singular goal of becoming one of the bright young things of dadaism alongside Duchamp and André Breton.</p><p>He had been taking photographs for a few years, but mainly portraits (Jean Cocteau was an early Paris sitter), and not always enthusiastically. He later said “photography is not art”, and that he would only shoot things he couldn’t paint. Still, he had no money, so when he was commissioned by Paul Poiret, the French couturier who took women out of corsets and put them into harem pants, he agreed. Back then, illustrations were the go-to for fashion houses, but Poiret was after something a bit different, which Man Ray was. Except the American turned up at the salon with no idea what he was doing. The lights weren’t right, and the electrics broke on set. Poiret didn’t like the pictures and refused to pay.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/01/man-ray-the-surrealist-who-had-fashion-and-art-all-sewn-up-momu-antwerp">Continue reading...</a>

## Fatal Attraction review – not as sexy as the original … and just as sexist

<p>No bunnies are boiled here, but this attempt to modernise the erotic classic is all tasteless jokes and lame flirting about meatballs. Sizzle it does not</p><p>Certain questions arise during the eight hours spent giving the reboot of Fatal Attraction a fair retrial. One is “what the hell is going on now?” Another is the question it thinks it’s answering by existing at all: “Is it possible to treat the sexism in an inherently sexist erotic thriller like a rotten tooth that can be extracted?” The answer in this case is no – with a side of “and why on earth would you want to?”</p><p>The original Fatal Attraction came out in 1987. Back then, the good lawyer fighting the good fight who ends up having a steamy weekend affair with the bad woman – or the career woman as we defined her back then, shudder – was regarded as “a powerful cautionary tale” (the New York Times) for married men. “Whatever you do, don’t shag the crazy lady!” When it came to the brutal bathtub climax, men jumped to their feet during screenings and screamed: “Kill the bitch!” A new phrase to describe the horrors enacted by a vengeful woman spurned by her lover was born: bunny boiler. Glenn Close, who played Alex, came to regret the role but at the time it was a huge success: nominated for six Oscars, an instant classic. Everyone watched it. I did. Many times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/fatal-attraction-review-this-reboot-thinks-its-being-serious-but-is-just-a-deep-dive-into-a-can-of-worms">Continue reading...</a>

## A Small Fortune review – stash of cash thriller about a schmuck trying to make an easy buck

<p>Set on Canada’s Prince Edward Island, director Adam Perry’s debut follows a well-worn path when a local discovers some ill-gotten gains – when will they learn this never ends well?</p><p>Shot and set on Prince Edward Island in Canada, with an almost all-Canadian cast and crew, one gets the feeling this ponderous drama was also made largely for a local audience. Writer-director Adam Perry takes a classic moral-dilemma set-up – poor protagonist finds a substantial amount of seemingly abandoned cash and must decide whether to keep it or call the cops – and puts a distinctly Prince Edward Island spin on it. On one level, that means taking advantage of the pretty rural scenery, with its old-fashioned clapboard houses and miles of beach, as well as interesting local traditions such as harvesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrus_crispus">Irish moss</a> (actually not a moss but a variety of nutritious seaweed) that main character Kevin Doucette (Stephen Oates) collects like his ancestors did on the shore with horse and trap.</p><p>However, on another level, and despite the no-doubt generous funding from local film commissions, the setting prompts the characters to whinge a lot about how boring and hardscrabble life is on the island and how much they’d like to leave if only they could. The strong influence of Irish ancestry is audible in the accents themselves. So if you were just listening to the dialogue alone, you might think this was an Irish film like The Banshees of Inisherin, but without the absurdist humour, sparkling dialogue, inventive violence, miniature donkeys and cute dogs, or any strikingly talented personnel involved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/01/a-small-fortune-review-stash-of-cash-thriller-about-a-schmuck-trying-to-make-an-easy-buck">Continue reading...</a>

It’s part of letting your emotions out.” It was that kind of weekend at the bottom of the table, both for the Swabians and for Schalke, two huge clubs who have spent most of this campaign looking over their shoulders and not seeing much behind them – but two teams who, after this weekend, are very much alive and kicking.</p><p>When the Bundesliga coins its marketing strapline “football as it’s meant to be” they envisage a greater level of technical competence than these two show on a regular basis but in terms of pure adrenaline, no argument can be broached after the respective wins of two struggling giants at the weekend. Stuttgart had surfed the wave of a breathless end to their previous home game with Borussia Dortmund, going 2-0 down, playing almost an hour with 10 men and salvaging an improbable point via Silas’ equaliser, the very last kick of the game.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/01/stuttgart-and-schalke-belatedly-discover-stomach-for-survival-fight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw and Rachel Daly chase scoring records as Manchester United keep the Double dream alive</p><p>Bunny Shaw cannot stop scoring and she added to her tally against Reading on Sunday. The goal was the Manchester City striker’s 18th of the season and the question now is can she break the record for most goals scored by a player in a WSL campaign. Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema currently holds the record with 22, achieved by the Dutch striker during the 2018-19 season. Shaw is four goals shy of matching Miedema’s tally and with City having three matches remaining this season, it is possible to see the 26-year-old doing just that. It should also be noted that Aston Villa’s Rachel Daly is on 17 goals, just one behind Shaw, and so, come the end of the season, it is possible <em>two</em> players will have surpassed Miedema’s mark. <strong>Sarah Rendell</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/01/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Lady Chatterley’s Lover to novels about trans children, attempts to suppress works of literature tend to have the opposite effect</p><p>The 17th century rector of St Alban’s College in Valladolid, Spain, must have rolled his eyes at the size of the book he had to review for the library. The Jesuit seminary, known as the English College because it produced missionaries committed to the reconversion of England to Catholicism, had received a 900-page volume of Shakespeare’s plays.</p><p>William Sankey prepared his quill and began the long work of censoring ungodly, anti-Catholic and otherwise unsuitable material. “Holy-day fools” – a jibe in the Tempest that seemed to impugn the Christian calendar – struck out. “Heavier soon by the weight of a man”, as Margaret tells Hero on the eve of her wedding in Much Ado About Nothing – filth – blotted into unreadability with heavy ink. A play about a pretend friar and a novice nun: actually, at Measure for Measure<em> </em>Sankey admitted defeat, put down his pen and took a sharp blade to cut out the pages of the entire play.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/01/the-big-idea-what-if-censoring-books-only-makes-them-more-popular">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Amo Bek-Nazaryan’s black and white film, a tale of betrayal in an oilfield, has a plaintive beauty and operatic intensity</p><p>Machinery itself has star quality – of the most monumental and anti-heroic sort – in this fascinating 1928 silent movie from the Armenian film-maker Amo Bek-Nazaryan. It’s such a vivid, dynamic, engaged piece of work, whose energies blaze forth afresh in this restoration, having apart from anything else wonderful archival value.</p><p>Bek-Nazaryan vehemently juxtaposes the strange statuary of vast industrial architecture and the faces of the people who live and work in its shadow. The framing device is that a veteran worker in present-day Soviet Armenia is asked by his son – or someone we are led to believe is his son – to sign his application to join the Communist party. Thoughtfully, the older man tells him this is not simply a matter of bits of paper, but hard-won experience in solidarity and sacrifice; he then tells him (and us) about a workers’ action during “the reactionary years” of 1907.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/01/house-on-the-volcano-review-silent-classic-of-soviet-armenia-glories-in-machine-age">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Introducing the Roman tradition of <em>misticanza</em>, a ‘particularly satisfying’ mixture of spring greens with potatoes, today served with pancetta or halloumi</p><p>Mixed days of sun and rain mean that every bit of green in Rome has burst: parks, <em>piazze</em>, hedges, ruins and the banks of the river, obviously, but also verges, circles of soil around the base of trees and traffic lights, kerbs and cracks in the pavement. Anywhere that green can push through, it has, and sometimes so enthusiastically it feels like an explosion. Add to this tree roots, which, like ringleaders in a classroom, encourage the eruption. One nearby pavement, overlooked by the recent repaving scheme, looks like a mountain range with a green river running through it.</p><p>I was intrigued enough to download an app that promised to identify what, exactly, is bursting out. Although, after a few tries, I’m beginning to wonder if the age of my phone camera is compromising things. When pointed at anything green, it invariably tells me the same thing: <em>tarassaco</em>, or dandelion, which, even without any golden-wonder heads, is one of the few plants I can actually recognise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/01/misticanza-recipe-potatoes-greens-pancetta-or-halloumi-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

Speaking about the offer and the decision by RCN members to reject it, Cullen told ITV’s Good Morning Britain:</p><p>What our nursing staff said was it was neither fair nor reasonable – it puts money in their pockets now but in the long term it doesn’t address recruitment and retention issues.</p><p>There were some elements of the pay offer that were attractive to our ruling council; for example around safe nurse staffing policy work that’s required in order for us to be able to move to a place where we have safe nurse staffing legislation in place.</p><p>Patients will still be seen if they unfortunately need to use an emergency department, of course that will always happen. But the delivery of care may be delayed if it is not a life-threatening emergency.</p><p>If it is an emergency, you will be treated as normal. That’s why we are really emphasising the importance of people not delaying seeking medical help and calling 999 as normal or using 111. But it is inevitable that there will be disruption to normal care even in those services where we have agreed mitigations with the Royal College of Nursing.</p><p>Our nurses will continue to work today to ensure our patients are kept safe. And those nurses that are on the picket lines losing a day’s pay, should there be other emergencies that arise during that period, I won’t even have to ask those nurses to return to work, they will return at their own volition. They don’t turn their back on patients, they will continue to do what they need to do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/live/2023/may/01/nurses-strike-live-cancer-and-intensive-care-affected-in-latest-nhs-industrial-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The president is trying to appeal to climate-conscious young voters and appease the fossil fuel industry. It won’t work</p><p>Just before announcing that he would again run for president, Joe Biden signed off on what on the surface looks like a great move to help address the climate crisis: an executive order that creates an office of environmental justice in the White House. “Environmental justice,” the president said from the Rose Garden, “will be the mission of the entire government, woven directly into how we work with state, local, tribal and territorial governments.”</p><p>That is a beautiful sentiment. And sentiment, when coupled with substantive policy positions, can lead the country forward. The idea of a White House office that can help mobilize an all-of-government response to the climate crisis could be a force multiplier in the fight to save the planet. But to be effective it needs real presidential leadership that involves the creation of a bold and realistic plan to phase out fossil fuels along a strict timeline.</p><p>Steven Donziger is a human rights and environmental lawyer, a Guardian US columnist, and the creator of the Substack newsletter <a href="https://stevendonziger.substack.com/">Donziger on Justice</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/01/biden-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis-voters">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Air pollution and the climate crisis are making pollen even more of a menace. Here’s how to stop your eyes itching and nose streaming</p><p>If you’ve found yourself reaching for the tissues more than usual recently, you’re not alone. The sun has shown its face a bit, and thanks to the arrival of a tree pollen bomb, which occurs when groups of trees release millions of grains of pollen at the same time, many of us are trading the joys of spring for itchy eyes and streaming noses.</p><p>According to Margaret Kelman, acting head of clinical services at <a href="https://www.allergyuk.org/">Allergy UK</a>, the number of people affected by hay fever has trebled in the last 30 years, with the condition now affecting one in four adults in the UK. “Climate change, including increased air pollution, has contributed to more intense pollen seasons,” she says. “Warmer weather speeds up the growing process, causing pollen seasons to start earlier and last longer.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/01/pollen-bomb-six-ways-to-fight-hay-fever-this-spring-from-vitamin-d-to-making-new-friends">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s gripping, nuanced, almost unbearably tense – and it’s about to come to an end. The BBC show’s take on policing post-Troubles Belfast is one of the finest watches of the year</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/27/blue-lights-review-dont-sleep-on-this-fantastically-tense-belfast-cop-show">Blue Lights</a> first appeared, it was hard to get too excited about yet another cop show. We are only at the end of April and already the year has been stuffed with them, from the great (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/05/happy-valley-finale-review-sally-wainwright-sarah-lancashire-one-of-tvs-greatest-trilogies-gets-a-fiery-farewell">Happy Valley</a>) to the functionally decent (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/27/unforgotten-series-five-review-still-cracking-drama-even-without-nicola-walker">Unforgotten</a>) to the fine (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/13/better-review-this-moreish-bent-copper-show-gets-stronger-and-stronger">Better</a>), you can’t move for a moody detective or a seemingly uncrackable case. One theory about their enduring appeal is that police procedurals are the most psychologically satisfying form of storytelling, because they fulfil what the human brain finds pleasurable about drama – a puzzle to solve, red herrings and false starts, and the idea that somebody knows what’s going on, even if we don’t yet.</p><p>Written and co-created by Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson (who wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/14/the-salisbury-poisonings-review-novichok-drama-with-lessons-for-now">The Salisbury Poisonings</a>), Blue Lights sets itself apart from the pack. The series – whose final episode airs on BBC One tonight – has a journalistic eye for detail and nuance. It sidesteps the case-of-the-week template, preferring to take an overview of the incredibly complex world of policing in Belfast. This is rich material. First broadcast just before the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, it paints a detailed picture of the city as it is today, with the Troubles never far from that picture, whether in the highly sensitive issue of policing by consent (and consent is not a given), or in the histories of the men (and women) involved in organised crime.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/blue-lights-this-thrilling-cop-drama-is-one-of-tvs-best-shows">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London</strong><br />The 20th edition of Jonzi D’s hip-hop theatre festival showcases new styles and old-school vibes with personality and humour</p><p>Jonzi D turned down an MBE when he was offered one for services to dance, back in 2011. But on stage at the 20th edition of Breakin’ Convention, the hip-hop theatre festival he founded, he did accept a more meaningful award, from the State Assembly of New York, birthplace of hip-hop, for his work promoting the art form. Two of the original B-boys, Keith and Kevin Smith, AKA the Legendary Twins, turned up to present it.</p><p>It’s well-deserved; the festival is a triumph, a weekend of events, on- and off-stage, a noisy, family-friendly party with a real sense of community, taking in breaking, popping, locking, krump, house, beatboxing, graffiti and more. As well as flying in artists from around the world, it’s a platform to nurture local talent that often goes on to big things: this year’s two dance winners at the Olivier awards, Ivan Blackstock and Dickson Mbi, both started out on the Breakin’ Convention Stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/01/breakin-convention-review-hip-hop-sadlers-wells-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In lieu of any real plot, the film centres on political pep talks and jingoism, making it more foreign policy document than flyboy blockbuster</p><p>The pilots in this so-called Chinese Top Gun are mostly top in the sense that they are in selfless support of China’s frontline troops thanks to the emerging technological superiority of the People’s Republic (which would have made for a less snappy title). Another in China’s seemingly never-ending line of propagandistic, government-backed action films, this is only distinguished in dunderheaded patriotism from its American 80s and 90s equivalents by its absence of any functioning sense of humour.</p><p>It’s about the country’s next-generation fighter pilots, but the plot is last-generation: promising flyboy Lei Yu (Wang Yibo) is plucked from his unit by veteran Zhang Ting (Hu Jun) to join the elite outfit trying to get “limit data” at high-altitude from the new stealth planes. Apart from a passing rivalry with Deng Fang (Yu Yosh), that’s about it. But the drama of interest is taking place outside the confines of this film, as referred to in Born to Fly’s constant political pep talks about foreign powers trying to contain China and impinging on its waters. The prologue features a pair of these incursive badboys who declare: “We can come and go whenever we want.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/01/born-to-fly-review-chinese-top-gun-puts-tech-propaganda-in-the-frontline">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor’s tale about the creation of a fantasy film captures the humdrum of Hollywood but lacks his on-screen ability to breathe life into characters</p><p>There is probably a good reason why it is hard to compile a list of decent novels about the making of films (I can think of one, Terry Southern’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/06/top-10-books-about-hollywood">Blue Movie</a></em>): nothing much happens. Or as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomhanks">Tom Hanks</a> observes in this ambitious addition to the genre: “making movies is complicated, maddening, highly technical at times”. Reading it is to be reminded that Hanks, one of the greatest of all movie stars, must have had a good deal of time on his hands during lockdown. Part of its motivation appears to be to give a proper flavour of that truism of movie making: that so much of it is waiting around; three days sitting in a trailer for a minute or two of drama that might end up in a digital suite trash can. This novel, if nothing else, gives you a sense of that experience in real time.</p><p>Hanks, a famous collector of typewriters, has put them to use once before, in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/15/tom-hanks-uncommon-type-some-stories-book-review-short-stories">short story collection</a> that came out in 2017. On that occasion his publisher ventured that “the two-time Oscar winner is as talented a writer as he is an actor”. His screen agent might have had something to say. He writes well enough – there are many artfully constructed scenes here – and what he doesn’t know about the world of this book you’d imagine is not worth knowing; but that quality that he possesses in so much range and depth on screen – the ability to make you care deeply about lives not your own – is quite often elusive on the page.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/01/the-making-of-another-major-motion-picture-masterpiece-review-tom-hanks-myth-busting-movie-novel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>BBC broadcaster is synonymous with the event after more than 20 years as TV’s face of the world snooker championship</p><p>This year’s World Snooker Championship has produced what some fans of the sport would consider a long overdue wind of change on the baize. Sure, Mark Selby can cement his place in history on bank holiday Monday if he wins the title for a fifth time, but the sight of two players under the age of 30 in Luca Brecel and Si Jiahui playing out a world semi-final felt refreshing if nothing else, given how the sport has been dominated by the same clutch of players for so long.</p><p>Sports thrive on progression and evolution when it comes to the stars of the show – but away from the action, consistency is a valuable commodity. And for all the change snooker is trying to undergo, there is one bastion of consistency who perhaps never quite gets the credit they truly deserve. In an ever-changing world, nothing screams comforting reassurance like Hazel Irvine presenting the snooker on the BBC. She will utter the first words to the new champion of the world on Monday evening and these days anyone other than Irvine on hand for the biggest moments that matter in snooker feels wrong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/01/give-praise-for-hazel-irvines-cool-presence-in-the-heat-of-the-crucible">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We tried and tried, but failed and failed. Yet the fertility industry kept offering us hope, so long as we offered them money</p><p>Is it possible to become addicted to fertility treatment? When does spending tens of thousands of pounds on IVF with no guarantee that it will actually work become a gambling problem? These are the questions I am searching for answers to as I meet virtually with a doctor from a top London fertility clinic. “Women are a mystery,” he jokes. I smile politely into the tiny camera on my laptop. I had been considering treatment with his clinic and we have spent the last hour running through my history of infertility, or rather, in my case, incomplete fertility.</p><p>My husband and I have been trying for nine years to have a baby. I’m quite good at getting pregnant, especially when we first started trying, but I can’t seem to stay pregnant. I don’t know why. And as it turns out, neither do the experts. I have spent years seeking their help, and because IVF wasn’t available on the NHS in my area, I have paid thousands of pounds along the way in my relentless pursuit of pregnancy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/01/why-i-quit-ivf-fertility-business-money">Continue reading...</a>

## Like Ruth Gordon, I’m a big believer in giving away things that matter to you – whatever the cost | Emma Forrest

<p>The Harold and Maude actor shows us that spur of the moment acts of generosity can be truly life affirming</p><p>On the first day directing my first film came my first communication error. I’d asked the costume department to take a man’s shirt (which the lead character had stolen after a one night stand), and fashion it into something she fixes around her cat to stop it picking at its surgical stitches. Expecting it to look like a striped cotton bandage, I was presented with a cat wearing an immaculately tailored miniature button-down. In the end I took it off the cat, but I wish I’d made that work because, when I’ve occasionally daydreamed about the etymology of phrases, I’ve always felt drawn to “the shirt off my back”.</p><p>At the end of the shoot, my lead, Jemima Kirke, slipped off a diamond and ruby fox ring and handed it to me – the ring off her own finger! I was touched by the gesture and by the echo from a woman I’d cast as “me”: I’d done this same thing myself to friends when I felt they needed moral support, unhooking a bracelet or brooch and pressing it into their palm. It’s never the value of the jewellery that matters as much as the instant decision. Maybe it’s a sense of memory conversation with the ancestors who sewed valuables into their clothes as they fled expulsions, pogroms and ghettoes; letting the past know I feel safe enough in my own life to give my precious things away. I’d say I’ve lost three pieces of jewellery this way, but they’re the opposite of lost.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/01/like-ruth-gordon-im-a-big-believer-in-giving-away-things-that-matter-to-me-whatever-the-cost">Continue reading...</a>

## Antetokounmpo’s dismissal of Bucks’ failure offers healthy dose of perspective | Barry Glendenning

<p>Refreshing response to a question from the media was unlike much of the discourse surrounding elite professional sport</p><p>Almost certainly fed up while facing the press in the media centre of Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum last Wednesday night, Giannis Antetokounmpo made no attempt to disguise his utter contempt for the query he had just been asked to field. The Bucks basketball legend had fronted up before the ladies and gentlemen of the fourth estate after his team’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/26/nba-playoffs-knicks-cavaliers-warriors-kings-lakers-grizzlies" title="">elimination by the lowly ranked Miami Heat</a> after a five-game series, arguably one of the most seismic upsets in NBA playoff history. Antetokounmpo’s gaze was caught by Eric Nehm, the man from the Athletic on the Bucks beat, who kept his question fairly short and to the point. He had already asked it of Antetokounmpo’s coach and now wished to hear the player’s considered opinion. “Do you view this season as a failure?”</p><p>A protracted sigh from the top table was followed by an audible groan of “Oh my God”, as Antetokounmpo wearily rubbed his hands up his face and through his hair, in the manner of a man who can’t quite believe the absolute inanity of the question he’s just been asked. Countering with several of his own, rhetorical questions regarding the successes or failures his inquisitor might have enjoyed or endured in his professional life over the past 12 months, he proceeded to expound on his own idea of what constitutes failure, or if there’s even any such thing. “Michael Jordan played 15 years,” he said. “Won six championships. The other nine years was a failure? That’s what you’re telling me? I’m asking you a question, yes or no?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/01/giannis-antetokounmpos-milwaukee-bucks-nba-basketball">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Harry Kane faces big decision, Palace are throwback entertainers and Gary O’Neil shows humility amid success</p><p>Jack Grealish has stopped falling over. But it’s not just that. Grealish was fouled just twice against Fulham, neither of these the contact-seeking lunges that had for a while become a part of his game. Grealish isn’t necessarily cheating or diving when he does this. The take-the-foul routine is also a way of having your legs battered into a pulp over several years. Grealish carries the ball too well not to be tripped a lot. Contact will happen. Why not manage how that collision works, take the lightest of touches, fall well? But Grealish has started to stay up as well, to use his strength instead to terrorise and bully defenders. He was very good against Fulham, helping to make the opening goal, and just about surviving an ongoing battle with Kenny Tete, who was defending aggressively. Another thing here: the Fulham crowd barracked Grealish and he wagged his finger back at them. But the feeling was less outrage, more pantomime jeers, a kind of semi-buried respect. The other story of Grealish’s season is that he is now surely the most marketable English player in the league; and, grudgingly perhaps for some, one of the most likeable. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/30/fulham-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Fulham 1-2 Manchester City</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/30/liverpool-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Liverpool 4-3 Tottenham</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/30/manchester-united-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Manchester United 1-0 Aston Villa</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/01/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a chance to do beauty “admin” such as hair removal, body exfoliation or a put on a mask. Whether this routine needed a name is up for debate (I quite like it), but I have one caveat: most of the routines I’ve seen on TikTok seem to be more about products than the selfcare ritual itself. You can obviously pick what you do and how, but a weekly pamper ritual means scheduled and very welcome downtime: I do this on Monday nights.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/01/should-an-everything-shower-be-a-weekly-selfcare-ritual">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Over the years, female artists like Georgia O’Keeffe and Hilma af Klint have received scathing reviews. When will women stop being seen as easy targets?</p><p>In 1993, the reviews for Georgia O’Keeffe’s exhibition at London’s Hayward gallery came in. In the Independent, Andrew Graham-Dixon likened the American artist to a “commercial illustrator” who had “limited talents … but the ambition to be remembered as a Rembrandt”. The Evening Standard’s Brian Sewell said her works were “irredeemably amateur”. William Feaver of the Observer proclaimed that her paintings “made good monthly images on calendars”, while Hilton Kramer’s review in the Sunday Telegraph called her “grossly overrated”, adding that “her great personal beauty played a major role in the myth that now attaches to her name”.</p><p>Many of these comments are quoted in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/a-woman-s-art-that-men-refuse-to-see-2323850.html">an article by Beatrix Campbell</a>, published in the Independent in 1993, with the headline: A Woman’s Art That Men Refuse to See. Campbell argued for a more intellectual reading of O’Keeffe – complaining that “national newspaper art critics do not think it necessary to explain or empathise with … or to locate her in the history of American modernism”. This made me think about how so much art criticism is written from a male point of view, and the exceedingly wide gender imbalance that still exists within it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/01/what-did-the-critics-who-trashed-georgia-okeeffe-have-in-common-see-if-you-can-guess">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Commendably transparent documentary following poet and ex-con Marc Thompson, as he deals with past traumas and tries to overcome the obstacles that hamper his re-entry into society</p><p>When Marc Thompson speaks, his words roll off the tongue like poetry, their melodic and precise fluidity damningly conjuring the reality of racist victimisation. The force of nature that he is animates Maria Petschnig’s documentary, which juxtaposes Thompson’s daily rituals as an unhoused person in New York with his contemplation of his incarcerated past and the systemic obstacles that hamper his re-entry into society.</p><p>With no fixed address, Thompson eats and sleeps in his car; this is a precarious arrangement steeped in feelings of freedom as well as shame, a paradoxical and transient state that perfectly encapsulates the film’s title. Mostly observing Thompson from behind, the camera follows his trips to the gym, the laundromat, the library; he has written a collection of poetry drawn from his own life. The process of writing allows him to look deeper into his traumas, which include the accidental death of his eight-year-old brother, a tragic event that induces self-destructive behaviours on Thompson’s part.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/01/uncomfortably-comfortable-review-the-tough-life-of-being-unhoused-in-new-york">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Daniel Rachel imagines what the next Beatles album might have been like, with painstaking detail and great stories</p><p>For a baby boomer like me, 12 years old when the Beatles broke through in 1962 and a mere 19 when they called it a day in 1969, it’s curious to watch the love objects of my teenage years still being pored over by grownups more than 50 years later. Writers such as <a href="https://danielrachel.com/">Daniel Rachel</a> may be adults today but they’re nonetheless too young to have experienced the Beatles in real time. They know more about their story than I do because they’ve read a lot of the books. Not all of them of course. Nobody could do that.<br /><br />The first half of Rachel’s book is spent anatomising the discontents that set in once their manager Brian Epstein died in 1967, feelings that the four of them seemingly had to explain in every single interview they did for the rest of their lives. For 60s kids like me, it was neither a shock nor a mystery. In those days there were no bands with 40 years on the clock and therefore we had no expectation that this lot would continue. As McCartney points out, when a band are on the rise all the members’ energies are consumed by the climb. Once they plateau there’s fighting in the captain’s tower.</p><p>Nonetheless, as Rachel painstakingly shows in his account of how they worked in their post-touring years, they had an ability to operate under conditions of personal tension that would have buckled most bands. They bit their lips. When John Lennon said: “Yoko only wanted to be accepted as one of us,” nobody offered the obvious rejoinder. Sometimes they expressed themselves more forcibly. In one passage the author wonders whether John really could have thrown a brick the 75 metres (246ft) it would have taken to break the front window of Paul’s home in St John’s Wood. More often than not the Beatles wrapped their troubles in work. When John decided he wanted to record The Ballad of John and Yoko as the new Beatles single, Paul didn’t object. He played all the parts John couldn’t, which was most of them.<br /><br />The counterfactual second half of the book looks at the album that could arguably have followed<em>,</em> had they acted upon their plan to divide up the songwriting chores equally. It proposes a double album made up of songs that appeared on their early solo records. That means it contains everything from John’s Jealous Guy and George’s My Sweet Lord to Paul’s Maybe I’m Amazed and even Ringo’s It Don’t Come Easy. It tells the story of every one of those songs and, this being the Beatles, and there being nothing about the group that is not interesting, every tale seems touched by serendipity. According to US musician <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/05/he-was-central-to-music-history-the-forgotten-legacy-of-leon-russell">Leon Russell</a>, even George Harrison, the member most ambivalent about the Beatles’ specialness, had already made a tape of just such an album at the beginning of the 70s. Certainly there are lots of great records in this track listing. However, there isn’t one that wouldn’t have been better if it had been recorded by the Beatles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/01/the-lost-album-of-the-beatles-review-daniel-rachel-deeply-researched-what-ifs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Diane and David Rowsell were looking forward to spending more time with the grandchildren.

## Richard Sharp is a public figure and fair game for satire. The use of antisemitic tropes is not | Dave Rich

<p>The Guardian was right to remove and delete the cartoon published on Saturday, but with all that is known about anti-Jewish symbols and images, this should not be happening</p><p>Other than his closest friends, it is unlikely that anybody would complain if a Guardian cartoonist drew Boris Johnson as a gorilla. All’s fair in political satire, cartoonists are expected to be scurrilous, and the former prime minister is fair game. But if that same cartoonist drew a black politician in simian form, it would be obviously racist.</p><p>This is the principle to hold in mind when decoding Martin Rowson’s cartoon of outgoing BBC chair Richard Sharp, who is Jewish, in Saturday’s Guardian. Centuries of anti-Jewish caricaturists (and to be clear, I do not accuse Rowson or the Guardian of falling into this category) have generated an extensive library of visual tropes to convey their hatred of, and disgust for, Jews. This is partly because antisemites face a challenge: how do you incite hatred against a group of people who are not always readily identifiable? Not every Jew wears religious clothing or “looks Jewish” to every beholder.</p><p>Dr Dave Rich is author of Everyday Hate: How antisemitism is built into our world and how you can change it</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/01/richard-sharp-guardian-martin-rowson-cartoon-antisemitism">Continue reading...</a>

## We want to rent out our Manchester house when we move but what are the tax implications?

<p>I have a new job in London, although we cannot afford to buy a property there</p><p><strong>Q</strong> My partner and I currently own a property in Manchester. We purchased the house in 2018 and the value has risen from £150,000 to £200,000. I have been offered a job in London and will be moving there in three months with my partner. We can’t afford to buy in London, so we would like to rent out our house in Manchester to cover the mortgage. This is to ensure that we can stay on the property ladder. What kinds of fees and taxes can we expect to pay? And would there be any implications if and when we come to sell the house?<br /><strong>LG</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> The first thing you need to do is ask your mortgage lender whether it will give you permission to rent out your house. If it will, there may be a modest fee for its “consent to let”. However, if letting your house is a complete no-no in your lender’s view, you will probably have to switch to a buy-to-let mortgage. However, this will be possible only if the loan (ie what is left on your current mortgage) represents less than 75% of the current value of your home. In addition, the rent you get on it needs to be at least 125% the mortgage you pay. This is not based on wishful thinking but on an assessment by a professional lettings agent, who will tell your prospective lender whether you are likely to achieve that level of rental income. If it doesn’t, one option would be to switch from a repayment mortgage to an interest-only one, which makes the monthly payment lower.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/01/we-want-to-rent-out-our-manchester-house-when-we-move-but-what-are-the-tax-implications">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the country gears up for June elections, women in politics speak out about the ‘suffocating’ sexism, abuse and intimidation they face and how they refuse to be silenced</p><p>When Femi Claudius Cole decided to form a political party, to address what she saw as Sierra Leone’s slow economic development and poor governance, she knew it would be tough. A former nurse, she had no experience in politics and people told her no one would vote for an unknown. But she could not have predicted quite how gruelling it would be: leaving her spending time in jail and fighting for her reputation.</p><p>The Unity party, registered by Cole in 2017, failed to win any seats in the 2018 general election. But she persevered, travelling around the country offering medical treatment with a surgeon, giving interviews and building up a social media following. In 2021 she co-founded the <a href="https://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/sierra-leones-consortium-of-progressive-political-parties-signs-memo-ahead-of-2023-elections/">Consortium of Progressive Political Parties</a>, an opposition alliance. “People thought that once I lost, I would disappear into thin air – they didn’t know me,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/01/women-fight-for-equality-in-sierra-leone-politics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Unsuccessful US college applicants have started having cathartic parties to ‘celebrate’. I think they might be on to something</p><p>High school students in the US are tackling the brutal process of college applications with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/25/style/college-rejection-parties.html">rejection parties</a>, the New York Times reported last week. At one school, students bring along a printout of their college rejections, ceremonially feed them into a shredder, then get an ice-cream; there is a prize for the most rejected. It sounds wonderful: a cathartic, collective “screw you” to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/books/review/selingo-korn-levitz-college-admissions.html">a broken system</a>, using fun to salve the pain.</p><p>I wonder if owning rejection is easier in the US, where there is at least a partial sense that failure is OK; it’s considered a learning opportunity and a key part of the origin story. The Silicon Valley motto “fail fast, fail often” took hold because failure was seen as indicative of audacity and a willingness to try. Rejection is a particularly stinging subset of failure, but the principle remains: you took the shot; it didn’t pay off; you try again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/01/failure-isnt-shameful-in-fact-its-the-perfect-reason-to-have-an-ice-cream">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From group hikes around the towns of the north-west to a seaside stroll in Snowdonia, there’s an event for every taste in 2023</p><p>May is national walking month – a good excuse to do something you’ve been putting off, or to expand your repertoire of rambles. The weather is perfect for hiking, the days lengthening, and spring flowers greeting walkers in rural spots. Walking cleans and heals the brain and body as well as the environment, and many festivals are designed to welcome those taking to the outdoors for the first time. A 20-minute walk each day can reduce the risk of preventable conditions including certain cancers, depression, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Britain is arguably <em>the</em> great walking nation. About two-thirds of us already head out to stretch our legs once a week. We’re lucky to have public footpaths and walking clubs in urban areas as well as wild and pretty places to explore.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/01/10-great-uk-walking-festivals-for-spring-and-summer">Continue reading...</a>

When Balanchine’s health began to fail, in his mid-70s, he resisted making a will, not thinking that the hundreds of ballets he had created would live on without him. When the IRS posthumously valued his repertory, it decided that the maximum shelf life of even his greatest ballets was just 15 years.</p><p>Yet today, almost exactly 40 years after Balanchine’s death, his works are as popular as ever. New York City Ballet (NYCB), the company he founded, has just announced its 75th anniversary season, with dozens of performances of his works. Masterful ballets such as Serenade, Symphony in C and Agon are still regularly danced around the world. This summer, the Australian Ballet comes to the UK to perform his Jewels. When Carlos Acosta marks his 50th birthday on stage in July, it is Balanchine’s Apollo that he will dance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/01/george-balanchine-dance-god-controlling-monster-fat">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Great Coco lies 55km from India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands; Beijing has denied it is involved in building a surveillance post there</p><p>Since the early 1990s, Myanmar’s Great Coco – a small, remote island in the Bay of Bengal – has been at the centre of intrigue. Rumour had it that the island was home to a Chinese intelligence facility, a claim lacking hard evidence. Now concerns over the island, and its uses, have re-emerged.</p><p>Satellite images taken in January 2023 show telltale signs of military modernisation, according to a report by the thinktank Chatham House. There’s a newly lengthened 2,300-metre runway and radar station, two new hangars, what appears to be an accommodation block, and a new causeway linking to a smaller island. At the tip of the island is evidence of land clearing efforts, suggesting further construction work is to come.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/01/military-construction-on-myanmars-great-coco-island-prompts-fears-of-chinese-involvement">Continue reading...</a>

In a deal done with the palace in 2011, the government reformed the funding mechanism for the monarchy and in the process removed the need for a<strong> </strong>regular debate around the grant they are given. And as McClenaghan discovers, it is not easy to find out exactly what each of the working royals do in return for the generous settlement. So she turns to an unofficial source: a 91-year-old man and his comprehensive scrapbooks that span decades of royal engagements.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/may/01/cost-of-the-crown-part-1-valuing-the-family-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Head of Russia’s Wagner group warns Ukrainian counterattack could turn into ‘tragedy’ for Russia; Pope Francis says he is involved in plan to end the conflict </p><p><strong>The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has warned that an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/30/ukraine-primed-for-crucial-offensive">expected Ukrainian counteroffensive</a> could turn into a “tragedy” for Russia, and complained that his fighters lacked ammunition</strong>, in an interview with pro-Kremlin war correspondent Semyon Pegov. Prigozhin, whose group is spearheading Russia’s attack on the embattled city of Bakhmut, predicted a Ukrainian counterattack in mid-May and said Wagner had <strong>“</strong>only 10-15% of the shells that we need.”</p><p><strong>Pope Francis has said that the Vatican is involved in a peace mission to try to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</strong> “I am willing to do everything that has to be done. There is a mission in course now but it is not yet public. When it is public, I will reveal it,” Pope Francis told reporters during a flight home after a three-day visit to Hungary.</p><p><strong>The Russian army replaced its highest ranking general in charge of logistics, after days of rumours about the sacking of Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev</strong>. In a statement, the Russian defence ministry said Alexei Kuzmenkov – a former official from the National Guard – had replaced Mizintsev as “deputy defence minister of the Russian Federation, responsible for the logistical support of the Armed Forces.” The statement did not say why Mizintsev was replaced after just seven months in the job.</p><p><strong>Ukraine said its troops were holding on to parts of the eastern city of Bakhmut</strong>. “The enemy is unable to take control over the city, despite throwing all its forces into the battle and having some success,” said Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar. Russia’s defence ministry earlier said its forces had taken four blocks in western Bakhmut on Sunday, according to Reuters, which could not independently confirm the claim.</p><p><strong>Four people have been killed from an overnight Ukrainian strike on the Russian border village of Suzemka</strong>, the governor of Russia’s western Bryansk region said on Sunday. “Two more civilians have been found and removed from the rubble. Unfortunately, both of them died,” local governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram.</p><p><strong>Russian commanders have likely started “punishing breaches in discipline by detaining the offending troops in ‘Zindans’ which are improvised cells consisting of holes in the ground covered with a metal grille</strong>,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. The army is thought to have been using “increasingly draconian” measures to enforce discipline since autumn 2022, the MoD said, and “especially since Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov assumed command of the operation in January 2023.”</p><p><strong>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had a “</strong>long and meaningful” telephone conversation with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. The French presidency said Macron had reaffirmed France’s support for Ukraine to Zelenskiy, and that Macron had given an update on European coordination to give Ukraine military help.</p><p><strong>Funerals were held for some of the 23 people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/30/ukrainians-struggle-to-comprehend-strikes-on-their-homes">who were killed on Friday</a> when two Russian missiles hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city Uman</strong>.
