  <p id="IPyMv1">Twitter had plenty of problems in February (the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591755/twitter-outage-down-rate-limit-dm-tweetdeck">rate limit debacle</a>) and March (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/6/23627444/twitter-down-outage-images-links-error-message-api">when it broke all links and pictures</a>), but through April, the service didn’t register outages of similar significance. Now it’s May, and the streak has ended early as a number of people (including many <em>Verge </em>staffers) report the <a href="http://Twitter.com">Twitter.com</a> desktop website has logged them out without warning and won’t let them log back in.</p>
<p id="lQhPEi">It’s unclear what’s causing the problem, and in place of a functional PR department, Twitter responds to press inquiries with only a poop emoji, so who knows when things may be fixed or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/6/23627875/twitter-outage-how-it-happened-engineer-api-shut-down">if a single engineer has managed to crash something big</a>... again.</p>

  <p id="NvR5or">Mastodon is making it easier for newcomers to create an account on the platform. On Monday, the <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/05/a-new-onboarding-experience-on-mastodon/">decentralized network announced</a> that it will start directing new users to create an account on mastodon.social instead of prompting them to choose from one of the thousands of other servers on the platform.</p>
<p id="tyiAVn">This update doesn’t mean that Mastodon’s taking away the ability for new users to sign up for an account in a specific community, though. It will simply present two separate options on its signup page: “Join mastodon.social” or “Pick my own server.” The service’s flagship mastodon.social server is the platform’s largest, but the network notes that users can swap instances at any time.</p>

  <p id="j4cUFM">Microsoft has reworked its Xbox Home UI to better accommodate background images and simplify access to key parts of the Xbox dashboard. The software giant halted a test of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/14/23683586/microsoft-xbox-home-ui-backgrounds-feedback">upcoming Xbox Home UI</a> last month to rework it, and the result <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/05/01/xbox-insiders-your-feedback-shapes-the-new-home-experience/">looks like a great improvement</a> for Xbox owners.</p>
<p id="JRlnAh">The new Xbox Home UI moves the tiles of apps and games down further, so there’s a lot more space to see a background. The tile sizes have also been reduced, and there’s a new responsive game art that will update the background when you hover over certain games and apps.</p>
