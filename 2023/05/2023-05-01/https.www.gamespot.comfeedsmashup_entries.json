Since its debut on the Nintendo Entertainment System nearly 40 years ago, Zelda has not only represented the very best that video games have to offer, but has regularly pushed the medium forward with new game mechanics, the transition from 2D to 3D, and open-ended and player-focused approaches to world design. In this episode of The Lore You Know--part of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamespot-has-an-exciting-new-video-lineup-and-it-starts-this-week/1100-6513702/\">GameSpot's fresh video lineup</a>--join us as we journey through the history of Zelda, going all the way back to the franchise's earliest days up to the brand-new Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Legend of Zelda hit the ball out of the park in 1986, introducing gameplay elements and characters that are <em>still </em>used today. Its enormous critical and commercial success didn't stop Nintendo from experimenting with the format, however, leading to the contentious Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and while A Link to the Past took Zelda back to a more-familiar structure a few years later, some of Zelda II's features--like Link's downward sword thrust--would actually go on to be influential in a variety of other games outside of the series.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/history-of-the-legend-of-zelda/1100-6513718/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/history-of-the-legend-of-zelda/1100-6513718/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-01 15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "History of The Legend of Zelda", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1352/13527689/4131249-zelda_site.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> The Legend of Zelda is one of the most beloved series in all of gaming.

Although much of the trailer was naturally focused on new legend <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-ballistic-abilities-lore-and-everything-we-know/1100-6513514/\">Ballistic</a>, what really stole the show was a new POI that appears to have been built on World's Edge.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Over the weekend, the official Apex Legends Twitter account temporarily changed its display name to \"Apex Games Museum,\" posting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1652704477877530633\">a series</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1652734673942978562\">cryptic tweets</a> that ended with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1652767151680536577\">a two-minute look</a> at the new POI, which seems to have taken the place of Skyhook on World's Edge. But there were plenty of other surprises included in the Arsenal gameplay trailer, including another look at <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-17-arsenal-launch-trailer-shows-off-ballistics-slick-battlefield-tactics/1100-6513593/\">Ballistic's curious abilities</a> and a redeploy balloon being used in a manner that was previously unheard of.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The trailer made mention of updates to Ranked Mode, but did not reveal any additional details, so the exact changes being made to the mode are currently unknown. What we do know, however, is that Apex Legends is getting a new Weapons Mastery system. The system appears to have six tiers for each weapon, with a unique reward that can be claimed upon completing each tier. This new feature will likely be well-received by dedicated daily players who tear through battle passes and LTE reward tracks at lightspeed, have already maxed out their account level, and are hungry for something else to grind for besides Ranked Mode rewards. (Though assuming these unnamed updates to Ranked Mode are an improvement, grinding for Ranked rewards may be more appealing.)</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-17-gameplay-trailer-teases-new-poi-weapons-mastery-system-and-firing-range-rework/1100-6513724/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-17-gameplay-trailer-teases-new-poi-weapons-mastery-system-and-firing-range-rework/1100-6513724/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-01 13:49:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "See Wonderful Moment Hayden Christensen, Huge Hockey Fan, Was Informed That The Leafs Advanced To Second Round", "description": "<p>Actor Hayden Christensen, who played Anakin/Darth Vader in the Star Wars series, is also a huge fan of ice hockey and specifically the Toronto Maple Leafs.
