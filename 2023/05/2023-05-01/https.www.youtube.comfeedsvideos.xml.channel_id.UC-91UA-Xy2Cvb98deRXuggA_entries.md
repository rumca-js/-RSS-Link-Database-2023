A CEO at the Society for Human Resource Management made a shocking move when he outsourced an employee's job to India after she asked for it to be remote, saving 40% on labor costs. This highlights a potential risk for workers who ask for permanent remote work.

Facts
🌎 Offshoring: Hiring someone in India saved the company around 40% in labor costs, according to the CEO.
💻 Remote Work: Some tech companies have hired remote workers overseas amid layoffs, and offshoring positions overseas could see a surge as companies look to reduce costs.
💼 Society for Human Resource Management: The company has a hybrid remote work policy that allows employees to work from home on Friday and Monday.
🌍 Global Competition: If more US businesses open their job listings to overseas workers, white-collar workers could find themselves competing with a global pool of applicants.
🚨 Risk for Workers: Asking for permanent remote work could lead to a worker's job being outsourced.
📉 Decline in Remote Work: The number of remote positions offered in the US has been steadily declining, especially as more companies impose return-to-office policies.
💻🌍 Tech Industry: US tech companies are turning to overseas labor where the average compensation for tech jobs is often far lower than in the US.
