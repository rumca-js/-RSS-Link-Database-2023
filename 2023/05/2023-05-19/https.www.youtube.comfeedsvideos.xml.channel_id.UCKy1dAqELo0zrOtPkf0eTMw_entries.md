In today's Daily Fix:
Mortal Kombat 1, the second reboot of the long-running fighting game franchise, was just announced yesterday, but today we have a leak of what's coming in the first DLC pack. Aside from more MK karacters, there's a crossover with Garth Ennis' The Boys. That's right, Homelander will be taking on Liu Kang and friends in the DLC drop. None of this is officially announced, and we can only assume that this Homelander will be modeled after Antony Starr from the Prime Video adaptation. In Zelda news, the first patch has gone live, and it fixes a pretty major bug that stopped some players from continuing with the main story. PC gamers can play Death Stranding for free via the Epic Game Store (and sign up to their rewards program). And finally, The Wonderful 101 Remastered is getting the DLC promised way back when it was just a kickstarter campaign.

## Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny Review

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny reviewed by Siddhant Adlakha. Opens in theaters on June 30, 2023.

By yanking Indiana Jones out of retirement yet again, for a fifth (and hopefully final) movie, Disney proves that some things should be allowed to end. Or, at the very least, it proves that a franchise resurrection should spend at least some of its 154 minutes doing something other than trying desperately to justify its own existence. Earnest final efforts from Harison Ford and John Williams couldn’t rescue a movie so directionless and haphazard, or action that fails to recapture the swashbuckling joys of the originals. By asking why Indy is on this adventure in the first place, and what the character gains on the other side of it, Dial of Destiny concocts paradoxical answers that fail to meet in the middle. It’s a film about letting go of the past and moving forward, but one that refuses to do the same.

Duplicating items such as diamonds or other high-priced items in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is technically an exploitation cheat, but that doesn't mean it's not extremely useful to make a ton of rupees incredibly fast. These duplication methods are almost certainly going to get patched out in the near future, as it kind of breaks the game economy. So if you want this to work, you’ll have to ensure not to update your game beyond version 1.1.0 by turning off automatic software updates on your Nintendo Switch.

## Fast X Ending Explained & Mid-Credits Explained | Why Death Still Doesn’t Exist in the Fast Saga | C

Fast X is in theaters now and already fans are talking about the movie’s ending. The tenth movie in the Fast and Furious franchise is a setup to Fast 11 due in 2025 and its cliffhanger style ending definitely sets up the next installment. And once again, the Fast Saga shows us how real character deaths aren’t really a thing in this franchise. So if you’re looking for the Fast X ending explained, we’ll break down where Dante Reyes, the unhinged villain played by Jason Momoa, is going to pop up next and what he has planned for the Fast Family. So join IGN producer Jesse B. Gill for Canon Fodder and the full Fast X ending explained and Fast X mid-credits scene explained. 

When The Fast and the Furious first debuted in 2001, it was a very different kind of movie than Fast and Furious 10, a.k.a. Fast X 2023. The saga has evolved into an epic story about Dom Torreto and his extended family and Fast and Furious 10 marks the beginning of the end of the Fast franchise. 

There is a Fast X mid-credits scene and we will break down what it means for the next installment of the Fast Saga. Dom, Little Brian, Tej, Roman, Ramsey and Han will all see their stories continued in Fast 1, as will Hobbs and Shaw, but one member of the Torreto family won’t return for the next adventure. We have the recap and the breakdown of what this major death in the family could mean.

LEGO 2K Drive reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X. Also available on Xbox One, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.

"One part The Crew 2, one part Mario Kart, and one thousand parts… LEGO parts, LEGO 2K Drive is a wild and whimsical all-ages kart racer that’s buried itself under my skin like the pointed edge of rogue plastic brick underfoot in a messy kid’s bedroom. Better still, it’s one that embraces the total creative freedom real LEGO affords like few games before it, with an incredible custom vehicle creation tool that’s just about worth the price of admission alone. The current inability to share those designs with others is disappointing – particularly in the shadow of another tedious microtransaction store – but LEGO 2K Drive is certainly the fastest and funniest way to rock out with your blocks out in recent memory."
