<p>This week Blizzard announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-pve-mode-is-being-scrapped-blizzard-explains-what-happened-and-why/1100-6514242/">dropping Overwatch 2's eagerly anticipated PvE element: Hero Missions</a>. These replayable, story-driven missions would make use of a Talent System, where Heroes would level up and gain access to new abilities. While PvE elements and missions will appear as seasonal content, a lot of the Overwatch community is unhappy with the mode being dropped completely, with many suggesting that the '2' in Overwatch 2 hung on the game's PvE.</p><p>In this week's Spot On, Lucy and Tam discuss the ways that multiplayer games have tried, succeeded, and failed to tell impactful stories, and suggest ways that the Overwatch 2 team could explore storytelling going forward.</p><div>          </div><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into single topic as opposed to recapping al the news.

<p>Blizzard has recently opened up about the cancellation of Hero Mode and has teased an unannounced co-op mode for its shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a>. This comes just days after it was announced that it would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-pve-mode-is-being-scrapped-blizzard-explains-what-happened-and-why/1100-6514242/">scrapping its PvE Hero Mode</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23952480/">Blizzard blog post</a>, we know Blizzard plans to add Story Missions to Overwatch 2. These missions are described as "fast-paced, co-op gameplay, as well as story, cinematics, and cutscenes that expand the world of Overwatch." The blog post also says that these missions will take place on huge maps and players will have new enemies to fight. Story Missions will become available to players during Season 6.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Story Mode, Blizzard talked a bit more about Hero Mode, which was a mode that would allow players to upgrade their favorite heroes via skill trees and has replayable PvE elements. From the very beginning of Overwatch, the dev team considered themselves an FPS MMO and had a "crawl, walk, run plan." According to Blizzard, the crawl phase was the game itself while the walk portion was introducing PvE, and the Run would be the MMO.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-co-op-content-teased-pve-changes-and-mmo-aspirations-further-discussed/1100-6514403/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom - How To Get To The Sky Islands

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, the explorable world is divided into three layers: the terrain, the depths, and the sky. You'll reach the terrain just by following the story, and you can jump into the depths by way of a chasm whenever you feel like it. But how do you get back up to the sky? That's a bit less obvious, so we've decided to cover it with this Zelda guide for your benefit.</p><h2>How to get back to the sky in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p dir="ltr">You have a few choices for getting back to the Sky Islands, though most of them involve progressing the story further until you have the right device or unlock a certain tower.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Use Skyview Towers</h3><p dir="ltr">The easiest way is using <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-skyview-towers-locations-guide/1100-6514025/">Skyview Towers</a> to launch yourself into the sky, so you can glide to a nearby island and unlock a shrine for fast travel purposes. The sky map layout means that not every Skyview Tower can actually help you get to an island, though. The Lookout Landing and Hyrule Field towers, for example, are inconveniently placed <em>just</em> out of reach of any island and most small rock masses. Even with upgraded stamina, you‚Äôll still lose too much altitude.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-how-to-get-to-the-sky-islands/1100-6514404/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, you'll want to find Zonai Device Dispensers in order to trade your Construct Horns or Zonai Charges for portable Zonai Devices--colloquially known as all the cool stuff the ancient civilization left behind. Things like wings, fans, flame emitters, and more can be used to make some truly incredible contraptions, and even in the game's first week since launch, we've seen some <a href="https://twitter.com/RinHara5aki/status/1659198151243202561">remarkable feats of engineering</a>. But none of it is possible without Zonai Devices. In order to stay stocked up on those items, here's where to find Device Dispensers all over Tears of the Kingdom.</p><h2>Zelda Device Dispenser locations</h2><p>Device Dispensers are sort of like gumball machines--in fact, they're very obviously made to look and behave like them. Go into your inventory and choose to hold up to five <strong>Zonai Charges</strong> or <strong>Construct Horns</strong>--like you would when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-recipes-list-and-cookbook/1100-6514134/">cooking</a>--and out will roll random Zonai Devices. The more tradeable items you have, the more you can stock up on Zonai Devices, so it's important to pick them up whenever you can--they're often dropped by enemies.</p><p>We've found many Device Dispensers in our travels, and though we suspect there are even more tucked away, the number of Device Dispenser locations we have already gives you plenty of options for pit stops during your travels. Use our gallery of images below to find the one nearest to where you are--or where you're heading--and get trading.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-zonai-device-dispenser-locations/1100-6514402/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Grossest And Most Gruesome Mortal Kombat Fatalities

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3963047-mkthumbnail.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Gruesome and sometimes gross, Mortal Kombat fatalities are artistic displays of gore that have only become more elaborate with each passing entry. Mortal Kombat‚Äôs fatalities have always shocking, but improvements in graphics and more realistic visuals have allowed the signature, match-ending moves to reach new heights of brutality in the two most recent games: Mortal Kombat X and 11. Chances are the newly announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-preorder-guide/1100-6514329/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> will find new and shocking ways to end matches in even more stylistic forms of bloodshed when it launches September 18. </p><p>We've rounded up the grossest and most gruesome Mortal Kombat fatalities across the franchise. All of our picks can be found in Mortal Kombat X or Mortal Kombat 11. To be fair, all fatalities are unsettling in their own unique ways, but we picked the finishers most likely to trigger gag reflexes. However, everyone has different, er, tastes so be sure to comment below with your picks for the grossest Mortal Kombat fatalities if we didn‚Äôt include it here.</p><p><em>Shop Mortal Kombat games:</em></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Kombat-11-Ultimate-PlayStation-4/dp/B08L6FZM6D?tag=gs-buybutton-20">Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate (console)</a></li><li><a href="https://shop-links.co/1808748609800386189?u1=subid_value">Mortal Kombat XL (console)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/search?search=mortal kombat">Mortal Kombat series (PC)</a></li></ul></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Jax: "T-Wrecks" (Mortal Kombat X)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3963071-1-mortalkombat.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Let‚Äôs start things off with the series‚Äô beloved cyborg, Jax. Jax‚Äôs T-Wrecks fatality displays the character's creative side: Instead of ripping his opponent‚Äôs arms off, Jax shoves those upper extremities into their torso so they resemble a T-Rex. To really sell the dinosaur effect, Jax then rips their jaw open, leaving just enough of the upper half attached so they now have a much wider smile. The whole thing ends with Jax extinguishing his cigar on the now very dead challenger‚Äôs tongue while blood gurgles from their exposed throat.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Jacqui Briggs: "Nothin‚Äô But Neck" (Mortal Kombat 11)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3963072-2-mortalkombat.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Following in her father‚Äôs footsteps, Jacqui Briggs--daughter of Jax Briggs--joined the series in Mortal Kombat X. Despite being a relatively new character in the series, Jacqui already has some truly brutal finisher moves, but her Mortal Kombat 11 fatality ‚ÄúNothin‚Äô But Neck‚Äù is arguably the gnarliest in her repertoire.</p><p>After punching her enemy‚Äôs head into their body and blasting a hole in their stomach, Jacqui casually turns around, lobs a device over her shoulder and into the opponent‚Äôs open neck. The device activates and a blue energy shield bisects the limp body, with the still-beating heart visible through the transparent energy wall.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bo Rai Cho: "Bottom‚Äôs Up" (Mortal Kombat X)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3963073-3-mortalkombat.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Fatalities from Mortal Kombat‚Äôs drunken master, Bo Rai Cho, are often more comical or slapstick, but ‚ÄúBottom‚Äôs Up‚Äù from Mortal Kombat X showcases the character‚Äôs brutality. Bo Rai Cho shoves the neck of his trusty booze jug into his opponent‚Äôs mouth--probably breaking teeth and facial bones in the process--who then have no choice but to drink down the liquid. But like all ill-advised chugging, the opponent then vomits the drink back up‚Ä¶ and keeps vomiting until their entrails spill out. They collapse to the ground, and Bo Rai Cho stomps on their stomach, sending even more of their intestines bursting forth from their mouth.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Takeda: "Whip it Good" (Mortal Kombat X)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3963074-4-mortalkombat.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Takeda‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhip it Good‚Äù is yet another literal gut-wrenching fatality. Takeda opens the assault by quickly severing the enemy‚Äôs arms with his bladed whip, then launches the whip into their throat with the blades retracted. Even if you‚Äôve never seen a Mortal Kombat fatality before, you can guess what‚Äôs coming next: The whip‚Äôs blades extend and pierce the opponent‚Äôs innards, then Takeda jerks the whip back and their insides become outsides. It‚Äôs an unpleasant display, but this fatality is actually a decent tutorial on how to gut a fish!</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Geras: "Peeling Back "(Mortal Kombat 11)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3963075-5-mortalkombat.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Geras is a powerful fighter with the ability to manipulate the very sands of time, and--as his Mortal Kombat 11 fatality ‚ÄúPeeling Back‚Äù clearly displays--the strength to rip a person in half like he‚Äôs peeling a banana.</p><p dir="ltr">Geras punches the losing character into a pillar of sand, walks up, grabs their hand and rips off the front half of their body. What really seals the brutality of this attack is the yelp of pain Geras‚Äô unfortunate target lets out after the first yank splits their arm--and the effortless smile on Geras‚Äô face as he rips them in half, their heart, lungs, and other organs trailing behind.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Baraka: "Food for Thought" (Mortal Kombat 11)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3963076-6-mortalkombat.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Baraka is arguably one of the most violent characters in the Mortal Kombat franchise (which is saying something), so it‚Äôs no surprise he makes our list. I mean, the dude has retractable bone blades embedded in his forearms, after all. However, despite his violent notoriety, Baraka‚Äôs most unpleasant fatality is surprisingly uncomplicated.</p><p dir="ltr">While other fatalities are more elaborate, "Food For Thought‚Äôs" simplicity lets the grossest details standout--like the sinewy ‚Äúcheese pull‚Äù of the facial tissue as Baraka removes it; the wet plop the flesh makes when it hits the ground; or the final slow-motion shot of Baraka biting into his victim‚Äôs skewered brain matter.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Shang Tsung: "Kondemned To The Damned" (Mortal Kombat 11)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3963077-7-mortalkombat.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>As one of the series‚Äô long-running antagonists and the host of the original Mortal Kombat tournament, Shang Tsung‚Äôs fatalities are always appropriately evil, but ‚ÄúKondemned To The Damned‚Äù from Mortal Kombat 11 is particularly cruel. Shang Tsung manifests magical chains that suspend his opponent over a fiery portal through which a duo of zombies appear. The zombies tear open the challenger‚Äôs stomach and greedily desmbowl them by the fistful while they cry out in pain--until the ghastly torturers tear off the opponent‚Äôs face, reach into their body cavity, and wrench out their skeleton whole.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ermac: "Inner Workings" (Mortal Kombat X)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3963078-8-mortalkombat.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>You might‚Äôve noticed a pattern by now, but we find it pretty gross when someone‚Äôs guts come out of their mouth. Of all the fatalities to feature organ upchucking, Ermac‚Äôs ‚ÄúInner Workings‚Äù is one of the most extreme. Ermac magically levitates the other fighter in the air, then twists and crushes their body. As if mangling their limbs and breaking every bone in their body wasn‚Äôt enough, the telekinetic ninja then unspools his enemy‚Äôs digestive system out through their mouth, and crushes it on the ground. In case you weren‚Äôt convinced Ermac‚Äôs opponent is dead by this point, the final shot of them suspended in air with their remaining intestines dangling from their mouth makes it pretty clear.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sindel: Hair Today Gone Tomorrow (Mortal Kombat 11)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3963079-9-mortalkombat.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>We chose most of the fatalities on this because of what happens to the losing fighter, but we picked Sindel‚Äôs ‚ÄúHair Today Gone Tomorrow‚Äù fatality from Mortal Kombat 11 because of how gross it is for the winner. Sindel‚Äôs long hair isn‚Äôt just for show, it‚Äôs also a deadly weapon. She can extend her silver locks and pierce her enemy‚Äôs flesh--which is exactly what she does in this fatality. First, her hair travel‚Äôs down the enemy‚Äôs throat, out the stomach, and weaves and coils in and out of her opponent‚Äôs body until it pierces the back of their head and exits through their eye sockets. Then, of course, the hair strands constrict and slice Sindel‚Äôs foe to pieces.</p><p dir="ltr">The evisceration is brutal, sure, but what makes this one extra unsettling to us is how messy it must be for Sindel to get all that blood, bile, and bone out of her hair‚Ä¶</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Triborg: ‚ÄúDeath Machine‚Äù (Mortal Kombat X)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3963080-10-mortalkombat.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Lastly, we have Triborg‚Äôs ‚ÄúDeath Machine‚Äù from Mortal Kombat X. To wrap up the fight, Triborg transforms into a giant meat processing machine that reels the opponent in with harpoon cables, then tears open their guts with a giant saw blade while platform slowly crushes down on them. The platform finally slams down in a burst of blood--and out pops a pulsating cube of meat. Somehow, the enemy character‚Äôs face managed to stay intact through the process.</p><p dir="ltr">Death Machine is admittedly one of Mortal Kombat‚Äôs more outlandish--and comical--fatalities, but it‚Äôs still pretty gross when you think about the engineering involved to get all that flesh compacted into such a neat--albeit squishy--little cube.</p></h3></p><br />

<p dir="ltr">As June approaches, Prime Video is preparing to introduce a range of new TV shows and movies. Starting from June 1, viewers can look forward to a lineup of titles set to debut throughout the month, offering a wide variety of entertainment choices to enjoy.</p><p dir="ltr">On June 27, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-m3gan/1100-6510309/">M3GAN</a> comes to Prime Video. Directed by Gerard Johnstone (Housebound), and written by Akela Cooper (Malignant, The Nun 2), the movie poses the question: Who would have thought that if you put an unexpectedly killer AI in an American Girl doll, there might be some drawbacks and unexpected consequences? Thrills, chills, and spills are ahead in this movie where--if you can believe it--things do not go well after a roboticist who becomes the caretaker of her orphaned niece sees an opportunity.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Earlier in the month, T√°r hits Prime Video on June 6. Starring Cate Blanchett as the titular renowned musician, Lydia T√°r, the movie chronicles how her life begins to unravel just days away from recording the symphony that will elevate her career. Lydia seeks solace in classical music, her escape from the overwhelming cacophony. The movie is a ride, posing questions about the nature of artistic achievement and the complexities of human behavior in the face of power and ambition.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-prime-video-in-june-2023-m3gan-tar/1100-6514398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Howard Ashman-focused documentary, simply called Howard, has been on Disney+ since 2021 and was slated for removal--until fans rallied together and the company has now reversed its decision, <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/disney-backlash-removal-howard-documentary-little-mermaid-lgbtq-1235373329/">Deadline</a> reports. Disney released a slew of titles that were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-announces-removal-of-multiple-titles-from-streaming-services/1100-6514361/">scheduled to be removed towards the end of May</a>, including its Willow sequel series and more of its original films as well.</p><p>The news about Howard sparked a widespread backlash from both Disney fans and the LGTBQ+ community, especially with the removals coinciding with the eve of Pride Month and the release of Disney's live-action remake of The Little Mermaid on the same day.</p><div>          </div><p>Ashman was a pivotal force in saving Disney animation studios with his music and helped usher in the so-called Disney Renaissance with 1989's The Little Mermaid. Ashman's fights with producer Jeffrey Katzenberg are <a href="https://collider.com/jeffrey-katzenberg-disney-renaissance-impact-influence-explained/">something of a legend</a> among animation history circles.

<p>One of the main side activities in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> are the Shrine puzzles found throughout Hyrule. Some of the puzzles can be tricky, like the <strong>Zanmik Shrine</strong> and its "Scoop It Out" puzzle. This Shrine can be found in Hateno Village, which is located to the south of Mount Lanayru and to the east of East Necluda. Here's how to complete this shrine.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to solve the Zanmik Shrine puzzle in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p dir="ltr">Upon entering the Shrine, you will see the exit door directly in front of you, with a large wheel contraption to the left. Underneath the wheel is a pit filled with large balls, one of which you will need to get up to the top area to unlock the door. It doesn't matter which ball, you just need to get one up top. Head down to the bottom area and you will find a battery.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4140813-zan2.jpg"><img alt="Use one of the metal platforms to power the giant wheel." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4140813-zan2.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Use one of the metal platforms to power the giant wheel.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Connect the battery to the giant wheel using one of the metal platforms located nearby. Now the big wheel will spin, which is how you get a ball to the top. To get the <strong>optional chest</strong>, head to the ball pit from the side closest to the battery. If you look closely, you will see the chest one row in on the left side of the pit. Fish it out with Ultrahand to secure it. You will need to move any balls that are on top of the chest.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-zanmik-shrine-puzzle-guide/1100-6514394/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><strong>Warning: This article contains some major spoilers for the ending of Fast X.</strong></p><p>Fast X is one of the most expensive movies of all time, and it's certainly got a cast large enough to match its massive budget. But for director Louis Leterrier, who took over behind the camera a week into production after franchise stalwart Justin Lin quit, the cast wasn't quite big enough.</p><p>The issue, as far as Leterrier was concerned, wasn't about how many people they had in the Fast &amp; Furious #family, but rather who was missing from it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fast-x-director-explains-how-he-ended-a-major-behind-the-scenes-franchise-feud/1100-6514397/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> is a lot of things: expansive, wonderous, and engrossing come to mind--but it's also pretty difficult at times. At least, it can be if you're not careful, heading off to places where you shouldn't be quite yet, or trekking into the snowcapped mountains without a pocket full of peppers. Thankfully, we've enlisted our foremost Zelda expert, Max Blumenthal, to walk you through exactly how to survive as you explore Tears of the Kingdom for, oh, I don't know, dozens to hundreds of hours. Here are Max's tips on staying alive, well-defended, and ready to prevail over any obstacle. </p><h2>Get to Satori Mountain</h2><p dir="ltr">I recommend that if you‚Äôre low on materials, one of the first stops can be Satori Mountain, which is a great resource to use to stock up on lots of healing items and goodies quickly. Between the apple orchard, flower garden, mushroom grove, and loads of other useful stuff around the mountain, you‚Äôre hard-pressed to find a more convenient place to find things clumped together.</p><p dir="ltr">If you continue to have problems collecting materials though, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-all-amiibo-rewards/2900-4749/">Amiibos</a> are also another option, as the Zelda Amiibos drop paraglider skins along with lots of helpful items, and even non zelda amiibos drop decent loot as well.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-survival-guide/1100-6514387/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Behaviour Interactive revealed that it is expanding the Dead by Daylight franchise by creating two new games in its universe. One is a narrative-driven game while the other is a multiplayer one.</p><p>The narrative-driven game will be headed by Supermassive Games, best known for developing Until Dawn, The Quarry, and the Dark Pictures Anthology. It's possible that the studio's Dead by Daylight game will follow the same single-player narrative framework that it is known for. The game will be set outside the Entity's realm and will feature a new cast and story.</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working hard to blunt the tension, agency, and branching storytelling of a Supermassive game together with Dead by Daylight‚Äòs mythology to create an intense narrative experience filled with powerful life-or-death choices," explained Supermassive Games executive producer Traci Tufte.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-new-dead-by-daylight-games-are-in-development/1100-6514390/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The John Wick film franchise has now crossed the billion-dollar mark, as with the release of John Wick Chapter 4, the franchise has made $1,011,319,297 at the global box office. To put that into perspective, that's just over $2.3 million for each person that met their end at the hands of Wick, who has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-john-wick-has-a-ridiculously-high-bodycount/1100-6512694/">total bodycount of 439 confirmed kills</a> across his film series.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, John Wick Chapter 4 has the highest worldwide box office gross with $425 million according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/john-wick-franchise-crosses-1-billion-worldwide-box-office-1235373213/">Deadline</a>, and that figure will rise after the film is released in Japan. John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum takes second place with $326.7 million, John Wick: Chapter 2 takes third place with $171.54 million, and the first film in the series is in last place with a still-impressive $87.8 million global haul.</p><p>As for the future of the series, those strong numbers could bring star Keanu Reeves back to reduce the European henchman population to single-digit numbers.

Kingdom</a> is a fantastic game whether you're playing on your TV or in handheld mode. Most people are probably playing with the Switch Pro controller or Joy-Con controllers, but neither of Nintendo's first-party controllers offer the most ideal way to play Tears of the Kingdom. For convenience and comfort, Tears of the Kingdom is best played with a controller equipped with remappable back buttons.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're anything like me, you've probably pressed the wrong button a lot while playing--there are lots of inputs, after all! Even if you always hit the right button, the controls can still be annoying. You have to take your thumbs off of the sticks often<em> </em>to cycle through weapons, jump, swim, and even just to run. Not to mention the frequency of pressing the A button to pick up the many, many resources and gear scattered across Hyrule. Over time, the demanding controls can become genuinely uncomfortable, especially if you play for long stretches--a very easy thing to do with Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, there are a handful of Nintendo Switch controllers that can markedly improve your experience playing Tears of the Kingdom by reducing how often you have to move your thumbs. I have personally tested all of the controllers listed below (as well as many others), and I've included options for handheld and docked modes. In addition to controllers designed for Switch, you'll see that there are some excellent out-of-the-box options that work very well despite not technically being Switch controllers. It's worth noting that you won't be able to scan Amiibo when using any of these controllers. Other features such as rumble and motion controls vary by controller.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-nintendo-controllers-arent-the-best-way-to-play-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6514384/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

One particular comment from Boon, however, has raised some questions about where this game falls in the greater MK timeline.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked why the team chose Mortal Kombat 1 as the title, Boon remarked that MK1 is"the beginning of a universe" and that the game "is not a continuation of the Mortal Kombat 11 story."

## Marvel's Secret Invasion Dives Into Nick Fury's Secret Past

<p>Nick Fury was introduced at the genesis of the MCU in 2008's Iron Man, Fury (played iconically by Samuel L. Jackson, who had his imagery based on the Ultimate Marvel version of the character) was a major player in getting the Avengers together with what was called the Avengers Initiative.</p><p>Since then, he's been a behind-the-scenes instructor, putting people together and pulling the strings across the MCU, eventually leaving Earth behind and befriending the alien Skrulls. However, we still don't know much about Fury's early days aside from what was shown and briefly talked about in Captain Marvel--that could all change with Secret Invasion.</p><p>Speaking with Total Film, series director Ali Selim and producer Jonathan Schwartz discussed how the new Disney+ series will take a deep dive into Fury's background. It's something that none of the film or television series have been able to do as of yet. Both creators wanted to take what Marvel did with Captain America: Winter Soldier and pile on that a level of grounded espionage in the mix with the sci-fi elements.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-secret-invasion-dives-into-nick-furys-secret-past/1100-6514379/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Yes, this sounds suspiciously similar to the plot of Despicable Me.</p><p>Moon World Resorts Inc. co-founder Michael Henderson's idea is to spend an obscene amount of cash on the construction of a 274-meter (900-foot) replica of the moon that will be perched on top of a 30-meter (100-foot) building in Dubai. Dubbed The MOON Project, the completed replica will glow at night and will include a destination resort inside, including space for a 4,000-room hotel, an arena that can host up to 10,000 people, and a "lunar colony" that will <em>sort of </em>allow you to say that you've been on the moon.</p><p>There's also a chance that it could deafen nearby residents when <a href="https://youtu.be/L3LbxDZRgA4?t=54">confused owls begin incessantly hooting</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dubai-moon-megastructure-proposal-is-basically-irl-destiny/1100-6514375/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny releases in theaters in June, but the action movie had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival this week. Reviews for the Harrison Ford film have begun to appear online, painting an early picture of the movie's critical reception.</p><p>The Dial of Destiny brings back Ford one more time in the role of the archaeologist-adventurer. He is now teaming up with his goddaughter, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for another adventure. The movie opens with a flashback that shows a de-aged Ford, and it seems there is an element of time travel within the movie by way of the artifact itself--the Dial of Destiny.</p><div>          </div><p> </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-review-roundup/1100-6514372/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Princess Zelda voice actress Patricia Summersett has said that Link and Zelda are "in a relationship with each other" in Tears of the Kingdom. <strong>Warning: minor spoilers ahead for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</strong></p><p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/patricia-summersett-interview-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">TheGamer</a>, Summersett reflected on her time voicing the iconic role of Hyrule's princess in Breath of the Wild, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, and Tears of the Kingdom. She also offered her own insight into the relationship between Link and Zelda, saying that the interim between Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom allows a deeper interpretation from players due to the time skip.</p><p>"As a voice actor, looking at the overall relationship between Link and Zelda over the ages, I personally love the ambiguity and that if there is something there it‚Äôs left to us," Summersett said. "I guess in my own life, I can respect and celebrate relationships that aren‚Äôt conventional."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/link-and-zelda-are-in-a-relationship-with-each-other-says-voice-actress/1100-6514373/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">To discover the voice of Princess Zelda, actress Patricia Summersett looked at strong women in other massive fantasy franchises like Game of Thrones and Harry Potter. She then took "a little bit" from a variety of sources to create the tone you hear in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom--as well as previously in Breath of the Wild and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity.</p><p dir="ltr">Summersett spoke with <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/18/zelda-patricia-summersett-interview">Axios</a> about her inspirations for Zelda, noting she researched "women who are very strong, heady but also placed in a royal position." This led to her pulling some Daenerys Targaryen (as played by Emilia Clarke) from Game of Thrones; a tad of Hermione Granger (as played by Emma Watson) from the Harry Potter film franchise; and even a smidge of Mia Farrow from The Last Unicorn, an animated movie she "grew up with."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of growing up, Summersett told Axios that she liked Mario and Duck Hunt more than The Legend of Zelda as a kid. But the actress did play Ocarina of Time in high school.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tears-of-the-kingdoms-zelda-voice-actress-drew-inspiration-from-game-of-thrones-harry-potter/1100-6514369/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

One of those characters is Seyka, who goes on to become a major character in Aloy's journey, and by the end of Burning Shores, their relationship had blossomed resulting in an optional kiss between the two.</p><p>While there was positivity around the inclusion, the kiss also came with online homophobic backlash, as well as review bombing of the game on Metacritic.

Once here, connect all three planks end-to-end to create a big bridge, which you can lean against the fence to exit this section.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-kudanisar-shrine-puzzle-guide/1100-6514360/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> sports plenty of puzzle-based shrines, but you'll also occasionally run across combat challenges. Yansamin Shrine--found high in the sky within a well-fortified location--is one such shrine. But this one has a twist--you've got to do it all in zero gravity. Here's how to find the shrine, as well as some tips for how to clear it of enemies.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to find Yansamin Shrine in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p>The first step to reaching Yansamin Shrine is to ensure you have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-clues-to-the-sky-quest-guide/1100-6514046/">a piece of Zora's Armor</a> equipped so that you can swim up waterfalls, then fast travel back to Gutanbac Shrine on Great Sky Island. This is where you started the game, so it will inevitably be unlocked for you already.</p><p>From the shrine, head to the far east side of the island and gaze out to see Zonaite Forge Island in the distance. It's going to be quite a trek to get there, so make sure you have some stamina-refilling food for long trips (or at least three full bars of stamina). It also helps to use Tulin's gust if you have him unlocked.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-how-to-get-to-the-necluda-sky-island-shrine/1100-6514315/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
