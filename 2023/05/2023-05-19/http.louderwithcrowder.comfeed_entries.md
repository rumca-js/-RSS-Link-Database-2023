At least I think that's how white privilege works. Most of us are too busy doing literally anything else to even let stuff like this register, but this person was really upset to find out that Mike Rowe did a video for PragerU. Four years ago (see <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mike-rowe-on-prager-u-dont-follow-your-passion" target="_self">MIKE ROWE OFFERS SAGE ADVICE: 'DON'T FOLLOW YOUR PASSION..."</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/now-youtube-restricting-mike-rowe-videos-hes-speaking" target="_self">YOUTUBE JUST RESTRICTED A MIKE ROWE VIDEO. AND HE'S SPEAKING OUT...</a>). All the respect she had for Mr. Dirty Jobs? It gone!</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p>Rowe of course responded in the most Mike Rowe possible. He straight-up bodied her with an "aw shucks" smile on his face.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="5826e" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=23482075&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>What's most funny here is that, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CC0rpTznvxw/" target="_blank">as you see from this earlier screen capture from PragerU</a>, this lady went back in to her post and added the part about Rowe's ignorant fans. A few thousand more comments later, I'm going to guess she switched off Facebook notifications.</p><p>Maybe it's just because of the entertainment industry being what it is, if you are an entertainer I just assume we vote for different people as my default position. The only time I can't separate art from the artist is if a) the artist is a dick and b) the artist acts like they hate the half the country who disagrees with them. Even then, I don't lose respect for them as much as I nothing them. </p><p>Mike Rowe does neither a) nor b). In this case, he recorded a video that echos almost everything he has said over the four years that came after the video was published. Taking this person at their word, they respect everything he has to say about college and work, but because he said those things in a snazzy video produced by someone this person doesn't respect, now the alleged "respect" is gone? That's just silly and a horrible way to view things.</p><p>If Jennifer is being honest about the respect in the first place. What mostly likely happened is that she saw a PragerU meme and pulled a "I've always been a big fan of yours, but ...". Had she actually been a big fan, she would have known that Rowe wasn't going to care.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Pastor loses it on woke school board shutting him down from reading pornographic book they want pushed on students

This means starting in the fourth grade. </p><p>The school board jumps in to stop the pastor from reading the filthy material that is inappropriate for adults at a school board meeting, yet a-ok for children in the public schools they allegedly care about.

	A palate cleanser after another political/cultural week of "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/congresswoman-witness-wrong-tweet" target="_blank">everything sucks</a>," "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fbi-activist-mother" target="_blank">everything is terrible</a>," and "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nbc-news-defends-teacher" target="_blank">dear God, someone do something.</a>" Because there are few things in America more pure than a kid's excitement on the last day of school. Whatever you do this weekend, have this youngblood's energy while doing so.

	Meet Ro. He KNOWS a lot about wrestling. And the clip you've seen on Twitter is edited because it cuts out the only thing that could make this video truly the greatest of all time... Alice Cooper's "Schools Out."

## Watch: Official sides with sex offender over his disabled Marine victim, claims sex offenders "among our most vulnerable"

Even as one of his victims, a disabled Marine, spoke out about it. Oh, and the sex offender is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=pedo" target="_blank">also a pedo</a>. More on that in a bit.</p><p>Our antagonist is Shanee Colston. She (I think she's a she) is co-chair of a subcommittee of the Regional Homelessness Authority. She wanted to appoint Thomas Whitaker, the registered sex offender, to the board. Kristina Sawyckyj, the disabled Marine, spoke up and said she had a bad experience with Whitaker (aka Raven Crowfoot) who had "touched" her. This is where Shanee goes bananas.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">WATCHüßµDuring a meeting of the <a href="https://twitter.com/KingCoRHA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KingCoRHA</a> Continuum of Care board, co-chair Shan√©√© Colston yelled at another member who objected to nominating a sex offender to the board <br /><br />‚ÄúHe‚Äôs here because sex offenders are another population that is vulnerable that don‚Äôt have housing!‚Äù <a href="https://t.co/XKTJAfDg2L">pic.twitter.com/XKTJAfDg2L</a><br />‚Äî Ari Hoffman (@thehoffather) <a href="https://twitter.com/thehoffather/status/1656530984144367616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>We're not here to discover people's backgrounds.

It's the left coast. This is how they do.</p><p>Sawyckj is at least an adult. The victims that made Whitaker/Crowfoot a sex offender -- and a PEDOPHILE -- were all minors. A 13-year-old in 2010. A 15-year-old in 2012. And a 17-year-old in 2018. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12096893/Screaming-Seattle-official-tells-meeting-shes-glad-support-PEDOPHILE-homelessness-board.html" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a>, chief program officer for King County Regional Homeless Authority wrote to the board and demanded Colston's resignation. No word on if Shawnee Colston has been offered a job in the Biden Administration yet.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Or, they did three years ago (the schmuck in this video yells "Kanye 2020") and have gotten worse sense. There are idiots living among us who, in the name of going viral and becoming an internet celebrity, call it a "prank" to pretend to pour gasoline on your car and YOU. </p><p>One guy with a gun did not find the humor in it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Live-streamer is filmed pouring fake gasoline on cars as a prank before someone pulls a gun on him. <a href="https://t.co/k0lg0EjqxI">pic.twitter.com/k0lg0EjqxI</a><br />‚Äî Catch Up (@CatchUpFeed) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpFeed/status/1659310420312866817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Meet Bob. Bob thinks it's funny to prank people by going to a parking lot and pouring gasoline on their cars. Why? Because LOL, it's only water! Something you wouldn't know as you see someone pouring liquid out of a gas canister onto your car. In case you don't get the humor of the prank yet, Bob also says "I'm burning your car down, bro."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="01e19" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33707184&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>And if you think THAT'S funny, wait until you see Bob chasing the guy around the parking lot threatening to kill him. He didn't say the words "I'm going to kill you." But when you a threatening to pour gasoline on someone, it's implied.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="f8a30" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33707185&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Then Bob, happy with how his "prank" was going, went to pull his "prank" on a second car. A pick-up. PawPaw's pick up. He's the guy with a gun.</p><p>PawPaw did not find the humor in Bob threatening to set his truck on fire: "It better be water, partner. Or you're one dead son of a b*tch."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="e286d" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33707186&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>This is the trend. If it's not <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/livestream-japanese-train" target="_blank">harassing people on trains</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/airport-prank" target="_blank">pretending to steal their luggage at the airport</a>, it's a "prank" where you convince people you are going to set their car -- and them -- on fire. This is what losers are doing desperate for the Internet to pay attention to them.</p><p>Why stop there? Next time wear a mask. Throw someone in the back of a van. Live-stream you threatening to behead them while saying "Admiral-Akbar." Then when they think they are going to die, take off the mask and yell, "Fooled you! You fell for the oldest trick in the book. It's just a prank! Like and subscribe!"</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
