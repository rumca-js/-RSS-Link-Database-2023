That's no easy feat for nine cast members, four bandmates and a composer wielding a glockenspiel.\n\nKimberly Akimbo (with title character played by Broadway star Victoria Clark) is a coming-of-age story about a 16-year-old girl with a rare genetic disease, which causes her to age four times faster than normal. The show is funny, sad and uplifting all at once. It's a family affair with songs sung by Kimberly's aunt, parents, love interest and friends.\n\nFor the transfer to the Tiny Desk, composer Jeanine Tesori led the audience through a playlist of four standout musical numbers, making sure to shout out her collaborator, playwright David Lindsay-Abaire. After opening with Bonnie Milligan's Tony-nominated performance of \"Better,\" Tesori asked her cast and band to introduce themselves. Justin Cooley, who plays Kimberly's first crush, could not make it to the Desk. The composer-turned-emcee used the opportunity to thank all understudies who work tirelessly to ensure that the show must go on \u2014 even at a desk in a Washington, D.C. office.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Better\"\n\"Anagram\"\n\"Father Time\"\n\"Great Adventure\" \n\nCAST\nSteven Boyer\nVictoria Clark \nMiguel Gil\nOlivia Elease Hardy \nFernell Hogan\nMichael Iskander\nAlli Mauzey\nBonnie Milligan\nNina White \n\nMUSICIANS\nJeanine Tesori: composer, glockenspiel\nChris Fenwick: piano\nAndrew Zinmeister: guitar, ukulele\nShannon Ford: percussion\nJeff Allen: upright bass\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Josh Rogosin\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, Neil Tevault\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Elizabeth Gillis, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistants: Josephine Nyouani\nProduction Assistant: Michael Zamora\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #kimberlyakimbo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRThiGArHxQ", "date_published": "2023-05-19 10:44:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
