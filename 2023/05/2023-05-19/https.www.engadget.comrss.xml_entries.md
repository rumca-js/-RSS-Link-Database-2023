<p>When Blizzard <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2s-long-awaited-co-op-story-missions-will-go-live-in-august-193108073.html">announced</a> earlier this week that it had canceled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/overwatch-2/"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a> hero missions, a central part of its player vs. environment (PvE) story mode, fans were none too pleased. So director Aaron Keller published a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23952480/">blog post</a> today to ease the concerns and offer more transparency about the development team’s “incredibly difficult decision.”</p><p>Hero missions, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-01-blizzard-overwatch-2-blizzcon-gameplay-trailer.html">revealed</a> in 2019, were designed to provide a “deeply repayable” branch of the game based on RPG-like talent trees. Although progression would have been separate from the main game (to avoid giving hero mission players an unfair advantage), it was still part of the hype Blizzard used during the past four years of marketing the title. But the publisher ultimately found that the hero missions were pulling too many development resources away from the live game.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“When we launched <em>Overwatch</em> in 2016, we quickly started talking about what that next iteration could be,” Keller wrote. “Looking back at that moment, it’s now obvious that we weren’t as focused as we should have been on a game that was a runaway hit. Instead, we stayed focused on a plan that was years old.” That years-old plan refers to the development team’s influence from its work on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-28-project-titan-a-brief-history-of-a-game-that-doesn-t-exist.html"><em>Project Titan</em></a>, Blizzard’s canceled MMORPG. The creators initially saw <em>Overwatch</em> as a vessel to reintegrate some of the ideas from that scrapped project.</p><figure><img alt="Overwatch 2 screenshot featuring two heroes standing on a large metallic flower petal" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/acbbfaf0-f684-11ed-bfff-60ae76f9c9a0" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Blizzard Entertainment</div></figure><p>“Work began on the PvE portion of the game and we steadily continued shifting more and more of the team to work on those features.” But, Keller says, “Scope grew. We were trying to do too many things at once and we lost focus. The team built some really great things, including hero talents, new enemy units and early versions of missions, but we were never able to bring together all of the elements needed to ship a polished, cohesive experience.”</p><p>Keller says the team’s ambition for hero missions was devouring resources at the expense of the core gameplay. “We had an exciting but gargantuan vision and we were continuously pulling resources away from the live game in an attempt to realize it,” said Keller. “I can’t help but look back on our original ambitions for <em>Overwatch</em> and feel like we used the slogan of ‘crawl, walk, run’ to continue to march forward with a strategy that just wasn’t working.”</p><p>The decision to abandon hero missions came down to prioritizing present quality over past promises. “We had announced something audacious,” Keller reflected. “Our players had high expectations for it, but we no longer felt like we could deliver it. We needed to make an incredibly difficult decision, one we knew would disappoint our players, the team, and everyone looking forward to Hero Missions. The <em>Overwatch</em> team understands this deeply — this represented years of work and emotional investment. They are wonderful, incredibly talented people and truly have a passion for our game and the work that they do.”</p><p><em>Overwatch 2</em>’s story missions — minus the canned hero missions — are set to arrive in season six, scheduled for mid-August. PvE aspects include a single-player version with a leaderboard, in-game and out-of-game stories and “new types of co-op content we haven’t yet shared.” Before that content arrives, there’s still season five, set to launch in June.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-director-explains-why-hero-missions-were-canceled-211629105.html?src=rss

## Disney+ and Hulu will remove a slew of titles on May 26th

<p>Disney+ and Hulu are starting to purge a number of shows from their respective streaming services. This seems to be an industry-wide trend that reinforces the idea that you don’t own anything with subscriptions.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/disney-remove-series-streaming-disney-plus-hulu-big-shot-willow-y-dollface-turner-hooch-pistol-1235372512/"><em><ins>Deadline</ins></em></a>, a slew of titles on Disney+, including <em>Big Shot</em>, <em>Clouds</em>, <em>Diary of a Future President</em>, and <em>Benedict Society</em> are leaving on May 26th. On the Hulu side, shows such as <em>Dollface</em>, <em>Maggie</em> and <em>Little Demon</em> will vanish on that same date.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In August of last year, HBO Max (now just Max) announced that it would be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-removing-shows-discovery-plus-203029015.html"><ins>stripping 36 shows from its platform</ins></a>, including <em>The-Not-Too-Late-Show with Elmo</em> and <em>My Dinner with Hervé</em>. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/westworld-the-nevers-to-leave-hbo-max-101455395.html"><ins>continued its rampage</ins></a> in December 2022 by announcing larger shows such as <em>Westworld</em> were going to be pulled from the platform. And even before then, Netflix was notoriously known for <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/every-netflix-original-removed-from-netflix/"><ins>pulling and adding shows and movies</ins></a> at the drop of a hat.</p><p>While the list mostly consists of direct-to-streaming movies and shows that didn’t get more than a few seasons, it’s still disappointing to see content being dropped. Movies and TV shows aren’t the only affected medium, as streaming music services <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-03-spotify-is-going-to-keep-missing-out-on-big-albums.html"><ins>have long had the issue</ins></a> of certain tracks becoming unavailable or an entire album being pulled entirely from the catalog. It’s the price you pay when going the subscription route. It’s an all-you-can-eat buffet, but the buffet owner can take anything away at a moment’s notice.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/disney-and-hulu-will-remove-a-slew-of-titles-on-may-26th-204658321.html?src=rss

## 'Until Dawn' developer Supermassive is making a ‘Dead by Daylight’ spin-off

<p>Behaviour Interactive has revealed what’s next for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dead-by-daylight/"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a>, including two more spin-off games. Perhaps the more intriguing of the two is a project being developed by Supermassive Games. While the game is staying mostly under wraps for now, it seems to build on the formula Supermassive has executed so well on games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-24-until-dawn-sony-playstation-4-review.html"><em>Until Dawn</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-quarry-game-release-date-201557551.html"><em>The Quarry</em></a>.</p><p>This will be a single-player interactive story game with a new cast of characters that offers “an intense narrative experience filled with powerful life-or-death choices set within the backdrop of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>,” according to Behaviour. Expect to learn more about the game later this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The other spin-off that’s in development is a co-op title from Midwinter Entertainment, which joined Behaviour last year. This game, which is in its very early stages, will focus on the themes of greed and the lust for power. You’ll be able to team up with as many as three other players.</p><p>These two games follow on from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dead-by-daylight-hooked-on-you-dating-sim-resident-evil-meet-your-maker-180050186.html"><em>Hooked On You</em></a>, a <em>DbD </em>dating sim that arrived last year. A <em>Dead by Daylight </em>film adaptation is in the works too. Behaviour and its partners are currently looking for the director and screenwriter for the project.</p><div id="7496c58d7c4444dfa765e08644aaf154"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Behaviour had a lot more to discuss during the <em>DbD </em>seventh anniversary showcase. There was news on upcoming collaborations for cosmetic items, including team ups with Slipknot and Iron Maiden. Ikumi Nakamura, the former <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-09-evil-within-new-game-ghostwire-tokyo-tango-bethesda-e3-2019.html"><em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em> creative director</a> who you may remember from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/9/18659141/ikumi-nakamura-bethesda-e3-2019-ghostwire-tokyo-presenter">that game’s reveal at E3 2019</a>, has designed some <em>DbD </em>cosmetics too.</p><p>On the gameplay front, the stream included a look at the next <em>DbD </em>chapter, which will be available on June 13th. End Transmission will bring sci-fi horror to the game, with a new map set on another planet that doesn't look unlike Atropos from <em>Returnal</em>. The upcoming killer, The Singularity, “is a monstrous amalgamation of restructured organic matter and machine parts seeking to become the perfect lifeform,” Behaviour said. The accompanying survivor is Gabriel Soma, a technician.</p><p>Over the next year, Behaviour plans to add four chapters, including End Transmission and two others that will bring another pair of licensed killers from other franchises to <em>DbD</em>. On top of those, there will be two extra survivor-only chapters. We already know who one of those survivors will be: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nicolas-cage-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight-174623542.html">a certain Nicolas Cage.</a></p><p>The actor is playing himself in the game. Lest you think that Behaviour recruited a soundalike, that’s not the case. Cage "was generous enough to record every grunt, scream and exertion you will hear in <em>Dead by Daylight,</em>" Mathieu Côté, head of partnerships for the game, told reporters at a preview event this week. Here's hoping that includes Cage <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1FVkNybVhXNi1QayIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmEwYTBlODUtZDE0Ni00MDg2LWIzZWQtYjliNzk5ODA4ZTAyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWp7i6fWv-kkd3e1DSfxhYvrirM6mZrRRKtI10xTKPba&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEVCrmXW6-Pk">shrieking about bees and his eyes</a>.

<p>Folks are spending less time on Twitter since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-adults-are-spending-less-time-on-twitter-since-elon-musk-took-over-192939586.html"><ins>Elon Musk bought the social media site</ins></a> last year, but there’s still plenty of demand for similar platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky. To that point, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-decentralized-twitter-competitor-071316333.html"><ins>Meta has long been rumored</ins></a> to be building its own platform to rival Twitter. After months of speculation, there’s finally some details to go along with the rumors, according to <a href="https://liahaberman.substack.com/p/icymi-instagrams-new-app-could-be"><ins>digital media marketing expert Lia Haberman.</ins></a></p><p>Haberman says the app is nearing completion and could launch as early as the end of June. She says that Meta has been meeting with select content creators to discuss the platform. One of these creators furnished Haberman with all kinds of info about the forthcoming app, calling it “Instagram for your thoughts.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="103ac0af8ff3421cbd732e4f5de1db25"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Based on a (somewhat blurry) example I got, Meta's new app looks a lot like Twitter.<br /><br />So, could this take over all the Twitter screenshots we've been seeing on the Feed lately? Maybe. <br /><br />It’s impossible to predict how audiences will respond but this could be an alternative. <a href="https://t.co/xgQa1kUjCl">pic.twitter.com/xgQa1kUjCl</a></p>— Lia Haberman (@liahaberman) <a href="https://twitter.com/liahaberman/status/1659555871565946882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Instagram is the right word here, as it looks like the entire platform is built out of the popular photo-sharing social network. The decentralized app is said to work with current Instagram parameters, like usernames and passwords. So if you already have an Instagram account you should be able to sign right up and automatically sync up with your current followers. Your handle, bio and verification should all carry over from IG. Haberman says that even blocked Instagram accounts and hidden words transfer to the new platform.</p><p>This is also set to be a decentralized app that’ll integrate with other platforms like Mastodon, meaning you should be able to interact with users across multiple services without having to constantly switch between apps. The report indicates that text updates will be limited to 500 characters, which is less than an Instagram caption, but still plenty long enough to make a sarcastic comment or whatever.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll likely be able to attach links, photos and videos up to five minutes long, which of course is much shorter than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-subscribers-can-now-upload-videos-as-long-as-two-hours-161504628.html">Twitter's recently launched two hour video-sharing feature.</a> Just like Twitter and similar platforms, Meta’s service will have its own versions of likes, replies and reposts. Haberman got her hands on a leaked marketing slide that shows the app in action and, well, it looks a whole lot like Twitter, Bluesky and the rest, with a dash of Instagram's design scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in March when these rumors first surfaced, Meta said it was indeed “exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates.” So this is coming, it’s just a matter of what it’ll look like and if it’ll be “the one” to dethrone Twitter. There's no name for the service yet, though within Meta it has a few codenames like Barcelona and P92.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/metas-rumored-twitter-competitor-could-launch-as-early-as-next-month-181625616.html?src=rss

Of course, you have to be okay with watching a few ads every now and again, but this is a full subscription with access to the streamer’s entire library of content, including forthcoming seasons of <em>The Bear</em> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/futurama-returns-july-24th-as-a-hulu-original-after-a-10-year-hiatus-203316031.html">the recently-revived <em>Futurama.</em></a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ad-supported tier, however, doesn’t allow you to download content for offline viewing, so keep that in mind when planning a long summer trip.

## Disney’s pricey, immersive Star Wars hotel is shutting down

<p>Less than 19 months after opening Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/disney/"><ins>Disney</ins></a> will close the hotel's doors. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star-wars/"><ins>Star Wars</ins></a> fans who are willing to splurge now have until the end of September to try the two-night experience.</p><p>“Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser is one of our most creative projects ever and has been praised by our guests and recognized for setting a new bar for innovation and immersive entertainment,” Disney told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/18/disney-worlds-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-to-shutter.html"><em><ins>CNBC</ins></em></a> in a statement. “This premium, boutique experience gave us the opportunity to try new things on a smaller scale of 100 rooms, and as we prepare for its final voyage, we will take what we’ve learned to create future experiences that can reach more of our guests and fans.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The hotel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-prices-092012242.html"><ins>opened at Walt Disney World</ins></a> in Florida in March 2022 and it promised fans a one-of-a-kind jaunt. Guests are immersed in a Star Wars story. As passengers on a starcruiser, they encounter a First Order officer and stormtroopers who board the ship to find Resistance spies. Guests can choose to join the light side or the dark side and they may encounter the likes of Chewbacca, Rey and Kylo Ren.</p><p>Along with the room, food and drink (except for alcohol), access to Disney World's Hollywood Studios park, a Magic Band and valet service are included in the stay. But for all that, guests are charged a pretty penny.</p><p>A two-night stay for two people at Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser starts at $4,800. For a group of three adults and one child, the rate is $6,000. That cost is on top of travel expenses and anything else that tourists might want to do in the area. As such, the hotel is out of the price range of many parents who want to take their kids to Disney World.</p><p>Disney didn't explain the reasons for closing down Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, but the writing has been on the wall for a while. Late last year, reports <a href="https://wdwnt.com/2022/11/galactic-starcruiser-low-occupancy-hours-cut/"><ins>suggested</ins></a> that the hotel was struggling with falling demand and was seeing occupancy rates of as little as 25 percent. In March, it emerged that Disney was <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/disney-cuts-bookings-star-wars-hotel-17829787.php"><ins>cutting back bookings</ins></a>. In the end, it seems Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser was an ambitious experiment for which not enough fans were willing to pay through the nose.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/disneys-pricey-immersive-star-wars-hotel-is-shutting-down-154345788.html?src=rss

## Fellow Tally hands-on: A slick scale for precise pour-overs

<p>Precise tools are a coffee nerd’s best friends and after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fellow-opus-review-a-coffee-grinder-that-doubles-as-a-showpiece-170020880.html">releasing the Opus grinder</a> earlier this year, Fellow has returned with another product called the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9e95760a-c57f-4a36-9e7d-674face57081&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Fellow&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5ZTk1NzYwYS1jNTdmLTRhMzYtOWU3ZC02NzRmYWNlNTcwODEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9mZWxsb3dwcm9kdWN0cy5jb20vcGFnZXMvdGFsbHktd2VpZ2h0LWxpc3QiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg3MmU2OTJiLTMyNzEtNDhiOC04NDE0LWFkM2ViNjAwMGRlZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYBaukqtIdKDn-ATJAqCLGOS_G7pV5B9AAxeisuzBZLa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffellowproducts.com%2Fpages%2Ftally-weight-list">Tally Pro</a>. And while it’s hard to find a kitchen scale exciting – especially one as niche as this – after trying it out for myself I’m starting to see the appeal.</p><p>Like the rest of Fellow’s gadgets, the Tally features a minimalist design with a black-on-black color scheme, though I wish there was a little more matte and less glossy in certain areas to hide fingerprints. In the center, there’s an easy-to-read OLED display along with a handy knob and a big button for setting the timer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="The Tally Pro has a sleek design, though there's a bit too much glossy black for my taste. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/4fe8c030-f4f2-11ed-bf9a-f4e8dd5f05cc" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Tally Pro’s specs are pretty solid, too. You get good sensitivity that goes down to a tenth of a gram, a removable weigh pan for easy cleaning and a max capacity of 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds). That means this thing can double as a general kitchen scale for all but the heaviest recipes. That said, what I like is Fellow’s attention to detail. Sure, its battery will last about three months, but unlike a lot of other rechargeable scales, the Tally can still work while it’s plugged in. And because the scale relies on a USB-C port for power, you don’t need to bother with proprietary charging bricks. Fellow even built a little Easter Egg into the scale that lets you play a game similar to the one you get <a href="https://trex-runner.com/">in Google Chrome</a> when you don’t have an internet connection.</p><figure><img alt="For more experience brewers, the Tally Pro also lets you manually set your ideal water-to-coffee ratios. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/4fec42a0-f4f2-11ed-afbe-7350a3892189" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>However, the standout feature on the Tally Pro is that alongside its weight and timer modes, there’s a new Brew Assist mode that attempts to take some of the math out of hitting that perfect coffee-to-water ratio. Simply by entering the amount of ground coffee you’re starting with and selecting your desired ratio (which can be adjusted manually), the scale will calculate the correct amount of water you need (by weight, of course, because no self-respecting coffee geek settles for volumetric measurements). It will even tell you how much water to add throughout your brewing time to help achieve an ideal extraction. Pretty much the only thing it doesn’t do is give you a bloom timer, but that's because given the huge variety of beans, Fellow believes it’s better to follow the roaster’s instructions for that.</p><figure><img alt="The Tally Pro three main features are its timer, scale, and the new Brew Assist mode. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/4fe95c70-f4f2-11ed-b77f-2f90e840c2a6" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Admittedly, long-time coffee aficionados might think this sort of hand-holding is a bit much. However, as someone who has only recently started diving deeper into the intricacies of making a great cup of coffee, I find it's a nice aid for less experienced brewers. In reality, the much bigger hurdle is its price, because at $185 the Tally Pro is around five times more expensive than a standard kitchen scale. And unless you’re a real java nut, that’s a tough swallow.</p><p>But if you want a good-looking scale to help maximize your brew, you better start saving up for when the Tally Pro officially goes on sale sometime in early June.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fellow-tally-hands-on-a-slick-scale-for-precise-pour-overs-150024886.html?src=rss

## NASA picks Blue Origin to build the Artemis V Moon landing system

<p>NASA has picked the company that will handle the third crewed Artemis Moon landing. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-blue-origin-as-second-artemis-lunar-lander-provider">will build</a> the landing system for Artemis V, which is currently set to launch in September 2029. While they didn't mention the choice of vehicle, the company is already working on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-09-blue-origin-blue-moon-lunar-lander.html">Blue Moon</a> lander. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Draper are among those involved in the NASA project. The NASA award is worth $3.4 billion, and Blue Origin said in the announcement event that it's contributing &quot;well north&quot; of that figure on its own.</p><p>An Orion capsule flight will take four astronauts to the Moon, where two of the crew members will use a Blue Origin lander docked to the Gateway space station to touch down at the lunar south pole. They'll spend a week conducting moonwalks, rover operations and science experiments while the other astronauts expand and take care of the Gateway.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NASA has already chosen SpaceX's Starship for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">the first</a> (Artemis III) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-picks-spacex-artemis-4-102537076.html">second</a> (Artemis IV) human landings. The agency said it would accept <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-new-artemis-lunar-lander-proposals-120519399.html">proposals for a second lander</a> last year to both provide a backup and foster competition. Blue Origin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-nasa-lunar-lander-moon-artemis-172023096.html">made its bid</a> for another lunar contract last December. The company objected to SpaceX's win and sued NASA for allegedly ignoring safety concerns when awarding the contract, but a federal court <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-loses-nasa-lawsuit-over-spacex-151101253.html">dismissed the claims</a>.</p><p>The decision is a coup for Blue Origin. While it already has a NASA contract for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-blue-origin-new-glenn-escapade-science-mission-mars-110049165.html">Mars science mission</a> and financial support for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-backs-blue-origins-orbital-reef-space-station-220247282.html">Orbital Reef space station</a>, it hasn't had success scoring a crewed trip to the Moon. This also highlights NASA's increasing reliance on privately developed technology for its missions beyond Earth orbit, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/this-is-the-spacesuit-nasas-artemis-astronauts-will-wear-on-the-moon-144528407.html">Axiom Space's Artemis suits</a>.

## 'BlackBerry' review: The comedy and tragedy of the innovator's dilemma

<p><em>BlackBerry</em> has everything <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tetris-movie-review-123020220.html">Apple's <em>Tetris </em>film lacked</a>: human drama grounded in actual history, without the need to spice things up with car chases and fantastical storytelling. On the face of it, the rise and fall of Research in Motion's keyboard-equipped smartphone may not seem inherently compelling. But the brilliance of the film — directed by Matt Johnson, who also co-wrote it with Matthew Miller — is that it makes the BlackBerry's journey feel like a genuine tragedy.</p><p>It's driven by two dramatically different people: RIM’s co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis, a nebbishy genius of an engineer, and Jim Balsillie, a ruthless and perpetually angry businessman. They struggled on their own, but together were able to rule the mobile industry for more than a decade. And then came the iPhone, which instantly reversed their fortunes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1013821b281645dcba03ba9f96cc92cb"></div><p>Like many former titans, RIM fell victim to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">the innovator's dilemma</a>. As described by Harvard professor Clayton Christensen, it's what happens when large and successful companies are entirely focused on iterating on existing products and appeasing customers. That leaves room for a more nimble newcomer to come along and develop something revolutionary that the incumbents could never have imagined.</p><p>In this case, it's Apple's iPhone, which lands like a nuclear bomb in the technology world. The film shows Lazaridis and his engineering team watching Steve Jobs' iconic iPhone keynote in disbelief. Lazaridis is the genius protagonist we've seen come up with the idea of a handheld, keyboard-equipped pocket computer that's efficient enough to run on unused, low-bandwidth wireless signals. Even after BlackBerry takes off, we see him have another stroke of inspiration with BlackBerry Messenger, a service that delivered free messaging to RIM's customers at a time when carriers charged 10 cents per SMS text. It was a brilliant maneuver that made BlackBerry users even more loyal, since BBM wasn't accessible on any other device.</p><figure><img alt="Jay Baruchel and Glenn Howerton in the BlackBerry movie." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/bd70f4b1-f64b-11ed-bfe4-e7d85fffb9f3" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IFC Films</div></figure><p>Even though he was no stranger to game-changing innovation himself, Lazaridis didn't think the iPhone would work. It was too expensive. It didn't have a physical keyboard. And it was built to gobble up mobile data (something RIM took pains to avoid). Who would want that? Turns out everyone did. While the iPhone was indeed pricey at launch, carrier subsidies made it easier to stomach. Its large screen, (eventual) App Store and revolutionary OS made up for its touch-based keyboard. And it arrived just as 3G networks were rolling out, which gave carriers more of an incentive to charge customers for data instead of cellular minutes. Just as the BlackBerry gave us a glimpse of an always-connected world in 1999, the iPhone promised to put the full power of the internet in your pocket.</p><p>Spoilers for real life, I guess: BlackBerry dropped from having 20 percent of the global smartphone market share in 2010 to 0 percent in 2017, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263439/global-market-share-held-by-rim-smartphones/">according to Statista</a>. For people who weren't around for the company's heyday, the film serves as a valuable history lesson.</p><section><img alt="Jay Baruchel and cast in the BlackBerry movie." class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/bd7190f0-f64b-11ed-9f75-608ae838c214" /></section><p>Crucially, though, it's not just like reading a Wikipedia entry. Johnson tells us exactly who Laziridis and Balsillie are from the very first scenes of the movie. As Laziridis and his RIM co-founder Doug Fregin prepare for a pitch meeting with Balsillie, he can't help but notice a buzzing intercom in the room. It's made in China, which to him is a red flag for bad engineering. So, almost without thinking, Laziridis tears it open and fixes a defective component. Balsillie, meanwhile, spends that time scheming to take the limelight away from a co-worker, simply because he thinks he's smarter than everyone around him.</p><p>While that first meeting doesn't go well, it's almost as if Laziridis and Balsillie's lives are destined to intertwine. The engineer needs someone with business smarts to sell his vision, and the business man needs something hot to sell. As played by Jay Baruchel (<em>This is the End</em>, <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>), Lazaridis is practically a poster child for socially awkward engineers. Glenn Howerton, meanwhile, channels the childish energy of his <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> character to portray Balsillie as a coked-up ball of rage. He may get results, but he also has the uncanny ability to turn every room into a toxic workplace.</p><p><em>BlackBerry</em> succeeds by making us care about Laziridis and his cadre of geeks, and by making Balsillie’s antics relentlessly entertaining (even when he’s being a complete jerk). But what’s most impressive is that it gives the story of <em>Research in Motion</em> a compelling dramatic shape: the rise of the genius, the defeat of his enemies (Palm’s potential hostile takeover of the company is particularly harrowing) and the inevitable downfall. It’ll forever change the way you view BlackBerry. And for the tech titans of today, the movie is a textbook example of how quickly you can fall from grace.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/blackberry-movie-review-comedy-tragedy-innovators-dilemma-140115574.html?src=rss

## Hyundai will pay $200 million after a TikTok challenge exposed a huge security flaw

<p>Hyundai is putting a relatively quick end to a class-action lawsuit over a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-and-kia-release-software-update-to-prevent-tiktok-thefts-193056722.html">viral TikTok car theft challenge</a>. The automaker <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3838">has agreed</a> to pay a settlement worth up to $200 million to compensate roughly 9 million US Hyundai and Kia owners. About $145 million is earmarked for out-of-pocket losses for customers whose cars were stolen or damaged and weren't covered by insurance. The companies also say they'll cover insurance deductibles, higher insurance premiums and other related expenses.</p><p>The settlement covers a wide range of Hyundai and Kia cars released between the 2011 and 2022 model years, including the Elantra, Santa Fe and Tucson. The 2011-2014 Genesis Coupe is also included. The marques will pay up to $6,125 per owner for the total loss of a car, and up to $3,375 for damage to the vehicle and any personal property.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The brands have already released a dealership-installed update that improves theft prevention for certain models (such as the 2017-2020 Elantra, 2015-2019 Sonata and 2020-2021 Venue) by disabling push-to-start and lengthening the alarm. Other vehicles that can receive updates will get theirs by June.  As part of the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will also offer up to $300 to help drivers buy anti-theft devices. They say they've already provided &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of free steering wheel locks to affected customers, and have provided AAA insurance options for customers who had trouble maintaining coverage.</p><p>The &quot;Kia Challenge&quot; emerged in mid-2022 after &quot;Kia Boyz&quot; posted TikTok videos showing how they used USB cables to hot-wire many Hyundai and Kia cars without anti-theft immobilizers. Thefts of those makes surged not long after, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration got involved after at least 14 crashes and eight deaths were linked to the viral clips.</p><p>The settlement heads off a high-profile court battle with owners, although it won't necessarily eliminate lawsuits from cities like Cleveland, San Diego and Seattle. It also underscores the cost of security issues in the social media era — it doesn't take much for a weakness to become public knowledge.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-will-pay-200-million-after-a-tiktok-challenge-exposed-a-huge-security-flaw-133327405.html?src=rss

Although the oft-used description of “smokeless” isn’t entirely accurate, Solo Stove’s smoke output is barely perceptible once your fire gets going — and it gets as close to smokeless as any product out there. Additionally, the company’s new 2.0 line includes a removable base plate and ash pan that make cleanup much less of a chore than older models.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/solo-stove-has-up-to-45-percent-off-site-wide-for-memorial-day-130058169.html?src=rss

## Engadget Podcast: How Apple and Google are highlighting accessibility

<p>This week, we’re focusing on Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD), an annual event meant to promote the need for accessible tech solutions. Cherlynn returns to tell us what Apple, Google, Adobe and others are doing to make their products more useful for people with disabilities (and, it turns out, many general users too). We also discuss Sam Altman’s trip to Congress, and why we’re not entirely impressed with the OpenAI CEO’s calls for AI regulation. Finally, we explain why the <em>BlackBerry </em>movie is one of the best films about tech ever made (take that, <em>Tetris!).</em></p><p>Listen below or subscribe on your podcast app of choice.

But now the tech giant has <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/updating-our-inactive-account-policies/">updated</a> its blog post (as noticed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/youtube-will-no-longer-be-deleting-videos-from-inactive-accounts/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>) announcing the purge to say that it does &quot;not have plans to delete accounts with YouTube videos at this time.&quot;</p><p>The tech giant positioned security as its main reason for deleting inactive accounts. It said internal analysis showed that old, abandoned accounts are around 10 times less likely to have two-factor enabled. That makes them vulnerable to bad actors who could use them for identity theft and other nefarious purposes. One could also come to the conclusion, however, that deleting old accounts would free up space in Google's servers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After the announcement went out, critics raised concerns that the move could wipe out some important pieces of internet history. Old YouTube videos, including the very first one, would disappear, along with videos uploaded by deceased users. Google didn't say why it ultimately changed its mind, but YouTube videos are safe. For now.</p><p>As for the rest of its products, the company intends to send out warning emails to accounts in danger of being deleted and to their recovery emails by the end of 2023. Those accounts will be deactivated within 60 days if their owners don't log in after receiving the warning email, though users will have 60 more days (for a total of four months) to recover their accounts before they're permanently gone.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-account-purge-will-spare-youtube-channels-with-videos-120458847.html?src=rss

<p>Google's Pixel 8 Pro could come with a new feature that's not quite commonly found on phones. <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-google-pixel-8-pro-leaked-video-design-built-in-thermometer/"><em>91mobiles</em></a> has published a video from tipster <a href="https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1659279640836358144">Kuba Wojciechowski</a> showing what looks like Pixel device being used to measure a person's temperature. Yep, if the leak is legit, the upcoming flagship Pixel will have a built-in thermometer. The video shows an infrared sensor similar to the ones used by contactless thermometers inside the metal panel where the rear cameras are also located.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the demonstration of the built-in thermometer, users will have to take off their glasses or any other eye and forehead accessories. They then have to bring the sensor as close to their forehead as possible without actually touching it and then moving their phone towards their temple in 5 seconds. <em>91mobiles</em> says the sensor could also be used to measure the temperature of inanimate objects, but the video didn't demonstrate how that would work. Google's employees have reportedly been testing the feature, as well.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-8-may-look-like-a-rounded-pixel-7-194230413.html">previous leak</a> of computer renders show the Pixel 8 Pro as a rounded version of the Pixel 7, and this new video does show a device that's identical to those renders. While the upcoming phone bears a lot of physical similarities to its predecessor, its three rear cameras are now inside one module. On the Pixel 7 Pro, one of the three camera sensors is in a separate module.&nbsp;</p><p>A thermometer is perhaps a curious feature addition for a phone, especially now that pandemic-related measures are no longer followed. Take note that this is merely a leak, and it remains to be seen whether the Pixel 8 Pros that will make their way to buyers will actually have the sensor.</p><p><em>91mobiles</em>' video has already been deleted due to a copyright claim, but one of the publication's readers tweeted a copy that we've embedded below.</p><div id="50017c7df55f4acab5225add75930a53"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">First leaked video of the Pixel 8 Pro showing off the phone and it’s new thermometer feature. <br /><br />This phone looks 🔥 I genuinely can’t wait for Pixel 8 series to launch.

It’s only available in the US for now, but the company says it will expand to additional countries “in the coming weeks.” It’s pretty much the same experience as the website.</p><p>At the same time, there are reports some tech companies are wary of staff using AI chatbots.

## The Supreme Court’s Warhol decision could have huge copyright implications for ‘fair use’

<p>The Supreme Court has <a href="https://www.asmp.org/news/breaking-news-lynn-goldsmith-prevails-in-7-2-supreme-court-decision/">ruled</a> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-24-resurrecting-andy-warhols-80s-amiga-artwork.html">Andy Warhol</a> has infringed on the copyright of Lynn Goldsmith, the photographer who took the image that he used for his famous silkscreen of the musician Prince. Goldsmith won the justices over 7-2, disagreeing with Warhol's camp that his work was transformative enough to prevent any copyright claims. In the majority opinion written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, she noted that &quot;Goldsmith's original works, like those of other photographers, are entitled to copyright protection, even against famous artists.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Goldsmith's story goes as far back as 1984, when <em>Vanity Fair </em>licensed her Prince photo for use as an artist reference. The photographer received $400 for a one-time use of her photograph, which Warhol then used as the basis for a silkscreen that the magazine published. Warhol then created 15 additional works based on her photo, one of which was sold to Condé Nast for another magazine story about Prince. The Andy Warhol Foundation (AWF) — the artist had passed away by then — got $10,000 it, while Goldsmith didn't get anything.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Typically, the use of copyrighted material for a limited and &quot;transformative&quot; purpose without the copyright holder's permission falls under &quot;fair use.&quot; But what passes as &quot;transformative&quot; use can be vague, and that  vagueness has led to numerous lawsuits. In this particular case, the court has decided that adding &quot;some new expression, meaning or message&quot; to the photograph does not constitute &quot;transformative use.&quot; Sotomayor said Goldsmith's photo and Warhol's silkscreen serve &quot;substantially the same purpose.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, the decision could have far ranging implications for fair use and could influence future cases on what constitutes as transformative work. Especially now that we're living in the era of content creators who could be taking inspiration from existing music and art. As <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/18/politics/supreme-court-prince-andy-warhol/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a> reports, Justice Elena Kagan strongly disagreed with her fellow justices, arguing that the decision would stifle creativity. She said the justices mostly just cared about the commercial purpose of the work and did not consider that the photograph and the silkscreen have different &quot;aesthetic characteristics&quot; and did not &quot;convey the same meaning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Both Congress and the courts have long recognized that an overly stringent copyright regime actually stifles creativity by preventing artists from building on the works of others. [The decision will] impede new art and music and literature, [and it will] thwart the expression of new ideas and the attainment of new knowledge. It will make our world poorer,&quot; she wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>The justices who wrote the majority opinion, however, believe that it &quot;will not impoverish our world to require AWF to pay Goldsmith a fraction of the proceeds from its reuse of her copyrighted work. Recall, payments like these are incentives for artists to create original works in the first place.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-supreme-courts-warhol-decision-could-have-huge-copyright-implications-for-fair-use-103547155.html?src=rss

<p>Apple is famous for being protective of its projects and for expecting secrecy from its workers.

The third employee reportedly uploaded a recorded meeting onto the chatbot and asked it to write minutes. It's unclear how Apple is restricting use of generative AI tools and if it's prohibiting their use completely.

However, after Twitter ended free access to its API, Microsoft decided to start  distancing itself from the website. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-removes-twitter-from-its-social-media-tool-for-advertisers-051717547.html">removed Twitter</a> from its social media management tool for advertisers, and it also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-cant-share-xbox-clips-directly-to-twitter-anymore-142026214.html">switched off</a> the option to upload screenshots and clips directly to Twitter from Xbox consoles and the Game Bar on Windows. The tech giant didn't explain the reason behind those decisions, but Twitter has been charging organizations <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nycs-transport-authority-will-no-longer-post-service-alerts-on-twitter-051701441.html">up to $50,000 a month</a> to access its new API.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In response to a tweet about Microsoft dropping Twitter from its social media management tool, Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1648784955655192577">said</a>: "They trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time." It's also worth noting that Musk and Microsoft have had a bumpy relationship lately, with the former <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/nadella-disputes-musks-claims-that-microsoft-controls-openai-.html">claiming</a> that the tech giant is controlling its partner OpenAI. Microsoft, which has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-openai-investment-expansion-152302151.html">invested a total of $13 billion</a> in the ChatGPT creator, said the claim was "<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/nadella-disputes-musks-claims-that-microsoft-controls-openai-.html">factually not correct</a>." Musk also told <em>Fox News</em> that he was concerned that ChatGPT "is being trained to be politically correct" and that he was looking to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-he-wants-to-start-truthgpt-to-rival-openai-and-google-014938539.html">create his own</a> generative AI chatbot called "TruthGPT." He also <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636047019893481474">criticized</a> OpenAI, which he helped start as a non-profit in 2015, for turning into a for-profit business.&nbsp;</p><p>It's unclear if this event will culminate into a lawsuit, but Twitter is demanding that Microsoft examine the data use of its apps. Twitter also wants Microsoft to submit a report by June on how much of its data the company has and how it's stored and used. In addition, it wants to know when Microsoft had given government organizations access to its data.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-accuses-microsoft-of-violating-its-data-use-policy-052356286.html?src=rss
