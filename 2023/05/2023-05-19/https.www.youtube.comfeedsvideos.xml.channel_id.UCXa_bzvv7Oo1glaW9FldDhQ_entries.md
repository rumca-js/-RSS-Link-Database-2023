Six years ago, if somebody told you after the launch of Breath of the Wild that the next Zelda game the developer makes will surpass it in almost every way possible, most would find that hard to believe. Making a direct sequel to one of the greatest games of all time is difficult enough as it is, but to make one that unquestionably improves upon an unabashed, genre-defining masterpiece? That's close to impossible. And yet, Tears of the Kingdom does it in a way that seems almost effortless. 

No, we're not anywhere close to as gobsmacked by its newness or its novelty as we were with Breath of the Wild when it came out in 2017, but in nearly every other way, incredibly enough, Zelda's newest outing touches heights even its predecessor couldn't (and yes, I am going to ruin that pun by saying "pun intended").

The dust has settled on NetherRealm Studios' next Mortal Kombat reveal, and it's official – the series is going back to square one. Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC and Nintendo Switch.

The Standard Edition will cost $70 on all platforms, and the presence of Dragon Krystals indicates microtransactions (which were also used in Mortal Kombat 11 to buy cosmetics). But for now, that's not causing the most buzz.

It's the announcement trailer, which showcases what NetherRealm is calling a reborn Mortal Kombat universe. What's going on?
