[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Two Axes of Contra Bands", "description": "<p><span>\n\nIn a conversation a few days ago I was thinking about how I mentally\ncategorize contra dance bands, and I think I have two main axes:\n\n</span>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>How serious?  Towards the less serious end you might see a band\ngo into a squared up pop tune, suddenly start playing kazoos, or\ngenerally goof around.  Towards the more serious end you have\nrespectable bands that don't draw on tricks or novelty for their\nappeal.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>How traditional?  Specifically, how close is their music to\nwhat has traditionally been played for contra dances?  A more\ntraditional band might play fiddle tunes from New England, Quebecois,\nCape Breton, or other similar traditions, backed up with guitar or\npiano.  A less traditional one might play klezmer, swing, rock,\nreggae, or EDM.\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nI made a chart:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/contra-bands\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/contra-dance-bands-two-axes.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nClick through for a version with names on hover and links to the\nbands: <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/contra-bands\">interactive</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThese aren't the only axes; I also care a lot about how well a band\nsucceeds at what they're going for, whether I like what they're going\nfor, and how well the band adjusts their playing to support the\ndancing.  But these are either awkward to graph (I'm not going to tell\nyou how I'd order all contra dance bands from best to worst) or I\ndon't have a good sense for a lot of bands (some of these I don't have\nstrong memories of dancing to).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSome of the placements are debatable, and I haven't thought that long\nabout these; feel free to try to convince me to move things around!\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(The top right corner is a bit messy, with several bands that are both\npretty serious and pretty traditional.  Ordering there isn't\nespecially meaningful, and is mostly so they're not too stacked on top\nof each other.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02ucheBRn1qwWz6FP84HXRRAcAzcfzF4XkWPYvoPhE9NhWrYzZU52v72ugadzjWiX5l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/a3qC2QFRo23KMFezr\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110395790113014745\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/two-axes-of-contra-bands", "date_published": "2023-05-19 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
