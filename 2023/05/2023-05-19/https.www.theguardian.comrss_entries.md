<p>Critics decry ‘egregious’ abuse after Fisa court shows repeated violations related to vast foreign intelligence database</p><p>FBI officials repeatedly violated their own standards when they searched a vast repository of foreign intelligence for information related to the January 6 insurrection and racial justice protests in 2020, according court order released Friday.</p><p>FBI officials said the thousands of violations, which also include improper searches of donors to a congressional campaign, predated a series of corrective measures that started in the summer of 2021 and continued last year. But the problems could nonetheless complicate FBI and Justice Department efforts to receive congressional reauthorization of a warrantless surveillance program that law enforcement officials say is needed to counter terrorism, espionage and international cybercrime.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/19/fbi-intelligence-surveillance-court-january-6-blm">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sleeveless formalwear is the go-to office look of the summer</p><p>Picture a waistcoat, that longstanding fixture of formal attire, and poof! . … images of portly magicians straining their buttons are conjured in the mind. Once a statement of refined dressing, the buttoned vest’s status has been diminished over the decades by illusionists, snooker players and eccentric members of the House of Lords.</p><p>But thanks to a new generation of devotees, the waistcoat is enjoying a comeback. The fashion forward England manager, Gareth Southgate, led his team to the World Cup semi-finals in 2018 sporting an M&amp;S version and now, thanks to cultural icons such as Taylor Swift and Sarah Snook’s Shiv from Succession, sleeveless formalwear is the go-to office look of the summer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/may/19/from-gareth-southgate-to-taylor-swift-the-continuing-rise-of-the-waistcoat">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Liverpool’s selfless striker opens up on his bond with the fans and credits Jürgen Klopp with his success after a tricky start</p><p>The master of the no-look goal is looking back once more and sadly, for the legions who cherish the joy that Roberto Firmino has brought to Liverpool over the past eight years, for one final time. “I am trying to focus on the game,” Firmino says of his Anfield farewell against Aston Villa on Saturday. “But after it I will cry 100%.”</p><p>Firmino has avoided media interviews as artfully as opposition defenders throughout his Liverpool career, and also with a beaming smile whenever politely declining another request. But today he makes an exception. He should not, and will not, go quietly. One of the most important and popular figures in Liverpool’s recent history and success under Jürgen Klopp is bowing out with, thus far, 360 appearances and 109 goals, and after seven winners’ medals and countless moments of audacious skill and selflessness.

<ul><li>Glasgow 19-43 Toulon</li><li>Baptiste Serin’s two tries help Toulon take early lead</li></ul><p>Glasgow’s dream of becoming the first Scottish team to secure a major European rugby title was comprehensively shattered in Dublin on Friday by a Toulon side who claimed their own little slice of history. The French club had lost all four of their previous Challenge Cup finals but ran in six tries in a comfortable win over below-par opponents who only spluttered into life late on.</p><p>Even the early loss of a dazed Dan Biggar could not throw Toulon off the scent, with French scrum-half Baptiste Serin contributing 16 points and the soon-to-retire Sergio Parisse, now 39, scoring a valedictory try. Glasgow did their best to recover after going 21-0 down inside the first 25 minutes but never looked like conjuring an improbable comeback on what was, atmosphere wise, a disappointingly low-key evening. Aside from a brace of second-half tries for captain Kyle Steyn and another consolation effort for Sebastián Cancelliere, Glasgow could make relatively few inroads and the final margin could have been wider.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/19/toulon-rout-glasgow-to-win-challenge-cup-final-after-serins-sizzling-start">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Howard Webb’s appearances on Sky and BT Sport sparked thoughts of what  other opportunities may yet be possible</p><p>There are some modern innovations so discomfiting, so problematic, so straightforwardly up-and-down wrong, that no amount of exposure, elucidation or soft lighting can make them acceptable. This week football fans were forced to confront one such example. Apologies for beginning in such a strident manner but: Michael Owen as a TV presenter? That’s a straight no from me.</p><p>Anyway, VAR. The digital refereeing supplement has generated no end of ire since it was introduced to England in 2019. Only now, however, have the officials who oversee it sought properly to engage with the public on the matter. And so, on Monday, we had Sky and BT Sport welcome the Professional Game Match Officials Limited technical director, Howard Webb, to their studios where Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville gave him a gentle grilling and Owen did his best to deliver a series of uncomplicated VT cues.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/19/glimpse-behind-the-var-curtain-was-not-enough-we-need-the-full-reality-show">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ukraine will be on the right side of history – but winning over neutral nations will take a G7 agenda they can follow</p><p></p><p>Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/19/g7-japan-summit-to-target-russian-exports-in-latest-ukraine-war-sanctions" title="">shuttle diplomacy</a> to marginalise Moscow is a necessary step to convince nations with longstanding Russian relationships that there are superior deals on offer. The moral case against Russia is unambiguous. Vladimir Putin has blood on his hands. This argument is better coming from President Zelenskiy than his backers in the west, whose actions from <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/india/modi-new-delhi-upside-rivalry" title="">Vietnam to Iraq</a> reveal a spotty record on matters of morality in foreign policy. His pitch will be that Ukraine will be on the right side of history: as a victim of imperialism but an eventual victor against aggression.</p><p>It would be unthinkable for western leaders to endorse the Arab League’s shameful decision to welcome Syria’s tyrant Bashar al-Assad back into its fold. Mr Zelenskiy is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-to-attend-g7-in-person-reports-say-as-leaders-prepare-new-sanctions?page=with:block-646768b08f088021e118b914#block-646768b08f088021e118b914" title="">attending</a> the Jeddah meeting despite Moscow’s backing of Mr Assad’s brutal suppression of a pro-democracy uprising.

He has made a pragmatic decision: to win over other leaders who have remained largely <a href="https://time.com/6281177/zelensky-arab-league-saudi/" title="">neutral</a> on Russia’s invasion, he will need to accept their norms rather than condemn them.

<p><strong>Jamie Hale</strong>, <strong>Richard Eyre</strong> and <strong>Chris Hodgkins</strong> respond to the director’s proposals</p><p>I read Nicholas Hytner’s article with interest (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/17/arts-council-britain-plan-save-new-body" title="">The arts in Britain are teetering on the brink. Here is my plan to save them, 17 May</a>). As someone who founded and runs a disability arts organisation working everywhere from Zoom to the Barbican, it is clear to me that some of the most exciting and innovative art comes from what he might call “community” and “non-professional” arts, not from what he described as the “top end”. While sports are reasonably objective and have a clear pathway of progression, the arts and cultural sector cannot simply be stratified, without risking ossifying. It is only through bringing together creative communities of people committed to the arts – whether through professional training, personal development, or any combination – that we’ll be able to really have the “best possible art”.</p><p>Separating off the art created by those people fortunate enough to have been able to develop potential careers as “professional artists” will set the diversity of the sector back enormously, returning it more and more to those people who have had the privilege – often formed through financial security – to make their way in an uncertain sector. Hytner is right that we need to save the arts – and certainly right that we need to be investing in arts education – but rather than separating community and professional work, we need to be uniting them.<br /><strong>Jamie Hale</strong><br /><em>Founder and artistic director, CRIPtic Arts</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/19/the-flaws-in-nicholas-hytners-plan-to-save-the-performing-arts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The ban on studying real juries should end, says says <strong>Dr Lewis Ross</strong>, while <strong>Pete Stockwell </strong>writes in support of Nicola Sturgeon’s backing for a pilot of judge-only rape trials</p><p>Nicola Sturgeon argues that we should remain open-minded about the Scottish government’s pilot for juryless rape trials (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/15/jury-less-trials-rapists-scotland-nicola-sturgeon" title="">We don’t know if jury-less trials will convict more rapists, but don’t shut down the debate, 15 May</a>). In my view, the government itself has not been open-minded enough. The premise behind juryless rape trials is that juries are declining to convict because they believe rape myths. However, the research supporting this claim was not conducted on real juries. Since studying live juries is illegal, researchers have to make do with second-best evidence – paying people to take part in make-believe trials involving actors. These “mock trials” have no real-world importance and so we shouldn’t blindly trust that people act the same in real-life cases.</p><p>A truly open-minded approach would end the ban on studying live juries. Letting researchers study real juries as they make decisions would allow our policymaking to be guided by scientific evidence. Forbidding research on live juries is a familiar conservative orthodoxy. But the importance of the debate about the justice deficit in sexual assault trials demands fresh thinking. <br /><strong>Dr Lewis Ross</strong><br /><em>London School of Economics</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/19/we-should-study-live-juries-to-improve-trials">Continue reading...</a>

Bassist with the Smiths whose distinctive melodic style was central to the band’s sound<p>Andy Rourke, who has died of pancreatic cancer aged 59, was a bass player with a distinctive melodic style. His musicianship was integral to the sound of the Smiths, the seminal Manchester band he played in from 1982 to 1987, along with the singer Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr and drummer Mike Joyce. Rourke’s funky twangs were a key component of classic singles such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRP3LRcUFg" title="">This Charming Man</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P22TEf4pZZs" title="">William, It Was Really Nothing</a>, not to mention much-loved album tracks such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siO6dkqidc4" title="">There Is a Light That Never Goes Out</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f37lC0CSXlQ" title="">The Headmaster Ritual</a>. “I tried to do a tune within a tune. I wanted it to stand up on its own,” Rourke once said, pinpointing how his style proved a perfect foil for Marr’s talents.</p><p>The pair first took up guitars at school in 1975, jamming during breaks. They took their friendship and musical kinship into the charts and on to Top of the Pops in the band which, in 2002, NME voted the “most influential of the last 50 years”. Rourke played on all the Smiths’ classic albums – The Smiths (1984), Meat Is Murder (1985), The Queen Is Dead (1986) and Strangeways Here We Come (1987) – as well as 24 singles and other key releases such as the compilation Hatful of Hollow (1984).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/19/andy-rourke-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The ‘remoaner elite’, the civil service, the BBC, universities, unions, refugees: anything is blamed but Brexit itself</p><p>It lasts no more than a second, but it is a moment for the ages. Interviewed on BBC Newsnight on Monday, Nigel Farage made a confession that, by rights, should end the debate that has split this country down the middle for much of the last decade. A month ahead of the seventh anniversary of the 2016 vote that took Britain out of the European Union, Farage said three words of striking simplicity and truth: “Brexit has failed.”</p><p>You can <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1658234370409263106">watch</a> the clip over and over, for it is something to behold. Here is the arch-Brexiter himself, the man who dedicated his life to the cause of rupture from the EU, admitting it has been a disaster. Of course, as we shall see, he and his fellow Brexiters do not blame that failure on the idea itself, but it’s the admission that counts. It offers grounds for modest celebration: now, at last, the contours of an emerging national consensus are visible, as remainers and leavers alike can join in agreement that this thing has not worked. And yet it comes at a price, one that also became darkly visible this week.</p><p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p><p>Join Jonathan Freedland and Marina Hyde for a Guardian Live event in London on Thursday 1 June.

With the tie ostensibly over after their humbling at the hands of a team that had finished 19 points below them, a photo of a flyer hawking seats on an Owls supporters’ bus to Wembley was published to much ridicule. The subtext: “Tee-hee! Look at these guys getting ahead of themselves! That’ll learn them.” On a far more sinister note, there were other posts, many of them toxic and abusive, calling for Wednesday coach Darren Moore’s head despite his side having amassed 96 points over the season, a tally that would have earned them automatic promotion every year in history if Football Daily could be bothered climbing up to the attic to check through the dozens of old Tobacco Yearbooks that are responsible for the worrying bulge in our bedroom ceiling.

<p>The trailer for Gareth Edwards’ new film shows humanity being outsmarted by AI – and is released just as our overlords-to-be are rearing their terrifying heads </p><p>It’s been a while since we had a truly great movie about devious, dystopian AIs priming themselves to take over the world, in which the key choices made by mere humans will decide whether we end up as just an organic footnote in histories written by our machine conquerors. Alex Garland’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/11/alex-garland-ex-machina-interview-the-beach-28-days-later">Ex-Machina</a> (2014) springs to mind, while 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron was a fun comic book romp, if lacking the spiky gravitas and sly intellectual thrust of Garland’s debut. Grant Sputore’s I Am Mother explored similar territory in 2019 with a rather more claustrophobic, yet devastatingly incisive touch. Now there’s Gareth Edwards’ The Creator, the first trailer for which debuted this week, arriving just as very real concerns about the ability of artificial intelligence to really muck things up for us humans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/12/ai-artificial-intelligence-generating-screenplays">are rearing their terrifying digital heads</a>.</p><p>At first glance, it looks as if Edwards has thrown in all our favourite sci-fi tropes. The basic scenario – tooled up military man fails in mission to wipe out robot child because she is just too cute – reminds us of kind-hearted Din Djarin’s inability to bounty hunt Grogu in early episodes of The Mandalorian.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/19/gareth-edwards-the-creator-ai-sci-fi-movies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is the era of the elderly white male finally over? This year’s global extravaganza, boasting a Ghanaian-Scottish curator, features a huge number of exhibitors from Africa – and shows its vicious exploitation continues</p><p>A faceted brick wall stands in the middle of Venice’s Arsenale, like a sharply creased origami screen, blocking the route of visitors to this year’s Architecture Biennale. As you get closer, it looks like a rubble tapestry, with pieces of crushed brick and coloured glass emerging from its gnarled surface like great chunks of mineral nougat. Fine geometric patterns are etched across its facets, adding an air of handmade embroidery.<br /><br />On a wall nearby hang images that explain the origins of this arresting barrier: a reproduction of a 17th-century map of the coasts of Africa and Brazil, a slave-trading ship’s logbook, and a piece of woven raffia from The Kingdom of Kongo. The Brazilian-Paraguayan architect Gloria Cabral and Congolese artist Sammy Baloji have fused these sources to craft a powerful monument to colonial extraction, forced migration, and the debris of empire: the rugged aggregate is demolition waste salvaged from Brussels, the imperial Belgian capital partly built on the brutal rape of the Congo.</p><p>At once tactile, seductive and unsettling, this imposing partition sets the tone for one of the most challenging, multilayered biennales yet, which puts Africa in the spotlight for the first time. It is an intentionally difficult show that explores the toxic landscapes and social scars that riddle the continent’s postcolonial lands, while also offering a glimpse of more hopeful futures brewing among the youthful population. It is a welcome wake-up call, opening a window on to a kaleidoscope of places and topics that have long been overlooked by mainstream architectural culture – as well as framing familiar topics, such as decarbonisation, in a fresh new light.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/19/the-toxic-landscape-of-colonialism-venices-architecture-biennale-spotlights-africa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The influential goalkeeper, who has signed a new deal, believes Arsenal are going places despite slipping in this season’s title race</p><p>When Arsenal returned to training on Tuesday their manager had a pick-me-up ready to go. Mikel Arteta’s quirkier motivational methods have achieved renown but this was more straightforward. Where usually the classroom inquest into a weekend game would bring clips of points for improvement, rounded off by reminders of things they had done well, this time the tone was kept entirely positive. The squad had cut dejected figures leaving the Emirates two days previously, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/14/arsenal-brighton-premier-league-match-report" title="">Brighton having comprehensively put any remaining title pretensions to bed</a>, and even Arteta had struggled to perform his usual hype-man act afterwards. Now he sensed a dose of perspective was needed.</p><p>“We did a different style of meeting, just remembering how far we’ve come,” says Aaron Ramsdale, whose frustration at being lobbed by Deniz Undav for the Seagulls’ second goal had been clear. “He put on the board about how we can still have the most wins by an Arsenal team in the Premier League, and about how it’s very disappointing at the moment but how progressive the season has been, how positive we can be.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/19/aaron-ramsdale-arsenal-bottled-it-thats-just-a-quick-cheap-narrative">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The standup has successfully used laughter as a balm, creating a safe space for himself and the audience to engage with this most difficult of subjects</p><p>The death of a loved one. It’s the least funny thing in the world, right? Try telling that to Sam Morrison, who has made a show about his bereavement journey since losing his partner to Covid in 2021. Sugar Daddy, already well received in New York and in London this week, is a wonderfully intimate offering from the 28-year-old that stints neither on big laughs, nor on honesty about Morrison’s grief. It’s a case study in the leaps comedy has taken, and continues to take, into territory that until recently most professional jokers would have considered out of bounds.</p><p>Morrison’s show is no outlier, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/17/arts/television/grief-stand-up-comedy.html">a piece in the New York Times</a> makes clear: there is a rash of standup shows about grief. Why so? Consider it the logical endpoint – or latest stage – of the process that has seen comedy, growing in confidence as an artform, address itself over the last decade to ever less comical subject matter. All those shows about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/oct/19/tig-notaro-reveals-cancer-on-stage">cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/10/chris-gethard-at-edinburgh-festival-review-frank-and-funny-tales-of-depression">mental ill health</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/22/richard-gadd-edinburgh-festival-fringe-comedy">trauma</a>; the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/02/dead-funny-comedy-grief-standups-death-humour-laughter">dead-dad shows</a>, supposedly so common as to become a cliche?

<p>Republican Florida governor reportedly dismissed Donald Trump’s chances as he gears up to announce his candidacy on Wednesday</p><p>Two things are happening simultaneously in the Republican presidential primary field: more candidates are arriving, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is staying as popular as ever.</p><p>Just take a look at <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/2024/national/">poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight</a> for evidence of that.

<p>The decaying parliament building – and the hypocrisy of those who should be fixing it – says a lot about a nation that’s seen better days</p><p>Britain increasingly feels like a terribly old country. We keep hearing its pipework hasn’t been properly overhauled since the Victorian age, so its own sewage laps at its shores and courses through its rivers. Earlier this month we crowned our oldest ever new monarch, a man who looked a picture of melancholy pretty much throughout, even if media sycophancy made it verboten to categorise the mood as anything other than joyous renewal. The country is overwhelmingly governed in the interests of older voters at the expense of the young. And this week, the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/palace-of-westminster-in-danger-of-destruction-while-mps-dither-over-repairs-vjj9mp7rw">latest update on the literally crumbling Houses of Parliament</a> warned that the building is so comprehensively knackered it could be destroyed before renovation is agreed upon, let alone begun. This would be the only conceivable occasion on which this cohort of politicians could be described as bringing the house down.</p><p>Even the sewage crisis has been folded into the nostalgia myths that some find more comfortable than dealing with the present. “I remember as a child in south Wales swimming in sewage,” <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-65615711">reminisced the Conservative MP Damian Green</a> this week. “Jackson’s Bay in Barry used to be a sewage outlet where we all went and paddled and swam...”</p><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/19/mps-london-elites-parliament-building-nation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tara and her friends decamp to a garish holiday resort on the lookout for her first sexual experience in Molly Manning Walker’s strong debut feature</p><p>Full-on energy, likable performances and uncompromisingly daft jokes turbocharge this debut feature from British film-maker Molly Manning Walker, about three teenage girls up for the holiday of a lifetime in the party town of Malia in Crete, and trying not to think about the exam results which their parents could tactlessly text them at any moment.<br /><br />The film delivers an intriguingly sympathetic, complex and even mysterious performance from Mia McKenna-Bruce as the shyest of the trio: Tara, whose face in closeup registers subtly shifting moods. For her, the quest for sex means more than for the others. She has still not had experience. Manning Walker herself coolly manages the film’s own mood, drifting towards crisis and retreating from it.<br /><br />Tara, or Taz, and her mates Skye (Lara Peake) and Em (Enva Lewis) show up and get a room overlooking the pool in one of the resort hotels along Malia’s main street: at night pulsing with garish neon drunkenness and during the day eerily deserted, like the location for a gunfight in a western.<br /><br />On one horrendously hungover morning on the balcony, Tara is aware of a young man on the next-door balcony looking at her. This is the goofy Badger (Shaun Thomas), there with his mates; he senses something of her loneliness and desperation to get sex out of the way. But of course Tara wants this to happen with the right candidate: it’s a moment for which, unlike A-levels, there are no retakes. Poor Badger naturally wants to pull himself – but in a million different ways puts himself in the friend zone with Tara, and part of their complex chemistry is that both perhaps want friendship more. It is Badger’s sexier, more boorish and insensitive mate Paddy (Samuel Bottomley) who takes Tara for a walk on the beach one night and meanwhile there is a connection between Em and a gay girl in the boys’ room: Paige (Laura Ambler).<br /><br />But as the situation with Paddy progresses, amid the 24/7 bacchanal of pool parties and club nights led by robo-cheery reps, the exact nature of the resulting event is left in question, and the title itself assumes a multiple-meaning. With banteringly concealed envy Skye asks Tara how it was: “Did he throw you around and that?” Did he? Does Tara want to remember it that way? Does she want to remember it at all? Consent is ambiguous. The film shows that the post-sex phase in Tara’s mind is perhaps composed of an inner negotiation: should she forget it and move on? This is an interestingly unsentimental film, without the coming-of-age cliches, and one from which the three leads emerge stronger and happier than before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/19/how-to-have-sex-review-an-education-in-consent-for-24-hour-party-people">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Santorini’s revered grape is now being grown farther afield, and its wine is well worth seeking out</p><p>Greece has been producing wine for longer even than Italy, though you’d hardly think so, considering its continued absence from most of our supermarket shelves. Mind you, that could soon be about to change due in no small part to the growing popularity of what has become Greece’s signature white grape, assyrtiko. It first took off on the island of Santorini, but the grape is now being planted all over the country, in areas such as the Atalanti Valley in Central Greece and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(region)">Macedonia</a>. Happily, it’s a brilliant pairing with all things Greek, including the ubiquitous Greek salad, and goes equally well with seafood from anywhere.</p><p>That’s the good news. The bad news is that assyrtiko has got progressively more expensive in recent years, especially examples from Santorini itself, where the growing conditions are exceptionally challenging, from the volcanic soil (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2004243117#:~:text=The%20Greek%20island%20of%20Santorini,than%20originally%20thought%20(1)">the island was ripped apart by a devastating eruption back in 1600BC</a>) to the lack of rain: Santorini gets a fraction of the mainland’s rainfall and instead relies on the moisture from the heavy mist that falls nightly over the island. It’s also subject to violent winds, which accounts for the unique way the vines are trained, coiled around like a woven basket. While the stems are cut back from time to time, the root systems can date back hundreds of years: “When we say old vines here, we don’t mean 40 years old,” explains Yiannis Paraskevopoulous of <a href="https://gaiawines.gr/en/about-en/">Gaia Wines</a>. “We mean 400.”</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/19/its-all-greek-to-me-assyrtiko-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

He is 70 metres above the ground, behind him is the vast Eiffel Tower, below him the River Seine. From a distance, the speck of him fades into the cityscape.</p><p>This is Nathan Paulin. He is a French highliner, another term for a tightrope walker, except that Paulin uses a slackline – the name is fairly self-explanatory – and he’s never been near a circus. Paulin is usually to be found rigging his slackline between two mountains in the Alps, or walking a record-breaking 2.2km, 100m in the air, to the island of Mont Saint Michel off the Normandy coast, wind whirling around him. “The first feeling is always fear,” says Paulin, 29, talking of the moment he steps out on the line. “But after the first few steps I start to feel comfortable. When I’m on the line, I feel more sensitive about everything. I’m not a spectator but I feel like I belong to the environment. I can hear everything around me.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/19/dance-corps-extremes-high-wire">Continue reading...</a>

But the book also suggests another genesis point for the Smiths, several years earlier, when he first meets, then is assigned by his school to keep an eye on, a troubled fellow pupil called Andy Rourke. Hailing from a noticeably more monied background than Marr’s own, Rourke had effectively been left to his own devices by his divorced parents and developed a drug habit that would grow to encompass heroin. The pair became friends and musical partners, performing together in teenage bands. The Smiths initially tried to do without Rourke, but could not: after one gig, Marr fired bass player Dale Hibbert and drafted his friend, despite misgivings about his drug use.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/19/andy-rourke-the-smiths-bassist">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Only God can say – That’s enough’: Wanda Sykes, the uncancellable standup superstar

<p>She ditched life as a government agent to become a comedian, one so fearless she even has a ‘tampon lasso’. The comic legend discusses cancelled men, coming out – and calling out Roseanne</p><p>About halfway through her new Netflix special, Wanda Sykes squats down and mimes pulling a tampon out from between her legs. To the noisy delight of her sold-out live audience, she swings the imaginary sanitary product round her head like a lasso. It’s not just an anarchic attempt to sum up the kind of bad behaviour that goes on in public toilets – it’s also a takedown of transphobic moral panic. After all, these spaces that people are freaking out about admitting trans women to – they’re not exactly the most pleasant places in the world. “I welcome my trans sisters into the ladies’ room,” she shrugs to the crowd. “Maybe you’ll make us do better, y’know?”</p><p>At 59, and with 30 years’ standup experience behind her, Wanda Sykes can segue from the personal to the political, and back again, in a hot flash. Her latest special, I’m an Entertainer, has material on her family life, how medical sexism has let down menopausal women and why Black people can’t be “weird” for fear of being murdered in the street – (“We have to fit the stereotype … [but] white people do weird shit all the time. Renaissance fairs – what the fuck is that?”) – which she switches between with the effortless groove of a Soul Train line dancer. Is she ever <em>not</em> enjoying herself? “In the early stages, when I’m trying new stuff, I’m anxious to see what it’s gonna do,” she muses from her Pennsylvania home. “But once it’s all there … <em>Man</em>. That’s when it’s fun.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/19/wanda-sykes-interview-comedy-netflix-im-entertainer-good-fight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Acclaimed actor in European art cinema also secured a prominent role in US soap opera Dynasty</p><p>Austrian actor Helmut Berger, who became a star of 60s and 70s art cinema with roles in films such as Luchino Visconti’s The Damned, and Ludwig and Joseph Losey’s The Romantic Englishwoman, has died aged 78. His death was announced by his management agency, which posted <a href="https://www.helmutwernermanagement.at/kuenstler/helmut-berger/">a statement on its website</a> saying Berger had “passed away peacefully but unexpectedly” in Salzburg, the city where he grew up.</p><p>Born Helmut Steinberger in the Austrian spa town of Bad Ischl in 1944, Berger studied acting in London before moving to Italy, where he met and began a relationship with acclaimed director Luchino Visconti, nearly 40 years his senior. Visconti gave him his first acting role, a small part in the comic anthology The Witches, and subsequently cast him in a spectacular role in his landmark 1969 epic The Damned. Berger played Martin von Essenbeck, a scion of a wealthy industrial family who struggle for control over the business in interwar Germany as the Nazis rise to power; for the film, Berger famously performed in drag as Marlene Dietrich and was subsequently nominated for a Golden Globe for most promising male newcomer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/19/helmut-berger-star-of-visconti-the-damned-dies-aged-78">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Hammers have struggled in the league but would they really ditch a manager who has taken them to a first European final since 1976?</p><p>The message coming out of West Ham at the start of the week was there would be no decision on David Moyes’s future until the end of the season. Yet by the time Pablo Fornals was beating two AZ Alkmaar defenders and running through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/18/az-alkmaar-west-ham-europa-conference-league-match-report">to score in the 94th minute</a> at the AFAS Stadion on Thursday night, it seemed absurd that anyone could possibly want to replace Moyes.</p><p>They were all off the bench when Fornals drove his low shot into the net, their reward for not treating the Europa Conference League as an inconvenience being a place in the final against Fiorentina. In those moments it was worth remembering that West Ham have put up with a lot of rubbish for much of their existence. This is the good stuff and, even if the standard of the Conference League has not been high, nobody who cares about West Ham was going to be sniffy about reaching a European final for the first time since 1976.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/19/west-hams-european-adventure-leaves-them-with-a-david-moyes-dilemma">Continue reading...</a>

Despite huge pressure from their allies to demonstrate that the equipment and ammunition that have been committed can be converted into serious territorial gains, Ukrainian officials are at pains to assert that this coming campaign is unlikely to be decisive. Instead, gains are more likely to be slow and incremental than sweeping and extensive.</p><p>Over the past year Ukraine has been forced to fight a war of attrition at <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/leaked-intelligence-documents-put-ukrainian-russian-total-casualties-up-to-354-000/#:~:text=Edit%20post-,Leaked%20intelligence%20papers%20suggest%20that%20Ukrainian%2C%20Russian,casualties%20reach%20up%20to%20354%2C000&amp;text=Leaked%20U.S.%20intelligence%20documents%20suggest,Reuters%20reported%20on%20April%2012.">truly punishing cost</a>. Wars of attrition such as this are never quick, and it is naive to believe that it will be over soon. There is no room for the idea that “it will all be over by Christmas”; it won’t. And probably not the Christmas afterwards either. Sustaining this effort into the medium- (one to three years) and long-term ( two to 10 years) will require a prodigious industrial effort, and a step-change in the supply of military equipment, far greater than what we have already seen. Whatever the situation is at the end of this summer’s series of operations, Russia is not going away.

## Cah Chi, New Malden: ‘An umami-drenched patch of extreme deliciousness’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants

<p>The whole thing is perfect, not to mention hugely entertaining for the lunching Korean grandmothers watching me try to eat with chopsticks</p><p>New Malden is an area of south London that, due to a quirk of fate, has one of the highest concentrations of good eating in the entire UK. It’s a neighbour of Kingston upon Thames, and close to Worcester Park, Norbiton, Tolworth and many other semi-anonymous suburbs that never trouble the Places To Eat Before You Die foodie bucket lists. What gives the area its sparkle, however, is its Korean population, which some say numbers only about 800, but could in reality be many more, because that figure doesn’t take into account all the temporary visitors, hungry South Korean and Chinese-Korean tourists and, presumably, quiet North Korean ones, too, though no one keeps much of a record on them. Regardless of the headcount, there are upwards of 20 more-than-decent Korean restaurants in New Malden, providing the opportunity to eat <em>pajeon</em>, <em>bibimbap</em>, <em>bulg</em><em>ogi</em>, noodles and hotpots; there are also a load of supermarkets where you can stock up on <em>gochugaru</em> and soju, plus cafes selling sweet treats such as <em>patbingsu</em>, a shaved ice dessert topped with sweet stewed adzuki beans that, to my mind, is one of the most delicious things on earth. It’s the firmness of the beans, you see, and the sugary hit of the burgundy-coloured sauce surrounding them.</p><p>If you’re not hugely familiar with Korean food, consider patbingsu and the spring onion and/or seafood pancake pajeon as your gateway drugs. I had been tipped off that they served a <em>very</em> good pajeon at Cah Chi on the Kingston Road, a family-run spot that has changed venues a few times over the years and opened here only a month or so ago, but has retained a loyal fanbase for its simple yet delicious taste of home. I visited on a wet Wednesday lunchtime, half-expecting to be one of the only customers, but found the place packed, due in no small part to Cah Chi’s warm welcome, and to the fact that a round of steamed <em>saewoo mandu</em> (seafood dumplings) comes with some of the most glorious fresh <em>banchan</em> (small plates): a dainty pile of lush, green, wonderfully seasoned spinach, pickled cucumber, fierce, roughly hewn kimchi and a mound of black, sticky, braised soy beans.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/19/cah-chi-new-malden-restaurant-review-grace-dent">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Taking their clothes off was a metaphor’: The Full Monty creators on the return of their Sheffield strippers

<p>The boys are back 25 years on from the original film, but no one gets naked and the women are more than just wives. Writers Simon Beaufoy and Alice Nutter talk about the new TV spin-off’s place in an asset-stripped state</p><p><strong>Simon Beaufoy</strong> Back in the mid-90s, I was unexpectedly kicking my heels in Sheffield. My girlfriend was in hospital and there wasn’t much to do in between visiting hours other than wander. It was a city literally being demolished in front of my eyes; there was a sort of grim theatricality to watching the wrecking ball take down another steel mill. Fifteen years of the Conservatives’ determination to allow heavy industry to collapse had left the north of England devastated. Men who had done the same job as their father and grandfather were now in a sort of shock, at a loss as to what to do with their lives, unsure of their place in the world.</p><p>The whole idea of male strippers wasn’t terribly interesting to me initially – the Chippendales were old news by then – until our astute producer, Uberto Pasolini, asked: “What’s happened to the British man that he’d take his clothes off for money? In Italy this would never happen!” Suddenly, everything clicked. I thought: what if we put it in the context of what was happening in Sheffield? What if we made taking your clothes off a metaphor for desperation, a loss of identity that working-class men from the steelworks had had stripped away from them by a government that appeared indifferent to the effects of their policies? Suddenly, we had comedy, politics and pathos all coalescing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/19/full-monty-disney-plus-simon-beaufoy-alice-nutter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Don’t wait until your climbers become unwieldy before giving them a helping hand</p><p>This is a busy time on my veg patch. The spring crops are established and the summer ones are finding their feet. The soft fruit plants – raspberries, redcurrants and blackcurrants – are starting to swell while the self-sown nasturtiums, calendula and poached egg plant are beginning to take up more space. Every day, a harvest awaits. Leaves of punchy rocket and oak-leafed lettuce leaves for a salad with dinner, and rhubarb stems shucked from their crown and stewed for dessert.</p><p>Putting in support structures for your plants is a pre-emptive act, a gesture made in the hope that your crops will flourish. So, since their growth is probably gathering pace, don’t wait until your plants become unwieldy before giving them something to lean on as they grow. They’ll be healthier for it, plus it makes harvest easier.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/19/lend-your-plants-some-support-theyll-do-better-with-something-to-lean-on">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is it OK to love the art of a morally repugnant artist?</p><p>Is it OK to love a film, a book or a painting if its maker turns out to be a bad person? Not just lovable aw-shucks everyday bad, the sort who forgets to pick the kids up because he or she is too busy making art, but someone whose behaviour is immoral, illegal or both? A monster, in fact.</p><p>This is the dilemma that Claire Dederer addresses in this exhilarating, gnarly inquiry into the business of separating the author’s repugnant life from his or her magnificent work. It is hardly a new topic – in the middle of the last century, the proponents of New Criticism were arguing about what they called the “biographical fallacy” and duly concluding that the critic should set aside an artist’s life and concentrate on their work alone. But then, Dederer points out tartly, they would say that, wouldn’t they? As mostly elite white men, these critics were naturally inclined to hand out free passes to others for the kind of bad behaviour with which they were themselves on intimate terms – parental absence, alcoholic indulgence and that impregnable self-regard that inflicts collateral damage on everyone else.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/19/monsters-a-fans-dilemma-by-claire-dederer-review-beauty-and-the-beast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Last weekend’s fixtures were supposed to send a united anti-homophobia message but the result bordered on a fiasco</p><p>“It’s catastrophic,” bemoaned the Brest manager, Eric Roy, after his team’s slender win over Auxerre. “It’s very good that the league is getting involved, but I think it needs to deal with football first of all.” The former midfielder was criticising the timing of last weekend’s anti-homophobia campaign in France’s top two divisions, which involved managers and captains wearing rainbow-coloured armbands and the numbers on the back of players’ shirts featuring the same motif. “We’re clearly seeing that it’s causing a problem for some players. Everyone has their opinions; personally it’s not a problem for me.”</p><p>“Don’t do it in the final four games, when clubs’ survival is at stake,” Roy went on, ostensibly unaware that last week’s matchday was chosen because 17 May is International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. Evidently, the founders should have taken the ramifications on future Ligue 1 relegation battles into consideration before choosing that day – marking the World Health Organization’s decision to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder – to draw attention to violence and discrimination experienced by LGBTQ+ people.</p><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/rafajuc">Raphaël Jucobin</a> is the editor-in-chief of <a href="https://twitter.com/GFFN">Get French Football News</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/19/ligue-1-lgbtq-campaign-absent-players-and-tone-deaf-managers">Continue reading...</a>

Immortalised in cinema and literature by The Godfather, it became synonymous with organised crime, even if the bosses who once governed it – Riina, Luciano Leggio and Bernardo Provenzano – are now dead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/19/corleone-the-sicilian-town-trying-to-break-free-of-its-mobster-past">Continue reading...</a>

## Hailing a father as a ‘doesband’ just shows how few look after their own children | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett

<p>Hands-on dads are certainly more commonplace among younger generations, but they are still seen as the exception</p><p>Are you a “doesband”? The latest irritating portmanteau refers to a husband who parents his own children. “A doesband has his own hectic job, but still does his fair share at home Without Being Asked,” writes Harriet Walker, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-partner-every-woman-should-have-a-doesband-k2sds3hfc">the Times journalist </a>who coined the term. “A doesband knows where the Calpol is and when ballet kit is needed … He gets up with the children and does bedtime; he feeds them, bathes them, does the school run; knows when their nails need to be cut and that behind their ears can get gunky.”</p><p>I hate the term, but Walker makes a salient point: that men who share childcare equally with their partners, including the mental load, are still rarer than they should be. There are more and more female breadwinners, but according to the Office for National Statistics, women still do 60% more unpaid work than men. Walker writes about staying awkwardly silent during conversations with other women about their useless partners. It can feel like boasting to go into just how much your male partner does (I’m only discussing heterosexual relationships here).</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author</p><p><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

## Rebel, rapist, libertine or libertarian? Staging Mozart’s Don Giovanni

<p>Mozart’s anti-hero can be many things, just as his opera can be read on multiple levels. Ahead of a new production at Glyndebourne, director Mariame Clément considers truth, interpretation and legitimacy</p><p>It’s unusual for a director to write about her work, apart from texts for programme notes. What should I write about? I can start with what I don’t want to write about. Addressing the question of whether we can still perform Don Giovanni today? (Spoiler: we can). Not that the question isn’t relevant, but the production itself should be the answer. Explaining the meaning of the staging? Again, the production should speak for itself. Analysing the piece and exposing the various theories and interpretations of Da Ponte’s libretto and Mozart’s music? It would take more than a page in the Guardian, and it’s the job of academics. As a stage director, I’ve done my homework, but like the stitches in a dress, it shouldn’t be apparent. It’s the result that counts.</p><p>One definition of my job is telling the story. Sounds simple enough. What is the plot of Don Giovanni? Act one, scene one. Leporello is playing sentry for his master at night in front of Donna Anna’s house. Fighting is heard. Don Giovanni and Donna Anna storm out. He is masked, she is furious: he has attempted to rape her, and she intends to find out who he is. No, wait – in many productions I’ve seen, she’s following him because she loves him and doesn’t want to let him leave: the rape thing is a lie made up to protect her honour. We’re not five minutes into the story, and it isn’t clear what happened. Funny how on the opera stage just as in real life, it seems people have a hard time figuring out the truth when it comes to rape. How do we deal with this in real life? Inquiries, investigations, trials – we try to understand what happened. But what is the truth in a play? There are no facts beyond the words said on stage. There are some clues. The full title of the piece (<em>Don Giovanni, ossia il dissoluto punito</em> – “or the punishment of a dissolute man”); the context – historically, it is unlikely that the authors would have represented respectable Donna Anna as sexually turned on by a man to the point of following him on to the street; also literary tradition and history – the idea that a character has dark and subconscious desires would be anachronistic: in 1787, characters pretty much mean what they say. This is where the homework helps in understanding what the authors might have meant. You could call that historically informed reconstitution.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/19/rebel-rapist-libertine-or-libertarian-staging-mozart-don-giovanni-glyndebourne-mariame-clement">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The story of Dora, an ageing writer, is told in observant fragments that form a ‘punishing self-portrait’</p><p>Female novelists seem to be getting a bit of a bashing these days. Some literature courses offer trigger warnings for anyone frightened by the “toxicity” of Jane Eyre or Northanger Abbey. Tom Rachman’s The Imposters doesn’t let them off too lightly either. His first novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/10/the-imperfectionists-tom-rachman-review">The Imperfectionists</a>, focused on journalists. Here he offers a convoluted study of a different sort of writer, the ageing novelist Dora, in a treatment that is not unfeeling, though needlessly contorted.</p><p>The book, one gradually realises, is supposed to have been written by Dora – Rachman is playing the ventriloquist here, with Dora his dummy. What we get are disparate pieces of fiction that Dora is presumably working on (mostly in the present tense, alas – almost always a mistake). These stories within stories, combined with scored-out sentences, snatches of her diary and Dora’s own cameo appearances, coalesce into a “punishing self-portrait”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/19/the-imposters-by-tom-rachman-review-novelists-writ-large">Continue reading...</a>

<p>End game approaches in the title race, Leeds and Leicester hear the clock ticking and Anfield celebrates a legend</p><p>The permutations of Chelsea’s visit for Manchester City’s title prospects are as follows: if Arsenal win at Nottingham Forest on Saturday, Pep Guardiola’s side have to beat their visitors to ensure a successful defence. A draw for the Gunners means City will all but retain their crown whatever the result against Chelsea due to a superior goal difference of 20 but a point will ensure this. And if Mikel Arteta’s team lose, the Etihad Stadium will be in party mode from the start, the scene of the coronation of City as the three-peat English champions, an achievement only Manchester United, Liverpool, Huddersfield Town and Arsenal have previously managed. Given the rampant form of Pep Guardiola’s side, the one scenario so far not mentioned seems highly unlikely: that, at the final whistle, Arsenal’s challenge will remain live.</p><p><em>Manchester City v Chelsea, Sunday 4pm (all times shown BST)</em></p><p><em>Nottingham Forest v Arsenal, Saturday 5.30pm</em></p><p><em>West Ham v Leeds, Sunday 1.30pm</em></p><p><em>Bournemouth v Manchester United, Saturday 3pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/19/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Warner Records)</strong><br />There are some gorgeous songs here, and some inventive arrangements, but the wit and honesty of her previous work seems diminished </p><p>For years, Brandy Clark has been one of country music’s most <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/16/brandy-clark-country-music-nashville-interview">reliable provocateurs</a>. She writes witty songs about characters with endearing quirks: the woman who would kill her cheating partner if not for the fact that she knows the prison jumpsuit wouldn’t suit her; the wild child who issues the simple ultimatum: “If you want the girl next door / Then go next door.”</p><p>Clark’s self-titled fourth album, produced by US singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile, is supposedly her rawest since her 2013 debut 12 Stories. That may be true – there are gorgeous songs here about Clark’s Pacific north-west home and her family – but it often feels as if she has mistaken seriousness for honesty. Aside from a few lovely ballads, such as the sparse Buried and plaintive maybe-breakup song Come Back to Me, most of these songs feel anonymous. A line like this, from 2020’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtZM28iWEyM">Pawn Shop</a> – “Someone told me it cost a lot / Man, ain’t that the truth” – feels far more revealing than “There’s a blue sky / Up above the clouds” on this album’s Cecilia’s Song.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/19/brandy-clark-brandy-clark-review-country-provocateur-holds-too-much-back-on-faltering-fourth-album">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The effort to stay below 1.5C needs to be a battle people feel we can win. They must sound the alarm, and make sure politicians listen</p><p>The end of the world is nigh, again. And as usual, it’s being greeted largely with a shrug. Perhaps you felt a prick of unease as you scrolled the headlines, or half listened over breakfast to some radio debate about the fact that sometime in the next four years the planet is likely to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/17/global-heating-climate-crisis-record-temperatures-wmo-research">breach the 1.5C rise</a> in global temperature that we have long been told is the tipping point to avoid. (Although this time the breach should be only temporary, the World Meteorological Organisation report stresses that it still takes us into uncharted waters, and if nothing changes the world is likely to cross this dangerous threshold more and more often in future.)</p><p>Perhaps you even felt rage or frustration that it’s taking everyone else so long to wake up.

## Foreign Bodies: Pandemics, Vaccines and the Health of Nations by Simon Schama review – scientists to the rescue

<p>The historian offers up lessons from past pandemics in an indictment of modern leaders’ response to Covid</p><p>‘In the end,” writes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simonschama" title="">Simon Schama</a> at the beginning of his extraordinary book on pandemics old and new, “all history is natural history.” Foreign Bodies is ostensibly an account of the bacteriologists and epidemiologists who studied the natural history of infectious diseases from the late 18th to the early 20th centuries, developing vaccines and saving millions from smallpox, cholera and the plague. But as its subtitle suggests, it is also a reflection on the political and scientific conflicts of the Covid pandemic, and the failure of contemporary leaders to coordinate a scientifically driven global response to the virus.</p><p>Over millennia, biological and environmental imperatives rather than states and empires have shaped human destiny. Now capitalism’s degradation of the planet threatens our future survival. Zoonosis – the transmission of infectious diseases from animals to humans – has always bedevilled humanity, but the risks are increasing as we encroach further into natural habitats. The Global Virome project estimates that there are more than half a million unknown viruses with zoonotic potential; since 1980 sub-equatorial regions have experienced viral outbreaks every eight months; the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars" title="">Sars epidemic</a> of 2003–4 has now been traced back to dragon-tiger-phoenix soup, a combination of palm civet meat, chrysanthemum petals and snake served in restaurants in southern China. If these facts are sobering, the response of our politicians, described with measured fury by Schama, is terrifying: now as before, international cooperation founders as national tribalism belittles science and its “cosmopolitan” practitioners.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/19/foreign-bodies-pandemics-vaccines-and-the-health-of-nations-by-simon-schama-review-scientists-to-the-rescue">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Voters as young as 16 will play a pivotal role as country goes to the polls on Sunday</p><p>Greek politicians are courting an estimated 430,000 generation Z voters, some as young as 16, as the country braces for a general election, taking to TikTok and YouTube to woo what could be a key demographic.</p><p>A smile crosses Stefanos Tsiandis’s face when talk turns to a poll that has been as low-key as it is unpredictable.<strong> </strong>As a first-time voter, the 19-year-old knows exactly which party he’ll be rooting for when he casts his ballot on Sunday. But that, he adds, is rare. “Our vote counts, and mine will go to Pasok,” says the economics student, proudly posing with the flag of the centre-left party he has just waved vigorously at a campaign rally beneath the Acropolis. “It’s disgusting how they’re making all these promises to win our support.

<p>The spellbinding singer returns with an album of warm, empathic folk-soul – plus a screaming lemur – to salute LGBTQ+ trailblazers, Lou Reed and more. She explains why we must forgive our enemies if we are ever to make change</p><p>In the summer of 1992, Anohni kissed the hand of Marsha P Johnson. Then 21, the British-born singer had moved to New York to study experimental theatre at New York University and was beginning to piece together her chosen family. “I quite idealised her,” Anohni says today of Johnson, the renowned activist who fought in the 1969 Stonewall uprising against anti-LGBTQ+ policing in New York, and spent her life at the vanguard of queer and transgender liberation. “A lot of her innovations were unprecedented.”</p><p>Six days after Anohni met her, Johnson’s body was found floating in New York’s Hudson river in circumstances that remain mysterious. “That period of weeks changed the direction of my life,” Anohni says. Since then, Johnson has been something of a spiritual guide: Anohni named her band the Johnsons in tribute, and on her debut album, 2000’s Antony and the Johnsons, exalted Marsha on the chamber rock elegy River of Sorrow. “No precious liar or well-wisher / Can return the love that was stolen,” she lamented.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/19/anohni-and-the-johnsons-my-back-was-a-bridge-interview">Continue reading...</a>

I asked why. Because, he said, you are too interested in politics. Stick to journalism. A political career was not about politics, but about loyalty.</p><p>Never a truer word was spoken. As the tottering frame of Britain’s Tory party heads for collapse at the end of this parliament, it is clearly suffering death throes. Loyalty, long that party’s “secret weapon”, has deserted it.
