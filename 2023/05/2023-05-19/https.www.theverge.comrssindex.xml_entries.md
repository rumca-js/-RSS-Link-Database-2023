  <p id="sA7XzG">It looks like Samsung isn’t going to use Bing as the default search engine on its mobile web browser after all. That’s according <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-is-spared-a-search-engine-switch-by-a-major-partner-f06b734f">to a report from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, which says Samsung paused an internal review of whether the company should replace Google with Bing on its in-house Internet Browser.</p>
<p id="GZv8Md">Samsung’s Internet Browser, which comes pre-installed on Samsung phones, has long used Google as its default search engine. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/technology/google-search-engine-ai.html">reported last month by <em>The New York Times</em></a>, Google employees were “shocked” to learn that Samsung had been contemplating a switch to Bing, putting at stake the $3 billion in annual revenue that the search giant gets out of the deal. </p>

  <p id="X5L4wI">New York City is sinking under the weight of its skyscrapers, new research shows, which could put its population of more than 8 million people at an increased risk of coastal flooding.</p>
<p id="htTv78">A <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022EF003465">new study</a> by the United States Geological Survey found the city is sinking at a rate of about 1–2mm per year, although certain parts of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and northern Staten Island are sinking at a faster rate of 2.75mm each year. </p>
<p id="OUSoEb">This could worsen the city’s already high risk of coastal flooding as a result of climate-amplified sea level rise. The New York City Panel on Climate Change <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans-studies/climate-resiliency/resiliency-newsletter-11-sea-level-rise-in-nyc.pdf">estimates</a> that, while the world’s sea levels have risen by about 0.5 inches per decade, New York City has had a much faster rate of about 1.2 inches per...</p>

  <p id="esKWxT">NASA has picked Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin to make a lunar lander for an upcoming Artemis mission to the Moon, the agency announced on Friday. As part of the $3.4 billion contract, there will be one uncrewed “demonstration mission” ahead of a human-crewed demo that’s set to take place in 2029 for the Artemis V mission, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-blue-origin-as-second-artemis-lunar-lander-provider">according to a press release</a>.</p>
<p id="hySGdH">Currently, the plan for the Artemis V mission is for four astronauts to first fly to the Gateway space station on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23630712/nasa-artemis-2-rocket-launch-sls-update-moon">NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS)</a> rocket and the Orion spacecraft.
