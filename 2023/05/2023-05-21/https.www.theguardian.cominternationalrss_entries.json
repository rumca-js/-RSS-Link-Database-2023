At Non-League Finals Day, the double header that has become a rich addition (spiritually if not financially) to the English football calendar, Kai Walters of Ascot United and Jamie Cooke of FC Halifax Town were carved on to the list of players who have lived the ultimate childhood daydream by scoring a winning goal at Wembley.</p><p>Non-League Finals Day, which started in 2016, is an opportunity for four teams of semi-professional players to see how the other half live. It combines the finals of the FA Vase, the knockout trophy for teams in tiers nine and 10 of English men\u2019s football, and the FA Trophy (tiers five to eight). There\u2019s none of the entitlement and ennui you sometimes see when the biggest clubs return to Wembley, and the mood around the stadium is subtly different: eyes are a little wider, smiles a little broader, songs a little lustier.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/21/dreams-come-true-for-footballs-everymen-on-non-league-finals-day\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/21/dreams-come-true-for-footballs-everymen-on-non-league-finals-day", "date_published": "2023-05-21 18:35:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Manchester City cap title triumph with win over Chelsea thanks to \u00c1lvarez", "description": "<p>Manchester City have never enjoyed a more dominant moment \u2013 or a more tantalising one.
