	A WNBA coach is upset that Brittney Griner's return didn't sell the arena out and wants to know why. One would think it has something to do with the word "WNBA," yet here we are.
</p><p>
	Los Angeles Sparks player Brittney Griner was arrested in Russia when she was caught in marijuana. Reefer. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brittney-griner-biden-paul-whelan" target="_blank">Because she was both African-American and LGBTQ</a>, a deal was made to trade her for someone called "The Merchant of Death." Seriously, the black and gay thing was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brittney-griner-merchant-death" target="_blank">what the Biden Admin and their acolytes promoted as to why we should praise them</a>. Side note, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brittney-griner-russian-media" target="_blank">Russia is laughing at us</a>.
</p><p>
	Griner returned to the court yesterday with special guest Kamala Harris. Over 10,000 fans showed up for a team <a href="https://www.outkick.com/brittney-griner-wnba-game-attendance-los-angeles-sparks-vanessa-nygaard/" target="_blank">who only averaged 5600 fans</a> a game last season. While anyone in the WNBA should be thrilled that a single game doubled their usual attendance, Phoenix Mercury coach Vanessa Nygaard head coach found it problematic.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote><p>To put the 10,000+ in comparison, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wnba-protest-roe" target="_blank">here's what attendance for a typical WNBA game</a> looks like:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Topless pro-choice protestors run onto court at WNBA game<br /><br /> <a href="https://t.co/Tp6ahqAsD7">pic.twitter.com/Tp6ahqAsD7</a><br />‚Äî The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) <a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1534526966841368576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It was not a sellout because it is the WNBA and no matter how hard the media tries, they can't make people care about the WNBA. That includes WOMEN who you would think would be thrilled they had their own NBA league. Yet...<br /></p><p>
	Hey Siri, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-burr-wnba-netflix" target="_blank">what was that Bill Burr said about the WNBA</a>?

## Social service kiosks?: NYC announces new plan to "combat" shoplifting that's beyond parody

Like other progressive cities, NYC has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/store-owner-thief-locked-door" target="_blank">an alarming number of people</a> who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/michael-rapaport-rite-aid-nyc" target="_blank">go into stores and think they don't have to pay for stuff</a>. And I know what you're thinking. "But Brodigan, that's because those cities stopped enforcing laws and let people steal. Wouldn't a new plan be to go back to enforcing laws?"</p><p>Two things. One, LOL you said "butt Brodigan." And B, you would think so, huh? Out here in Real America where you and I live, we have laws and DON'T have a rampant retail-theft problem.  In New York City, they have new a plan to combat theirs. Or I should say "combat" in finger quotes.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">NYC Mayor Eric Adams just unveiled his new plan to combat skyrocketing retail theft in the city. <br /><br />These are not serious people. <a href="https://t.co/ovD5hT7APb">https://t.co/ovD5hT7APb</a> <a href="https://t.co/WCGai1CRHA">pic.twitter.com/WCGai1CRHA</a><br />‚Äî AG (@AGHamilton29) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGHamilton29/status/1659724159738339328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Mayor Adams feels this new plan will tackle an issue that shows retail theft is up 44% and a third of suspects are repeat offenders.</p><blockquote>Give first-time offender intervention programs instead of prosecution</blockquote><p>Not prosecuting first-time offenders is how they become repeat offenders. You let them know they can get away with it, so they do.</p><blockquote>De-escalation training for retail employees</blockquote><p>It's unclear how you can de-escalate <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/michael-rapaport-shoplifter" target="_blank">from currently doing nothing</a>. Though I get a feeling a consultant will get paid a ludicrous amount of public tax dollars to tell us. Are the employees supposed to hold the bag as people shoplift?</p><blockquote>Establish neighborhood retail watch groups to share theft info in real-time w/one another and NYPD.</blockquote><p>I just... no.</p><p>This one is my favorite.</p><blockquote>Install kiosks in stores to connect would-be thieves w/ social service programs</blockquote><p>There are people working in your government who think if they set up computers in stores, someone who has the intention of stealing is going to see the computer, scroll through the information, and decide instead of continuing their criminal ways they are going to take the city up on their job training courses. Instead of the most likely outcome: stealing the kiosk too.</p><p>Our progressive cities are governed by nincompoops. Yet progressive voters keep reelecting them. It's a coin toss over who the biggest nincompoop is.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
