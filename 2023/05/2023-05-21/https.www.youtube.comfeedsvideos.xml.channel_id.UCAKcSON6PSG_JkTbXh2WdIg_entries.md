It may have seemed all was lost when Abraham Alexander’s college soccer career was ended by an ACL injury. But it was during his recuperation that someone handed Alexander a guitar — and the next chapter of his life began. “I could express myself in ways that I never knew I could before," Alexander recalls. “It was like one of those moments where the light shines … It just made so much sense.”

Drawing inspiration from artists like Gary Clark Jr. and Leon Bridges, Alexander set about writing songs and road-testing them at open mics. All the effort has paid off, and Alexander is now touring in support of his debut album, SEA/SONS (pronounced “seasons”), which released April 14.

Abraham Alexander recently visited The Current studio to perform songs from SEA/SONS and to chat with host Bill DeVille. Watch the complete session above.

Ruston Kelly’s third full-length album, "The Weakness," released April 7, 2023. Now touring in support of the album, Kelly is savoring the time, to say the least. “The relief of being back onstage doing what I love to do the most is, it's kind of wordless to be able to express how happy it makes me,” he says.

Kelly’s tour included a stop at First Avenue in Minneapolis, and the morning before the show, Kelly visited The Current studio to perform solo acoustic versions of songs from "The Weakness," and to chat with host Bill DeVille.

Watch the complete session above.
