[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Elevator Positioning", "description": "<p><span>\n\nI really don't like the feeling of leaving an elevator and not knowing\nwhether to go left or right.  You need to be moving so you don't\nbother the people behind you, but if you just pick a direction you\nmight be going completely the wrong way.  My sense of direction is\npretty good outside but inside it's patchy, effectively on a\nfloor-by-floor basis.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nA few months ago I realized that while waiting for the elevator I can\ngenerally work out which way I'll want to walk when I get off.  I\ndon't have anything else to do while waiting, so it's a nice short\npuzzle.  Once I figure it out I stand on the side of the elevator\nopposite where I intend to get out, and maintain that inside the car.\nWhen I get to the top I know which way to go from where I'm standing,\nin case I forgot on the way up, and I go from 50% success in leaving\npointing the right way to ~95%.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0LEqxvdXLgAi7AQVasSamS7GGX6ZfQcZDM4EKLAnL6eyLkJgAaVPHxPLA5NfKyGDZl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110406419955711836\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/elevator-positioning", "date_published": "2023-05-21 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
