But even leaving aside the fact that so many film-makers are not very good at the old-fashioned business of storytelling, the fact is that cinema does not have to be about story, however uncommercial an idea that seems.<br /><br />The Argentinian director Lisandro Alonso is a case in point: his work is challenging and opaque and taken an uncompromisingly andante pace and yes, it is probably destined to be shown at festivals. But it is also weirdly hypnotic and exalted and magnificent in its way, and often has nothing do with story. His last movie, with Viggo Mortensen, entitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/09/juaja-review-viggo-mortensen-in-existential-quest\">Jauja</a>, was a case in point. Now he has come to Cannes with his experimentally non-narrative meditation on the global condition of indigenous peoples. It is entirely fascinating, though undoubtedly it requires the audience to recalibrate their own consumption-tempo and attention span stamina.<br /><br />We begin with an eerily slow black-and-white sequence which appears to be an old-fashioned western, with Viggo Mortensen playing some stranger arriving in a windblown American town in the Old West. From there, we shift, in full colour, to a Native American reservation in the contemporary US, where a Native American police officer picks up an actor from that movie by the side of the road with car trouble. This same officer gives the actor a ride to a nearby school where her niece Sadie coaches basketball. Then she resumes her increasingly dreary workload: picking up a violent drunk with a knife and another drunk driver and attending to reports of a fistfight at a casino.</p><p>But she seems disinclined to answer her despatcher\u2019s calls for information and this despatcher\u2019s radio calls seem like wan calls into an empty void. Meanwhile, young Sadie, herself apparently tired of life calls on her grandfather to give her a potion which will give her deliverance: a brew which cause her soul to change into a large bird which flies through time and space to the Brazilian jungle of the early 70s, where the member of some religious community kills someone in a knife fight and escapes to where gold is being prospected and meet his own strange destiny with the bird-soul as witness.<br /><br />The entirely bizarre narrative or anti-narrative conveys nothing of film\u2019s dreamy effect, its prose-poetic procedure or its status as artwork. It\u2019s a film which moves laterally away from its starting point and more or less ignores those Aristotelean unities of time and place that most film\u2019s stick to. And the title is another enigmatic thing about it. There is certainly no obvious \u201cEureka\u201d moment of discovery or understanding. But there is a sort of sensory perception, a feeling that through drifting downstream along the river-course of this film, and gazing at the foliage on either bank, some progress of the soul is being achieved. It is an enriching experience.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/21/eureka-review-booze-bird-souls-and-viggo-mortensen-in-barmy-yet-rich-experimental-enigma\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/21/eureka-review-booze-bird-souls-and-viggo-mortensen-in-barmy-yet-rich-experimental-enigma", "date_published": "2023-05-21 17:50:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Ben Jennings on Suella Braverman\u2019s speeding fine \u2013 cartoon", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2023/may/21/ben-jennings-on-suella-bravermans-speeding-fine-cartoon\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2023/may/21/ben-jennings-on-suella-bravermans-speeding-fine-cartoon", "date_published": "2023-05-21 17:33:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Guardian view on England\u2019s water companies: a badly broken system | Editorial", "description": "<p>Ministers were warned about the risks of private equity entering the sector but did nothing. Now we\u2019re paying the price</p><p>The revelation should anger all who care about England\u2019s rivers and beaches. Two decades ago, ministers were warned about private equity firms buying up water companies. In a briefing prepared for Britain\u2019s competition regulator prior to the takeover of Southern Water, researchers raised the alarm that private equity-owned water companies would become \u201cimpossible\u201d to regulate. Despite the 20-year transparency rule, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has not released the briefing. Its existence was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/20/revealed-warning-to-ministers-over-privatised-water-kept-secret-since-2002\" title=\"\">uncovered by this newspaper</a>. Though its full contents remain secret, its implications are clear: ministers were alerted to the devastating impact that this industry could have on England\u2019s water supply, but they chose not to act.</p><p>Since then, a tide of effluent has polluted England\u2019s rivers. Following the privatisation of water companies in 1989, owners have enriched themselves while neglecting infrastructure and dumping vast quantities of untreated sewage. As investors have loaded water companies with debt, they have continued to pay dividends to their shareholders, which totalled <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee03d551-8eee-4136-9eeb-7c8b51169a99\" title=\"\">\u00a31.4bn last year</a>.

Ruth Kelly, the former Labour cabinet minister who is head of the industry\u2019s trade body, Water UK, said more should have been done to address the spillages.

It reminded me at various stages of Billy Wilder\u2019s Agatha Christie adaptation Witness for the Prosecution or Steven Bochco\u2019s underrated, under-remembered 90s TV drama Murder One.<br /><br />Sandra H\u00fcller plays Sandra, a successful and fashionable author (that staple figure of French cinema), German by birth, but now living in a handsome chalet in the French Alps with her French husband Samuel (Samuel Theis), a former academic and would-be author himself, who has now hit a career slump and creative block and is currently hoping to salvage the family finances by fixing up the chalet as an Airbnb. It is while he is grumpily sawing and hammering upstairs, with the music on too loud, that Sandra attempts to give an interview, which simply has to be abandoned because of the noise. Sandra wearily attempts to take a nap, while the couple\u2019s son Daniel (Milo Machado Graner) takes their dog Snoop for a walk.<br /><br />But when he returns, his dad\u2019s corpse is lying on the snow outside the chalet with a brutal wound on his head. Did he fall from the top window? Did his head hit something on the way down? Or did someone hit him? Poor Daniel is an unreliable witness because he is blind, the result of an accident which Sandra always blamed on Samuel, who was supposed to be looking after him at the time, and which caused Samuel to spiral into depressive anger; he hated Sandra for her affairs and for plagiarising what she felt was an idea of his \u2014 Sandra perhaps still blamed him for their son\u2019s condition. It isn\u2019t long before the cops have snapped the cuffs on Sandra and charged her with murder. She employs as her lawyer an old friend (Swann Arlaud) who may in love with her. Yet her fate may still lie in the hands of her blind son who saw nothing at all, yet might still remember something convenient at any moment.</p><p>Sandra H\u00fcller\u2019s calm directness as an actor is what gives the film its texture, substance and emotional force. She anchors it in a kind of accessible reality: we naturally sympathise with her, and yet Triet shows us that she is capable of transparent lies, lies which are almost credible because H\u00fcller is such a plausible personality. The men that surround her seem to be over-emotional, more emotional than her \u2014 odd, as she is the one facing a prison sentence.<br /><br />And as the film pursues its own forensic style of drama: we see the body itself examined, and the event itself bizarrely reconstructed by the defence, with a dummy dropped from the window, to determine if the corpse\u2019s trajectory and the resulting blood splatters incriminate Sandra or not. The film does not signpost the traditional twists and turns and dramatic reversals, but keeps a cool distance, letting us wonder if Sandra is guilty or not, and we are kept guessing until the end. It\u2019s a lowkey, almost downbeat drama, but with something invigoratingly cerebral.<br /></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/21/anatomy-of-a-fall-review-sandra-huller-compels-as-an-author-accused-of-her-husbands\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/21/anatomy-of-a-fall-review-sandra-huller-compels-as-an-author-accused-of-her-husbands", "date_published": "2023-05-21 17:27:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Guardian view on Pakistan\u2019s army: go back to the barracks | Editorial", "description": "<p>The confrontation between the country\u2019s most popular politician, Imran Khan, and the generals threatens to paralyse the state</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/14/imran-khan-arrest-pakistan-military\" title=\"\">standoff</a> between Imran Khan, Pakistan\u2019s former prime minister, and the country\u2019s military is yet another sign that the political system created by the army is inherently unstable.

As the Trinidadian writer Sam Selvon wryly notes in his 1956 Windrush novel <em>The Lonely Londoners</em>: \u201cBefore Jamaicans start to invade Brit\u2019n, it was a hell of a thing to pick up a piece of saltfish anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Initially operated by savvy white English or south Asian businesspeople \u2013 and then by enterprising West Indians selling shipped produce out of vans \u2013 by the early 1960s, Black-owned Caribbean food shops dotted Britain\u2019s major cities, and had emerged as vital points of cultural connection and congregation. \u201cThey were significant because they were among the first public displays of Caribbean life, besides music, that people from outside the community would have interacted with,\u201d notes <a href=\"https://theface.com/culture/belly-full-riaz-phillips-caribbean-food-uk\" title=\"\">Riaz Phillips</a>, author of <em>Belly Full</em> and chronicler of Caribbean diaspora food in the UK. \u201cFor those within the community, bakeries, mini markets and restaurants were more like social hubs than just places to buy food.

One might have to insert a qualifying \u201cmale\u201d here. Or go the other way, stop generalizing and say how thoroughly he had me in his thrall throughout the 1980s and 90s. There were writers I admired more but he was more fun to read than all of them put together. I sat there aghast at his transformative impact on language. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/29/100-best-novels-93-martin-amis-money\">Money</a> he imported an American form \u2013 the voice-powered monologue \u2013 and mixed it in with vernacular English ingredients that were traditional and of the moment. The next big novel was called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/30/martin-amis-london-fields-film-amber-heard-interview\">London Fields</a> but this phase of extended dominance can be likened to an earlier titular declaration from 1979: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/09/the-clash-london-calling-reviewed-january-1980\">London Calling</a>. But just as this was a New York-inflected London, so the daylight yobbery of register was always being yanked (in both senses) into a subtly different gear by a mix of inheritance (Kingsley), institution (first-class English degree from Oxford) and indebtedness to American favourites: Saul Bellow, pre-eminently). An ironic consequence of all this was that Amis\u2019s contemporaneity made Bellow seem old-worldy (while Martin enjoyed the dubious distinction of being referred to as an <em>enfant terrible</em> well into his sixties).</p><p>But what was this <em>this</em>? Or, More exactly <em>where</em> was it? In Money, obviously, but the truth is that with the exception of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/09/bookclub-martin-amis-times-arrow\">Time\u2019s Arrow</a><em> </em>Amis\u2019s other major novels were all overlong. I tired of them even in the midst of relishing them. London Fields sagged fatally \u2013 then sprang back into life. The Information was unable to sustain the weight and momentum of its opening. What this meant was that he was at his consistent best in the collections of journalism such as The Moronic Inferno and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/apr/14/fiction.martinamis\">The War Against Cliche</a>. His signature strength as a writer \u2013 the electrifying prose \u2013 was also a component of his shortcoming as a novelist. In some ways, an unflashy writer such as Tessa Hadley seems to get closer to the permanent mystery of great fiction than he ever did. But style is not just a varnish; it is, as he pointed out, intrinsic to perception. Every page of his writing \u2013 in any form \u2013 was steeped in his consciousness and I was besotted by that consciousness in all its forms. I think that\u2019s why there was such a personality cult around Amis in a way that there could never be a cult of Julian Barnes or AS Byatt.

There\u2019s Athena Liu, a critical and commercial darling who has just signed a deal with Netflix, and green-eyed frenemy Juniper Hayward, whose debut has already been forgotten, the paperback publication axed owing to poor sales. The novel starts with the pair toasting Athena\u2019s success in her ritzy apartment after a night on the town; Juniper, our narrator, is choking down her resentment when, suddenly, Athena is literally \u2013 and fatally \u2013 choking on a homemade pancake\u2026<br /><br />It\u2019s a freak accident whose sheer unbelievability sounds the keynote for a novel circling the slipperiness of truth, but most of all it gets the motor running on the novel\u2019s plot, a brazen literary heist. Athena had just shown Juniper her secret new manuscript \u2013 an epic novel about the Chinese workers recruited by the British army in the first world war, drafted on a typewriter (\u201cno Word backups, no Google Docs, no Scrivener\u201d, which is to say, no plot holes here, OK?). In the subsequent blur of events, from 911 call to tear-stained Uber ride home, Juniper spirits away the stack of pages then just can\u2019t help publishing it under her own name, rebranded as June Song (Song being her middle name, given by her hippy mother).</p><p>At first, the calculatedly fuzzy sobriquet wrongfoots anyone ready to accuse a non-Asian writer of cultural appropriation. And all Juniper\u2019s dreams come true: the squillion-dollar advance, the critical kudos, a spot on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list. Sure, there\u2019s the small matter of Athena\u2019s mother pledging her daughter\u2019s research notebooks to a university archive (something she\u2019s talked out of a little too conveniently), not to mention some grumbling from an Asian-American editorial assistant (less easily dismissed). But Juniper still basks in the glow of success \u2013 at least until Twitter raises its collective eyebrow and she\u2019s mired in an ever-widening plagiarism scandal.<br /><br />Sustaining the fraud in the eye of the storm requires ever more manic deception \u2013 and self-deception. After all, didn\u2019t Juniper simply midwife a far-from-ready draft that might otherwise never have seen daylight? And in the first place, hadn\u2019t Athena once strip-mined sensitive details of Juniper\u2019s personal life for an early short story? And it\u2019s so hard for white writers to catch a break these days\u2026<br /><br />As the excuses pile up, Kuang convincingly keeps the ground shifting as to whether Juniper\u2019s confession is just another con trick, as well as concealing the scale of her misdemeanours. As a tale of rivalrous friendship that morphs into lurid revenge melodrama and even a sort-of ghost story, <em>Yellowface</em> keeps us agog, narrowing its eyes all the while at an industry\u2019s attitudes towards racial diversity. Still, it\u2019s a thriller about the book trade \u2013 the appeal is niche \u2013 and you can sense Kuang\u2019s uncertainty about what does and doesn\u2019t need explaining. The reader who cares to know that the central characters became fast friends over a shared love of Elif Batuman\u2019s <em>The Idiot</em> (\u201c\u2018It is the perfect campus tale,\u2019 Athena said, articulating clearly every feeling I\u2019d ever had about the novel\u201d) isn\u2019t, I suspect, a reader who needs to be told that paperbacks are cheaper than hardbacks, as Juniper at one point handily lets us know.<br /><br />That said, I probably wolfed this down more avidly than anything I\u2019ve read this year. It\u2019s often wickedly funny: Juniper stakes her entire sense of self on the fallacy that she wrote Athena\u2019s novel, yet also privately exults when critics find fault with it (she always knew Athena was a hack). But there\u2019s deeper comedy, too. Juniper\u2019s ill-gotten gains mean she can give up \u2013 wait for it \u2013 ghost-writing college application essays; and in one scene, she twigs that her agent is bullshitting her over the phone about Chinese politics because she\u2019s reading the same Wikipedia entry as him at exactly the same time. Everyone\u2019s bluffing, Kuang seems to say, and in its deepest implications <em>Yellowface</em> ultimately posits any creative act as a pilfering of one sort or another. Or have I just been Juniper-pilled and fallen for her sob story? It\u2019s the knife edge on which this clever and entertaining send-up leaves you poised.</p><p><em>Yellowface</em> by Rebecca F Kuang is published by the Borough Press (\u00a316.99).

Environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy\u2019s Allison Ogden-Newton said: \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we understand what makes women and girls feel safe or unsafe across our green spaces and what needs to change to make them feel able to use their local park.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/21/eva-wiseman-column-before-women-feel-safe-in-parks-they-must-be-safe\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/21/eva-wiseman-column-before-women-feel-safe-in-parks-they-must-be-safe", "date_published": "2023-05-21 07:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Ten title-race turning points: how Manchester City overtook Arsenal", "description": "<p>The battle between the defending Premier League champions and their challengers has been full of twists and turns</p><p>Manchester City are Premier League champions after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/nottingham-forest-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal lost 1-0 to Nottingham Forest</a> on Saturday.

Certainly, throughout the 20th century, you could trace the spread of the Bordelais way across the globe by following plantings of the most important of Bordeaux\u2019s red grapes \u2013 cabernet sauvignon \u2013 to vineyards in California, Chile, China\u2026 pretty much everywhere wine is made. Such was its dominance, familiarity began to breed a little contempt for cabernet \u2013 a situation which has not been helped by the way it\u2019s been used to make some of the world\u2019s more powerfully syrupy red wines by winemakers who forget that great Bordeaux always leavens the power with a little Atlantic-influenced freshness. In the right hands, cabernet sauvignon is far too interesting and adaptable a grape to ignore, however, with a wine such as the superb-value Big Beltie bringing a little French Mediterranean solar charge to the classic cassis characters.</p><p><strong>Wynns The Siding Coonawarra Cabernet, Coonawarra, South Australia, Australia 2021 (\u00a315, <a href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/309207479\">Tesco</a>)</strong> Australian red winemakers may be best known for shiraz, and in recent years they have been building a reputation for fine pinot noir, but they also consistently produce some of the finest cabernet sauvignons in the world. What I like about Australian cabernet is the way it varies from region to region: there is a real sense of place to the country\u2019s best bottles. At a sumptuous recent tasting of 30 or so of the southern hemisphere\u2019s best cabernets hosted by the magazine <em>The World of Fine Wine</em>, the standouts included such variously gorgeous wines as the sublimely silky, pretty Victorian Yarra Yering Carrodus Cabernet Sauvignon (Yarra Valley, Australia 2018); the densely powerful, endlessly complex South Australian Penfolds Bin 707 Cabernet Sauvignon ((South Australia 2010); and the lushly pure cassis-fruited Wynns Coonawarra Estate John Riddoch Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra, Australia 2020). Only the Riddoch will leave you with change from \u00a3100 if you can find a bottle, but fortunately Wynns The Siding offers a succulent sample of Coonawarra cassis at a more accessible price.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/21/the-red-wine-grape-that-conquered-the-world\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/21/the-red-wine-grape-that-conquered-the-world", "date_published": "2023-05-21 05:01:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Killers of the Flower Moon review \u2013 Scorsese\u2019s magnificent period epic is an instant American classic", "description": "<p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro star in a sinuous, pitch-black tragedy about how the west was really won</p><p>Fate has smiled on the Osage Indian nation, out in Oklahoma.
