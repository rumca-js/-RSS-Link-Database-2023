He turned himself in and has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. To recap, video had come out of Penny choking unhoused homeless man Jordan Neely. And <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-neely-weekend-protests-subway\" target=\"_blank\">while the usual suspects didn't wait for facts</a>, we later found out that<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-neely-aditional-context\" target=\"_blank\"> Neely was acting violent and threatening passengers</a> until Penny attempted to do something.</p><p>A GoFundMe has been launched to help with Penny's legal expenses. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is expected to enter the GOP presidential race next month, is helping raise money for the Marine and wants him to know America has his back.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">We must defeat the Soros-Funded DAs, stop the Left's pro-criminal agenda, and take back the streets for law abiding citizens.

You know, \"context.\" <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/05/12/jordan-neely-chokehold-death-witness-praying-for-daniel-penny/\" target=\"_blank\">They spoke anonymously to the New York Post</a>.</p><blockquote>\"[Neely] said, 'I don't care. I'll take a bullet, I'll go to jail' because he would kill people on the train,\" she recalled. \"He said, 'I would kill a motherf*cker. I don't care. I'll take a bullet. I'll go to jail'.\"<br /><br />The retiree said Penny did not initially engage with Neely during the wild rant until things got out of hand and he felt the urge to step in.<br /><br />\u201cThis gentleman, Mr. Penny, did not stand up,\u201d the rider said. \u201cDid not engage with the gentleman. He said not a word. It was all Mr. Neely that was \u2026 threatening the passengers. If he did not get what he wants.\u201d<br /></blockquote><p>Second-degree manslaughter in New York City is a felony that could carry up to a fifteen-year prison sentence. That is bad enough. What's worse is that this is New York City where activists want the Marine charged with murder. One of those activists COULD be the judge, or be able to influence the judge.
