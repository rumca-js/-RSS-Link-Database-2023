Asked to respond to the social services minister’s comments, he said:</p><p><em><strong>Oh that’s just rot</strong>. You would expect that from a government that doesn’t seem to be focused on the things that are really going to help all Australians to put downward pressure on inflation, getting people into work.</em></p><p><em>The analysis is simple: Over 430,000 job vacancies … if there was ever an opportunity to get people into work it’s now.</em></p><p><em>This is a thought bubble by Peter Dutton. And what we don’t know is how this will actually encourage workforce participation. He’s provided no evidence to suggest that this would alleviate barriers that many people on jobseeker have in gaining employment. He quoted 75% of job seekers don’t report any earnings. But of course, that means they’re already not taking out the income-free threshold of $150.</em></p><p><em>Now, of course, we’re going through a whole range of scenarios and analysis through our white paper on labour and full employment and so we will continue to work through that process in a rigorous way.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/may/14/australia-news-live-jim-chalmers-federal-budget-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese-amanda-rishworth-shark-attack-victoria-nazis">Continue reading...</a>
