Google has spent a couple of decades creating products that make my life easier. This week, it demonstrated the exact opposite: a way to make communicating with other people worse.</p>
<p id="Vo4lUd">Google I/O, this year, was focused on artificial intelligence, and one of its centerpieces was prompt-based text generation, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23718301/google-ai-workspace-features-duet-docs-gmail-io">particularly in Google’s office suite</a>. At several points throughout the keynote, it demoed a system called “Help me write” — which rewrites simple prompts in Gmail and other apps as more polished paragraphs of text. But <em>more polished</em> doesn’t automatically mean <em>better.</em></p>

  <p id="VrqqQE">There was a chilly marine layer hanging in the air above the Shoreline Amphitheater, but the danceable beats thumped on in spite of it. Dan Deacon was playing a set that had something to do with AI, followed by a person in a duck costume dancing on stage. Not the kind of spectacle you’re typically expecting before you’ve even had your second cup of coffee, but that’s Google I/O, baby. </p>
<p id="hWBDAn">I/O is, of course, the company’s yearly developer conference, and it officially kicked off on Wednesday morning when CEO Sundar Pichai took the stage, headlining a two-hour presentation that was almost entirely centered on AI.
