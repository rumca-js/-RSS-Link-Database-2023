This week, it demonstrated the exact opposite: a way to make communicating with other people worse.</p>\n<p id=\"Vo4lUd\">Google I/O, this year, was focused on artificial intelligence, and one of its centerpieces was prompt-based text generation, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23718301/google-ai-workspace-features-duet-docs-gmail-io\">particularly in Google\u2019s office suite</a>.
