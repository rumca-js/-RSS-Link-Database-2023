Turns out there\u2019s rather a lot, says the author of the much-loved Flavour Thesaurus</p><p>Miso is a flavourful paste made from fermented soybeans. Rice or <em>kome</em> miso, the most popular type, is made with soybeans, water, salt and rice inoculated with a culture called koji. In barley or <em>mugi</em> miso, the rice koji is replaced by barley koji. But the most obvious difference between misos is in their appearance: they can be straw-pale or near-black, smooth or chunky. As a rule, the paler the miso, the sweeter and lighter it will be. Some leading authorities on miso maintain that the complexity of its flavour makes it hard for westerners to describe, but I\u2019d beg to differ. It\u2019s hard to describe the taste of a courgette, but miso is so flavourful that it\u2019s hard to stop describing it \u2013 you might detect barnyard, nutty, brown butter, caramelised, exotic fruit (banana, mango, pineapple), olive, briny, boozy or chestnut blossom notes. It is especially good with rustic flavours such as alliums, root vegetables and seaweed, but it has some less likely partners, too.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/13/niki-segnit-beginners-guide-to-cooking-with-miso\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/13/niki-segnit-beginners-guide-to-cooking-with-miso", "date_published": "2023-05-13 13:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Stosie Madi\u2019s vegan recipe for Lebanese stuffed cabbage rolls | The new vegan", "description": "<p>Beans, herbs and Levantine spices combined with fragrant basmati, stuffed into cabbage leaves and baked in a hearty stock</p><p>Stuffed vegetables, or <em>mehsh\u00e9</em> in Arabic, are among my all-time favourite dishes, and stuffed cabbage-leaf rolls, which are found in some form or other all over Europe and the Middle East, are hard to beat.
