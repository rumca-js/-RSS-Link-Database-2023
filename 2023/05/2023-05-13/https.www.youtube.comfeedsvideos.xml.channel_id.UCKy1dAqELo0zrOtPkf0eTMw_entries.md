An important returning feature in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the limit to your inventory - including melee weapons, bows, and shields. The only way to increase your inventory in Breath of the Wild was by finding collectible Korok Seeds and giving them to a character named Hestu — and Tears of the Kingdom is no different. In this video guide, we’ll help you track down the elusive Hestu, and show you a few places where he might show up after your first meeting in Zelda: TotK.

Check out the trailer for our latest IGN Inside Stories episode, The Nier: Automata Mod That Fooled the World, coming to IGN on May 20.

In June 2022, a new user on the Nier Automata subreddit asked a fairly innocuous question: "How do you open the church?" The problem? There was no such church. SadFutago kicked off a beautiful mess of a multi-month storyline that twisted the community, media, and even expert modders into knots.

We tracked down the trio of creators behind SadFutago to get the true tale behind the Nier church saga. This is the IGN Inside Story of the Nier Automata modders that fooled the world.

When The Fast Saga first began back in 2001, it was about a bunch of edgy street racers who liked to steal large quantities of obsolete consumer electronics. Nowadays, Dom Toretto and the rest of the family are constantly saving the world and doing crazy things like driving cars in space. So how did we get to this? To understand, we need to go back to the beginning and piece it all together. Here’s the Fast and The Furious Timeline in chronological order, updated for 2023 and the release of Fast X. 

This timeline includes all of the films and important moments from the Fast Saga – 2001's The Fast and the Furious, the Hobbs and Shaw spin-off and everything through, Fast and the Furious 9, a.k.a. Fast 9, a.k.a. F9 as we prepare for Fast X.

Check out our Fast and the Furious timeline for all the details of Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto and Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner, just the start of the Toretto family – A Fast Family – even though the actual Torreto family was already a thing. The film series has veered off in some unexpected directions, with the Diesel-less 2 Fast 2 Furious and the Walker-less The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift before the brothers were reunited eight years after the original for 2009's Fast & Furious.

So dive into the story so far of the Fast family in this Fast and the Furious timeline in chronological order, 2023 edition!

The Kingdom of Hyrule is a vast place to explore in Tears of the Kingdom, and while you’ll eventually be able to skydive from towers and utilize Zonai devices to cross land, sea, and air, there are sometimes when you just need a mount that doesn’t rely on batteries. This holds especially true early in the game when you’re still discovering new regions and towers, so in this guide video, we’ll show you exactly how to find, tame, register, and upgrade your brand-new horse. Really, it’s everything you need to know about your general horse in Zelda: TotK.

Just like in Breath of the Wild, there are tons of shrines to explore in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. In each, you'll earn a new upgrade resource called Light of Blessing and you can find at least one bonus treasure chest hidden somewhere in the shrine. After collecting four Lights of Blessing, you can take these to a Goddess Statue to expand either your heart containers or your stamina bar. Whichever one you choose, both are vital to ensuring that your time in Hyrule is a success, so we’re here to tell you which of these shrines you should visit and complete first in Zelda: TotK.
