In this video, I'm sharing some big news about my life. My partner, HR lady, and I are both moving out of our house and into a fifth wheel with our dogs. We've realized that we were living a life that wasn't really meant for us, and we wanted to simplify things and focus on what we really need to be happy. We'll be living in the desert and mountains and traveling around, producing YouTube videos from our fifth wheel. We're downsizing and getting rid of excess possessions that were bogging us down. Right now, we're figuring out the logistics of where we're going to stay and how we're going to handle things like working out and eating on the road. We're excited for this new chapter and can't wait to share more content with our viewers.
