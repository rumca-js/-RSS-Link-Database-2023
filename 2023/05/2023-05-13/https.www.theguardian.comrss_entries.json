For the better part of the last decade, the steady fulcrum around which the NBA has revolved has been the special ongoing rivalry between future first-ballot Hall of Famers LeBron James and Stephen Curry.</p><p>Some basketball fans grew up at a time when they watched Magic Johnson and Larry Bird duke it out year after year, and other fandoms were formed during the swath of time in which extraordinary players, like Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant, dominated the league and had no singular, definitive rival to speak of. Personally, basketball didn\u2019t come into my life in a meaningful way until early adulthood, so for basically as long as I\u2019ve been paying attention, an NBA centered around LeBron and Steph has represented the permanent blueprint. Any aspirant to the throne inevitably had to go through one or the other to reach the mountaintop, and for the four straight years Steph\u2019s Warriors and LeBron\u2019s Cavaliers met in the NBA finals (from 2015 to 2018), no one successfully did.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/13/lebron-james-stephen-curry-rivalry-lakers-warriors\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/13/lebron-james-stephen-curry-rivalry-lakers-warriors", "date_published": "2023-05-13 11:15:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Leroy Cooper, photographer whose arrest led to Toxteth riots, dies", "description": "<p>Cooper was arrested after going to aid of fellow protester in 1981 and went on to photograph Liverpool life</p><p>The Liverpool photographer Leroy Cooper, whose arrest led to the Toxteth riots in 1981, has died, aged 62.</p><p>Cooper, who was also a writer and activist, was arrested in front of protesters after he went to the aid of a fellow Liverpool resident in July 1981.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/13/leroy-cooper-photographer-whose-arrest-led-to-toxteth-riots-dies\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/13/leroy-cooper-photographer-whose-arrest-led-to-toxteth-riots-dies", "date_published": "2023-05-13 11:14:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "North Wales police suspend officer after footage shows \u2018punching\u2019 incident", "description": "<p>Clip online appears to show a man being restrained and then punched nine times in the face</p><p>A police officer in north Wales has been suspended from duty after appearing to punch a man nine times while arresting him.</p><p>North Wales police said the action had been taken after the incident in Porthmadog, Gwynedd, on Wednesday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/13/north-wales-police-suspend-officer-after-footage-shows-punching-incident\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/13/north-wales-police-suspend-officer-after-footage-shows-punching-incident", "date_published": "2023-05-13 11:13:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Kevin Sinfield: \u2018The longer this marathon takes, the more time I get to spend with Rob\u2019", "description": "<p>In Sunday\u2019s Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon, Sinfield will push his former Rhinos teammate \u2013 who has motor neurone disease \u2013 for 26.2 miles in a wheelchair: \u2018We\u2019ll have some fun, I promise you\u2019</p><p>Stroll up the hill from Headingley Stadium, the place with which Kevin Sinfield became synonymous, and you cannot miss an enormous mural of the rugby league legend.

The novel<em> </em>focuses on a period of transition as this young woman emerges from a difficult childhood and an abusive relationship. She quits her job, sculpts a beautiful and powerful body, eats clean, and develops her own meditation technique. Her skin takes on a hallowed but very literal glow.

At the gym she meets Elliot, a lonely workaholic. She is increasingly estranged from her isolated mother, Bella. Susie, a former colleague, becomes her flatmate for a while. Elliot, Bella and Susie are all painfully vulnerable and chronically lonely. There is no framing device, no pretext for their telling us what they know about this woman, and the background is so lightly sketched that it feels neutralised. Elliot lives in an anonymous urban area, a poignant sunset skyline seen through the gym\u2019s glass wall.
