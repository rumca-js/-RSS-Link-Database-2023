<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> Tunic of the Wind can also be called the classic green tunic. That's because it would generally remind you of Link's outfit in older Zelda games. Remember those? Although Link was a bit "bluer" in Breath of the Wild, and he starts topless in Tears, you could soon grab this nostalgic attire piece. Here's our guide to help you get the Tunic of the Wind in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><h2>How to get the Tunic of the Wind in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p>To be fair, we (or I, actually) stumbled upon the Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Tunic of the Wind location by accident. Basically, I was looking for the last <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-depths-chasm-guide/1100-6514040/">Chasm for the Depths quest chain</a>. Through a bit of aimless roaming, I ended up dropping down into Hyrule Field Chasm. That's where the whole thing started. Here's the gist:</p><ul><li>1 - From Hyrule Field Chasm, follow the path that leads to the next Lightroot. Technically, you'll also be following the statues.</li><li>2 - Upon reaching the end of the path, you'll notice a dead end, as well as a fallen statue. If you're doing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-master-kohga-boss-guide/1100-6514042/"><strong>Master Kohga quest chain</strong></a> or if you're looking for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-hebra-mine-guide/1100-6514041/"><strong>Abandoned Hebra Mine</strong></a>, then a Yiga Ninja will attack you here, too.</li><li>3 - From the fallen statue, head slightly southwest, which leads to Cuho Canyon Mine.</li></ul><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4137290-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-tunic-of-the-wind-classic-green-tunic-1.jpg"><img alt="Tunic of the Wind location" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4137290-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-tunic-of-the-wind-classic-green-tunic-1.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Tunic of the Wind location</figcaption></figure><p>Bear in mind that it's extremely dark in the depths. There's also a chance that you won't be able to tag any nearby Lightroots to help you see your surroundings. As such, we recommend bringing a lot of Brighbloom Seeds that you can throw or attach to arrows.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-tunic-of-the-wind-guide/1100-6514137/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
