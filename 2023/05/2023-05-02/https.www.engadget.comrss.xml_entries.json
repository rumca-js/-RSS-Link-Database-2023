[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Bipartisan Senate group reintroduces a revised Kids Online Safety Act", "description": "<p>US Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) <a href=\"https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2023/5/blackburn-blumenthal-introduce-bipartisan-kids-online-safety-act\">reintroduced</a> a bill today that would put the onus on social media companies to add online safeguards for children. The Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/senate-kids-online-safety-act-bill-141708555.html\">first introduced last February</a> (sponsored by the same pair) but never made it to the Senate floor after backlash from advocacy groups. The revamped legislation \u201cprovides specific tools to stop Big Tech companies from driving toxic content at kids and to hold them accountable for putting profits over safety,\u201d said Blumenthal. It follows a separate bill <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-bill-would-require-parental-consent-for-teens-to-use-social-media-172601557.html\">introduced last month</a> with a similar aim.</p><p>Like the original KOSA, the updated bill would require annual independent audits by \u201cexperts and academic researchers\u201d to force regulation-averse social media companies to address the online dangers posed to children. However, the updated legislation attempts to address the concerns that led to its previous iteration\u2019s downfall, namely that its overly broad nature could do more harm than good by requiring surveillance and censorship of young users. The EFF <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/kids-online-safety-act-heavy-handed-plan-force-platforms-spy-young-people\">described</a> the February 2022 bill as \u201ca heavy-handed plan to force platforms to spy on young people\u201d that \u201cfails to properly distinguish between harmful and non-harmful content, leaving politically motivated state attorneys general with the power to define what harms children. One of the primary fears is that states could use the flimsy definitions to ban content for political gain.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The rewritten bill adds new protections for services like the National Suicide Hotline, LGBTQ+ youth centers and substance-abuse organizations to avoid being unnecessarily harmed. In addition, it would make social platforms give minors options to safeguard their information, turn off addictive features and opt out of algorithmic recommendations. (Social platforms would have to enable the strongest settings by default.) It would also give parents \u201cnew controls to help support their children and identify harmful behaviors\u201d while offering children \u201ca dedicated channel to report harms\u201d on the platform. Additionally, it would specifically ban the promotion of suicide, eating disorders, substance abuse, sexual exploitation and the use of \u201cunlawful products for minors\u201d like gambling, drugs and alcohol. Finally, it would require social companies to provide \u201cacademic and public interest organizations\u201d with data to help them research social media\u2019s effects on the safety and well-being of minors.</p><p>The American Psychological Association, Common Sense Media and other advocacy groups support the updated bill. It has 26 cosponsors from both parties, including lawmakers ranging from Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) to Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Blackburn told CNBC today that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is \u201ca hundred percent behind this bill and efforts to protect kids online.\u201d</p><p>Despite the Senators\u2019 renewed optimism about passing the bill, some organizations believe it\u2019s still too broad to avoid a negative net impact. \u201cThe changes made to the bill do not at all address our concerns,\u201d Evan Greer, director of digital rights advocacy group Fight For the Future, said in an emailed statement to Engadget. \u201cIf Senator Blumenthal\u2019s office had been willing to meet with us, we could have explained why. I can see where changes were made that <em>attempt</em> to address the concerns, but they fail to do so. Even with the new changes, this bill will allow extreme right-wing attorneys general to dictate what content platforms can recommend to younger users.\u201d</p><p>The ACLU also opposes the resurrected bill. \u201cKOSA\u2019s core approach still threatens the privacy, security and free expression of both minors and adults by deputizing platforms of all stripes to police their users and censor their content under the guise of a \u2018duty of care,\u2019\u201d ACLU Senior Policy Counsel Cody Venzke <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/updated-kids-online-safety-act-aims-to-fix-unintended-consequences.html\">told</a><em>CNBC</em>. \u201cTo accomplish this, the bill would legitimize platforms\u2019 already pervasive data collection to identify which users are minors when it should be seeking to curb those data abuses. Moreover, parental guidance in minors\u2019 online lives is critical, but KOSA would mandate surveillance tools without regard to minors\u2019 home situations or safety. KOSA would be a step backward in making the internet a safer place for children and minors.\u201d</p><p>Blumenthal argues that the bill was \u201cvery purposely narrowed\u201d to prevent harm. \u201cI think we\u2019ve met that kind of suggestion very directly and effectively,\u201d he said at a press conference. \u201cObviously, our door remains open. We\u2019re willing to hear and talk to other kinds of suggestions that are made. And we have talked to many of the groups that had great criticism and a number have actually dropped their opposition, as I think you\u2019ll hear in response to today\u2019s session. So I think our bill is clarified and improved in a way that meets some of the criticism. We\u2019re not going to solve all of the problems of the world with a single bill. But we are making a measurable, very significant start.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-group-reintroduces-a-revised-kids-online-safety-act-212117992.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-group-reintroduces-a-revised-kids-online-safety-act-212117992.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-02 21:21:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Twitter restores free API access for emergency, weather and transportation alerts", "description": "<p>Twitter's decision to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-shut-off-its-free-api-and-its-breaking-a-lot-of-apps-222011637.html\">shut off its free API</a> caused more than a few problems for public institutions that depend on the functionality, and the company is clearly ready to backtrack. The social network has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1653492584176656384\">restored</a> free access to the app programming framework for verified government and publicly-owned services that use the tool for &quot;critical purposes&quot; such as emergency notifications, transportation updates and weather alerts.</p><p>The social media giant outlined a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-announces-new-api-pricing-including-a-limited-free-tier-for-bots-005251253.html\">three-tier pricing strategy</a> for its API in March. Normally, free access is limited to bots and testers that only need to write posts. It allows just 1,500 tweets per month and one app ID, which can be limiting for creators that need frequent updates. Basic access costs $100 per month with fixed caps on tweets, while businesses have to use multiple enterprise-level tiers to meet their needs. These can cost tens of thousands of dollars per month.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"80f71f02ded5462b8244b0a59b033d5e\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">One of the most important use cases for the Twitter API has always been public utility.

New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it would stop posting service alerts on Twitter after it faced a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nycs-transport-authority-will-no-longer-post-service-alerts-on-twitter-051701441.html\">$50,000 per month fee</a> for access. Microsoft also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-removes-twitter-from-its-social-media-tool-for-advertisers-051717547.html\">pulled Twitter</a> from its social media tool for advertisers, and disabled Twitter screenshot sharing for Windows and Xbox gamers.</p><p>Twitter under Elon Musk's leadership has clamped down on previously free functionality in a bid to both control more of the experience and shift more of its revenue to subscriptions. It <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-new-developer-terms-ban-third-party-clients-211247096.html\">banned third-party clients</a>, for example, and required a Blue membership for some verified checkmarks.

New York Democrat House Representative Yvette Clarke has <a href=\"https://clarke.house.gov/clarke-introduces-legislation-to-regulate-ai-in-political-advertisements/\">introduced</a> a bill, the REAL Political Ads Act, that would require political ads to disclose the use of generative AI through conspicuous audio or text.

She believes unchecked use could have a &quot;devastating&quot; effect on elections and national security, and that laws haven't kept up with the technology.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The bill comes just days after Republicans used AI-generated visuals in a political ad speculating what might happen during a second term for President Biden. The ad does include a faint disclaimer that it's &quot;built entirely with AI imagery,&quot; but there's a concern that future advertisers might skip disclaimers entirely or lie about past events.</p><p>Politicians already hope to regulate AI.

Clarke's bill is more targeted and clearly meant to pass quickly.</p><p>Whether or not it does isn't certain. The act has to pass a vote in a Republican-led House, and the Senate jsd to develop and pass an equivalent bill before the two bodies of Congress reconcile their work and send a law to the President's desk. Success also won't prevent unofficial attempts to fool voters. Still, this might discourage politicians and action committees from using AI to fool voters.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/house-bill-would-demand-disclosure-of-ai-generated-content-in-political-ads-190524733.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/house-bill-would-demand-disclosure-of-ai-generated-content-in-political-ads-190524733.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-02 19:05:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Ford's new trail-finding app is exclusively for Bronco SUV owners", "description": "<p>Ford just dropped a trail-finding app <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/05/02/take-the-roads-less-traveled--and-share-your-adventure--with-new.html\"><ins>specifically for Bronco SUV owners.</ins></a> The appropriately-named Bronco Trail App is available for both iOS and Android mobile devices and includes a boatload of goodies for true off-roading enthusiasts.

The crossover SUV's starting price has dropped $3,000 to $42,995 (before a $3,750 federal tax credit) for an RWD Standard Range trim, with a matching price cut for its $45,995 AWD counterpart. They're also more capable vehicles \u2014 all Standard Range variants use lithium iron phosphate batteries that extend their range to 250 miles (RWD) or 226 miles (AWD) while adding 45HP. They now take a more reasonable 33 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 80 percent on a DC fast charger, and they're more likely to reach maximum capacity through AC charging at home.</p><p>The hardware for BlueCruise hands-free highway driving is now standard. You'll still have to pay to unlock it, but you now get a 90-day trial that lets you activate if and when you're ready. You can still pay for three years (now $2,100 instead of $1,900) if you're already sold on the concept. BlueCruise 1.2 adds turn signal-activated lane changes and repositioning that keeps you away from semis and other vehicles that might intrude into your lane.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Higher-end models also have their share of price cuts. The Premium Standard Range models are dropping by $4,000 to reach $46,995 for an RWD configuration and $49,995 for AWD. Buy a California Route 1 AWD Extended Range and you'll pay $56,995, or $1,000 less. And if you insist on the most powerful model, the GT is down $4,000 to $59,995.</p><p>Crucially, there's a better chance you'll get a vehicle in the first place. Ford is scaling up Mustang Mach-E production for the second half of the year to help meet demand. The automaker doesn't say when you can expect to receive a new order, but you may not have to rush to purchase like you did before.</p><p>The price cuts come just months after Ford slashed Mustang Mach-E prices <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-ev-price-cut-170151501.html\">up to $5,900</a>, and reflect &quot;lower costs&quot; on Ford's end. The brand previously said the switch to lithium iron phosphate batteries would help it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ford-ev-manufacturing-rate-lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-131424727.html\">make 600,000 EVs per year</a> by the end of 2023 by expanding capacity, lowering production costs and reducing the need for shortage-prone resources like nickel.</p><p>Ford is also under pressure to drop prices, mind you. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/teslas-latest-price-cut-brings-model-3-pricing-below-40000-071124983.html\">Tesla has cut prices</a> multiple times in 2023, and the Model 3 now starts at $40,240.

Still, YouTube is &quot;constantly working&quot; to upgrade its systems and get better at spotting and removing content that violates its policies.

The new phone packs a smoother 165Hz 6.7-inch OLED screen, a speedier Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and a larger 5,100mAh battery. And gone is the 2-megapixel depth sensor \u2014 instead, you'll get an actually-useful 12MP 2X telephoto camera to go alongside the 50MP standard and ultra-wide cams.

More importantly, Motorola is promising better update support than in the past \u2014 you'll get three years of OS upgrades and four years of bi-monthly security fixes. That's not quite up to Samsung's level (four years for both), but it might last the practical life of your device.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The price is also a major selling point. Where the 2022 Edge+ was priced like a flagship at $1,000, the 2023 version will be available for $800 when the unlocked version arrives May 25th at Amazon, Best Buy and Motorola.

Officially dubbed version 2.0, the new Weber Connect app now includes <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-grilling-gear-143011296.html\">grill tools</a> like an updated dashboard, temperature graphing, more recipes and the ability to monitor multiple grills \u2014 and multiple recipes \u2014 at the same time.</p><p>Weber says one of the most-requested features is the ability to watch multiple recipes simultaneously inside the app. You can now do so with the new &quot;mission-control-style&quot; interface. The company explains that its smart grills and the Weber Connect Smart Grilling Hub can handle up to 12 recipes and timers at the same time. What's more, you don't have to keep all of your dishes on the same grill as the app can also keep tabs on multiple grills at once. There's a Launchpad section of the app that offers easy access to the Smokeboost feature, adjusting grill temp, adding a temperature alert, starting a timer and shutting down the grill \u2014 most of which are exclusive to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/weber-smokefire-sear-plus-announced-140007112.html\">the SmokeFire pellet grills</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>For all of the barbecue data nerds, Weber Connect now features temperature graphing. The company says these colorful live visuals are updated every second as the cook progresses. Graphs display temperature stats for the grill and up to four connected probes, so all of info is viewable in one place. The graphs also appear on the Now Grilling screen alongside start time, current temp and target temp info for each probe. Data can be shared with other users, including status updates and still images. What's more, you can create CSV files to use all of your grilling data in spreadsheets.</p><p>Weber also made the app more accessible with the option to increase font size via dynamic text and the addition of voiceovers. A new dark more changes the entire interface from color to black-and-white for aspiring pitmasters who wish to reduce eye strain. With this update, Weber says the Connect app now houses over 800 recipes. 350 of those are &quot;smart&quot; recipes, meaning they offer step-by-step guidance with videos and detailed instructions. All of today's updates join tools like the ability to monitor and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/weber-smokefire-grills-update-smokeboost-remote-control-firmware-173014646.html\">adjust temperatures remotely</a> so you don't have to stay near the grill or Hub the entire time.</p><p>Weber Connect 2.0 is available now in the Apple App Store and Google Play store. The software supports iPhone, iPad, macOS and Android devices. Additionally, iOS users can choose to have grilling notifications sent to Apple Watch.

There are just two options, the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, but depending on the configuration, a new MacBook can cost between $999 and $6,500, so there\u2019s considerable variation between the two makes. All current models run on the company\u2019s own M-series processors that combine CPU, GPU, unified memory and other functions on a single chip, giving the latest MacBooks longer battery lives, better multitasking performance and faster operating speeds over the previous Intel chips. If you\u2019re not sure which model would work best for you, we\u2019re here to make things a little more clear. Based on our testing, here\u2019s what we think are the best MacBooks for everyone from students to power users.</p><h2><br />Best overall: MacBook Air M2</h2><p></p><p>Our resident laptop expert Devindra Hardawar called the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLUFwcGxlLU1hY0Jvb2stTGFwdG9wLWNoaXAvZHAvQjBCM0JWV0o2WS8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdmwtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2ZGNhYjI1LTBkNzMtNGRhMi05OGJhLThhNGJkOGNiODY0ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaNkgrrG9NWMcefckvhwPK3gpuQZ_4KqPp6ddPNQS7Ch&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%2F\">MacBook Air M2</a> a \u201cnear-perfect Mac\u201d <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html\">in his review</a>, awarding it a high score of 96. It\u2019s the newer of the two Air models Apple still sells, and notably a better buy than the 13-inch MacBook Pro, as the latter is both heavier and more expensive. The Air was built around the new M2 chip and completely refreshed for 2022 with a squared-off design that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-hands-on-192857444.html\">ditches the wedge</a> shape.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen hits up to 500 nits, making it both bigger and brighter than the previous generation. The 60Hz refresh rate doesn\u2019t deliver the butter-smooth scrolling you get on Pro models, but it\u2019s lovely nonetheless. The quad speaker array pumps out great sound, filling a room at max volume without distortion, and the three-mic array does a good job of picking up your voice for video calls. The 1080p camera is an improvement over previous generations. It even beats our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html\">top Windows laptop</a>, Dell\u2019s XPS 13 Plus which still sports a 720p webcam, but Devindra found the image the Air captures to be drab.</p><p>Despite being thinner than ever, the M2 Air manages to hang on to its 3.5mm headphone jack and includes two USB-C Thunderbolt ports and a MagSafe connector. That means you don\u2019t have to block a potential data port while charging. The battery life is ample, lasting 16 hours and 30 minutes in our rundown test, which should be more than enough for a day (or two) of work.</p><p>The M2 chip gives the Air enough speed to play games, particularly those from Apple Arcade. Streaming and cloud gaming work well through Safari, and you\u2019ll find a handful of compatible titles on Steam. However, many of the bigger AAA releases still aren\u2019t compatible with Macs \u2013 though Apple is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/06/apple-execs-on-m2-chips-winning-gamers-and-when-to-buy-a-mac/\">looking to change</a> that. Our review unit performed well in benchmark tests, beating the Air M1 and nearly matching the performance of the 13-inch MacBook Pro M2. It\u2019s a fanless system which means it\u2019s quiet, but to keep things cool, the CPU does have to be throttled occasionally.</p><p>Overall, it\u2019s an excellent choice for everyday use and can handle most tasks. Of course, if you\u2019re planning on doing intensive video editing, you\u2019ll likely want something more powerful, such as the <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0eee6f60-6f21-4ba6-b70e-cc15b39bf860&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Adorama&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZWVlNmY2MC02ZjIxLTRiYTYtYjcwZS1jYzE1YjM5YmY4NjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvcmFtYS5jb20vYWNtbmVxM2xsYTMuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZkY2FiMjUtMGQ3My00ZGEyLTk4YmEtOGE0YmQ4Y2I4NjRkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVVNv9rtuH9rSXo2a6Ew15Gk9tKtDhoe8B3sPboFgmgy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmneq3lla3.html\">MacBook Pro M2</a>, but the Air is arguably the best multipurpose, ultraportable laptop that Apple makes.</p><p>Our review MacBook Air had an M2 chip with a 10-core GPU, along with 16GB of memory and 1TB of storage. <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0eee6f60-6f21-4ba6-b70e-cc15b39bf860&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Adorama&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZWVlNmY2MC02ZjIxLTRiYTYtYjcwZS1jYzE1YjM5YmY4NjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvcmFtYS5jb20vYWNtbHk0M2xsYTEzLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2ZGNhYjI1LTBkNzMtNGRhMi05OGJhLThhNGJkOGNiODY0ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATSgsfWXw5op5tbUFKUUojFFNmBPVmZ457HV0XyrCgZ7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmly43lla13.html\">That configuration will run you $1,899</a>.

It earned a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html\">high score of 94</a> in our review and Devindra declared it one of the fastest ultraportables you could buy at the time. Of course, now that the M2 is on the scene, its numbers are comparatively less impressive \u2013 but with a base price of $999 (and often on sale for less), it\u2019s a relatively affordable way for students or those with tight budgets to snag a fast and capable machine.</p><p>The Air\u2019s 13.3-inch Retina display looks beautiful and is ideal for binge sessions. The laptop\u2019s sturdy, wedge-shaped unibody case weighs just 2.8 pounds, making it easy to take to class or work. You can even fire it up in the quietest library without making a sound, thanks to a heat sink and passive cooling that eliminate the need for a fan. The keyboard offers a satisfying amount of depth despite its thin profile and the trackpad is smooth.</p><p>The performance of the M1 chip really makes the MacBook Air M1 stand out. It\u2019s impressively responsive, launching apps nearly instantly and running them effortlessly. Safari delivers a slick browsing experience, loading complex pages quickly. The M1 chip is also behind the Air\u2019s great battery life. We managed to get 16 hours and 20 minutes during our video rundown test, which should be more than enough to get you through a full-day grind.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s not without drawbacks. The M1 Air houses a 720p webcam, which isn\u2019t as sharp as the M2 Air\u2019s 1080p camera and it only comes with two Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack. If you\u2019re charging your computer, there\u2019s only one available plug for accessories. There\u2019s no SD card slot, either, and since Apple hardware isn\u2019t the easiest to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-mac-ram-ssd-upgrades-possible-143834335.html\">upgrade yourself</a>, you\u2019ll want to buy all the storage you need right out of the gate.</p><p>We recommend sticking with the base configuration (8GB RAM/256GB SSD) if you\u2019ll mostly be using web-based programs and cloud-based apps. For an extra $200, you can upgrade to <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTYwNDg1OC1SRUcvYXBwbGVfejEyYV9tZ25kXzA1X2JoXzEzXzNfbWFjYm9va19haXJfd2l0aC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmRjYWIyNS0wZDczLTRkYTItOThiYS04YTRiZDhjYjg2NGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT7_zK0w3W1fA_2SKnxGsn7alQNlto8vxqSg3d-q2iqg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604858-REG%2Fapple_z12a_mgnd_05_bh_13_3_macbook_air_with.html\">16GB of memory</a> which is good if you stream heavily, like to have a lot of open tabs or want to run a ton of apps at once.

There\u2019s even a MagSafe power connector dedicated to charging.

Its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-28-unagi-electric-scooter.html\">stylish scooters</a> are often found in the hands of celebrities and musicians, setting themselves apart from the generic rental models found on street corners. Now, the company has unveiled the Model One Voyager, a second-generation version of its existing Model One, which the company will either sell to you outright, or rent to you for $55 a month. Given the plaudits afforded to that device, it should come as no surprise that the Voyager opts not to fix what wasn\u2019t broken, but focuses on addressing its predecessor\u2019s (relatively few) flaws.</p><p>Long-time Unagi followers may recall the company had been working on the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/unagi-model-eleven-smart-scooter-adas-turn-by-turn-directions-gps-tracking-163008213.html\"><ins>Model Eleven</ins></a>, a wildly ultra-premium scooter to top off its lineup. Priced at $2,440, the Eleven would have offered GPS tracking, turn-by-turn directions and an ADAS collision sensor. Unagi killed the product, saying that the market was turning away from pricey, one-off purchases toward a service model. The majority of its customers presently pay $55 a month to rent a Model One, with the company taking care of the maintenance and insurance. And that switch in focus is likely to produce more models that look to evolve the existing concept, rather than offering something more dramatic.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To avoid all of the cliches, let\u2019s get them all out of the way in a single paragraph and be done with it. The Voyager is a <em>polish</em>, an <em>evolution</em>, a <em>refinement </em>on the existing Model One template, and you\u2019ll struggle to tell them apart looking at them from a distance. It uses the same industrial design, and the same high-end materials, although the neck and fork angles have been tweaked for better stability. It remains one of the best-looking e-scooters on the market today, with a clean, elegant design and color choices which straddle the line between transport and fashion statement.</p><p>Instead, the big changes are all on the inside, with a specific focus on addressing issues around range and power that existing Model One renters have grappled with. For instance, while the Model One\u2019s quoted range tops out at a less-than-ideal 12 miles, the Voyager stretches to 25, which should be enough to get you where you need to go and back without anxiety. Now, real-world mileage will be wildly different based on your use (and your weight), but the hope is that the Voyager will eliminate range anxiety for most people.</p><figure><img alt=\"Close-up of the handlebars and display area on the Model One Voyager.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/46f2bfc0-e8d7-11ed-bbea-94cdc6fef434\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>The second new feature, Distance To Empty, is a system that calculates your remaining range. It\u2019s not hugely sophisticated, since it uses a dynamic look-up table checking your weight, speed profile and hill profile against the existing battery level. But a better-educated guess about how much further you can go is likely to be a better deal than just letting you see the percentage of battery that\u2019s still there and letting you hope for the best.</p><p>As well as the attention paid to make sure you\u2019ve got enough power in your Voyager, there\u2019s a lot of focus on getting it back out again. The Model One could produce 26 newton meters of torque, but the Voyager will knock out 32, with both motors offering a combined peak power of 1,000W. Unagi said that you can expect to see a 25 percent improvement in acceleration and deceleration out of the motors, and that you\u2019ll see charging times fall in half compared to the Model One. That\u2019s before we get to the promised improvements in hill climbing, where Unagi said that riders should \u201cprepare to magically clobber hills that seem insurmountable.\u201d</p><p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong><em> I\u2019m based in the UK, and it is presently illegal to ride an e-scooter on public roads and pavements. There is a generous exception for a series of government-approved e-scooter trials currently in place, but private scooters are all but banned. For this review, I primarily used private roads and other private spaces, where the laws do not apply, rather than in public. While the target audience for this review is primarily American, our lawyers have reminded us to say that Engadget does not condone breaking the law, and would-be UK users risk having their scooters seized, or facing criminal penalties including points on your driving license and a fine. That said, Unagi does sell the Model One to UK customers for \u00a3899, if you\u2019re prepared to bear the risk for yourself.</em></p><p>You won\u2019t need to spend a lot of time inside Voyager\u2019s companion app, which connects to the scooter over Bluetooth. You\u2019ll see your Odometer and Distance to Empty figures, and can toggle between single- and dual-motor modes. (You\u2019ll really mostly stick in dual-motor mode which offers better range and performance unless you\u2019re on a flat surface and don\u2019t need to speed up or slow down too often.) You can also activate the front light and, crucially, lock the scooter\u2019s wheels to make it harder for a nefarious type to steal it.</p><figure><img alt=\"Close-up of the front wheel and deck of the Unagi Model One Voyager\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/68c05040-e8d7-11ed-bc5f-e195a9b8a1f4\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>If there\u2019s one thing Unagi should have, but didn\u2019t, improve upon from the original, it was the ride quality. Specifically, making an effort to help the Voyager smooth out the sometimes less than pristine asphalt on our streets. Voyager comes with the same small, hard rubber tyres as the Model One, without much in the way of suspension or shock absorption. When I can feel every bump and crack in the road, it dents my confidence as to how far I want to ride this thing.</p><p>Admittedly, this is a common problem with a lot of e-scooters, but it\u2019s one worth examining if you\u2019re charging two or three times the cost of a run-of-the-mill Xiaomi. Sure, the monthly rent cost covers maintenance, insurance and everything else, but it\u2019s still a premium product. It all depends if you\u2019re living somewhere with flat, well-maintained roads, because none of this will concern you. But if your streets have more than a few cracks in them, be prepared to feel all of them in your knees.</p><p>I will say, Unagi shared with me both a confidence in its puncture-proof tyres and a belief that more can be done. A representative said that improvements to both the tyres and deckpad are in the pipeline, although neither will be ready for some time. It\u2019s not yet clear if these tweaks will be available on a future version of the Voyager, or if they\u2019ll be held back for the next new model, the Model Two, pegged to arrive at some point in 2024.</p><p>This is perhaps the one demerit I can offer, however, as everything else has seen the details sweated, and for a good cause. There\u2019s the same set of electronic throttle and brake as found on the previous model, the latter of which I found very easy to trust. It\u2019s a personal preference I know, but I\u2019ve often preferred the comfort of a mechanical brake on cheaper e-scooters to give me a sense of security when it comes to stopping. Oh, I can also gripe about the milquetoast horn, which I\u2019m sure wouldn\u2019t send a group of slow-moving pedestrians scattering out of your way, but that really is it.</p><figure><img alt=\"Overdeck image of the Unagi Model One Voyager with the Unagi burn-in into the plating.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/8134d790-e8d7-11ed-b7ff-cc2a0a05e6aa\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the Model One, and you\u2019ve been using an e-scooter with a smartphone mount, then the Voyager\u2019s display may feel a bit minimal. There\u2019s an old-school feel to the data on show, with a brightly-backlit speedometer that\u2019s easily visible in strong light. That\u2019s key, since you\u2019ll have to take your eyes off the road to check your speed \u2013 although I will admit that I find my gut tells me how much speed I can handle based on the surrounding areas rather than trying to stick to a solid figure.</p><p>Below that figure, you\u2019ll find either the odometer or trip computer, based on your preference, and below that, the battery display. At the bottom, you\u2019ll also be able to see which speed profile the scooter is set in, and icons telling you if you\u2019re in single or dual-motor mode. To be honest, I don\u2019t know how much extra data you might need on a scooter display, and I like the neat and tidy way that all of this information has been laid out.</p><p>On flat, straight roads and gentle inclines, I found the Voyager to offer rather excellent balance. With some practice, I was able to get my turning circle down to the bare minimum, and it\u2019s easy to ride at slow speeds. It\u2019s even pretty easy to ride when you open up the throttle and try to get close to that top speed, even if I was too chicken to get it to max out. Similarly, the headlights are bright enough, although if I was riding this on roads at night, I\u2019d be tempted to get a head or shirt-worn rear light since the deck-height brake light is a bit low.</p><p>The Voyager weighs the better part of 30 pounds, and it\u2019s a significant lump to haul around in your hands. 30 pounds may not sound like a lot, but with the scooter folded down it\u2019s quite an unwieldy thing to carry in your hand. I pulled my back one night and, the following day, tried to carry this to a private road for testing before bailing out and throwing it in the car instead. That solidity may make it prohibitive for you to carry up every flight of stairs in your building, but it also gives you confidence that it won\u2019t fall apart after a few weeks of use.</p><figure><img alt=\"Image of the rear wheel and tail light for the Unagi Model One Voyager\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/9ba073f0-e8d7-11ed-b9ff-26a26728ab9b\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you\u2019re already sold on the idea of toting one of these around with you, you\u2019ll now need to look at the figures. The Unagi Model One Voyager costs $1,190 to buy, but the company doesn\u2019t expect many people to buy it outright. Instead, it hopes they will opt to rent their scooter via the <a href=\"https://unagiscooters.com/all-access/checkout/original\"><ins>Unagi All-Access program</ins></a> which includes service and, for an extra fee, theft insurance.</p><p>The basic payment is $69 a month for a no-commitment rental, with theft insurance an extra $5 per month. You can also request a \u201cguaranteed brand new scooter\u201d for an additional $10 monthly premium. As the name implies, this will guarantee that you will get brand-new hardware both when you sign up, and also if you need a replacement. Plus, of course, you\u2019ll need to pony up a one-time sign-up fee of $50. Adding that all up and dividing by twelve means that to have one of these in your life, your monthly outgoing will be $89 a month.</p><p>Now, you\u2019ll have to decide if you\u2019ll get that paid back compared to, say, using the local Lime or Bird scooters in your area. The obvious benefit is that you\u2019ll be able to ride your own scooter and you\u2019ll never have to scrub around looking for a working model when you\u2019re out and about. The downside is that it\u2019s a fairly significant outlay each month so you\u2019d better be sure that you will get your money\u2019s worth by using the scooter as your primary mode of transportation.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you\u2019re already living inside Unagi\u2019s scooter rental ecosystem and paying for a Model One, then you can upgrade to Voyager by switching your plan to the more expensive option and paying the one-off charge of $50.</p><p>If you\u2019ve been looking for a scooter that will hopefully last you a long while, get you to and from wherever you need to go, and look good while doing it, then this is probably a decent bet.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/unagi-took-one-of-the-best-e-scooters-on-the-market-and-made-it-better-134510138.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/unagi-took-one-of-the-best-e-scooters-on-the-market-and-made-it-better-134510138.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-02 13:45:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best gaming gear for graduates", "description": "<p>The next graduating class is about to hit the workforce, but hopefully they\u2019ll take the summer off to sleep, chill at the beach and\u2026 game.

It\u2019s easily the smallest (7.69x5.3x0.25 inches) and lightest (0.65 pounds for the WiFi model) of any current iPad, with an 8.3-inch display that\u2019s more comfortable to operate with a single hand.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>At the same time, it has similar specs to the iPhone 13, with the same speedy A15 Bionic chip that delivers a big jump in performance over the fifth-gen model. It comes with a larger 8.3-inch display with higher 2,266 x 1,488 resolution than the previous models, and eliminates the physical home button, moving the Touch ID sensor to the power button. The volume buttons, meanwhile, are at the top to make room for Apple Pencil 2 that can be attached to the side magnetically.</p><p>Other features include USB-C charging and upgraded cameras with support from Apple's Center Stage feature, keeping you in the center of the frame during video calls. The main downsides are the lack of a headphone jack, limited 64GB of storage on the base model and fairly high price compared to tablets with comparable specs. Amazon and Target have certainly taken the edge off the price, but it's best to act soon before the deal ends.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-ipad-mini-is-back-on-sale-for-400-124717156.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-ipad-mini-is-back-on-sale-for-400-124717156.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-02 12:47:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Samsung tells employees not to use AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard", "description": "<p>While many workers worry AI bots will take their jobs, Samsung employees are no longer allowed to use them.
