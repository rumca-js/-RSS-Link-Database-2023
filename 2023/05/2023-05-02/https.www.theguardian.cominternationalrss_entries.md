## Musician Peter One’s incredible story: ‘I had this dream … it’s starting to come true’

<p>The 67-year-old Ivory Coast-born musician was a star in his heyday but political and economic unrest forced him into a life out of the spotlight. Now, he’s making a comeback</p><p>On a recent night at the New York music venue Webster Hall, a white-haired man in his 60s with an acoustic guitar walked gracefully onto the stage, sat on a stool and began to speak. “I’m from Ivory Coast,” he said in a voice barely above a whisper. “I came a long way to America to play music for you – and to tell you my story.”</p><p>For the next 45 minutes, he offered slices of it, interspersed with cascading ballads that mix African cadences with strains of American country and folk music sung at a hushed volume. Despite the intimate nature of the performance – not to mention the fact that few in the crowd, who had come to see the headliners, the Walkmen, had any idea who the singer was – the audience remained rapt. Having spent an hour earlier in the evening with the man born Pierre-Evrard Tra, who performs as Peter One, I understood what transfixed them. His story involves tales of economic collapse, political corruption and mass violence in his home country, as well as resourcefulness, focus and courage on his part in coming to America. It’s the kind of positive immigrant story that fulfills the promise to new arrivals the US often only pays lip service to. “I felt fear when I came here,” One said when we spoke backstage. “But I was determined. This was my dream.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/02/peter-one-ivory-coast-musician-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Since being laid low with the virus more than a year ago, Catherine Heymans can only operate in half-hour bursts. But her work could still change the way we understand the universe</p><p>Last September, Catherine Heymans, one of the world’s leading cosmologists, was supposed to board a ferry for the northernmost island in the Orkney archipelago. The island, North Ronaldsay, is among the darkest inhabited places on earth. On a clear winter’s night, it is easy to be awed by the thousands upon thousands of stars visible to the naked eye, which spill their unpolluted light upon the Earth. Heymans, who is the first woman appointed astronomer royal for Scotland, was planning to explain to the island’s 60 or so residents that those stars, and the rest of the perceptible universe, represent a mere fraction of the stuff that makes up our cosmos. What she studies is everything we cannot see: the darkness.</p><p>Over the past two decades, Heymans, who is 45, has advanced our understanding of a vast, invisible cosmos that scientists are only beginning to comprehend. That “dark universe” is thought to constitute more than 95% of everything that exists. It is made up of entities more mysterious than the ordinary matter and energy – the light, atoms, molecules, lifeforms, stars, galaxies – that have been the subject of scientific inquiry throughout history. In the past 10 years, Heymans has learned that the dark universe shapes the visible cosmos in unexpected ways, and may not follow all the standard rules of physics. Her discoveries are unsettling a broad consensus on how our world works on its grandest scales. “I believe that, to truly understand the dark universe, we will need to invoke some new physics that will for ever change our cosmic view,” she has written.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/02/catherine-heymans-dark-universe-the-cosmologist-battling-long-covid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Věra Jourová says her upbringing in former Czechoslovakia has inspired her work to ensure journalism remains independent</p><p>Věra Jourová was 13 when she was first investigated for her political views. It was 1977 in communist Czechoslovakia and the state was cracking down on political dissidents who had signed a human rights declaration – Charter 77. Her civics teacher wanted to know what she thought of the document. Jourová’s parents were already blacklisted and she feared the wrong answer would make things worse. “It was a horror moment,” recalls Jourová, who knew about Charter 77 from the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe broadcasts that her family listened to in secret. So she said nothing and saw her school marks slide.</p><p>Nearly half a century later, Jourová is one of the European Commission’s most powerful officials and seeking to protect the media in the European Union. “There are increasing threats and a very dangerous trend,” she told the Guardian.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/02/vera-jourova-eu-official-mission-protect-media-freedom">Continue reading...</a>
