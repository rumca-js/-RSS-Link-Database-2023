The filmmakers found doctors and nurses struggling to guide families through a maze of end-of-life choices that had become available: whether to pull feeding and breathing tubes, when to perform expensive surgeries and therapies and when to call for hospice. The documentary presented intimate portraits of patients grappling with the trade-offs of modern medicine and the prospect of dying.\n\nExplore additional reporting on \"Facing Death\" on our website:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/facing-death/\n\n#Documentary #ICU\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW\u200b\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\u200b\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\u200b\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and airs nationwide on PBS.\n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nAdditional funding is provided by the Abrams Foundation; Park Foundation; the John D. and Catherine T.
