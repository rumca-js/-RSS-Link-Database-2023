<p><strong>British Museum, London<br /></strong>Centuries of conflict between the civilisations of Persia and Greece are chiefly captured through elaborate drinking vessels in this lively – and occasionally puzzling – show<br /></p><p>A pair of sculpted heads stare at each other at the start of this exhibition: an ancient Persian with a square beard and tight ringlets facing up to the Greek god Apollo. Here is a polarity that has defined global history. The struggle between the Greek city states and the Achaemenid empire was believed by the Greeks to be a fight to establish who they were: western, not eastern, self-governing, and democratic in the case of Athens, as opposed to the playthings of Persian tyrants.</p><p>But guess what – the reality was more complicated. The Persian portrait and the Chatsworth Apollo, as it’s known, are not so different. Both come from 5th century BC Cyprus, and are associated with sanctuaries where Apollo and the Persian god Reshef were jointly worshipped.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/03/luxury-and-power-review-bender-persians-greeks-british-museum">Continue reading...</a>

The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/may/01/world-snooker-championship-crucible-2023-final-mark-selby-luca-brecel-live" title="">new world champion</a> certainly navigated his road to victory at the Crucible his own way, with a brand of attacking snooker usually only restricted to one man: Brecel’s hero, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/26/luca-brecel-rocks-ronnie-osullivan-to-reach-world-snooker-semis" title="">Ronnie O’Sullivan</a>.</p><p>For years, snooker has relied on O’Sullivan to provide the entertainment. Even now as he approaches 50, O’Sullivan remains the undisputed face of the sport. Inside and outside of the Crucible this year, there were pictures of the seven-time champion of the world everywhere you looked. World Snooker Tour’s media team lined a corridor near the press centre with cuttings from the coverage throughout the tournament: most of them featured O’Sullivan in some format.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/02/snooker-salutes-its-new-entertainer-after-luca-brecel-fulfils-his-destiny">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Labour leader says they will be both going and staying – and he can’t say fairer or unfairer than that</p><p>When you’re 15 points ahead in the polls with the local elections just two days away, some might argue that it is best to keep quiet. Especially if you haven’t really got much new to say. Why rock the boat when you’ve got a comfortable lead? No need to go for another goal when you’re five-nil up with only added time to play. Just keep it safe, bank the win and save your resources for more important games to come. Don’t give the Tory party chair, Greg Hands, an excuse to fire off another desperate tweet about Labour having spent all the money.</p><p>Keir Starmer saw it rather differently. He had chosen to do a morning tour of the BBC studios. A last-chance power drive to remind everyone of what was at stake this week. Only he didn’t really appear to have given it much thought, as his only consistent message was that everyone was more broke than they had ever been. Almost as though he had imagined that just saying the same thing over and over again would get him through any 15-minute interview.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/02/keir-starmer-labour-tuition-fees-politics-sketch">Continue reading...</a>

The UK Health Security Agency has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/24/vaccination-rates-fallen-children-england-ukhsa" title="">warned</a> that uptake of the meningococcal vaccine, and the last routine dose of the combined polio, diphtheria and tetanus vaccine, fell significantly last year among adolescents.

<p><strong>Tim Allen</strong> on guarding the guardians of democracy, and <strong>David Chan</strong> on the need to diversify those who work in the media</p><p>The press is essential to a healthy democracy (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/01/trust-diversity-independence-press-newspapers" title="">Trust, diversity and independence: three key elements for a thriving press, 1 May</a>). The conventional wisdom is that a “free” press is the guardian of democracy, but I would argue that it is, in fact, an unbiased press that serves that purpose.</p><p>Should newspapers operate on the basis of neutrality? Perhaps they should be considered a public service. Responsible journalism should present the facts in a coherent way, with spin deciphered, and only then draw an editorial conclusion, if it is appropriate. But this cannot be the case when each publication panders to its ideological base or, more worryingly, to the interests of its owner. Then, the “free” press is a mere propaganda tool.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/02/an-ofsted-for-journalists-could-raise-press-standards">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Charles was crowned Prince of Wales, he didn’t know he was wearing a table tennis ball on his head. What can the world expect on Saturday? We examine the strange and often blood-drenched world of crown design</p><p>When King Charles was invested as the Prince of Wales in 1969, the young royal went through all the pomp and ceremony unaware that the jazzy modern crown he wore on his head was topped with a ping-pong ball. The plastic sphere was, of course, well disguised: not only coated with gold filigree but also surrounded by a floating constellation of diamonds arranged in the shape of Charles’s star sign, Scorpio. It was pagan astrology meets high church meets high camp, a fittingly fruity headpiece for the eccentric prince.</p><p>The crown was designed by Louis Osman, an architect and goldsmith described by one of his friends as “the original hippie” – and it marked a radical departure from the usual staid royal headwear. This was <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/style/jewelry-and-watches/a27207763/prince-charles-prince-of-wales-coronet-history-designer/">a futuristic vision</a> featuring swooping golden arches surrounded by abstract fleurs-de-lis and needle-thin crosses that jutted out like splintering lightning bolts. The gold, symbolically, came from a Welsh nugget, but rather than being traditionally hammered it was – in a showcase of modern methods – electroplated on to an epoxy resin cast. An internal purple velvet cap banded with ermine completed the look, fulfilling Charles’s wish for a crown that could be worn by a “modern prince” with a regular haircut, not someone with a wig, and “ears that show”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/02/charles-ping-pong-ball-crown-shocking-history-royal-headwear-bling">Continue reading...</a>

## Sunak and Starmer are obsessed with home ownership. Neither seems to want to fix the housing crisis | Kieran Yates

<p>Both parties emphasise ‘getting on the ladder’ to win middle-class votes, ignoring the vast majority of people affected by this emergency</p><p>Britain is obsessed with home ownership. This might date back to our history of land ownership, class and colonial exploit but the fixation lives on, thanks in no small part to Thatcher’s introduction of the right to buy in 1980.</p><p>This weekend, both parties made their bids to reckon with the housing crisis, and both leaders, predictably, zeroed in on ownership. The Tories have for years declared they would transform “generation rent” into “generation buy” and Rishi Sunak is now considering bringing back help to buy – a 2013 Tory policy that ended last year – to win votes at the next election.<em> </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/05/sunak-backs-down-on-housebuilding-targets-after-pressure-from-tory-mps">He also recently announced</a> he would scrap the house-building target of 300,000 every year in England, displaying a wilful ignorance of what is actually needed to plug the housing deficit.

<p>There’s a little bit of popstar aiming for No 1 – and fans will enjoy lots of behind-the-scenes footage – but Sheeran appears as a homely, nice man struggling with difficult circumstances</p><p>Cheekier viewers than me might wonder how this Disney+ documentary is going to manage to fill out an entire four-part series about the singer. Sheeran is massive, the biggest male pop star in the world, capable of selling out – as he does here – Wembley Stadium for the 12th time. Each of his albums goes to No 1; he’s played at practically every massive arena in the world. He sings with Eminem on stage; Beyoncé will perform with him. But if you only know about his life from the tabloids, or by gossip osmosis, you might know he has a pub, that he married a school friend, that he still lives in Suffolk, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2019/apr/24/ed-sheeran-own-pub-pond-private-beach-sheeranville">has a pond that was briefly controversial</a>. As a star, he is not so much champagne as he is pale ale. He has a homely quality to him.</p><p>This homeliness belies a certain unknown aspect, though. Not unknown in the Beyoncé way, with that distant remove of a glossy machine, but unknown in the sense that his normal-guy shtick might be the extent of it. We see him as a hard worker done good. He appears to be a very nice man. The documentary – which, again, cheekier viewers might note, coincides with a high-profile court case against him, and does much to make him seem even more human and likable – foregrounds the unknown man, via the people who do know and love him, including his wife, Cherry, and his parents, John and Imogen.</p><p>Ed Sheeran: The Sum of It All is on Disney+ from 3 May.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/02/ed-sheeran-the-sum-of-it-all-review-a-surprisingly-moving-intimate-view-of-marriage-loss-and-mental-health">Continue reading...</a>

## Is it better, nutritionally, to boil or steam vegetables? | Kitchen aide

<p>It is better, nutritionally speaking, to steam vegetables, but that doesn’t mean you have to, says our panel of cooks</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>Every </strong><strong>Guardian </strong><strong>recipe </strong><strong>begins with “boil the vegetable(s)”. We </strong><strong>always steam, believing more nutrients and </strong><strong>flavour stay</strong><strong> in </strong><strong> that way, so why are we out of step with your </strong><strong>writers?</strong><br /><em><strong>Malcolm, Norwich<br /></strong></em>Right, let’s round up some of the Guardian’s food crew and ask them to explain themselves. First to take the stand is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/meera-sodha">Meera Sodha</a>. “I’m not the sort of person to optimise anything in life, except for pleasure and ease,” she says, so when it comes to vegetables, her answer is easy: “If I’m cooking them into a meal [a curry or pan-fried dish, say], I’ll just put them in the pot or pan with all the other ingredients, where they might cook by frying, simmering or, if there’s a lid involved, part-steaming – I suppose the nutrients are captive then, so that’s a bonus!” If, however, she is serving a side of, for instance, broccoli, she’ll boil it, “because it’s quick, efficient and hands-off, which is important to me, especially if there’s something else on the bubble.” And while Sodha concedes that she <em>could</em> steam (“It just involves a colander and lid, after all”), she won’t be changing her ways any time soon. “I like to get to something as delicious as possible with the least amount of fuss, so boiling will always win.”</p><p>For our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/felicity-cloake">resident perfectionist Felicity Cloake</a>, however, the cooking method she chooses depends on what she’s making. “I steam if the vegetable is going on the plate naked with salt and oil, because I prefer the texture. But if I was adding it to another dish, I’d blanch rather than boil, because it’s more efficient.” Nutrients-wise, Cloake doesn’t have a policy: “If there are vegetables in there, I’m generally thinking nutrients are happening anyway. Although it’s obviously something to consider, and I will in future, so thank you, Malcolm.”</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

## How does the coronation look from the US? Like the final straw for Brand Britain | Arwa Mahdawi

<p>Stateside obsession with the Windsors appears to have peaked with Harry and Meghan’s Oprah interview. Now there is little but apathy towards King Charles</p><p>Hello from Philadelphia where the excited natives are counting down the days until Charles III’s coronation. Anticipation fills the air and there is royal swag everywhere: the shops are overflowing with coronation-themed trinkets. There isn’t a single American in this city that isn’t tingling with excitement about Britain’s new king and his glorious crown.</p><p>I’m joking, of course: from what I can see from my little perch, the US is mostly ignoring the pageantry taking place across the Atlantic. It wasn’t like this for Queen Elizabeth II: her coronation reportedly “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/queen-elizabeth-ii-coronation-television-broadcasting-battleground/" title="">created a television broadcasting battleground</a>” in the US and 85 million Americans <a href="https://www.bbc.com/historyofthebbc/anniversaries/june/coronation-of-queen-elizabeth-ii/" title="">watched recordings of the highlights</a>. Queen Victoria’s coronation was also a transatlantic crowd-pleaser: according to a <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/americans-caught-victoria-fever-british-queens-1838-coronation-180963802/" title="">dispatch</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States_Magazine_and_Democratic_Review" title="">The United States Magazine and Democratic Review</a>, a prominent political magazine from the time, the US was infected by <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/americans-caught-victoria-fever-british-queens-1838-coronation-180963802/" title="">“Victoria Fever”</a> and “Queen-mania” back in 1838. A writer, going by the initials ADF, spent a day in Philadelphia – the “birthplace of America” – and declared the city so smitten with the new Queen that it should be renamed “Victoria-delphia”. Everywhere you went, ADF said, there was Victoria-related merch. There were hairbrushes with her picture on, Victoria-themed soap and gloves – even Victoria riding whips. I have thoroughly examined every grocery store in my corner of Philadelphia and I can assure you that there isn’t a single Charles-themed riding whip to be found. There isn’t even a can of beans with his face on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/02/how-does-the-coronation-look-from-the-us-like-the-final-straw-for-brand-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Exclusive: Fires more than quadruple since 2020 after surge in popularity of battery-assisted travel</p><p>Fires sparked by faulty e-bikes and e-scooters have injured at least 190 people in the UK and killed eight, the Guardian can reveal, as a surge in public enthusiasm for battery-assisted travel is matched by a more than quadrupling in blazes since 2020.</p><p>Overheating lithium-ion batteries create fierce fires, releasing toxic smoke, and are now occurring at the rate of at least six a week in the UK, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Fire and electrical experts are warning riders against buying batteries in less regulated online marketplaces, particularly from China, and are urging greater precautions when charging.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/may/02/e-bike-e-scooter-battery-fires-uk-data">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘It’s Shakespeare – as important as any modern piece of work’: Derek Jarman’s Blue comes to the stage

<p>Russell Tovey, Simon Fisher Turner, Travis Alabanza and Neil Bartlett are teaming up to reimagine the director’s final film – a narrated meditation over a static blue screen – as a ‘thank you’ to the LGBTQ+ hero</p><p>Neil Bartlett vividly remembers his first glimpse of Derek Jarman’s work: covertly watching the film Sebastiane (Latin dialogue, glistening flesh). “How I managed to do that without my mum and dad finding out,” he marvels. “I was captivated. That’s when Derek became public property – Mary Whitehouse and her cohorts were frothing at the mouth. And my young man’s cultural gaydar went: ‘Oh, what’s this?’”</p><p>As a painter, writer and film-maker, Jarman was a unique figure in British culture: an icon of the Thatcher years who defied all they stood for. He never hid his sexuality, and nor did he hide his Aids diagnosis, despite the snarling hatred shown towards people living with the disease. His final film, Blue, premiered in June 1993, less than a year before his death. Over a static, unchanging shot of Yves Klein blue, Jarman and some of his long-serving collaborators narrate a text that is scoured by illness, fired by fury and radiated by lyricism. The film plays like a sound collage, a meditation on love, loss and the colour blue as the director comes to terms with his illness and loss of sight (he can only see in shades of blue) yet retains his ardent intensity. “Our lives will run,” Jarman insists, “like sparks through the stubble.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/02/derek-jarman-blue-now-stage-film-simon-fisher-turner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The designer is about to make history with Camilla’s coronation dress. He talks about growing up a Barnardo’s child, finding his way in fashion, and dressing Bianca Jagger, Charlotte Rampling and Princess Diana </p><p>It is the 50th anniversary of Bruce Oldfield’s couture business this year, and he marks it with one of his greatest accomplishments – even if it comes with a certain amount of awkwardness. News broke in February that Oldfield was designing Queen Camilla’s, dress for the coronation. Such a historic commission would be a crowning achievement for any designer. For someone from Oldfield’s background – pretty much the opposite end of the social spectrum from royalty – it is almost miraculous.</p><p>The awkwardness comes because the Camilla commission immediately triggers comparison with another of Oldfield’s royal patrons (and King Charles’s wives, for that matter): Diana, Princess of Wales. In their shared 1980s heyday, Diana was one of a number of high-profile women who helped make Oldfield’s name. And as with many of Oldfield’s clients, it seems, the two were also friends.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/02/i-wanted-success-and-i-got-it-quickly-how-bruce-oldfield-went-from-foster-care-to-fashion-royalty">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The bass player has made a bitingly honest documentary about his struggles with cocaine and alcohol, and how he recovered. He hopes it might help others who are facing the same demons</p><p>On the nights when he thought he’d gone too far, that he’d drunk too much and taken too many drugs, Matt Willis would leave notes for his wife, in case he didn’t wake up. “Saying sorry,” he says. In the morning, he’d find the note before she did and throw it away. He thought about dying, he says, “quite a lot. I was always terrified of that. Many times, it was at a point where my body felt like it was giving up. It’s very different when the addiction becomes physical.”</p><p>Willis, the bass player of the band Busted, has made a documentary exploring his addiction to alcohol and drugs, the effect it had on those around him, and the new research and treatment being developed. Originally, he wanted to focus on the science of addiction – he has become “obsessed” with it, he says, and he reads everything he can – but it became more personal. There was a screening the evening before we meet, which was the first time he’d watched it as a whole. “It was really hard to not just go: what have I done?” But he’s proud of it. In the past, when he talked about his addictions, “it kind of turned into some scandalous headline. I had a [recovery] sponsor early on who went: ‘Keep that shit to yourself, it won’t be good for your recovery.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/02/my-body-felt-like-it-was-giving-up-busteds-matt-willis-on-the-addictions-that-nearly-destroyed-him">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Any attempt to understand the extent of royal wealth will need to account for the value of their land and their most valuable treasures. Maeve McClenaghan sets off to uncover what is held by the crown and what belongs to the family privately</p><p>Alongside the sovereign grant, the main source of royal income is the property empire that the family passes down through the generations. The duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall provide millions of pounds annually to the monarch and his male heir. As the Guardian’s <strong>Rob Evans </strong>tells <strong>Maeve McClenaghan, </strong>it is not simple to find out exactly how much money this land holding has generated for them, but through painstaking research and careful reading of the accounts filed in the House of Lords, a picture emerges. Since the queen took the throne in 1952, the duchies have provided £1.2bn in income for the family, when adjusted for inflation.</p><p>On top of the duchies, the family also has huge wealth tied up in treasures: art, jewels, racehorses – even a stamp collection worth approximately £100m. Reporters <strong>David Pegg, Henry Dyer and Greg Wood </strong>go out across the country to track down lists of items held by royal collections. Looking closer at some of these possessions reveals an interesting common theme: in several cases it becomes clear that the line is blurred between what is owned by the sovereign on behalf of the nation and what is owned by them personally.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/may/02/cost-of-the-crown-part-2-duchies-diamonds-and-dalis-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
