Let that sink in for a moment \u2013 Resident Evil 4 remake, Dead Space remake, and Metroid Prime Remastered all garnered high review scores; three games that are recapturing, remolding, and re-envisioning experiences that are over a decade old. And that's only the beginning, as more remakes are underway like Silent Hill 2, Alone in the Dark, Max Payne 1 and 2 \u2014 that's a lot. At face value, it\u2019s totally appropriate to raise an eyebrow: plenty of new games, new experiences have already come out this year, and yet the top three rated games of the year are remakes? That can be misconstrued as a negative thing, but that may not be the case. In fact, look a little closer, and it might be one of the only ways to really uphold a game\u2019s legacy.\u00a0\n\nIn this episode of The Kurt Locker, Kurt Indovina examines the current trend of remakes and remasters and breaks down the multi-faceted, even confusing, topic, and gives his perspective on how remakes may actually be a good thing. \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:50 - The remake: Dead Space\n02:22 - The remaster: Metroid Prime \n03:05 - The reimagining: Resident Evil 4 \n04:10 - The compelling case of GoldenEye 007\n06:38 - The preservation problem\n08:47 - Conclusion\n\nTo be entered to win some amazing prizes reply to the pinned comment in this video with #GamespotGiveaway and answer the following question: \"What do you think is the greatest Remake of all time?\" Giveaway closes at on 5/3 at 8AM PT!
