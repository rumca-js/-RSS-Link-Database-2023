The plastic sphere was, of course, well disguised: not only coated with gold filigree but also surrounded by a floating constellation of diamonds arranged in the shape of Charles\u2019s star sign, Scorpio. It was pagan astrology meets high church meets high camp, a fittingly fruity headpiece for the eccentric prince.</p><p>The crown was designed by Louis Osman, an architect and goldsmith described by one of his friends as \u201cthe original hippie\u201d \u2013 and it marked a radical departure from the usual staid royal headwear. This was <a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/style/jewelry-and-watches/a27207763/prince-charles-prince-of-wales-coronet-history-designer/\">a futuristic vision</a> featuring swooping golden arches surrounded by abstract fleurs-de-lis and needle-thin crosses that jutted out like splintering lightning bolts. The gold, symbolically, came from a Welsh nugget, but rather than being traditionally hammered it was \u2013 in a showcase of modern methods \u2013 electroplated on to an epoxy resin cast. An internal purple velvet cap banded with ermine completed the look, fulfilling Charles\u2019s wish for a crown that could be worn by a \u201cmodern prince\u201d with a regular haircut, not someone with a wig, and \u201cears that show\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/02/charles-ping-pong-ball-crown-shocking-history-royal-headwear-bling\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/02/charles-ping-pong-ball-crown-shocking-history-royal-headwear-bling", "date_published": "2023-05-02 15:22:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Muslim mayor turned away from White House Eid event: \u2018There is a secret list\u2019", "description": "<p>Mohamed Khairullah, mayor of a New Jersey town, says he\u2019s on list \u2018that has targeted me because of my identity\u2019</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics\">US</a> Secret Service denied security clearance for Mohamed Khairullah, the longest-serving Muslim mayor in New Jersey, and prevented him from attending a White House Eid al-Fitr event on Monday afternoon marking the end of Ramadan.</p><p>Khairullah, who was critical of the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban in 2017 that restricted entry to the United States from several predominantly Muslim countries, received the call from the Secret Service while he was en route to the White House.

First to take the stand is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/meera-sodha\">Meera Sodha</a>. \u201cI\u2019m not the sort of person to optimise anything in life, except for pleasure and ease,\u201d she says, so when it comes to vegetables, her answer is easy: \u201cIf I\u2019m cooking them into a meal [a curry or pan-fried dish, say], I\u2019ll just put them in the pot or pan with all the other ingredients, where they might cook by frying, simmering or, if there\u2019s a lid involved, part-steaming \u2013 I suppose the nutrients are captive then, so that\u2019s a bonus!\u201d If, however, she is serving a side of, for instance, broccoli, she\u2019ll boil it, \u201cbecause it\u2019s quick, efficient and hands-off, which is important to me, especially if there\u2019s something else on the bubble.\u201d And while Sodha concedes that she <em>could</em> steam (\u201cIt just involves a colander and lid, after all\u201d), she won\u2019t be changing her ways any time soon. \u201cI like to get to something as delicious as possible with the least amount of fuss, so boiling will always win.\u201d</p><p>For our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/felicity-cloake\">resident perfectionist Felicity Cloake</a>, however, the cooking method she chooses depends on what she\u2019s making. \u201cI steam if the vegetable is going on the plate naked with salt and oil, because I prefer the texture. But if I was adding it to another dish, I\u2019d blanch rather than boil, because it\u2019s more efficient.\u201d Nutrients-wise, Cloake doesn\u2019t have a policy: \u201cIf there are vegetables in there, I\u2019m generally thinking nutrients are happening anyway. Although it\u2019s obviously something to consider, and I will in future, so thank you, Malcolm.\u201d</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

Maeve McClenaghan sets off to uncover what is held by the crown and what belongs to the family privately</p><p>Alongside the sovereign grant, the main source of royal income is the property empire that the family passes down through the generations. The duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall provide millions of pounds annually to the monarch and his male heir. As the Guardian\u2019s <strong>Rob Evans </strong>tells <strong>Maeve McClenaghan, </strong>it is not simple to find out exactly how much money this land holding has generated for them, but through painstaking research and careful reading of the accounts filed in the House of Lords, a picture emerges. Since the queen took the throne in 1952, the duchies have provided \u00a31.2bn in income for the family, when adjusted for inflation.</p><p>On top of the duchies, the family also has huge wealth tied up in treasures: art, jewels, racehorses \u2013 even a stamp collection worth approximately \u00a3100m. Reporters <strong>David Pegg, Henry Dyer and Greg Wood </strong>go out across the country to track down lists of items held by royal collections. Looking closer at some of these possessions reveals an interesting common theme: in several cases it becomes clear that the line is blurred between what is owned by the sovereign on behalf of the nation and what is owned by them personally.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/may/02/cost-of-the-crown-part-2-duchies-diamonds-and-dalis-podcast\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/may/02/cost-of-the-crown-part-2-duchies-diamonds-and-dalis-podcast", "date_published": "2023-05-02 02:00:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
