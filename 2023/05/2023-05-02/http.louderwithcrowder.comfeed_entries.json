You're joyriding in my car like nobody was going to see you.</blockquote><p>This is the most embarrassing apprehension of a car thief <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/santa-claus-car-thief\" target=\"_blank\">since that dude got taken down by Santa Claus</a>. Embarrassing for the thief. Hysterical for everyone watching.</p><p>The story goes like this. Bianca Chambers is a boutique owner with a Mercedes-Benz. Dummy McDumberson stole that Mercedes-Benz. McDumberson then drives the stolen Benz around the same neighborhood Chambers owns a boutique in. This allowed Chambers to track the stolen vehicle via tips on social media. Three times she found her car, but by the time police came Dummy drove off.</p><p>The fourth time, Chambers took matters into her own hands. She took out her own tires so McDumberson couldn't escape. She then goes into the barbershop to confront McDumberson and drags him by his dreadlocks. The other people in the shop helped make a citizen's arrest until police showed up. Chambers got her Benz back. Her nice and cleans Benz. McDumberson took the car to get detailed.</p><p>The look on McDumberson's face as he's being dragged makes the video. Rarely do you catch the exact moment someone finds themselves questioning all their poor life choices all at once. McDumberson will now have plenty of time to think about where it all went wrong.</p><p>Chambers, if the boutique doesn't work out, should consider a career as a private investigator and/or a bounty hunter. She does great work.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

It's a viral video, allow for missing context and whatnot. The context I'm most curious about is how this fight started. Because it takes place in the middle of a freeway, and shawty with the shorty-shorts doesn't look like someone who was driving. Unless her man was driving, only he's beta and, after cutting someone off, sat in the car while his girlfriend did all the work. </p><p>Either that, or the one in white is the \"other woman\" and picked an awkward time to confront her boyfriend's wife. And how did she know they would be driving down the freeway at that moment and manage to run into the middle of traffic? These are the questions we need answered.</p><p>I feel bad for the one in white because we've all been there. You pick a fight with someone more significant than you, and then the moment of clarity smacks you upside the head that... I just picked a fight with someone bigger than me. Fight or flight. She chose flight. Until she found herself eating pavement.
