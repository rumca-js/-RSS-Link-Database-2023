👀 Watch Citadel on @PrimeVideo!

Loyal Theorist, I need YOUR help to find the double agent. The spy agency Citadel has fallen and all of the agents’ memories have been wiped. But after watching the first few episodes and the official trailer, we think there’s something sus going on with either Mason, Nadia, or Bernard. Can you help us find who’s lying?
