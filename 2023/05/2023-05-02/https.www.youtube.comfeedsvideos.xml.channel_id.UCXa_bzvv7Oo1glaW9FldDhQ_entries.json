While Redfall might be about working together to keep off hordes of vampires from eating your squad up, Arkane\u2019s open ended ability-based gameplay continues to influence the game, and this is most evident in the many special talents of each of the playable cast of characters. \n\nBut enough about gameplay, let\u2019s talk about the visuals. How has Arkane leveraged the power of Microsoft\u2019s current gen machine? How does the game look and perform on Xbox Series X? These are the questions that we will be trying to answer as we peel back the many layers of Redfall\u2019s visual presentation with this technical analysis.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3dCSyiLHiM", "date_published": "2023-05-02 06:45:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Redfall Review - Huge Disappointment", "description": "Redfall\u00a0feels entirely out of character for Arkane, a studio that has always prided itself on developing unique, systemically dense games that provide experiences that have almost no peers in the medium. While it does retain hints of the studio's formula, it dilutes it too much with rote and uninspired gameplay and design choices, resulting in a blend that feels like it's neither here nor there. \n\nThen you have the technical and control issues, which further mar the experience, while the narrative shortcomings prove to be another stake to the heart. It'd be unfair and inaccurate to say that there's nothing to like here \u2013 there certainly is \u2013 but in what's probably a first for Arkane, the bad ends up outweighing the good.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucXGh5QRE_4", "date_published": "2023-05-02 00:15:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
