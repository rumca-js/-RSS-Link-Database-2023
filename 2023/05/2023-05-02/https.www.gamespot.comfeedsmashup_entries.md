## One Of The First Social Deduction Games Is Getting A Creepy Horror Sequel

<p>Social deduction games have been around for decades, but mostly as tabletop experiences. Though there are a handful of early examples, like the 2009 Trouble in Terrorist Town mod, the genre's popularity in the video game space is a relatively recent development with early trendsetters releasing in 2017-2018 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/among-us/">Among Us</a> becoming a surprise overnight sensation in 2020. But before the likes of Among Us and the many games thereafter chasing its popularity, there was 2017's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deceit/">Deceit</a>, a social deduction game so ahead of its time that it was not even called a social deduction game--since you outed the traitor with guns, the game is classified as a shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">That game is now getting a sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deceit-2/">Deceit 2</a>, and it aims to inject all the learnings of the social deduction genre that came after Deceit to make for an even creepier experience that prioritizes clue hunting, monstrous masquerading, and a horror-driven world. The game is also being made in Unreal 5, featuring an artistic direction that's going for photorealism, much like the first Deceit. It sees you play as one of the members of the Truth Seekers Anonymous, who are looking to uncover the story behind an occult ritual gone wrong from decades prior. Their efforts lead them into a trap set up by a mysterious masked entity known as the Game Master, who hides eldritch horrors and monsters amongst the party in a bid to complete some strange ritual before anyone can escape.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4132857-1.png"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4132857-1.png" /></a></figure><p dir="ltr">I got to play two sessions in the alpha build of the 6-9 player social deduction horror game. Both times, I played with members of developer World Makers for a full nine-player lobby. In the first match, I played as one of the seven Innocents, and we barely scraped together a victory. In the second, I was one of the two monstrous Infected--save for custom games, you always play with two Infected in Deceit 2--and just barely lost. I had a lot of fun both times, though not in a way that felt totally different and unique from what I've experienced elsewhere in the genre. The original Deceit may have been ahead of its time, but I worry Deceit 2 may be just another social deduction game playing catch-up to Among Us. Following my play session, I spoke to World Makers CEO James Thompson and executive producer Jord Fox about what players can expect from the full version of Deceit 2, which is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC in 2023.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-first-social-deduction-games-is-getting-a-creepy-horror-sequel/1100-6513781/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> New box office tracking estimates from <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/box-office-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-opening-weekend-projection-1235600984/">Variety</a> suggest that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 should make $120 million in the US this weekend for its opening. That would be well above the first-weekend results of the original movie ($94 million) but significantly under 2017's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ($146.5 million). The report said Vol. 3 might fall even shorter than expectations and make $110 million-$118 million.</p><p>The initial box office estimates from April said Vol. 3 might make $130 million over its first three days stateside and that those predictions might be conservative because the marketing campaign hadn't fully ramped up. But now that the marketing machine is in full gear, Vol. 3 is tracking even lower.</p><p>"That points to either mounting indifference to the newest phase in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or a sign that Disney waited too long to conclude the Guardians story, which began nearly a decade ago..."

<p>New footage shows Ukrainian military personnel piloting a remote-control turret with nothing other than a Steam Deck. As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ukraines-army-is-experimenting-with-using-steam-decks-to-remote-control-gun-turrets/">PC Gamer</a>, footage of the Steam Deck being used by the Ukrainian military first emerged via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CrS0d4_v6qq/">TRO Media</a> on Instagram. Later footage, likely from the same event, appeared showing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYE5w3ETtDM">the turret explicitly being controlled by the portable PC</a>.</p><p>The turret shown in the footage is a <a href="https://roboneers.net/en/shablya-rws">Shablya model</a>, developed by Ukrainian firm <a href="https://defence-blog.com/global-dynamics-unveiled-modern-unmanned-ground-vehicle-with-shablya-rws/">Global Dynamics</a>. A crowdfunding campaign via <a href="https://www.peoplesproject.com/en/sabre-remote-weapon-station/">People's Project</a> raised 445,000 uah (12,000 USD) to supply 10 of the remote weapon stations to the Ukraine armed forces.</p><p>Why use a video game device to control a remote turret? According to Bellingcat research <a href="https://twitter.com/AricToler">Aric Toler</a>, as quoted by PC Gamer, the device is perfect for this kind of usage. Toler said, "Totally native OS client, great controller you can use, touch screen, etc. It makes perfect sense for Steam Deck to be used, assuming the software is Linux-compatible (unless they went through the godawful process of dual-booting Windows on a Steam Deck)."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ukraine-army-using-steam-decks-to-shoot-real-turrets-in-war-with-russia/1100-6513768/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>EA Sports has officially announced Super Mega Baseball 4, and it sounds like it's changing things up in a big way for the humorous and lighthearted baseball series.</p><p>Super Mega Baseball 4 is now a licensed game, featuring more than 200 real-life baseball players. Retired Red Sox slugger David Ortiz is on the cover, and the roster also includes baseball legends like Jose Bautista, Babe Ruth, and Hank Aaron. These real-life players will hit the field alongside a roster of fictional characters. The game doesn't appear to have the MLB license, however, so don't expect to play as the Red Sox or Yankees or see real-world stadiums.</p><div>          </div><p>Super Mega Baseball 4 has six new stadiums and a series of "top community-requested features," EA said. The game promises the "most significant presentation upgrade" in the series so far.

<p>Actor Nicolas Cage has shared his thoughts on what he believes happens when we die, and he also discussed how his earliest memory may have been when he was in the womb.</p><p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyXr1vrT8G0">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a>, Cage began by describing what happens when we die, as he sees it. The Oscar-winner has a hopeful take on death, saying he believes that everyone's "spark" may go on, in some way or another.</p><p>"Nobody really knows. I don't know. They say that electricity is forever, eternal; the spark keeps going. I'd like to think whatever spark is animating our bodies, once the body passes on that the spark continues to go. But whether or not that electricity has consciousness or not, who could really say?" Cage said (<a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/nicolas-cage-remembers-mothers-womb-1235600977/">via Variety</a>).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicolas-cage-describes-what-he-believes-happens-when-we-die/1100-6513765/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
