[{"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Microsoft now lets you share Xbox PC Game Pass with friends", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft wants to lure more PC gamers to its Netflix-like Xbox Game Pass subscriptions&mdash;and it&rsquo;s using subscribers&rsquo; friend networks to cast the net. As of May 2, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/05/02/game-pass-friend-referral-program-announce/&amp;xcust=2-1-1805939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">the new program</a> allows existing PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to share 14-day trials with up to five friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, the cheap way to sample <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/pc-game-pass&amp;xcust=2-1-1805939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">PC Game Pass</a> was through a $1 trial, which offered a full month of time to explore <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#pcgames&amp;xcust=2-1-1805939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">over 400 games for PC</a>. This offer unfortunately died a quiet but sad death in late March 2023. Since then, gamers wanting to try the service have had to pony up for a full month, or hunt for a promotional card that offers a short trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PC Game Pass&rsquo;s library includes titles from Microsoft, Bethesda, EA, and third-party studios. Subscriptions also offer additional in-game perks when you link your Microsoft account to other services (e.g., a Riot Games account). Like Netflix, new games are constantly added to the catalog, with others periodically leaving, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tied to the launch of co-op vampire <em>Redfall</em>, this current promotion seems aimed at drawing more PC subscribers to the Xbox Game Pass service. In an interview last fall with <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23425029/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-profitable-revenues&amp;xcust=2-1-1805939-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Verge</a>, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer noted that while console subscriber growth had begun to slow, PC growth continues to climb. Figures released by Microsoft in October 2022 showed a 159 percent increase in PC Game Pass subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current subscribers can find Friend Referral invitations on the Game Pass Home screen (for both console and the Xbox app on PC), as well as on Xbox.com. If you&rsquo;re on the receiving end of a code, and find that you like PC Game Pass, you can use <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/397667/get-3-years-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-tip.html\">this handy trick</a> to subscribe for half the cost. Just let the trial run out first, then follow that guide&rsquo;s instructions. You can lock in that cheaper rate for up to three years.</p>\n\nGaming</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1805939/microsoft-now-lets-you-share-xbox-pc-game-pass-with-friends.html", "date_published": "2023-05-02 20:02:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "OneDrive\u2019s new UI focuses on people, not files, and that\u2019s great", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Any files you have stored in OneDrive or other cloud services are probably organized by file and name so you know where they are. But in the workplace, all bets are off. A new OneDrive for the web UI feature helps solve that problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OneDrive&rsquo;s new feature for businesses and schools allows you to organize files by <em>people</em>, not just file name. You can also organize them by meeting, too&mdash;even upcoming meetings that haven&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are two solid improvements to the OneDrive UI. If you&rsquo;re the type of person who can mentally categorize files across multiple workgroups, good for you. Sometimes that means navigating through threads and chat rooms to find the relevant file, whether they&rsquo;ve ben bookmarked or pinned or not. What OneDrive is proposing is simply skipping all that. Perhaps you&rsquo;re supposed to be working with a coworker or two on a specific proposal&mdash;which may have been shunted off into separate drafts. OneDrive&rsquo;s new Meetings view will automatically organize those files, whether it be in the context of a specific past or upcoming meeting, or just the coworker(s) that are involved. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that OneDrive isn&rsquo;t moving away from its traditional file-first organization scheme&mdash;if you want to organize your shared and personal files like that, you can. OneDrive is also adding filtering by file type and little touches like the ability to color-code your folders, too.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"OneDrive People interface\" class=\"wp-image-1805917\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/People.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>OneDrive&rsquo;s new People interface complements the new Meetings UI at the top of this story.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The only hitch? For one, this is only being rolled out to schools and businesses, and only on the web. The consumer version of OneDrive will remain unchanged. Microsoft isn&rsquo;t giving an exact timeframe for when these new changes will roll out, either, only that they&rsquo;ll happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft also plans to use AI to make additional file recommendations &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo; as part of the &ldquo;For You&rdquo; section of the OneDrive home page. Though AI gets all the headlines these days, it honestly feels like organizing files by person and meeting is well on its way to helping you find what you need. (Maybe Projects can be the next addition?) OneDrive&rsquo;s new schema seems like a smart addition already.</p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1805856/onedrives-new-ui-can-focus-on-people-not-files-and-thats-great.html", "date_published": "2023-05-02 19:41:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Apple and Google join forces to combat AirTag stalking", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple and Google are teaming up to fight AirTag and Tile bluetooth tracker stalking by proposing an industry specification. This specification is intended to &ldquo;alert users in the event of suspected unwanted tracking,&rdquo; according to the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-google-partner-on-an-industry-specification-to-address-unwanted-tracking/&amp;xcust=2-1-1805514-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">official press release</a>. Location-tracking devices can be a godsend, especially when you misplace your keys or wallet. However, they can also be used for far more nefarious reasons like stalking and car theft. This proposed specification is meant to squash the misuse of these gadgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>My colleague used Apple AirTag to track his wife and kids for science&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/608037/i-used-apple-airtag-to-track-my-wife-and-kids-heres-what-i-learned.html\">these are his takeaways</a>.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how will this standard work? Well, it would allow Bluetooth-enabled gadgets to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across both iOS and Android ecosystems. They&rsquo;ve already got the support of Tile, Samsung, Eufy Security, Pebblebee, Chipolo, and more. Apple and Google submitted this proposed specification to the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/&amp;xcust=2-1-1805514-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (otherwise known as IETF), which is a standards organization that was established back in 1986. Interested parties are currently being invited to review and comment on the proposal over a period of three months. Once they&rsquo;ve gone over the feedback, they&rsquo;ll release a production implement of the specification, which is expected by the end of 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the release of the new AirTags in 2021, Apple has gone ahead and implemented a couple of new anti-stalking features. The device will now producer louder alert sounds when separated from from its owner. You&rsquo;ll also see a warning message when setting up the AirTag for the first time. This new message informs folks that using this item to track people is indeed a criminal offense in most places around the world. While these changes are no doubt important, Google and Apple seem to be taking things a step further. This is great news, as safety should <strong>always</strong> be a top priority. </p>\n\nGadgets</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1805514/1805514.html", "date_published": "2023-05-02 15:57:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Steam Deck in the Ukraine War: How it controls guns remotely", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian soldiers have to be inventive in their fight against the Russian army. For example, commercially available drones are used for reconnaissance and to fight enemy troops. But the Ukrainian soldiers have also found a military application for Valve&rsquo;s handheld Steam Deck gaming console. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mobile PC is used to control machine gun emplacements from a distance. The system, called &ldquo;Sabre,&rdquo; was created via a crowdfunding platform that was founded after Russia&rsquo;s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"remote-control-for-large-machine-guns\">Remote control for large machine guns</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a video posted on Facebook, Ukrainian soldiers can be seen using the Steam Deck, primarily designed for PC gaming, to remotely control a large machine gun via a thick cable. &ldquo;Sabre&rdquo; is supposed to help repel attackers from a safe distance, and control weapons of different types, from an anti-tank gun to a Kalashnikov.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=722476006338616&amp;xcust=2-1-1805588-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">published video</a>, a PKT-type machine gun can be seen being supplied with new ammunition via a belt. The heavy machine gun is normally mounted on vehicles. Therefore, it is already designed to be fired from a distance. According to the Ukrainian development team, &ldquo;Sabre&rdquo; can protect the survival of Ukrainian soldiers in war, as they no longer have to stand unprotected behind the machine gun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the crowdfunding campaign that has been running since 2015, more than $12,000 has been raised to pay for the project. The first prototypes weren&rsquo;t built for Valve&rsquo;s Steam Deck, which wasn&rsquo;t launched until 2022. But eventually the hardware built for gamers met all the requirements of the Ukrainian army.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other countries have similar systems. South Korea, for example, secures its borders with North Korea with automatic gun turrets. Israel has AI-supported turrets called &ldquo;Smartshooter&rdquo; in use at its borders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on PC-Welt, and has been translated from German to English.</em></p>\n\nGaming PCs, Internet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1805588/steam-deck-in-the-ukraine-war.html", "date_published": "2023-05-02 15:24:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Intel may drop the iconic \u201ci\u201d from future Core CPU names", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;i&rdquo; in team, as the saying goes. Other words lacking the third vowel include &ldquo;processor,&rdquo; &ldquo;name scheme,&rdquo; and &ldquo;rebrand.&rdquo; And if a couple of leaks are any indication, Intel&rsquo;s next series of CPUs will lack that little &ldquo;i&rdquo; after the Core title too, simply being called &ldquo;Intel Core 3,&rdquo; &ldquo;Core 5,&rdquo; &ldquo;Core 7,&rdquo; et cetera. If it turns out to be true, it&rsquo;ll be a shake-up of a CPU brand that&rsquo;s been going strong since 2008, when Intel shifted away from its Core Duo and Core Quad labeling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benchmarks of the upcoming &ldquo;Meteor Lake generation&rdquo; of CPUs have leaked, showing off the name &ldquo;Core Ultra 5 1003H,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-meteor-lake-p-core-ultra-engineering-sample-spotted-with-18-threads-and-128-gpu-cores&amp;xcust=2-1-1805480-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">according to VideoCardz</a>. Note the lack of an &ldquo;i&rdquo; before the 5. The CPU in question has 18 cores, putting it on the higher end of Intel&rsquo;s lineup, which makes sense given the &ldquo;Ultra&rdquo; moniker that would be a new differentiator. The Ultra name gives a bit of weight to the idea that this is a deliberate name for an upcoming CPU, not just some data entry flub that made its way to a leaked benchmark. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-to-change-branding-of-meteor-lake-cpus-core-5-ultra-incoming&amp;xcust=2-1-1805480-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a> reached out to Intel for comment on the leak, getting a predictable PR response that neither confirms nor denies that this is a real chip in development. But the spokesperson did say that the company is &ldquo;making brand changes&rdquo; for Meteor Lake, with more details coming in the next few weeks. That echoes Twitter statements made by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/Bernard_P/status/1653022115367645190&amp;xcust=2-1-1805480-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Intel&rsquo;s Director of global communications</a>: &ldquo;Yes, we are making band changes as we&rsquo;re at an inflection point in our client roadmap in preparation for the upcoming launch of our Meteor Lake processors.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Intel is looking to shake up its 15-year-old naming system, Meteor Lake is as good a launch as any. The next generation of Intel CPUs utilizes a radical new modular fabrication process based on the UCIe interface, allowing for a more flexible approach to customizing chips. This tile-based &ldquo;chiplet&rdquo; construction will let Intel mix-and-match components as necessary for CPU designs, even across manufacturers. So for example, Intel could make a laptop CPU with a main chip from Intel, an SoC tile from Samsung, and a GPU made at TSMC all on the same integrated system.

In truth, however, it&rsquo;s unlikely most people would see a resemblance without being told. In overall terms, it&rsquo;s light, handsome, and fast&mdash;just like I once was.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundups of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html\">best external drives</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html\">best SSDs</a> to learn about competing products. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"teamgroup-m200-design-and-features\">Teamgroup M200 design and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring 4.13-inches long, by 2.18-inches wide, by 0.43-inches thick, and weighing a shade under 3 ounces, the M200 is black and banded with alternating rough and semi-glossy surfaces. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sports a military-style anchor point for lanyards, clips, etc. if for some reason you&rsquo;d actually like to hang it from a utility belt. Teamgroup made no claims that I saw about IP ratings, but did say the drive has survived a 2-meter drop test. From my hands-on, that seems plausible. Then again, most SSDs will survive such a fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The T-Force M200 is currently available in $40/250GB, $58/500GB, $260/2TB, and the $300/4TB version we tested. The $90/1TB and 8TB versions should be available at some point&mdash;if I had to guess, I&rsquo;d say $700 for the 8TB simply because super-capacious drives generally carry a premium. I could be wrong and Teamgroup will price it in line with the others. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1801923\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/T-Force-M200-flat.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Note that the &ldquo;blue&rdquo; stripes are reflections from the room&rsquo;s lighting&mdash;the T-Force M200 is all black.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The internal SSD is NVMe (it needs to be to attain 20Gbps speeds) and uses either TLC or QLC, according to the fact-check sheet the company returned. They would not, however, specify which capacities used which. The company told me they reserve the right to change components if shortages arise. Hopefully, they are not swapping TLC and QLC in the same models and capacities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you&rsquo;ll read below, benchmark and bare drive everyday performance of the 4TB model was indeed that of a 20Gbps SSD, but that was while caching data (writing it as SLC, or one cell/bit at a time) was fully engaged. Data is later transferred to the native format as time allows. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where you generally see a difference in TLC versus QLC performance is when the NAND is written off cache, natively as 3-bit or 4-bit. TLC can often still maintain 450MBps or better, while QLC can drop all the way down to 90MBps to 200MBps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After filling the drive, the M200&rsquo;s ultimate low speed was around 150MBps, so I&rsquo;m calling the NAND in our 4TB test unit: QLC. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M200 is warrantied for five years; however, Teamgroup didn&rsquo;t provide the TBW (terabytes that may be written) numbers that might cut that short. As external SSDs are rarely written to enough to wear out NAND in five years, I&rsquo;m thinking you&rsquo;re safe in this instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The T-Force M200 portable SSD looks tough and walks the walk with its speedy performance.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-the-teamgroup-m200-perform\">How does the Teamgroup M200 perform?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The M200 wasn&rsquo;t the fastest 20Gbps drive we&rsquo;ve tested&mdash;however, it was close and certainly fast enough for the average user. We&rsquo;re talking a one percent disadvantage overall to the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/399150/wd-black-p50-game-drive-ssd-review.html\">WD Black Game Drive P50</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M200 was a bit slower under CrystalDiskMark 8, but dominated the 450GB write test. Most likely, the M200 having 4TB of NAND compared to the WD&rsquo;s 2TB influenced the latter result to some degree.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1802029\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/T-Force-M200-CDM8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>The Teamgroup T-Force M200 wrote faster, but read slower than the WD Black P50.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that our new test bed using the latest version of Windows 11 has shown some lower numbers, especially when it comes to sequential tests with fewer threads and queues. However, any drives compared have been re-tested on the new system and will share in the phenomenon.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1802030\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/T-Force-M200-48GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>While the M200  couldn&rsquo;t quite match the WD Black P50 in the 48GB transfers, it was darn close and subjectively tied. Shorter bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, the M200 is a 20Gbps USB (USB 3.2&times;2) SSD and USB 20Gbps ports aren&rsquo;t nearly as common as 5/10Gbps (USB 3.x) ports. But the M200, as with all the external 20Gbps drives we&rsquo;ve tested, is backwards compatible. You&rsquo;ll get roughly 1Gbps sustained throughput over the far more common 10Gbps ports, and somewhere north of 500MBps with 5Gbps USB. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1802031\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/T-Force-M200-450GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>This is where the T-Force M200  caught and surpassed the P50.

That means performance for PC gamers is something of a crapshoot &mdash; recent examples like <em>The Last of Us </em>and <em>Jedi: Survivor </em>show how that looks when it goes wrong. But what of <em>Redfall</em>, the much-anticipated multiplayer vampire shooter from Arkane Studios? Let&rsquo;s take a deep dive into how it performs on PC. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>PCWorld&rsquo;s Adam Patrick Murray tried out <em>Redfall</em> on a whopping <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html\">eight different graphics cards</a>, ranging from super-affordable to &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m not paying rent this month&rdquo; expensive.

No, it&rsquo;s to see what settings you need to get to hit a 60fps target for smooth gameplay.

While it&rsquo;s often smooth, any kind of motion in the highly detailed environments can cause framerate dips and jitters, to say nothing of when combat starts and lighting effects are going wild. Even the RTX 4080 struggles to maintain 60 frames per second in 4K with relatively high settings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see the ideal settings for the relevant graphics cards, use the chapter breaks in the video above to find the closest card to the one you&rsquo;re using. While these cards from Asus, MSI, EVGA, Nvidia, Sapphire, XFX, and Intel may not be identical to the specific model you own, you can generally trust that graphics cards based on the same GPU (with various cooling and OC tweaks) will perform at about the same level, give or take five percent. Your CPU, RAM, and monitor resolution will add further variables, of course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more deep dives into the latest PC gaming hardware, be sure to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@pcworld&amp;xcust=2-1-1805403-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to PCWorld on YouTube</a>!  </p>\n\nGraphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1805403/redfall-pc-performance-tested-on-8-different-graphics-cards.html", "date_published": "2023-05-02 14:37:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Save 50% on this Eufy robot vacuum and make spring cleaning easy", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing better than a robot vacuum that automatically cleans up your house, especially if you&rsquo;ve got pets. I have one myself and it sure as heck beats lugging a heavy, traditional vacuum cleaner around the house. If you&rsquo;re in the market for a robot vacuum, you&rsquo;re in luck, as we&rsquo;ve got a sweet deal for you today.

Not only does this robot clean carpets and hardwood floors, but it also has a suction power of 2000Pa, which is powerful enough for an effective clean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RoboVac X8 features twin turbine technology, which provides 80 percent more airflow than a single-turbine vacuum. According to Eufy, debris will tightly pack within the dust box, meaning you don&rsquo;t have to empty it as often. You can also customize cleaning areas, no-go zones, and more with the companion app. The vacuum is even smart enough to know which floor it&rsquo;s on. The maximum runtime is approximately 208 minutes, which is about three and a half hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a killer deal. You better scoop it up now, though. We don&rsquo;t expect it to last long&mdash;it&rsquo;s spring cleaning season, after all.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Navigation-Twin-Turbine-Technology-generates/dp/B08XJRC164&amp;xcust=2-1-1805425-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the eufy RoboVac X8 for $299.99 at Amazon</a></p>\nSmart Home</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1805425/1805425.html", "date_published": "2023-05-02 14:23:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Ryzen 7800X3D vs 7950X3D: AMD\u2019s killer gaming CPUs, compared", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet waited with extreme eagerness for AMD&rsquo;s second-generation <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394646/how-amds-3d-v-cache-can-increase-ryzen-performance-by-up-to-25-percent.html\">3D V-Cache</a> chips&mdash;and when the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html\">Ryzen 9 7950X3D and 7900X3D</a> launched in late February, and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1686772/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-amds-new-ryzen-7-7800x3d.html\">Ryzen 7 7800X3D</a> followed in early April, they weren&rsquo;t disappointed.

In a couple of our gaming benchmarks, the 7800X3D trails by double digital percentages&mdash;a 14 percent decrease in performance in Dirt 5 and an 11 percent drop in Gears Tactics. On the flip side of the coin, the 7800X3D stretched ahead of the 7950X3D by 9 percent. But even with these differences, both chips perform extremely well in games, making the 7800X3D the better choice for most people looking for the best gaming CPU on the market. Only those who need to drive extremely high refresh-rate panels (240Hz or faster) would need to examine performance in specific games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"but-the-7950x3d-is-more-versatile\">But the 7950X3D is more versatile</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d\">AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"4176\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ryzen-9-7950X3D_07.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"8129\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t789 Euro\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>As you just saw, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D keeps pace with the 7950X3D in games.

You get top-notch gaming <em>and</em> excellent production performance with the Ryzen 9 7950X3D and 7900X3D; they&rsquo;re a touch slower than their non-3D V-Cache counterparts in heavy workloads, but make up for it with screaming frame rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"theyre-physically-different\">They&rsquo;re physically different</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ryzen 9 7950X3D and Ryzen 7 7800X3D both have additional L3 cache stacked on a die (the 3D in 3D V-Cache), but they&rsquo;re not built the same. Open up these two CPUs and you&rsquo;ll immediately see a difference.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3d die\" class=\"wp-image-1446922\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AMD-Ryzen-9-7950X3d-die.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Ryzen 9 7950X3D and 7900X3D both have a dual die design.

One die is layered with that extra L3 cache, while the other runs at higher frequencies. Windows defaults to the non-stacked die for programs unless it detects a game&mdash;then the operating system will move all active applications to the stacked die and leave the other idle, unless you need more threads. The second die will come back into play then, but at a lower clock speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, the 7950X3D is simply more complex than the 7800X3D, which has just one die, stacked with extra L3 cache. For most people, this fact won&rsquo;t matter much, but those who love extra performance and tinkering have the option to play with what the 7950X3D and 7900X3D&rsquo;s stacked die <em>and</em> the higher frequency die handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"they-both-go-easy-on-power-consumption\">They both go easy on power consumption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chips in AMD&rsquo;s X3D lineup all but sip at electricity compared to the other processors in Team Red&rsquo;s stable&mdash;as well as Intel rivals. During Cinebench R23&rsquo;s multi-core benchmark, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D used about 35 percent less energy (228 watts total) than the Ryzen 9 7950X. And when put head-to-head with the Intel Core i9-13900K and i9-13900KS, the 7950X3D delivered a 51 percent and 55 percent decrease in energy consumption, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter\"><div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container\"><ul class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper\"><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img alt=\"Ryzen 7800X3D power consumption in Cinenbench R23\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-1804171\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Power_Cinebench_R23_nT.png\" /></figure></li><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img alt=\"7950X3D power draw multicore Cinebench benchmark results\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-1524620\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/All_Core_Power_Nt.png\" /></figure></li></ul><a class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white\"></a><a class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white\"></a><a class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause\"></a><div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white\"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those numbers put the 7950X3D in a great light, given its strong performance in games and production work. But it&rsquo;s still outshone by the 7800X3D on this front, which consumes 24 percent less power (172 watts total) in the same Cinebench R23 test while offering nearly identical performance in games as the 7950X. If you don&rsquo;t need the extra firepower for production work, the 7800X3D is the winning ticket&mdash;especially if you live in a hot climate or your electricity rates are high.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"best-for-primary-gamers\">\n\t\t\t\t\tbest for primary gamers\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"ryzen-7-7800x3d\">Ryzen 7 7800X3D</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Ryzen 7 7800X3D\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AMD-ryzen-7-7800x3d.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1920\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t499 Euro\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"best-for-work-and-play-alike\">\n\t\t\t\t\tbest for work and play alike\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d\">AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"4176\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ryzen-9-7950X3D_07.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"8129\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t789 Euro\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1804140/ryzen-7800x3d-vs-7950x3d-amd-gaming-cpus-compared.html", "date_published": "2023-05-02 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Ultrawide monitors: 4 reasons to embrace the widescreen life", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been shopping around for a new monitor, you&rsquo;ve probably come across the ultrawide variety.

According to our review, it has a &ldquo;wide color gamut, excellent color accuracy, and a virtual buffet of image-quality calibration features that let users precisely tune the image.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s also quite vibrant and has a surprisingly fast refresh rate of 120Hz. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"theyre-awesome-for-movie-watching\">They&rsquo;re awesome for movie watching</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"our-favorite-bigscreen-ultrawide-monitor-offers-the-ultimate-in-immersion\">\n\t\t\t\t\tOur favorite bigscreen ultrawide monitor offers the ultimate in immersion\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"xeneon-flex\">Xeneon Flex</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Xeneon Flex\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/corsair-xeneon-flex-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1437\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677744/corsair-xeneon-flex-monitor-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6530600&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6530600%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=2-1-1515292-5-1677823-9957\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$1699.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing quite like watching an adventure-filled movie on an ultrawide monitor, especially one with a 21:9 aspect ratio. The movie will often fill every inch of the spacious screen, making for a more immersive experience. In a way, it sort of mimics going to the movie theatre. Most ultrawide monitors are curved as well, which really ups the immersive factor. But while watching movies on such a wide monitor can be a lot of fun, most people use them for PC gaming. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"youll-get-a-more-immersive-gaming-experience-out-of-it\">You&rsquo;ll get a more immersive gaming experience out of it</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-best-ultrawide-monitor-you-can-buy-for-gaming-or-anything-else\">\n\t\t\t\t\tThe best ultrawide monitor you can buy, for gaming or anything else\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"alienware-aw3423dwf\">Alienware AW3423DWF</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Alienware AW3423DWF\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Ultrawide monitors are perfect for graphically intensive games, as they really increase your field of view, resulting in a more immersive experience. Many new games support ultrawide resolutions natively, too. That means you don&rsquo;t have to manually stretch and adjust the picture to fit the screen. That said, for competitive FPS games like <em>Valorant </em>or <em>Overwatch</em>, in which every second matters, we&rsquo;d recommend springing for a smaller monitor. The reason being is that you don&rsquo;t have to turn your head much. By the time you spot an enemy player on an ultrawide monitor, they&rsquo;ve likely already run off and gunned down one of your teammates. But for less competitive games, ultrawide monitors shine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/804136/lg-ultragear-34gn850-review-2.html\">LG Ultragear 34GN850 ultrawide monitor</a> is our best budget pick for gamers because of its &ldquo;excellent color performance, good image quality, and a bright, vivid picture.&rdquo; It has a refresh rate of 144Hz (160Hz in overclocked mode) and it supports AMD FreeSync as well as Nvidia G-Sync for buttery smooth gameplay. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"more-room-for-ports\">More room for ports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that ultrawide monitors are gigantic. However, that means there&rsquo;s more room for ports. The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346674/asus-proart-pa348cgv-review.html\">Asus ProArt PA348CGV ultrawide monitor</a> mentioned above, for example, features a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 90 watts of Power Delivery, so it can charge a connected laptop or table. The USB-C port can drive up to four additional USB-A ports, offering a wide range of physical connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more connectivity options, the better. Diversity of ports really adds a lot of versatility to an ultrawide monitor. This way you can hook up to as many mice and keyboards as you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottom line? There&rsquo;s a reason why ultrawide monitors are all the rage these days, for work and play alike. If you&rsquo;re not a gaming-first PC enthusiast, however, you could get many of their benefits with a multiple display setup as well.
