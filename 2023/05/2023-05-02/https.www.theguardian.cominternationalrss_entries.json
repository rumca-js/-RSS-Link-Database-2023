The island, North Ronaldsay, is among the darkest inhabited places on earth. On a clear winter\u2019s night, it is easy to be awed by the thousands upon thousands of stars visible to the naked eye, which spill their unpolluted light upon the Earth. Heymans, who is the first woman appointed astronomer royal for Scotland, was planning to explain to the island\u2019s 60 or so residents that those stars, and the rest of the perceptible universe, represent a mere fraction of the stuff that makes up our cosmos. What she studies is everything we cannot see: the darkness.</p><p>Over the past two decades, Heymans, who is 45, has advanced our understanding of a vast, invisible cosmos that scientists are only beginning to comprehend. That \u201cdark universe\u201d is thought to constitute more than 95% of everything that exists. It is made up of entities more mysterious than the ordinary matter and energy \u2013 the light, atoms, molecules, lifeforms, stars, galaxies \u2013 that have been the subject of scientific inquiry throughout history. In the past 10 years, Heymans has learned that the dark universe shapes the visible cosmos in unexpected ways, and may not follow all the standard rules of physics. Her discoveries are unsettling a broad consensus on how our world works on its grandest scales. \u201cI believe that, to truly understand the dark universe, we will need to invoke some new physics that will for ever change our cosmic view,\u201d she has written.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/02/catherine-heymans-dark-universe-the-cosmologist-battling-long-covid\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/02/catherine-heymans-dark-universe-the-cosmologist-battling-long-covid", "date_published": "2023-05-02 05:00:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018Threats are increasing\u2019: the EU official on a mission to protect media freedom", "description": "<p>V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 says her upbringing in former Czechoslovakia has inspired her work to ensure journalism remains independent</p><p>V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 was 13 when she was first investigated for her political views.
