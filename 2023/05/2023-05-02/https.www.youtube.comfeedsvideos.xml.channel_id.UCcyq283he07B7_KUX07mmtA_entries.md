Bilona ghee is ghee that’s hand-churned from the milk of native South Asian cows.  Whereas factory-made ghee sells in India for around 585 rupees per kilogram, bilona ghee can cost up to 1,900 rupees per kilogram — over three times as much. Compared to industrial ghee, it takes much longer to make, but the end product is nuttier and more aromatic. Outside of India, it can sell for over $100 per kilogram.
