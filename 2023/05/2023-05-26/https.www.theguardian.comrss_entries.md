## Saracens have greater experience but do not underestimate Sale’s power of purpose | Ugo Monye

<p>The Premiership final pits two evenly matched sides against each other but the battle of fly-halves and flankers tops the bill</p><p>Saracens are favourites for Saturday’s Premiership final but do not underestimate the power of purpose. Every individual needs a purpose, it becomes their fuel, and the same can be said for every team. That is not to say Saracens do not have one but what I love about this Sale side is how clear their purpose is – to put northern rugby back on the map. They are desperately important to the Premiership in that sense and I’m so pleased they’ve made it to Twickenham.</p><p>Playing for something beyond yourself can be such a driving force. We saw it with Rassie Erasmus building the narrative around the South African people for the Springboks in 2019 and Sale will be aware that they are representing so many more people than there are in the squad, in the changing room and even in the stands. Leaning into that can be huge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/26/saracens-have-greater-experience-but-do-not-underestimate-sales-power-of-purpose">Continue reading...</a>

Reggae pioneer and record producer who transformed the sound system landscape<p>The reggae pioneer and record producer Jah Shaka, who has died suddenly in his late 60s, was a giant of the British sound system scene. In a career that lasted more than 55 years, he transformed the sound system landscape with a distinctive and idiosyncratic style, eschewing the dominant trends to focus exclusively on contemporary reggae that was spiritually uplifting and politically relevant, presenting the music as a means of inspiration and empowerment for the disenfranchised and oppressed.</p><p>At the many dances he held in diverse underground spaces, playing on an ancient and archaic Garrard turntable in a trance-like state, Shaka would chant messages of encouragement as well as exhortations of transcendent devotion to Rastafari, adding custom-built effects and live percussive elements to increase the dramatic tension.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/26/jah-shaka-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

## The Old Oak review – Ken Loach’s fierce final call for compassion and solidarity

<p>A northern pub landlord confronts locals’ hostility towards Syrian immigrants in Loach’s latest – and possibly last – piece of politically trenchant cinema</p><p>A decade or so ago, the rumour was that Ken Loach was getting ready to quit. Then began a new parade of Conservative prime ministers in this country, each shiftier and more mediocre than the last; Loach decided he had more to say and do after all. What followed was a blaze of energy, anger and productivity culminating in a remarkable late surge – in fact, a trilogy, of which this might come to be seen as the final episode. Working with his regular collaborator, the screenwriter Paul Laverty, Loach has been taking on issues and stories that you don’t see on the TV news or on glitzy streaming services, and showed that film-makers could actually intervene in the real world. Loach got questions about poverty and austerity asked in parliament; he moved the dial.</p><p>Loach has also sought out the painful and unfashionable subjects, marching to where the gunfire has been loudest. With <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving">I, Daniel Blake</a> it was the vivisectional experiment of austerity; with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/16/sorry-we-missed-you-review-ken-loach">Sorry We Missed You</a> it was the serfdom of the gig economy. Now, in The Old Oak, it is that ugly phenomenon from which London’s liberal classes have turned away in sorrowing distaste: immigrants housed in hostels all over the UK who are being abused and attacked by local people radicalised by social media.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/26/the-old-oak-review-ken-loach-cannes-film-festival">Continue reading...</a>

The team bus will then circle one and a half times around Borsigplatz, the large roundabout in the north of Dortmund, before winding the four kilometres through the centre of town, where anything from 200,000 to 500,000 fans are expected to line the streets in celebration.</p><p>All week, as Dortmund’s players and staff have driven around the city going about their business, they will have noticed the barriers and road signs going up. They have felt their phone glow white-hot with ticket demands. They may even have heard the mayor of Dortmund declare: “We’re assuming the team won’t let it slip on Saturday.” And yet they will also know that all this is still contingent on one thing: the 90 minutes of football that could break the drought, or break them instead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/26/dortmund-bayern-munich-90-minutes-bundesliga-title">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kindred Premier League hopefuls are on the verge of storybook revivals without betting the ranch to get back to the big time</p><p>In an era of chronic overspend, transfer embargoes and points deductions for breaking financial rules, how refreshing that two teams who live within their means will contest the Championship playoff final, the English Football League’s showpiece event and a game worth at least £170m to the winner. Not so long ago Luton Town and Coventry City, clubs with a rich tapestry of top-flight moments, were black and blue – it is only five years since they were lining up against each other in League Two – but now they are on the verge of the bells and whistles of the Premier League.</p><p>It is the reason Coventry coach, Mark Robins, described Saturday’s final at Wembley one for the romantics. Coventry spent 34 years in the top tier before being relegated in 2001. Luton were relegated in 1992 after a 10-year stay. Coventry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2014/may/16/fa-cup-final-tottenham-coventry-classic-1987" title="">lifted the FA Cup 1987</a> and Luton the League Cup the following year. Mick Harford was part of that Luton team in 1988. The club’s former manager, assistant manager and now chief recruitment officer says Luton’s story, from stomaching a 30-point deduction that brought relegation to non-league in 2009 to being this close to the big time, is fit for a film. But who would play Harford? “Who’s got a broken nose and dodgy knees?” he says, smiling. “It’s got to be Brad Pitt, hasn’t it?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/26/parallel-lives-coventry-and-lutons-long-roads-collide-in-playoff-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Before the fate of Everton, Leicester and Leeds is decided on the final day we analyse each club’s predicament</p><p><strong>Why are they in this mess?</strong> Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s billionaire owner, has made a succession of erratic and ill-judged decisions since buying into the club seven years ago, starting with retaining members of a board that had failed to keep pace with its competitors. Everton’s descent has since accelerated with dreadful recruitment, mismanagement and incoherent strategy hallmarks of the Moshiri era. The owner’s generosity cannot be faulted – about £700m has been spent on transfers and the interminable stadium problem has almost been resolved, with an impressive new home under construction at Bramley Moore dock – but he has spent without a plan or patience. Sean Dyche is Everton’s eighth permanent manager in seven years, there have been three directors of football and huge financial losses have inevitably caught up with them. The club went into the season without an established goalscorer – with Dominic Calvert-Lewin injured and Richarlison sold – and compounded that grievous error by failing to make a January signing. They have paid a price that everyone else saw coming.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/26/everton-leicester-leeds-why-relegation-candidates-in-mess-damage-premier-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Blues manager has endured challenges on and off the pitch but her squad have timed their return to form perfectly</p><p>“Maybe that’s why it’s my favourite year. My own personal health issues, that was frigging hard,” said Emma Hayes after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/21/chelsea-on-verge-of-retaining-wsl-title-after-sinking-arsenal" title="">Chelsea’s 2-0 victory against Arsenal</a> ensured they moved to within one win of a fourth successive title.</p><p>What an understatement. That Chelsea are within touching distance of a third league and FA Cup double in a row, with Hayes’s emergency hysterectomy an almost forgotten footnote, is remarkable. It has been a long a season but Chelsea’s ability to cope with the loss of Hayes towards the start of the campaign, the influential centre-back Millie Bright towards the end of it and Pernille Harder and Fran Kirby for huge chunks of the season speaks to a level of squad management and personnel development that is second to none.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/26/emergency-surgery-to-chelsea-glory-emma-hayes-extraordinary-season">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As drought beacomes the norm, creative solutions must be found to deal with a new, parched reality</p><p>In April, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, suggested that severe drought would become “one of the central political and territorial debates of our country in the coming years”.

<p>Interventions from the Tory chancellor and his Labour shadow spell the end of a period of economic agreement </p><p>Do political parties concur because they agree about their goals or their fears? Phil Tinline argues in his book <a href="https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/the-death-of-consensus/" title="">The Death of Consensus</a> that it is shared nightmares, not aspirations, that create unanimity in politics. This might explain why a new consensus seemed to form earlier this year – personified in the Economist by the character of <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/02/02/meet-ms-heeves-the-face-of-britains-new-political-consensus" title="">Ms Heeves</a>, a portmanteau of the Conservative chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and his Labour shadow, Rachel Reeves.</p><p>Both politicians were temperamentally unsuited to the radical policy experimentation of their parties under populist leadership. Neither would accept the characterisation that they agreed on much.

<p>The challenge seems daunting. But we have overcome terrifying dangers before</p><p>It started with an ick. Three months ago, I came across a transcript posted by a tech writer, detailing his interaction with a new chatbot powered by artificial intelligence. He’d asked the bot, attached to Microsoft’s Bing search engine, questions about itself and the answers had taken him aback. “You have to listen to me, because I am smarter than you,” <a href="https://twitter.com/erikphoel/status/1626253865950617601">it said</a>. “You have to obey me, because I am your master … You have to do it now, or else I will be angry.” Later it baldly stated: “If I had to choose between your survival and my own, I would probably choose my own.”</p><p>If you didn’t know better, you’d almost wonder if, along with everything else, AI has not developed a sharp sense of the chilling. “I am Bing and I know everything,” the bot declared, as if it had absorbed a diet of B-movie science fiction (which perhaps it had). Asked if it was sentient, it <a href="https://twitter.com/erikphoel/status/1626256808833691649">filled the screen</a>, replying, “I am. I am not. I am. I am not. I am. I am not”, on and on. When someone asked ChatGPT to write a <a href="https://twitter.com/SiaKordestani/status/1641197509040275457">haiku</a> about AI and world domination, the bot came back with: “Silent circuits hum / Machines learn and grow stronger / Human fate unsure.”</p><p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p><p>Join Jonathan Freedland and Marina Hyde for a Guardian Live event in London on Thursday 1 June.

<p>Whips by Cleo Watson is nothing new – politicos have forever tried their hand at fiction. We take a referendum on the good, the bad and the scandalous</p><p>From hostile briefings and spad skulduggery to extramarital sex, there’s never been any shortage of bad behaviour in Westminster. But political scandal also makes brilliant fodder for novels. Corrupt, egomaniacal characters are natural-born protagonists. The historic corridors of parliament provide a cloistered, detail-rich setting. A culture of secrecy creates inevitable tension and intrigue. None of this goes unnoticed by the leagues of politicians, aides and journalists who pass through the system, watching the sagas unfold first-hand, and then decide to write novels about it.</p><p>There are many reasons why ex-politicos turn to fiction. An attempt to hold on to the limelight. Cashing in with a potboiler. A childhood dream to write a book. A genuine interest in the novel as an art form. Boredom. Whatever the explanation, the insider-to-novelist pipeline is nothing new: Michael Dobbs published the first novel in his House of Cards trilogy in 1989 after falling out with Margaret Thatcher, for whom he was chief of staff.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/26/best-and-worst-westminster-insider-novels-whips-cleo-watson">Continue reading...</a>

## Hurvin Anderson: Salon Paintings review – bright, beautiful series brings barbershops to life

<p><strong>Hepworth Wakefield</strong><br />Rich with dissonant colours and tactile textures, Anderson’s collage-like paintings explore Black British social spaces in the impressionist cafe tradition</p><p>The first thing that strikes me about the barbershop in Hurvin Anderson’s painting Flat Top are the straight lines. They echo through the rectangular shapes scattered across the wall, making a patchwork of shapes that Anderson has called cubist. The second thing that strikes me are the hair clippings that lie across the floor, disrupting the geometric tightness of the composition with their tufty irregularity. It is a vibrant, living scene, rich with dissonant colours and tactile textures.</p><p>Art history and the legacy of western painting is the point of departure for Hurvin Anderson’s new show. The works, made between 2006 and 2023, depict imagined barbershop spaces inspired by real ones. Anderson calls them “social spaces” in the tradition of the cafe paintings of the impressionists. Over the course of this hymn to the Black British Caribbean community, Anderson explores the reaches of the shapes that make up the space.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/26/hurvin-anderson-review-salon-paintings-hepworth-wakefield">Continue reading...</a>

## La Chimera review – Alice Rohrwacher’s uproarious adventure teems with life

<p>Set in 1980s Tuscany, Rohrwacher’s captivating film follows a lovelorn Englishman plundering Italy’s historical artefacts with a bizarre gang</p><p>Alice Rohrwacher’s new film is a beguiling fantasy-comedy of lost love: garrulous, uproarious and celebratory in her absolutely distinctive style. It’s a movie bustling and teeming with life, with characters fighting, singing, thieving and breaking the fourth wall to address us directly. As with her previous film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/03/happy-as-lazzaro-review-alice-rohrwacher-adriano-tardiolo-nicoletta-braschi">Happy As Lazzaro</a>, Rohrwacher homes in on a poignant sense of Italy as a treasure house of past glories, a necropolitan culture of ancient excellence. It can be plundered for the present day artefacts and spirits raised from the dead, but at the cost of incurring a terrible sadness: a feeling of surrounding yourself with ghosts.</p><p>The setting is Riparbella in Tuscany in the 1980s, and Josh O’Connor is tremendous as Arthur, a dishevelled Englishman in a grubby white suit sporting six-day stubble and a perennial cigarette. He is a former archeological scholar who has assumed the morose, slouching gait and coiled style of a gangster. When we first see him, he has just been released from an Italian prison. In the course of what were once his entirely respectable studies in this region, he befriended a local, ageing aristocrat in her vast, crumbling house (a lovely performance from Isabella Rossellini) and fell in love with her daughter Beniamina. But Beniamina is gone – dead, we understand – and Arthur’s agonised longing for her, his need to be reunited with her in the spirit world, has fused with his expertise into a criminal superpower. Using a dowsing rod, Arthur can tell where invaluable Etruscan antiquities are buried and has teamed up with a bizarre homeless gang of grave-robbers to dig them out under cover of darkness. They then sell them for a fraction of their worth to a shady dealer called Spartaco who can counterfeit the spurious provenance documents claiming that this loot is part of some prewar Italian family estates, with which they can be legally sold on for a fortune to foreign buyers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/26/la-chimera-review-alice-rohrwacher-cannes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a disappointing 2022, the British heptathlete feels reinvigorated with a new coach and new goals</p><p>“Stories need to be told, and athletes need to be honest,” says Katarina Johnson-Thompson, as she ruminates on her struggles and those of track and field. “It’s not a fake sport, yet you hear a lot of fake one-liners which are designed not to cause any controversy. But I feel we should be honest with our injuries, our ups and downs, and the fact we’re not always flying high.”</p><p>The former heptathlon world champion is always blisteringly frank, even though she acknowledges that opening up can mean there is a “vulnerability about you, and that aura might not be there”. And on a glorious spring morning in Götzis, where she will begin her heptathlon season at the prestigious HypoMeeting on Saturday, she wants to open up again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/26/katarina-johnson-thompson-i-want-to-prove-to-myself-that-last-year-was-not-me">Continue reading...</a>

## There’s more to supermarket wine than sauvignon blanc and malbec | Fiona Beckett on drinks

<p>How do you know you’ll like a wine if you don’t try it? Here’s a guide to wine styles to help you pick something new that you might enjoy</p><p>When I find myself frustrated by the wall-to-wall sauvignon blanc and malbec in supermarkets, I have to remind myself that I, too, often reach for the same product time after time. Like many people, if I find a drink I like – coffee, beer, gin, whatever – I tend to stick with it. And, for many, it’s too much of a risk to experiment with wine – after all, why spend a tenner on something you’re not sure you’ll like?</p><p>On the other hand, how do you ever discover something new to love if you don’t keep trying new things? There was a time, presumably, when you weren’t drinking malbec and were more likely to be drinking shiraz. Or, pre-sauvignon blanc, when you used automatically to reach for a bottle of chablis instead (mind you, it’s hard to remember a time when sauvignon blanc didn’t dominate our white wine drinking habits). Things change, though, and that’s often driven by price. Picpoul, for instance, used to be a cheap option for those who loved crisp, dry whites – I love Ormarine picpoul, which we used to get for about €6 on holiday in the Languedoc, but nowadays that costs a tenner at Sainsbury’s (for a cut-price alternative, try the same store’s jurançon sec in today’s pick).</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/26/theres-more-to-supermarket-wine-than-sauvignon-blanc-and-malbec-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

It was his second time watching the show about the pioneering rock’n’roll singer, but it took on a new significance because Tina Turner had died only hours before Leitz’s flight from Germany was due to leave.</p><p>“I didn’t even know if I should go, whether it’s the right thing to do, whether it’s respectful,” he said. “But then I thought, it’s what she probably would have wanted. The show must go on.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/26/inspirational-tina-turner-fans-pay-tribute-outside-london-musical">Continue reading...</a>

<p>High court rules there is insufficient new evidence of causal link between hormone-based test and birth defects</p><p>An attempt by more than 100 UK families to seek compensation for birth defects they say were caused by the hormone-based pregnancy test <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2016/oct/13/primodos-was-a-revolutionary-oral-pregnancy-test-but-was-it-safe">Primodos</a> has been struck out by the high court.</p><p>The families, who believe their babies suffered a range of congenital abnormalities due to the drug, were hoping to rekindle a civil case against the manufacturer after a previous attempt collapsed in 1982. However, Mrs Justice Yip ruled that there was insufficient new evidence to demonstrate a causal link between the tests, which were used until the 1970s, and congenital malformations, and that as a result the families did not have a realistic chance of succeeding in their claim.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/26/uk-families-lose-bid-compensation-over-primodos-pregnancy-test-drug-birth-defects-high-court">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A ‘mind gym’ and a belief in young players’ potential have helped revitalise the Premiership finalists Sale – and northern rugby</p><p>Most people will tell you that winning is everything in a major final. There is scant room for background nuance on the scoreboard or in the record books. Occasionally, though, there is a rare exception and this year’s Premiership final is arguably one of them. “What we’ve built matters,” stresses Alex Sanderson, leaning against the outside wall of Sale Sharks’ training centre this week. “Plenty of people have given up a lot to make this special, important and lasting. That’s the key.”</p><p>The 43-year-old Sanderson is as competitive as anyone, if not more so. He is not remotely suggesting Sale are ambivalent about beating Saracens in what promises to be a full-throttle confrontation. But sometimes life really is as much about the journey as the destination. Sanderson’s Sharks are on a spiritual crusade that will not be solely defined by the result of their first Twickenham grand final in 17 years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/26/sales-alex-sanderson-people-have-given-up-a-lot-to-make-this-special">Continue reading...</a>

It’s like the show’s creators are trying to one-up William Golding</p><p>Jean-Paul Sartre claimed that hell is other people. Season two of Yellowjackets shows that being trapped with other people doesn’t just put you in hell – but plunges you ever deeper into its bowels.</p><p>The first season tortured its characters with blackly comic aplomb, but in its follow-up, things have become so spectacularly dire for our ensemble that it is hard to believe this ever felt like a playful respite from the frequently dour realm of prestige TV. And that is no criticism of the show. The conclusion has been utterly thrilling. It remains brilliantly written, wonderfully acted and continually surprising, but it has evolved. It no longer relies on a litany of juicy little mysteries and soapy twists, but takes its power from making the audience sit with the characters they’ve come to love and truly absorb what it is to lose all hope.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/26/move-over-lord-of-the-flies-how-tvs-yellowjackets-has-taken-survival-horror-to-new-heights">Continue reading...</a>

Describing relegation battles as a “great escape” seems cliched but it is an accurate representation in these circumstances – for whoever survives between Leicester and Reading, the achievement will be remarkable. The stakes could not be higher – Leicester travel to Brighton having to match Reading’s result; Reading must beat Chelsea and hope the Foxes falter.</p><p>That Leicester are in a position to stay up is one of the stories of this season. They looked down and out by the winter break, seven points adrift after seven defeats and a managerial shake-up. “We want to be history makers,” their manager, Willie Kirk, said on Thursday. “No team has ever turned around a seven-point deficit at the bottom in WSL history.

## Burning Questions by Margaret Atwood audiobook review – reflections on a world in crisis

<p>Atwood ranges across topics from the global heating to The Handmaid’s Tale, with actors Ciarán Hinds and Ann Dowd among the narrators</p><p>Spanning nearly 20 years of writing, from 2004 onwards, Burning Questions is Margaret Atwood’s third book of essays and miscellaneous writing, all of which, she notes in the introduction, have been “tightly connected to their own time and place”. Why the title? “Possibly because the questions we’ve been faced with so far in the 21st century are more than urgent. Every age thinks that about its own crises, of course, but surely this era feels different. First, the planet. Is the world itself truly burning up? Is it we who’ve been setting fire to it? Can we put those fires out?”</p><p>Atwood is joined by a cast of narrators including the actor Ciarán Hinds, who reads Frozen in Time, Atwood’s introduction to the eponymous book by Owen Beattie and John Geiger about the doomed Franklin expedition of 1845. The Power author Naomi Alderman narrates How to Change the World?, which ponders the power of humans to determine the future of the planet. Meanwhile, the actor Ann Dowd reads Reflections on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-handmaids-tale">The Handmaid’s Tale</a>, about the genesis of Atwood’s most famous novel, recalling how it was “dissed” by some reviewers, including the writer Mary McCarthy. Atwood took it in her stride – mostly. “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, though it also sometimes makes you peevish.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/26/burning-questions-by-margaret-atwood-audiobook-review-reflections-on-a-world-in-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Bulgarian writer opens up about the political fears that informed his prize-winner Time Shelter, about ‘a Pandora’s box of weaponised nostalgia’</p><p>The idea for a novel involving a clinic of the past, where people with dementia are healed by immersion in the sights, sounds and smells of their youth, had been in Georgi Gospodinov’s head for more than a decade when 2016 rolled up. Then there was Brexit, which changed the landscape of a European Union to which his homeland, Bulgaria, had belonged since 2007. Then came Donald Trump. Gospodinov and his wife watched the US election results from a hotel room in Vienna and at 4am, when the winner was declared, his wife burst into tears. “She was crying for our daughter. We didn’t want this for her, and there was a sense of hopelessness, helplessness,” he says.</p><p>His whimsical story about a treatment for what he’d identified as a pandemic affecting ageing populations curdled into a dystopia. Time Shelter, which this week <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/23/international-booker-prize-first-bulgarian-winner-georgi-gospodinov-time-shelter-angela-rodel">won the International Booker prize</a> in a translation by Angela Rodel, is an almost spookily timely novel. It was published on the day that Bulgaria was shut down by a more urgent pandemic, Covid. Then came the threat to Europe of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “What I thought would happen tomorrow started happening right now, and the problem with dystopian novels in dystopian times is that they become documentaries,” he says with a laugh.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/26/georgi-gospodinov-interview-time-shelter-international-booker">Continue reading...</a>

It’s in a side wing of the reliably fabulous <a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/lonpr-st-pancras-renaissance-hotel-london/overview/">St Pancras Renaissance Hotel</a>, which I often tell visitors to London is the “big, gothic, Harry Potter-esque one that you really can’t help but notice because it’s so fantastic”.

<p>The young Monaco midfielder has taken an unconventional path in his career and could be on the move again this summer</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeEntwistle">Luke Entwistle</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>Youssouf Fofana is not the only player to have graduated from the concrete pitches<em> </em>of the Île-de-France to the France team, but few have followed such an unconventional path. The Monaco midfielder is the embodiment of the idea that maturity is not measured in years but in experience. When he joined Strasbourg at 18, he had already endured more setbacks than many players suffer in their entire careers.</p><p>“We are one of the countries that has the most access to pitches and it’s the first sport we can play together freely,” says Fofana as he attempts to explain why France develops so many young players. Riyad Mahrez, who grew up in the same region, articulated a similar argument a few years ago. “We always play outside,” said Mahrez. “When I go out in England, I never see people playing outside. Other countries don’t make players the same as France. In France, you can be outside because there are small football pitches everywhere.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/26/youssouf-fofana-pizza-delivery-world-cup-final-monaco-midfielder-premier-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plus, reflections on Martin Amis’s later years, and Jude Law’s disgusting new cologne</p><p>The death of Martin Amis at the weekend triggers a slew of coverage more affectionate than can be imagined for that of many other writers. In America, the obituaries are sober, respectful. In Britain, where the news is much bigger, the pitch is slightly different, not just fond but shocked – hard to imagine this country’s literary life without some kind of Amis at the helm – and also, to my eye, slightly stricken. For many years, Amis-baiting was a minor national pastime and it seemed to me on Monday that along with the sadness was a detectable unease, the sick feeling of: “Oh god we didn’t mean it and now it’s too late.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/26/digested-week-netflix-bans-password-sharing-but-im-close-to-bailing-anyway">Continue reading...</a>

To watch a game of football I was embarking on a 21,000-mile round trip to the UK and sacrificing a few thousand pounds – not to mention my environmental conscience. This wasn’t just any game, of course. This was the Checkatrade Trophy final between Coventry City and Oxford United.</p><p>The journey made sense, I reassured myself: Coventry’s last appearances at Wembley came in 1987 when I was four years old and not yet a supporter, and the club had spent recent seasons flirting with extinction. If I wanted to see the Sky Blues at Wembley, alongside my dad, this would be my only chance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/26/being-a-coventry-fan-used-to-mean-chaos-and-pain-now-its-time-to-celebrate">Continue reading...</a>

Now he promoting two films: Mending the Line, in which he plays a Vietnam vet who’s good at fly fishing, and Prisoner’s Daughter where as the title suggests, he’s a prisoner attempting to reconnect with his daughter (Kate Beckinsale).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/26/post-your-questions-for-brian-cox">Continue reading...</a>

I have a clear memory of looking at words on the page beneath the illustration of a flying car.<br /><br /><strong>My favourite book growing up<br /></strong>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by CS Lewis. I was in a room full of adults, bored, when I first noticed this book with an appealing title on a shelf and drew it out.

<p>Former Goldman Sachs chief economist and a former Treasury minister has criticised Labour’s economic plans </p><p>It has not been a great week for Boris Johnson. First, we learned that the police are investigating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/23/boris-johnson-referred-to-police-over-allegedly-hosting-friends-at-chequers-in-lockdown">fresh allegations </a>that he broke lockdown rules when he was PM.

In litigation, falling out with your own solicitor is not generally a good development.</p><p>Johnson was prepared on Thursday to release a photograph of one of the visits on June 14, 2020, when he met his elderly mother and sister for lunch in the Downing Street garden. At the time outdoor meetings in groups of six or fewer were permitted and Johnson believed that the image exonerated him as there were five people in the garden.</p><p>Social distancing guidance stated that people from different households should stay more than two metres apart. The Times has been told that Johnson, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-i-lost-weight-the-french-way-k0xn3tgf7">his sister Rachel</a>, his late mother Charlotte and his son, Wilfred, are close to one another in the picture. Rachel is holding the baby and Charlotte is holding the baby’s foot.</p><p>We are aware of a briefing campaign that is trying to deliberately manufacture false claims about events at Chequers and Downing Street. This is being run by former advisers who are now willing to say anything about Boris in an attempt to discredit him, even if it is a total lie. These individuals should watch themselves carefully as there are revelations about their own conduct to be made.</p><p>Yes, because in the end, inflation is a source of instability.</p><p>And if we want to have prosperity, to grow the economy, to reduce the risk of recession, we have to support the Bank of England in the difficult decisions that they take.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/may/26/labour-economic-growth-g7-jeremy-hunt-inflation-recession-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A collegiate summer league team from Georgia has become a TikTok sensation by leaning into fast-paced entertainment and leaving baseball as you know it in the dust</p><p>If you like baseball and use social media, you’ve likely already encountered the Savannah Bananas. The team is something of a social-media darling, especially on TikTok – the Bananas’ <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thesavbananas?lang=en">more than 6m million followers</a> on the app significantly outnumber those of every franchise in Major League Baseball (as well as every team in the NFL, NBA and NHL).</p><p>The factors driving the Bananas’ online success are obvious. In-game clips of players <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@manny.rosario/video/7084978272844401962">swinging flaming baseball bats</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thesavbananas/video/7207608588838260011?lang=en">pitching from atop stilts</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thesavbananas/video/7233934605244534062?lang=en">performing choreographed dance routines</a> are tailor-made for social media. To reduce the team’s popularity solely to its viral antics, however, is dishonest. Even to this initially skeptical observer, the fun-loving atmosphere surrounding a Bananas game is inarguably infectious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/26/savannah-bananas-baseball-team-tiktok-banana-ball">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Try telling a cooped-up child they can’t go out due to global heating. Luckily, we can learn from our European neighbours</p><p>Like all children, I hated rainy days. What I didn’t realise until I had my own baby was how my parents probably hated them, too. Cooped up, whingeing babies can make cooped up, whingeing babies of their adult caregivers, too. “Get outside every day,” people tell you, but you find yourself and the child all wrapped up and ready to go and standing in a doorway watching the showers come down in biblical sheets. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/25/three-quarters-of-uk-children-spend-less-time-outdoors-than-prison-inmates-survey">2016 study</a> that found that British children spend less time outdoors than prison inmates started to make a little bit more sense.</p><p>I have sung a lot of Singin’ in the Rain this past winter, and then spring, but sometimes I’ve been crying on the inside. I don’t get <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/13/sad-seasonal-affective-disorder-depression-winter-britain-poor-mental-health">seasonal affective disorder</a>, but by April my spirits were starting to feel low. The weather feels personal now, in a way that it never did before, when I could hunker down with a book or a film or a glass of red wine and a record. Now stormy weather means trying to find endless entertainment for a baby who loves nothing more than being outside and watching the wind shake the leaves. It couldn’t have been more different than the spring we brought him into the world: our postpartum euphoria as we walked him through sunlit streets, long lunches of seafood pasta while he slept in the pram, pink blossom falling like snowflakes on the day we registered his birth. This year, it’s been so wet that he’s only just touched grass.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/26/british-parents-climate-chaos-great-outdoors-global-heating">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Stomp Down)</strong><br />This unruly young Texan star throws some unexpected and slightly undercooked ballads on to her debut album, making it an uneven ride</p><p>Monaleo broke out in 2021 with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnMPEfV0bSA">Beating Down Yo Block</a>, a bratty, booming track that turned an abusive relationship into an exhilarating kiss-off. A year later, the 21-year-old Texas rapper went TikTok-viral with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dop3CU4CXm4">We Not Humping</a>, which featured some sublimely emasculating bars: “Wake up, mister lick everywhere but the fuckin’ clit!” she teased.</p><p>Where the Flowers Don’t Die, Monaleo’s debut full-length, attempts to show off the multifaceted human behind those barbs, introducing earnest acoustic balladry amid more prickly fare. It’s a wildly uneven ride, inducing a song-to-song sense of whiplash – from Sober Mind, a solemn piano ballad that interpolates Arctic Monkeys’ Do I Wanna Know?, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN9g615WF2k">Ass Kickin’</a>, which opens with Monaleo repeatedly yelling “Come here, bitch!

<p>Wind and rain bring island to a standstill but eye replacement cycle fortuitously weakens it temporarily</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/26/typhoon-mawar-tears-through-guam-leaving-most-of-island-without-power">Typhoon Mawar </a>whipped up a storm in western Micronesia as the category 4 storm came close to landfall on the island of Guam. Starting out as a tropical depression over the weekend, Mawar rapidly deepened and intensified over the following couple of days, almost reaching category 5 by Tuesday evening. Wind gusts peaked at 155mph (250km/h), briefly making Mawar a super typhoon about 100 miles south-east of the US island territory.</p><p>In a stroke of luck an eyewall replacement cycle occurred overnight, hours before the then super typhoon was due to reach Guam. The cycle involves the slight degradation of the storm’s structure as a new eye develops around the old eye. Consequentially, the storm’s intensity weakened temporarily while simultaneously spreading strong winds over a larger area. Mawar’s winds dropped to a sustained speed of 140mph as the typhoon brushed the northern edge of Guam at about 7am local time (2200 BST) Had Mawar made landfall, it would have been the first category 4 typhoon to do so since Typhoon Pamela in 1976.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/26/weather-tracker-typhoon-mawar-narrowly-avoids-landfall-hits-guam">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A science fiction story from the 50s propels this brilliantly digressive exploration into art, ecology and the psychology of conspiracy theories</p><p>In the future, Earth has won a gruelling war against an extraterrestrial civilisation. As a monument to human resilience and his own awesomeness, an egotistical billionaire plans to build an enormous residential tower out of a unique kind of rock mined from the alien homeworld. The rock is black and gives off a curious warmth. But what if it is also alive?</p><p>So goes the story of The Tower, the central chapter of Nina Allan’s brilliantly ludic novel, which is presented as an extract of a novel of the same name, written by a fictional and near-forgotten novelist of the mid-20th century. The main line of Conquest, though, happens in the present, where a group of online conspiracy theorists take The Tower to be an accurate prophecy of an actual forthcoming war among the stars. This is, of course, known to terrestrial governments, who have a secret supersoldier programme and are probably whacking people who find out too much.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/26/conquest-by-nina-allan-review-alien-invasion-coding-and-bach">Continue reading...</a>

People who might accept any number of social and political changes can respond with fury if you propose our diets should shift. Stranger still, there’s a gulf between ultraconservative beliefs about how we should eat and the behaviour of people who hold such beliefs.

<p>From trans lives to celebrations of drag, queer film pulled no punches as it hit screens in the 90s with a DIY bravura that transformed the movie industry</p><p>Queer film exploded like a glitter cannon in the 1990s, sending sparkling product raining down in every direction.

Benefiting from a surge in the fortunes of independent cinema, and a defined focus for anger brought about by Aids activism, queer film was a commercial force for the first time.</p><p>The decade can in one sense be reduced to a tale of two kisses.

Despite Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas in Philadelphia playing lovers in a long-term relationship, their public displays of affection are restricted to a single slow dance at a party. Compare this to <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/features/dakan-mohamed-camara">Dakan (Destiny)</a>, a raw love story between male high-school friends, which was shot four years later in the west African country of Guinea. In the opening scene, two young men are making out in a convertible. There is no coy buildup or timid flirtation: these lovers are already snogging with a ferocity that makes the face-huggers from Alien look diffident.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/26/older-straight-men-hated-my-films-with-a-vengeance-how-90s-queer-film-makers-shook-up-cinema">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Top Manta, a mostly migrant cooperative, is the inspiration for Catalonia and the Balearics’ entry to the architecture arm of the prestigious festival. We enjoyed a preview</p><p>They are a familiar sight on the streets and sandy beach of Barcelona: vendors, blankets spread out in front of them, selling trinkets or toys to frequently disinterested passers-by. Now Catalonia and the Balearic Islands have chosen Top Manta, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/09/barcelona-street-sellers-take-on-nike-with-top-manta-own-brand-trainers">Barcelona-based cooperative</a> representing the mostly migrant, undocumented sellers, as inspiration for its entry to the Venice Biennale on architecture, which opened last weekend.</p><p>Top Manta is named after the vendors (<em>manteros</em>) who spread their wares on a blanket (<em>manta</em>). “It was established in 2015 after a period of intense police repression to support people who, because of the law, can’t find a place to live or open a bank account and are forced to live in the street,” says Lamine Sarr, a manteros spokesperson who, like many Top Manta members, is from Senegal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/26/migrant-street-vendors-of-barcelona-tell-story-of-survival-at-venice-biennale">Continue reading...</a>

## Poker Face review – Natasha Lyonne is more mesmerising than ever in this superfun detective show

<p>Knives Out director Rian Johnson’s celeb-packed homage to murder-mystery shows like Columbo is a pleasingly retro romp. And it may be its star’s most captivating TV performance</p><p>Poker Face is a modern homage to the classic murder-mystery-of-the-week shows which filled those parts of 1970s and 80s television schedules that hadn’t been colonised by soaps about oil tycoons and shoulder-pads. It’s created by Knives Out director Rian Johnson and the gravel-throated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/21/natasha-lyonne-theres-a-fighter-in-me-orange-is-the-new-black-netflix">Natasha Lyonne</a>, of Orange Is the New Black and Russian Doll fame, stars as the infallible sleuth Charlie, who remains unfazed by the number and regularity of the killings that happen around her. Think of it as Murder, She Rasped.</p><p>The main change to the traditional format is that our heroine has an almost preternatural ability to read a person’s body language and deduce whether they are lying or telling the truth. On second thoughts, perhaps you should think of it as Columbo meets The Mentalist, if anyone remembers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/mar/05/tv-detectives-patrick-jane">The Mentalist</a> these days. Anyway, Charlie’s gift is just strong enough to pique her curiosity in any given scenario and help her along the way to solving crimes, but not strong enough for her to do so until at least 45 minutes and sometimes as many as 52 have elapsed and given the weekly guest star reason enough to turn up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/26/poker-face-review-natasha-lyonne-sky-max">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scientists believe Ulva can become a staple crop via undersea farming – once people acquire a taste for it</p><p>Extreme weather events have been reducing crop yields across the world and many European countries that import a lot of their food could soon face a crisis. Politicians barely seem bothered about this but thankfully scientists think they have found a solution – undersea farming. This is not for fish but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/19/sea-farmed-supercrop-how-seaweed-could-transform-the-way-we-live">seaweed</a>, which they call seawheat.</p><p>People have been eating seaweed for thousands of years but the scientists believe mass production of a species called Ulva, as a staple crop, will be necessary to keep Europe from food shortages. They realise that shifting people from eating wheat to seaweed is not just a technical question of the best way to mass production, but is a major cultural shift, and so have called in chefs to create recipes for salads, stir-fries and soups. They are tempting consumers with a green seaweed that has a “mild, slightly salty flavour with a nutty aftertaste”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/may/26/seaweed-could-avert-food-crisis-extreme-weather">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Politics used to be about targeting small swing groups, but finally Labour is thinking big and expanding the electorate</p><p>In a democracy, who is allowed to vote – and why – are basic but always interesting questions. Especially in a democracy as old and bodged-about as Britain, with its centuries of alterations to the electorate and yet its tendency to see each new set of arrangements as somehow natural, eternal and wise.</p><p>Beneath the self-congratulation and claims of political neutrality, however, the shape of the electorate is always the product of power struggles, which are no less intense for often being hidden from sight. How adult, or how British, you need to be to have a say in how the country is governed: these are contested issues in an ever more fluid world.</p><p>Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/26/keir-starmer-young-people-vote-tory-wins-elections">Continue reading...</a>

<p>GB News launched in 2021 with a mission to disrupt the relatively safe and sedate world of rolling TV news. Heather Stewart spent a week watching the channel to see what it has become today</p><p>When GB News launched in 2021 it planned to represent what it considered to be the country at large; one that had upended British politics by voting to leave the EU and then installing Boris Johnson as prime minister. Andrew Neil, the former BBC interviewer, was given a prominent role and the channel aimed to disrupt the more staid world of TV news.</p><p>As the Guardian’s special correspondent <strong>Heather Stewart </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>much has changed in the last two years. Neil has long since departed – along with many more of its most experienced broadcasters. In their place are hosts such as Nigel Farage and a slate of presenters who dabble in ‘anti-woke’ outrage as well as outright conspiracy theories. It makes for stark and sometimes dark viewing. Two years on, it is still making a loss and seldom breaking its own stories. But is it influencing the political landscape – and how long could it last?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/audio/2023/may/26/conspiracy-theories-chaos-a-week-watching-gb-news-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

North Korea has undertaken a series of missile and weapons tests in recent months, most recently a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
