It\u2019s a movie bustling and teeming with life, with characters fighting, singing, thieving and breaking the fourth wall to address us directly. As with her previous film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/03/happy-as-lazzaro-review-alice-rohrwacher-adriano-tardiolo-nicoletta-braschi\">Happy As Lazzaro</a>, Rohrwacher homes in on a poignant sense of Italy as a treasure house of past glories, a necropolitan culture of ancient excellence. It can be plundered for the present day artefacts and spirits raised from the dead, but at the cost of incurring a terrible sadness: a feeling of surrounding yourself with ghosts.</p><p>The setting is Riparbella in Tuscany in the 1980s, and Josh O\u2019Connor is tremendous as Arthur, a dishevelled Englishman in a grubby white suit sporting six-day stubble and a perennial cigarette. He is a former archeological scholar who has assumed the morose, slouching gait and coiled style of a gangster. When we first see him, he has just been released from an Italian prison. In the course of what were once his entirely respectable studies in this region, he befriended a local, ageing aristocrat in her vast, crumbling house (a lovely performance from Isabella Rossellini) and fell in love with her daughter Beniamina. But Beniamina is gone \u2013 dead, we understand \u2013 and Arthur\u2019s agonised longing for her, his need to be reunited with her in the spirit world, has fused with his expertise into a criminal superpower. Using a dowsing rod, Arthur can tell where invaluable Etruscan antiquities are buried and has teamed up with a bizarre homeless gang of grave-robbers to dig them out under cover of darkness. They then sell them for a fraction of their worth to a shady dealer called Spartaco who can counterfeit the spurious provenance documents claiming that this loot is part of some prewar Italian family estates, with which they can be legally sold on for a fortune to foreign buyers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/26/la-chimera-review-alice-rohrwacher-cannes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/26/la-chimera-review-alice-rohrwacher-cannes", "date_published": "2023-05-26 15:40:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Dan Evans says British tennis \u2018papering over cracks\u2019 since Raducanu glory", "description": "<ul><li>\u2018They\u2019ve been lucky they had a grand slam champion\u2019</li><li>He criticises LTA\u2019s scholarship programme and funding</li></ul><p>Dan Evans has suggested that the success of Emma Raducanu has papered over the cracks in British tennis as an alarmingly low number of players are present in the French Open main draw this year.</p><p>Only three British players will compete in singles at Roland Garros and the absence of Raducanu, who is recovering from surgical procedures to her hands and an ankle, means there are no British women in the main draw of a grand slam singles tournament for the first time since 2009.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/26/british-tennis-papering-over-the-cracks-since-raducanu-win-says-dan-evans\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/26/british-tennis-papering-over-the-cracks-since-raducanu-win-says-dan-evans", "date_published": "2023-05-26 15:37:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Jockey Club granted injunction against Animal Rising to stop Derby disruption", "description": "<ul><li>High court ruling prevents protestors entering the track</li><li>Grand National delayed 15 minutes by course invasion</li></ul><p>The Jockey Club, the owner of Epsom racecourse, has been granted an injunction which aims to prevent disruption of the Derby at the track on 3 June by protesters from the group Animal Rising, some of whose members caused a 15-minute delay to the start of last month\u2019s Grand National at Aintree.</p><p>Sir Anthony Mann, who heard the Jockey Club\u2019s application at the high court in London on Friday, said as he granted the injunction that he had heard \u201cclear evidence of potential deliberate disruption to the race meeting\u201d by members of Animal Rising, including \u201cannouncements of the intention to cause disruption\u201d on the group\u2019s website.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/26/jockey-club-granted-injunction-against-animal-rising-protesters-at-derby-horse-racing-talking-horses\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/26/jockey-club-granted-injunction-against-animal-rising-protesters-at-derby-horse-racing-talking-horses", "date_published": "2023-05-26 15:34:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Tell us: has your UK energy supplier back-billed you by more than 12 months?", "description": "<p>We\u2019re keen to hear from people being back-billed by UK energy companies for energy used more than 12 months previously and what you have done about it</p><p>We\u2019re interested in hearing from people whose energy supplier has back-billed them for energy used more than 12 months before the date of the bill.</p><p>Ofgem rules state: \u201cYou can\u2019t be charged for gas or electricity used more than 12 months ago if you have not been correctly billed for it, or informed about it via a statement of account, before.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/26/tell-us-has-your-uk-energy-supplier-back-billed-you-by-more-than-12-months\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/26/tell-us-has-your-uk-energy-supplier-back-billed-you-by-more-than-12-months", "date_published": "2023-05-26 15:33:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Football Daily | Frank Lampard, Emma Hayes and a tale of two Chelseas", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2022/nov/14/football-daily-email-sign-up\">Sign up now!
