In today's Entertainment Fix:
Just when we thought John Wick: Chapter 4 signalled the end of the franchise, Lionsgate has put into development a fifth movie. Along with it is a AAA game, more spinoff movies, and the upcoming TV series. Looks like we may have more of our favorite assassin in the future. In other TV news, The CW's Arrowverse has ended with this week's The Flash series finale, but what of Arrowverse-adjacent shows like Superman and Lois? And finally, Netflix's password crackdown drew a few good jabs from the internet, especially one from competitor Prime Video from Amazon.

Another entry in the long tale of Microsoft trying to buy Activision Blizzard has been written, as the European Commission has explained why they approved of the acquisition. And finally, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is getting absolutely roasted by the gaming community, as the developers are apologizing for it. It's your Daily Fix.

George is the latest recruit to The Lazarus Project – a secret organization that has harnessed the ability to turn back time whenever the world is at the threat of extinction. George and his colleagues are the few people on Earth with the ability to remember the events that are undone when time goes back. But when a freak accident harms someone close to George, Lazarus won’t let him turn back time to undo it unless there is the threat of global extinction.  Now George must choose to stay loyal or go rogue as he faces the question: if you had the power to re-write your past, what would you sacrifice to do it?
