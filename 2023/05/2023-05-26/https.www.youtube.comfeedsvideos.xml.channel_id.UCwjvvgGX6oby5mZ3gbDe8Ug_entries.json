However, he is a strong personality and won\u2019t back down, so he strongly supports Xiong'an. However, Xi's hard-line approach isn't enough to silence the opposition. On the contrary, the lack of a corrective mechanism is turning the Xiongan New Area into a vortex: the more investment, the less likely it will stop; and when it doesn't stop, more investment is needed. China's economy is in turmoil and its finances are getting tighter. The Xiongan New Area has become a bottomless pit, which will be more and more politically damaging to Xi. \n\nHave questions?
