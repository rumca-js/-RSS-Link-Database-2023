  <p id="bOe6Un">Google has finally started to roll out the beta of Magic Compose, its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23718088/google-android-14-ai-wallpaper-messages-magic-compose-io">new Messages feature that uses AI</a> to help you write text messages. However, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/magic-compose-google-messages-beta-supercharge-conversations/">as pointed out by <em>Android Police</em></a>, the feature comes with a pretty big caveat: it will send up to “20 previous messages” to Google’s servers to generate suggestions — even if you’re using RCS with end-to-end encryption (E2EE).</p>
<p id="kKScxZ">Google outlines these conditions on its <a href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/13632636">Magic Compose support page</a>, noting that it will send these messages, along with any included emoji, reactions, and URLs, to its servers to help its AI craft an appropriate response.

  <p id="b46vcm">Google has been ordered to pay Sonos $32.5 million for infringing on the company’s smart speaker patent. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23826599-google-sonos-trial-verdict?responsive=1&amp;title=1">jury verdict</a> issued in a San Francisco courtroom on Friday found that Google’s smart speakers and media players infringed on one of two Sonos patents at issue.</p>
<p id="keHPBL"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055048/sonos-google-lawsuit-sues-speakers-assistant-amazon">The legal battle started in 2020</a> when Sonos accused Google of copying its patented multiroom audio technology after the companies partnered in 2013. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871121/sonos-google-patent-itc-ruling-decision-import-ban">Sonos went on to win its case at the US International Trade Commission</a>, resulting in a limited import ban on some of the Google devices in question. Google has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871304/google-home-speaker-group-volume-control-changes-sonos-patent-decision">had to pull some features</a> from its lineup of smart speakers and smart displays.</p>

<p id="8uW2zW">In practice, the custom feeds work <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23734263/twitter-search-lists-follow-new">a lot like Twitter lists</a>. Similar to those, you can pin specific custom feeds, and they’ll show up at the top of your timeline as different tabs to pick from. You can pick which feeds to pin from a new “My Feeds” menu in the app’s sidebar. By default, that tab has feeds for “What’s Hot” (“Top trending content from the whole network”), “What’s Hot Classic” (“The original What’s Hot experience”), “Bluesky Team” (“Posts from members of...</p>

The song, “You’re Losing Me,” would only appear on physical copies of the album for sale at the concerts at MetLife Stadium.</p>

  <p id="3HCVVY">For the first time ever, an all-electric vehicle — specifically the Tesla Model Y — is now the world’s bestselling car. According to analyst data from Jato Dynamics (<a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/669135/tesla-model-y-worlds-best-selling-car-q1-2023/">published by <em>Motor1</em></a>), the Tesla Model Y has surpassed Toyota’s RAV4 and Corolla models to top global sales rankings in the first quarter of 2023. That’s especially impressive given pricing for the 2023 Model Y starts at $47,490, considerably more than the 2023 Corolla ($21,550) and RAV4 ($27,575).</p>
<p id="xbLsaQ">The figures reported by Jato Dynamics reveal that the Tesla Model Y sold 267,200 units globally in Q1, compared to the 256,400 Corolla and 214,700 RAV4 units sold during the same period. That’s approximately a 69 percent year-on-year increase for the Model Y — a figure that Tesla’s...</p>

  <p id="OrkzsO">Honestly, I’m as confused as anyone about how a holiday that was initially about honoring fallen soldiers has come to be associated with deals on big-ticket items.

  <p id="iqsKdJ">Netflix is betting that a password-sharing crackdown will reverse its dwindling revenue and wavering subscriber count. The company has historically never enforced its policy of one account per household. Now, by making members pay to share their subscriptions with people who live in other homes, Netflix will cash in on all those users they’ve been missing out on for all these years, right?</p>
<p id="rjXpi6">Well, it might not be that simple.</p>
<p id="D6DvNr">Netflix — where <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2016/q3/NFLX-USQ_Transcript_2016-10-17.pdf">co-founder and now-former CEO Reed Hastings once said</a> “password sharing is something you have to learn to live with” — told investors last year that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23032399/netflix-lost-subscribers-q1-2022-earnings">password sharing</a> contributed to the streamer’s first loss in subscribers in over a decade.

  <p id="1mjH1z">Filming for <em>Thunderbolts</em>, the upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe film centered around the franchise’s anti-heroes, has been delayed due to the ongoing writers strike, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/marvel-delays-thunderbolts-filming-amid-writers-strike-1235501482/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/marvel-thunderbolts-writers-strike-1235380504/"><em>Deadline</em></a> report. Production had been due to start in the coming weeks in Atlanta, but now isn’t expected to commence until after the strike ends. </p>
<p id="zVGeci"><em>Thunderbolts</em> is just the latest production impacted by the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike.

The new version is described as a “re-imagining” of the initial trilogy, which kicked off with the seminal survival horror original in 1992. It’s being developed by Pieces Interactive and published by THQ Nordic and stars David Harbour and Jodie Comer — you can get a feel for the creepy action in the spotlight video, which features plenty of gameplay footage, above.</p>
