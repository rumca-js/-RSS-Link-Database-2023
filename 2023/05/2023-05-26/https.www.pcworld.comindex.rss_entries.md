<p>Microsoft may have sent Windows XP off into the great unknown in 2014, but the operating system never fully went dark. Never mind that yet two more versions of Windows have been put to rest since XP&rsquo;s final days. Against the advice of just about everyone, the efforts to keep XP usable have continued on&mdash;as evidenced by recent news about a crack that enables offline validation of Windows XP product keys.</p>



<p>Previously, getting Windows XP to activate required circumventing Microsoft&rsquo;s validation process or using a third-party server to fool XP. But as documented by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://tinyapps.org/blog/202304230700_xp_wpa.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1933367-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">tinyapps</a>, a blog dedicated to floppy-drive-sized Windows programs, a new validation technique came to light last year. An app shared in a thread on the Windows XP subreddit not only performs Microsoft&rsquo;s official activation process, but does so offline. Users can run the app freely, and afterward, they can reset the PC as much as they like without having to revalidate their copy of XP, too.</p>



<p>But as noted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/windows_xp_activation_cracked&amp;xcust=2-1-1933367-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Register</a> (which first spotted this news), virtually no one should be running Windows XP these days. While this crack is a lifeline for folks stuck supporting ancient software that only runs on an equally decrepit operating system, everyone else should be on a supported version of Windows (i.e., Windows 10 or 11). In its heyday, Windows XP had plenty of security issues&mdash;and now that it&rsquo;s ostensibly in the grave, it&rsquo;s even more vulnerable to today&rsquo;s online threats.</p>



<p>That won&rsquo;t stop the still-lingering resistance against migration, of course. But for the overwhelming majority of Windows users, you&rsquo;re much better off leaving the past where it lies. If you must indulge nostalgia, you&rsquo;re best off doing so briefly <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1915961/how-to-upgrade-from-windows-11-home-to-pro.html">within a virtual machine</a>&mdash;or just gawking at this news and then moving on.</p>

## Love building weird vehicles in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Go play Besiege

<p>If you have a Nintendo Switch, you&rsquo;ve probably been spending every spare moment of the last week playing <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>. (You might be playing it even if you don&rsquo;t have one, <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJXpcra0E24&amp;xcust=2-3-1931250-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ahem</a></em>.) There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff to love in the game, from its tall-and-deep open world to its experimental weapon fusing system. But if what you really love is using the Ultrahand to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XE9eLfG6yg&amp;xcust=2-3-1931250-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">make a bunch of weird LEGO-like vehicles</a>, there&rsquo;s another game you need to check out. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s called <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/346010/Besiege/&amp;xcust=2-3-1931250-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Besiege</a></em>, and I&rsquo;m willing to bet the mechanics of this little indie game inspired at least some of <em>Zelda&rsquo;s </em>Ultrahand functionality &mdash; that, and the way <em>Breath of the Wild</em> players <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGZElRJtyCo&amp;xcust=2-3-1931250-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">made some of their own hacked-together vehicles</a> to exploit the game&rsquo;s physics engine. <em>Besiege </em>was fully released in 2020, but it was available in early access for years before that. And its modular gadget-making action will look familiar to anyone who&rsquo;s spent hours sticking wheels and fans on carts in Hyrule. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><em>Besiege </em>is, at its heart, a physics puzzle game. You start each level with a limited number of parts, a little papercraft medieval diorama, and a specific target that needs to be destroyed. Stick the parts together in LEGO style, control your kooky siege engine, and get it done &mdash; in whatever order or fashion you think is appropriate. You might build a simple cart with a ram on the end, or an elaborate Da Vinci flying machine with a flamethrower. You might just stick a bomb to a wheel, whatever works. Your gadget doesn&rsquo;t need to finish the run in one piece, so long as you accomplish your goal. </p>



<p>The game starts out simple and builds on its open-ended mechanics quickly. Once you discover that you can bind different moving parts to different keys, setting up customizable weapons and movement functions, the possibilities become almost endless. They&rsquo;re <em>literally </em>endless if you disable the limitations on the stages (which is an option, but won&rsquo;t let you progress in the campaign) or go into the free build mode. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Besiege building gif" class="wp-image-1931480" height="338" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-c650c70ef5.gif" width="600" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Spiderling Studios</p></div>



<p>Setting up spinning, whirling carts of medieval death is great fun. It&rsquo;s got that oh-so-satisfying feeling of pushing over your sibling&rsquo;s block tower and running away before they can tell your parents. But what&rsquo;s truly amazing about <em>Besiege </em>is the way it enables shockingly complex builds with a collection of relatively simple 3D tools. The modular block design is so flexible that the options for completing any specific task are nearly infinite. Can&rsquo;t get over some terrain? You could lift your cart up and add shock absorbers to the wheels, or put some balloons on it to make it float, or stick some mines on the front and make the thing flip over the obstacle in a windmill of flaming splinters. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><em>Besiege&rsquo;s </em>long development time and healthy fan community has given it a lot of extra value. In addition to the main campaign of more than 50 structured levels, the game now has multiplayer co-op, player-versus-player where you can pit your tanks and flying machines against one another, a sandbox mode and a level editor, and integration with Steam Workshop for easy mod support. If you&rsquo;re willing to spend a few hours making your dream machine &mdash; or a few minutes importing someone else&rsquo;s &mdash; it&rsquo;s amazing what you can do with just a few tools. The developers aren&rsquo;t resting on their laurels, either: Despite being &ldquo;finished&rdquo; three years ago, they just released new building blocks with the latest bug fixes last month. </p>



<p><em>Besiege </em>is a fantastic little game at $15. But if you hurry you can <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/346010/Besiege/&amp;xcust=2-3-1931250-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">get it on sale for six bucks on Steam</a>. Grab it now, for when you&rsquo;re finally finished with <em>Zelda </em>sometime in the next decade. It&rsquo;ll be worth the wait.

<p>eMeet&rsquo;s SmartCam C960 is the most popular webcam on Amazon at press time, and for good reason&mdash;it&rsquo;s been around since the early days of the pandemic, meaning that it was one of the few choices during the peak work-from-home era. Don&rsquo;t rely on just that, however. The C960 has received a small refresh along with a small price cut, adding some features to keep up with its rivals.</p>



<p>The 1080p Smartcam C960 used to be a 30Hz webcam that shipped with a small tripod. The upgraded model now offers a &ldquo;stickum&rdquo; DIY privacy shutter, which it lacked before. (There&rsquo;s still a threaded hole in the base for mounting it on a tripod option, though the tripod ships with a slightly different <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/EMEET-C960-2K-Microphone-Noise-Reduction/dp/B0BQYP4H8Z&amp;ascsubtag=2-1-1926085-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">eMeet model</a>.)</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong>&nbsp;See our roundup of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html">best webcams</a>&nbsp;for our recommendations, buying advice, and more.</p></blockquote>



<p>Otherwise, the basics remain the same. The eMeet Smartcam is a 1080p webcam that plugs into your PC with a USB-A cord that&rsquo;s about four feet long. The webcam offers a wide-angle, 90-degree field of view, probably too wide for most one-on-one video calls. It&rsquo;s a fixed-focus camera, with a focal length of between 11.8 to118.1 inches, according to the manufacturer&mdash;that&rsquo;s just fine for virtually all scenarios. The webcam includes a pair of noise-cancelling mics, too.</p>



<p>The privacy shutter ships in a small baggie inside the box. You&rsquo;ll need to manually peel back the sticky tape, then affix the shutter so it flops down over the lens. This approach feels a little cheap, but it works. The entire webcam uses a &ldquo;jaws&rdquo; clamp to loosely hold onto a monitor or laptop display, and the entire webcam assembly can be pivoted up and down to adjust the view.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The eMeet SmartCam C960 is a solid budget webcam, especially at its lower price. Just be sure to be well lit and have a good microphone as backup.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>While the webcam is plug and play, you can download an associated eMeetLink app to adjust the white balance, contrast, and more. Many of these tweaks can be made in a videoconferencing app itself, so there&rsquo;s really no need to download it, otherwise. (Remember, too, that not every videoconferencing app supports 1080p&mdash;Google Meet finally added 1080p support in April, but it still defaults to 720p.)</p>



<h2 id="how-does-the-emeet-smartcam-c960-perform">How does the eMeet SmartCam C960 perform?</h2>



<p>We tested the webcam in both a dim home office environment as well as a more brightly-lit kitchen table. In each, we use the Windows Camera application (in video mode) to record the image, as we don&rsquo;t have to worry about image compression. It also provides a neutral light source&mdash;a big bright display can serve as a rich man&rsquo;s ring light! You may see grainier images when on video calls, though.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="eMeet C960 bad light" class="wp-image-1926082" height="653" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-125341.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The C960 does a pretty middling job in a dim office. We&rsquo;d recommend a ring light or a bright screen instead.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>In the office, the camera did a poor job of detecting the different colors of my sweatshirt and T-shirt, but did pretty well in picking up my face. The wide 90-degree FOV isn&rsquo;t of much use, though.</p>



<p>At my impromptu workspace at my dining table, the C960 does much better. The 60Hz refresh rate certainly makes a difference in capturing video, too.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="eMeet C960 good light" class="wp-image-1926081" height="699" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-22-130302.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The eMeet SMartCam C960 does a better job in better light, which here comes from the side.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The one weakness, typical of many webcams, is the microphone quality. It&rsquo;s average at best, and there&rsquo;s certainly an argument that your laptop may have better mics already built in. (To check, you can go to your videoconferencing app&rsquo;s Settings menu and switch back and forth.)</p>



<p>There are simply so many quality webcams available now, including budget models. Rest assured that there are better, more expensive webcams available. But as a solid budget pick, the eMeet SmartCam C960 is a smart choice as long as you have good lighting and perhaps an external mic. And if that&rsquo;s good enough, eMeet has another option: <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/EMEET-C960-2K-Microphone-Noise-Reduction/dp/B0BX94BJFR&amp;ascsubtag=2-1-1926085-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">a 2K webcam with autofocus</a> for about $10 more. </p>

## Nab this crazy fast Asus wireless gaming mouse for just $99

<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about competitive gaming, you&rsquo;ll probably need a super fast mouse in your arsenal of gaming peripherals. Fortunately for you, we&rsquo;ve got a sweet deal for you today. Amazon&rsquo;s selling the <a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14154&amp;GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSKX9V7C&amp;ascsubtag=2-1-1932956-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">Asus ROG Harpe Aim Lab Edition Gaming Mouse for $99</a>, which is a savings of $51 (make sure you add the $21 on-page coupon). This device has a maximum DPI of 36,000, which is positively wild. That means it&rsquo;s ultra-responsive, which is important when you&rsquo;re playing a first-person-shooter where every second matters. Let&rsquo;s dive into the other details then, shall we?</p>



<p>The Asus ROG features five programmable buttons, up to 90 hours of battery life, and a lightweight design. In fact, according to the manufacturer, the mouse weighs just 54 grams. It&rsquo;s the perfect size and weighs for gaming as well as daily tasks like checking e-mail and whatnot. One Amazon reviewer claims that the mouse makes aiming feel incredibly accurate. This is truly a killer deal, so you better jump on it now before it&rsquo;s gone. </p>

<p>The new Google AI search engine gets right to the point: You ask a question, it answers (albeit sometimes with inaccuracies). And you can do it without needing to scroll down past all the ads, promoted responses, and other cruft to see what matters. </p>



<p>It may seem like a pithy response, but that&rsquo;s the real benefit of the new Google Search, the AI edition, aka the Search Generative Experience (SGE). PCWorld was offered a chance to go hands-on with Google&rsquo;s new AI search experience, and we came away (mostly) impressed. It&rsquo;s a richer experience than what <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671133/chatgpt-vs-bing-vs-bard-whats-the-best-ai-chatbot.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing Chat offers</a>. </p>



<p>Google allows you to sign up for the SGE via its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://labs.google.com/search/install?source=smp.23q2USLabs.30&amp;xcust=2-3-1931953-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Search Labs</a>, accessible via the Chrome desktop browser, or Chrome for Android and iOS. You&rsquo;ll need to join a waitlist, the same way Microsoft offered a waitlist for Bing Chat.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google AI Search generative AI 6" class="wp-image-1931990" height="808" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-Search-6.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>How is the new Google search? Mostly for the better, though publishers should still worry about Google snatching even more eyeballs than than it already does. But Google (like Bing) makes a real effort to answer the question you pose to it immediately, but with more detail than what Bing offers and an invitation to follow up.</p>



<p>The best thing, though, is simply this: It gets right to the point. That&rsquo;s the way Google used to be, decades ago. Over time, though, the results to your query are competing with ads and sponsored results, cards, and all sort of middling-to-useless information that simply distracts from what you&rsquo;re searching for. Google&rsquo;s new AI search treats your question the way PCWorld treats its reviews: with a clean, direct presentation summarizing relevant information, such as pros, cons, prices and more.</p>



<h2 id="how-google-searchs-ai-handles-queries">How Google Search&rsquo;s AI handles queries</h2>



<p>Google subtly encourages you to &ldquo;ask&rdquo; a question and any follow-ups, but you don&rsquo;t have to: Search for simply &ldquo;Morocco&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll receive a Wikipedia-like series of four paragraphs or so explaining the key points. Ask a question (&ldquo;is Maui better than Oahu?&rdquo;) and you&rsquo;ll receive a similar response, but with the pros and cons of each. The latter are the next-level contextual questions content creators usually try to answer, because search historically can&rsquo;t. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google AI Search generative AI 2" class="wp-image-1931989" height="498" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-Search-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Google provides solid contextual information here, without being definitive.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>In both contexts, Google declines to footnote its information as Bing does, but includes two or three small &ldquo;cards&rdquo; to the right, inside the search response box. Like Bard, Google&rsquo;s formal AI chatbot, Google&rsquo;s AI search suggests a few follow-up questions. Underneath all this, if you can scroll down far enough, are the list of traditional links.</p>



<p>If you ask a shopping-related question (&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the best gaming laptop under $1,000?&rdquo;) Google provides several more cards, in a column hierarchy, with much more detailed information about the pros and cons of each. It looks very much like a traditional web site or even a magazine layout, and goes far beyond the competition in presenting rich, though bite-sized, information about each product. Click the card, and a sidebar pushes out from the side of the search box, with even more links and details.</p>



<p>Google&rsquo;s new AI search does seem to track follow-up queries. A disclaimer claims that it will store your query information for 24 hours, so that you don&rsquo;t have to constantly resubmit your questions.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google AI Search 7" class="wp-image-1931994" height="674" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-AI-search-7.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You can perform traditional searches for topics on Google&rsquo;s AI search. But it won&rsquo;t generate a search box for every result, like the top. In that case, Google Search represented a list of links&hellip;which disappeared after the next search was completed.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="is-googles-ai-search-accurate">Is Google&rsquo;s AI search accurate?</h2>



<p>Not entirely. Still, it&rsquo;s better than our earlier experiments with<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1817020/google-search-ai-bard-wrong-pixel-facts.html"> Bard, which flubbed a substantial number of the details</a> of Google&rsquo;s own Pixel Fold and Tablet.</p>



<p>Google doesn&rsquo;t really bother with the now-almost-traditional warnings that AI can generate imprecise results. Instead, its disclaimer is that &ldquo;Generative AI is experimental. Info quality may vary.&rdquo;</p>



<p>And it <em>does</em> vary. Remember that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1721988/ai-chatbots-arent-search-engines-google-bard-bing-chat.html">AI chatbots can&rsquo;t be trusted to give fully accurate answers</a>, no matter how confident the presentation seems.</p>



<p>To its credit, Google did a very good job in presenting the details of its own Pixel Tablet and Fold, when Bard couldn&rsquo;t. Factually, a quick check of its results seemed to match the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Google search. </p>



<p>But it was when Google&rsquo;s AI became &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; that it ran into trouble. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google AI Search generative AI 1" class="wp-image-1931987" height="751" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-Search-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>There&rsquo;s a lot of information that Google&rsquo;s generative AI search presents here, but not all of it is totally accurate.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>A case in point: &ldquo;When choosing a gaming laptop, you can consider things like [the] display: A 1366 x 768 resolution display is better for gaming than a 1080P display,&rdquo; it returned, when asked about gaming laptops under $1,000. We&rsquo;d disagree with that, and you probably would, too.</p>



<p>When asked to summarize the HP Victus 16-e1000 Series gaming laptops, Google&rsquo;s AI search replied: &ldquo;This laptop has a 16.1-inch screen, 8-64 GB of RAM, and a 256 GB-8.2 TB drive. It can handle most games at 30 FPS. However, it has a plastic build, a weak screen hinge, and a chintzy touchpad.&rdquo;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s a great summary, with a rich, concise mix of details. But according to HP, the Victus 16-e1000 includes 8-32GB of RAM and between 256GB and 1TB of storage, not 8.2TB. And yet, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/551295/hp-victus-16-review-this-budget-16-inch-gaming-laptop-delivers-solid-value.html">having reviewed an earlier Victus</a>, I&rsquo;d agree with the other points. </p>



<p>Again, I do like the fact that the new AI-powered Google search tries to answer the question. I still found myself wishing for the richness and the thoughtfulness of well, humans. In asking Google to compare Maui and Oahu, I found <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://thehawaiivacationguide.com/oahu-vs-maui/&amp;xcust=2-3-1931953-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">this response</a> to be more thoughtful, entertaining, and knowledgeable. Google specifically architected Google Search <em>not</em> to display personality, unlike Bing. Google also refuses to commit to picking one choice over another. Humans do. </p>



<h2 id="enjoy-it-while-you-can">Enjoy it while you can</h2>



<p>That will likely be the crux of the love/hate relationship with AI search&mdash;immediacy of answers versus personality and a human touch.</p>



<p>For publishers, the trouble is this: In a traditional search engine, you enter your query at the top of the page, and Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or whoever simply publishes a list of results. Add a new query, and you get a new list.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google AI Search generative AI 3" class="wp-image-1931992" height="787" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-Search-3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Google Search query with sponsored results all over. If nothing else, AI search forces Google to start over.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>With Google&rsquo;s new AI Search, all of the questions and Google&rsquo;s responses stack, so the page simply gets longer and longer&mdash;and any traditional text links that Google provided for earlier responses disappear. (The small &ldquo;card&rdquo; links remain.) Bing&rsquo;s search page (not Bing Chat, but actual Bing search) feels much friendlier to traditional publishers. Unless you&rsquo;re a merchant, Google&rsquo;s approach to the rest of the web feels much more arrogant and cursory.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve been around tech long enough, you know that companies bend over backwards during the first few weeks and months to ensure that nothing gets in the way of an optimal user experience. That&rsquo;s when they hook you. There will be a time, probably, when Google works through accuracy issues to present you with a coherent AI search experience.</p>



<p>Enjoy that time while you can. For now, Google&rsquo;s new AI Search is a decent, modern refresh of Google Search. But it&rsquo;s likely only a matter of time before this refresh becomes as cluttered with junk as &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Search.</p>

<p>Modern mechanical keyboards hold endless possibilities in design and function, yet one experience remains rare: the classic buckling spring keyboard. This key switch design was popularized by early IBM keyboards, such as the Model M and Model F, which are prized for their uniquely clicky tactile feel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter Model F Labs, a small company set up exclusively to produce buckling spring keyboards. The model I received, the counter-intuitively titled Model F Ultra Compact, retails for an intimidating $420. That&rsquo;s a high price to pay for a keyboard with few modern conveniences&mdash;but I&rsquo;m sold.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> For more keyboard recommendations see our roundups of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406235/best-gaming-keyboard.html">best gaming keyboards</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/414972/best-wireless-keyboards.html">best wireless keyboards</a>.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="whats-a-model-f-keyboard-grandpa">What&rsquo;s a Model F keyboard, grandpa?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>IBM&rsquo;s Model F is the original buckling spring keyboard launched in 1981 alongside early IBM PCs. It was standard issue for most IBM PCs through 1985, when the Model F was replaced by the more famous and affordable Model M (the Model F was still produced until 1994, however).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The distinction between the Model F and Model M is important, at least to enthusiasts. Though both are buckling spring keyboards, Model F keyboards don&rsquo;t have a membrane but instead rely on metal barrel plates. They&rsquo;re also absolute units: Most Model F keyboards have odd layouts or extra function keys. That&rsquo;s why the Model F Ultra Compact, which is based on the Model F 104, doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit its name. It&rsquo;s large by modern standards but small compared to many original Model F keyboards.</p>



<p>None of this matters if you&rsquo;re not a Model F enthusiast, but if you are, I think you&rsquo;ll still like what you see. The Model F Ultra Compact&rsquo;s layout offers the feel of a Model F but is condensed into a more modern arrangement. However, it&rsquo;s not a one-to-one reproduction of the original look, as this model lacks the swooping accent lines that border each side of the original Model F keyboard train.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Model F Ultra Compact keyboard" class="wp-image-1928364" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/model-f-keyboard-2023-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p><br />You can see how solid and sturdy the Model F Ultra Compact&rsquo;s construction is. It will last a lifetime!</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The Model F Ultra Compact subverted my expectations with improvements to the durability of the original design. Original Model F keyboards sold for hundreds of dollars in the early 1980s (adjusted for inflation, some carried an MSRP above $1,000) and were robust, using thick plastic casing over a metal backplate. Yet the new Model F Ultra Compact has them beat with a die-cast aluminum case and backplate that weighs in at roughly nine pounds. IBM&rsquo;s design was rugged, to be sure, but the plastic inevitably becomes brittle over time and is prone to discoloration, problems the new all-metal keyboard won&rsquo;t have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enthusiasts looking for a more accurate reproduction should turn their gaze towards<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.modelfkeyboards.com/product/classic-f104-model-f-keyboard/&amp;xcust=2-3-1928356-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"> the Classic Style Model F</a> or, if you want an even more obscure and classic layout, models like the F77 and F62. These more faithfully mimic the look and feel of original IBM keyboards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Model F can keep up when I blaze away at 100 words per minute but feels satisfying when I find myself slowly writing, deleting, and re-writing the same sentence a dozen times over.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="what-makes-the-model-fs-buckling-springs-so-special">What makes the Model F&rsquo;s buckling springs so special?</h2>



<p>The Model F Ultra Compact certainly looks like a retro keyboard, but that&rsquo;s not its most important trait. This keyboard lives or dies on the quality of the buckling spring switches underneath each key. Fortunately, they&rsquo;re excellent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Buckling spring key switches do what they say on the tin. A spring is beneath each key, as true of most modern mechanical keyboard switches, but the spring isn&rsquo;t placed on a stem but instead inside a barrel. The spring provides resistance when pressed but eventually buckles, providing firm tactile feedback with a distinctive click.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether this is better than modern tactile switches is a matter of opinion. Modern switches are more versatile, offering a variety of options for feedback, noise, and speed of actuation. When it comes to sheer typing enjoyment, however, the Model F&rsquo;s buckling spring feels more lively than modern mechanical switches. The difference is both felt and heard, as this reproduction Model F clicky-clacks like a horse trotting down a brick road.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Personally, I love it. The Model F feels engaging, enjoyable, and accurate. It can keep up when I blaze away at 100 words per minute but feels satisfying when I find myself slowly writing, deleting, and re-writing the same sentence a dozen times over. It&rsquo;s a typist&rsquo;s key switch.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Model F Ultra Compact arrow keys" class="wp-image-1928363" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/model-f-keyboard-2023-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Replacing the keys and springs on the Model F Ultra Compact is easy, with Model F Labs offering all the replacement parts.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<h2 id="how-is-the-model-f-ultra-compact-for-other-tasks">How is the Model F Ultra Compact for other tasks?</h2>



<p>The Model F&rsquo;s bucking spring feels less at home playing modern games, like <em>Counter-Strike</em>, or scrolling through a video timeline in Adobe Premiere. It requires a heavy force to activate and is relatively sluggish to return, so it&rsquo;s not great in any situation where a user rapidly, repeatedly activates a single key or flips between a few keys quickly. It also lacks the macro buttons or dials that can be found on some modern keyboards, useful add-ons that are handy for many photo and video editors as well as digital artists. The keyboard doesn&rsquo;t even have an LED backlight, so you&rsquo;ll either need to remember the keyboard&rsquo;s layout or keep a light on at night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Personally, I would never use this keyboard for all tasks&mdash;it&rsquo;s just not well suited to gaming. If I owned it, I&rsquo;d pair it with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406235/best-gaming-keyboard.html">a compact mechanical keyboard like the Keychron Q5</a>. Keyboard enthusiasts may view this as a positive. Finally, a real, tangible justification for not one but <em>two </em>expensive keyboards! For those who just want to get the job done, though, it&rsquo;s a bit much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Model F Labs&rsquo; website and service feels archaic, as well. Though expensive, the keyboard ships in unlabeled packaging with a receipt printed on an old-school dot matrix printer and a simple paper brochure. The keyboard may require setup, as keys may loosen in shipping (two popped off on mine). The manual says this is an unavoidable reality of the buckling spring mechanism, but doesn&rsquo;t jibe with the price tag. Model F Labs suggests users spend up to an hour familiarizing themselves with the keyboard to ensure all keys are operating correctly, which feels positively naive in a world where Twitter and TikTok exist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The suggestion is not without merit, though, as the keyboard is designed for ease of repair. Individual keycaps can be replaced at a moment&rsquo;s notice, and while a plastic spunger is preferable to ensure the keys aren&rsquo;t scuffed, any moderately wedge-shaped tool can be used to pop off the keys. The buckling spring mechanisms are replaceable, too, as is the entire case should you decide you&rsquo;d like a different color. Spare parts are available from Model F Labs with replacement spring mechanisms priced at a dollar each (the keyboard ships with two spares).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="is-the-model-f-ultra-compact-worth-it">Is the Model F Ultra Compact worth it?</h2>



<p>The Model F Ultra Compact&rsquo;s retail price of $420 is steep by modern standards. While some new mechanical keyboards are as expensive, they usually pair that with a huge swath of features and high degree of customization from the factory. The Model F Ultra Compact offers few options aside from the color of the case (currently available in gray, black, red, or blue) and lacks the media, macro, and special function keys found on similarly priced alternatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet I don&rsquo;t think the price is unreasonable. It&rsquo;s expensive, sure, but far more affordable than the original Model F keyboards were back in the mid-1980s. The reproduction is even more durable than the original, too&mdash;a refreshing reversal from most such recreations, which often cut corners to keep the price tolerable.</p>



<p>PC enthusiasts often ironically call hardware an &ldquo;investment&rdquo; knowing it will be obsolete in three to five years, but the Model F Ultra Compact is different. This keyboard could last decades. Nostalgic nerds shouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to splurge.&nbsp;</p>
