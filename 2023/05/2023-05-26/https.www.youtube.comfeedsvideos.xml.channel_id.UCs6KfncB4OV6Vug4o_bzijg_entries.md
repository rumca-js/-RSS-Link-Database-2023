Our first attempt with OpenAndroidInstaller - a wonderful idea to make Android flashing universal and easy! Check them out: https://openandroidinstaller.org/

Again people, it's a beta project that we did a live demo for - not knowing if it would work or not. The Pixel 6 & Nexus 6P aren't even on the supported devices list. (Though the FP4 is) We're just testing things out for fun right now to see what the potential is for a tool like this! We do NOT suggest using the tool in an unofficial way as we tried to!
