After initial excitement, Tam and Lucy question if that's a good idea. \n#gaming #metalgearsolid #gamespot \n\nThe PlayStation Showcase offered an early look at a variety of new games coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation VR, but the biggest reveal was undoubtedly a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. The title is one of the worst-kept secrets in the industry and, finally, it is out in the open. The immediate response, naturally, was excitement, particularly from the GameSpot team. But in the hours following, concerns began to arise.\n\nMetal Gear Solid is one of the biggest and most iconic video game franchises of all time and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is regarded as one of the greatest games of all time. But there is cynicism and skepticism around Konami's ability to do justice to the franchise and the game. On this week's episode of Spot On, Metal Gear Solid fans Lucy and Tamoor discuss why they're worried about the project, delving into some of the key questions that remain unanswered, and why they may be cause for concern. \n\nSpot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.  \n\nTimestamps:\n00:20 - Tam's history with Metal Gear Solid\n00:45 - Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake Announcement\n02:06 - Why you should be concerned\n03:42 - Konami and Kojima\n04:43 - Konami since Metal Gear Solid 5", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTXRjuPJA4", "date_published": "2023-05-26 20:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
