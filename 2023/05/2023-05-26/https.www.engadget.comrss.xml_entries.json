While there might never be a way to get rid of them entirely (though agencies are certainly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fcc-makes-its-first-rule-to-block-scam-robotexts-official-191006311.html\">working on it</a>), one the most prolific sources of these intrusions is finally getting hauled into court.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/robocalls-lawsuit-avid-telecom-nearly-every-us-state-sues/\"><em>CBS News</em></a> reports that Attorneys General from 48 states (as well as DC) are coming together to file a bipartisan lawsuit against Arizona-based Avid Telecom, its owner Michael D. Lansky and vice president Stacey S. Reeves. The <a href=\"https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Files/Briefing-Room/News-Releases/Consumer-Protection/Conformed-Complaint_Avid.aspx\">141-page suit</a> claims that the company illegally made over 7.5 billion calls to people on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-stop-spam-calls\">the National Do Not Call Registry</a>. Arizona Attorney General Kris Meyes claims that nearly 197 million robocalls were made to phone numbers in her state over a five-year period between December 2018 and January 2023.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The lawsuit says that Avid Telecom spoofed phone numbers, including 8.4 million that appeared to be coming from the government or law enforcement, and others disguised as originating from Amazon, DirecTV and many more. The suit alleges that Avid Telecom violated the Telephone and Consumer Act, the Telemarketing Sales Rule and several other telemarketing and consumer laws.&nbsp;</p><p>The AGs are asking the court to enjoin Avid Telecom from making illegal robocalls, and to pay damages and restitution to the people it called illegally. They're also pursuing several statutory avenues to make Avid cough of money on a per-violation basis, which given the enormous volume of calls it has made, could add up quickly. Sumco Panama, which was responsible for a comparatively smaller 5 billion robocalls, was fined nearly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/robocall-company-may-receive-the-largest-fine-ever-from-the-fcc-110759522.html\">$300 million</a> by the FCC late last year.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2023-05-12/robocall-company-behind-billions-of-illegal-calls-sued-by-ftc\">it was reported</a> that XCast Labs is being sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over allegedly helping other companies call those on the National Do Not Call Registry.</p><p>In 2017, Dish <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dish-network-settlement-idUSKBN28E2UH\">reached a settlement</a> that cost them $210 million. The company allegedly made millions of calls in an attempt to sell and promote its satellite TV service. Dish ultimately had to pay a $126 million civil fine to the US government, and $84 million to residents in California, Illinois, North Carolina and Ohio. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see a similar result with Avid Telecom.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/company-responsible-for-75-billion-robocalls-sued-by-nearly-every-attorney-general-220050450.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/company-responsible-for-75-billion-robocalls-sued-by-nearly-every-attorney-general-220050450.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-26 22:00:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google fined $32.5 million for infringing on Sonos patent", "description": "<p>Google has just been hit with a $32.5 million penalty for infringing on a patent held by Sonos. <a href=\"https://www.law360.com/technology/articles/1682102\">According to <em>Law360</em></a>, a California federal jury ordered the fine after determining that Google infringed on a patent Sonos holds relating to grouping speakers so they can play audio at the same time, something the company has been doing for years.&nbsp;</p><p>US District Judge William Alsup had already determined that early version of products like the Chromecast Audio and Google Home infringed on Sonos' patent; the question was whether more recent, revamped products were also infringing on the patent. The jury found in favor of Sonos, but decided a second patent \u2014 one that relates to controlling devices via a smartphone or other device \u2014 wasn't violated. They said that Sonos hadn't convincingly shown that the Google Home app infringed on that particular patent.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Still, it feels like a big win for Sonos, who originally filed suit against Google all the way <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-sonos-sues-google.html\">back in January of 2020</a>. Specifically, Sonos claimed that Google gained knowledge of the patent through prior collaboration between the two companies, back they collaborated to allow for integration between Sonos's speakers and Google Play Music.</p><p>Since then, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-countersues-sonos-patent-infringement-132548465.html\">Google counter-sued Sonos</a>, claiming that Sonos had in fact infringed its own patents around smart speakers. As with any good legal battle, Sonos then <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-sues-google-190303052.html\">expanded its own lawsuit</a> a few months later. More recently, Google <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-sues-sonos-over-seven-google-assistant-related-patents-091023307.html\">sued Sonos in 2022</a>, saying that its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-voice-control-music-assistant-170028950.html\">new voice assistant</a> infringed on seven patents relating to the Google Assistant.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether today's decision will slow the legal battle between the two companies remains to be seen, though we'd expect the bickering to continue full-throttle in the months to come. There are plenty of suits out there between the companies that aren't yet resolved, and we'd expect Google to appeal this decision as well. We've reached out to both Sonos and Google and will update this story with anything we hear.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-fined-325-million-for-infringing-on-sonos-patent-210411398.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-fined-325-million-for-infringing-on-sonos-patent-210411398.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-26 21:04:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Naughty Dog says its Last of Us multiplayer game needs more time in the oven", "description": "<p>One of the most notable omissions from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/watch-the-playstation-showcase-here-at-4pm-et-190006173.html\">this week's PlayStation Showcase</a> was anything from Naughty Dog.

That suggests the studio wasn't planning to release the title in 2023. In any case, it's probably a good thing that Naughty Dog is taking its time to get things right. The studio won't want to be in a position where it's releasing a game that definitely could have used more time in the oven, as was the case with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1662166716892479488\">the buggy debut of <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em> on PC</a>.</p><p>On a positive note, Naughty Dog says it has other games (plural) in development, \"including a brand new single-player experience.\" It's been known for a while that the studio had at least one other game in the works, but it's not clear whether this single-player title will continue the main story of The Last of Us.

The service, which is still in a closed beta, released its \u201ccustom feeds\u201d feature, which allows people to subscribe to a range of different algorithms and make their own for others to follow.</p><p>In practice, the feature works a bit like pinning different lists to your home timeline on Twitter in that users can subscribe to multiple feeds and easily swipe between them in the app. But custom feeds, because they\u2019re algorithmic, are also more powerful than simple account lists.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>For example, there\u2019s a feed dedicated to posts from your mutuals \u2014people you follow who also follow you back.

Jay Graber, CEO of Bluesky, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorseys-bluesky-is-building-a-marketplace-of-algorithms-184601024.html\"><ins>has said</ins></a> that algorithmic choice could address \u201cbacklash against the perceived algorithmic manipulation of people\u2019s timelines.\u201d It also offers a hint of what\u2019s to come for the early-stage platform.

The XM5s are the top pick in our guide to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html\">the best wireless headphones</a>, and we gave them a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html\">review score of 95</a> last year thanks to their powerful ANC, lightweight design, punchy sound and deep feature set.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to save a little extra cash, the XM5's predecessor, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LVdILTEwMDBYTTQtQ2FuY2VsaW5nLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMtcGhvbmUtY2FsbC9kcC9CMDg2M1RYR00zP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTA5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiYzE3MjdhMy03YjdkLTQ1ZTUtODg4NC00MmZmMjBiZmVlOWYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATf_rUTGqojyBl4KPYEvSuqVN-GU0Z1aoCpZoEnWIfZE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call%2Fdp%2FB0863TXGM3%3Fth%3D1\">WH-1000XM4</a>, is also worth a look at $278. Again, that's not the lowest these headphones ever been, but it's still $70 below their typical street price. This pair is slightly bulkier than the XM5, its sound is a bit boomier out of the box and it has a worse mic for phone calls. Its ANC, battery life and general feature set are similar, though, and it can fold up for easier storage. The XM5s also use an automatic ANC adjustment system, which some may prefer to avoid.

While the promotion includes a handful of decent price drops, its real value comes from the \"<a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/coupons/mega-sale\">Epic Coupon</a>,\" which takes 25 percent off most purchases of $14.99 or more. The offer applies whether you buy one or multiple games at a time and stacks on top of any existing discounts. This brings many games back around their best prices to date: <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/red-dead-redemption-2\"><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></a>, for instance, is already on sale for $20, but with the coupon it drops to an <a href=\"https://isthereanydeal.com/game/reddeadredemptionii/info/\">all-time low</a> of $15.</p><p>The coupon also works on games that aren't otherwise part of the sale, so you can take 25 percent off newer titles like <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/star-wars-jedi-survivor\"><em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dead-island-2\"><em>Dead Island 2</em></a>, which haven't received major discounts elsewhere. (The former's PC port has had <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-and-the-year-of-disappointing-pc-ports-141551209.html\">a rocky launch</a>, to put it mildly, though a few patches have helped stabilize it.) And because the coupon renews after each eligible purchase, you can use it continuously until the promotion ends on June 15. It won't work on pre-orders, though. If you prefer to get your PC games through Steam, meanwhile, note that Valve's Summer Sale <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/sales/history/\">will kick off</a> on June 29.</p><h2>Apple Gift Card</h2><p></p><p>If you pick up a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5e0bed65-d2f8-4b34-9b8f-955218c0e37a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Best+Buy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZTBiZWQ2NS1kMmY4LTRiMzQtOWI4Zi05NTUyMThjMGUzN2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVzdGJ1eS5jb20vc2l0ZS9hcHBsZS1naWZ0LWNhcmQtYXBwLXN0b3JlLWFwcGxlLW11c2ljLWl0dW5lcy1pcGhvbmUtaXBhZC1haXJwb2RzLWFjY2Vzc29yaWVzLWFuZC1tb3JlLWVtYWlsLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWRpZ2l0YWwvNjQyMTk1MS5wP3NrdUlkPTY0MjE5NTEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJjMTcyN2EzLTdiN2QtNDVlNS04ODg0LTQyZmYyMGJmZWU5ZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVFRp9MIJPa1nS9G2t4YlqTS74FEqTPpr-phusbTGAxO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-gift-card-app-store-apple-music-itunes-iphone-ipad-airpods-accessories-and-more-email-delivery-digital%2F6421951.p%3FskuId%3D6421951\">$100 Apple gift card</a> at Best Buy, the retailer will throw in a $10 Best Buy gift card for no extra cost.

But the therapy at that time was hampered by the need for wearable motion sensors, and by, \u201cthe participants \u2026 limited ability to adapt leg movements to changing terrain and volitional demands.\u201c Onward addressed that issue in Tuesday\u2019s study by incorporating a \u201cdigital bridge\u201d to monitor the brain\u2019s command impulses and deliver them, wirelessly and in real-time, to a stimulation pack implanted in the patient\u2019s lower back.</p><p>Clinicians have employed these systems for the better part of a decade to assist in improving upper extremity control and function following SCI \u2013 Onward\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.med-technews.com/news/medical-device-news/onward-medical-granted-fda-breakthrough-device-designation/\">ARC EX system</a> is designed to do just that \u2013 though this study was the first to apply the same theories to the lower extremities.</p><p>Onward\u2019s patient was a 38-year-old man who had suffered an \u201cincomplete cervical (C5/C6) spinal cord injury\u201d a decade before and who had undergone a five-month neurorehabilitation program with \u201ctargeted epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord\u201d in 2017. \u201cThis program enabled him to regain the ability to step with the help of a front-wheel walker,\u201d the research team noted in the <em>Nature</em> study. \u201cDespite continued use of the stimulation at home, for approximately three years, he had reached a neurological recovery plateau.\u201d</p><p>In addition to the EX, Onward Medical has also developed an internally mounted electrostimulation therapy, the ARC IM. Per the company, it is\u201dpurpose-built for placement along the spinal cord to stimulate the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_root_of_spinal_nerve\">dorsal roots</a>,\u201d to help improve SCI patients\u2019 blood pressure regulation.

Technically, it was a pair of 64-lead electrode implants, each mounted in a 50-milimenter\u2009circular-shaped titanium case that sits flush with the skull. The WIMAGINE \u201cis less invasive than other options while offering sufficient resolution to drive walking,\u201d Dave Marver, OnwardMedical CEO, told Engadget via email. \u201cIt also has five-year data that demonstrates stability in the clarity of signals produced.\u201d</p><p>Two external antennas sit on the scalp, the first providing power to the implants via inductive coupling, the second to shunt the signal to a portable base station for decoding and processing.  The processed signal is then beamed wirelessly to the <a href=\"https://www.medtronic.com/uk-en/patients/treatments-therapies/neurostimulator-essential-tremor/activa-rc.html\">ACTIVA RC implantable pulse generator</a> sitting atop the patient\u2019s lumbar region where 16 more implanted electrodes shock the appropriate nerve clusters to move their legs. Together they form a Brain Spine Interface (BSI) system, per Onward.</p><p>The entire setup is designed to be used independently by the patient. The assistive walker houses all the BSI bits and pieces while a tactile feedback interface helps them correctly position the headset and calibrate the predictive algorithm.</p><p>In order to get the BCI and pulse generator to work together seamlessly, Onward leveraged a \u201cAksenova/Markov-switching multilinear algorithm that linked <a href=\"https://ecog-acrin.org/resources/ecog-performance-status\">ECoG</a> signals to the control of epidural electrical stimulation parameters,\u201d which seems so obvious in hindsight. Basically, this algorithm predicts two things: the probability that the patient intends to move a specific joint based on the signals it\u2019s monitoring, and both the amplitude and direction of that presumed intended movement. Those predictions are then dumped into an analog controller which translates them into code commands that are, in turn, cycled to the pulse generator every 300 milliseconds. In all, the latency between the patient thinking, \u201cI should walk over there,\u201d and the system decoding those thoughts is just 1.1 seconds.</p><div id=\"bf690dc27d044e5cbf1340e22b18409e\"></div><p>Calibrating the system to the patient proved an equally quick process. The patient had figured out how to properly \u201cactivate\u201d the muscles in their hips to generate enough torque to swing their legs within the first two minutes of trying \u2014 and did it with 97 percent accuracy. Over the course of the rehabilitation, the patient managed to achieve control over the movements of each joint in their leg (hip, knee and ankle) with an average accuracy (in that the BSI did what the patient intended) of around 75 percent.</p><p>\u201cAfter only 5\u2009min of calibration, the BSI supported continuous control over the activity of hip flexor muscles,\u201d the team continued, \u201cwhich enabled the participant to achieve a fivefold increase in muscle activity compared to attempts without the BSI\u201d Unfortunately, those gains were wiped away as soon as the BCI was turned off, instantly losing the ability to step, they explained. \u201cWalking resumed as soon as the BSI was turned back on.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just that the patient was able to graduate from walking with a front-wheeled frame walker to crutches thanks to this procedure \u2013 their walking gait improved significantly as well. \u201cCompared to stimulation alone, the BSI enabled walking with gait features that were markedly closer to those quantified in healthy individuals,\u201d the Onward team wrote. The patient was even able to use the system to cross unpaved terrain while on their crutches, a feat that still routinely proves hazardous for many bipedal robots.</p><p>In all, the patient underwent 40 rehab sessions with the BCI \u2013 a mix of standard physio-rehab along with BCI-enabled balance, walking and movement exercises. The patient saw moderate gains in their sensory (light touch) scores but a whopping 10-point increase in their <a href=\"https://scireproject.com/outcome/wisci-and-wisci-ii\">WISCI II scores</a>.

This is the ninth season of the all-electric racing series, but it\u2019s the first of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-gen-e-electric-race-car-164542680.html\">the Gen3 era</a>. The new car is a massive leap forward in terms of technology. This model is able to regenerate up to 40 percent of the power needed to complete a race while on track. After <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-preseason-testing-gen3-203026534.html\">a tumultuous preseason</a> and major concerns heading into the first race back in January, there were some indications the series might stumble with its ambitious trajectory for the Gen3 racer. Despite the initial warning signs, the new generation for the series has begun without major issues.</p><p>I spoke to Neom McLaren team principal Ian James and Jaguar TCS Racing team principal James Barclay to get their thoughts on how the season has gone, the challenges of Gen3 and what\u2019s to come in the near future for Formula E.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>The races have been exciting to watch</h2><figure><img alt=\"Jake Hughes, NEOM McLaren Formula E Team, e-4ORCE 04\nleads Sacha Fenestraz, Nissan Formula E Team, Nissan e-4ORCE 04\n (Jake Hughes, NEOM McLaren Formula E Team, e-4ORCE 04\nleads Sacha Fenestraz, Nissan Formula E Team, Nissan e-4ORCE 04, ASCII, 118 co\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/6ae60a30-fb11-11ed-8e7f-bba192bf4c03\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Bagnall</div></figure><p>One of the major selling points of the Gen3 car was the ability for drivers to race each other in closer confines than Gen2. This was proven true in one turn at the Monaco E-Prix when Envision\u2019s Nick Cassidy passed two cars (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yFdKJSl0oxc\">he nearly overtook a third</a>) in the hotel hairpin. That\u2019s not typically a spot on the compact street course where there\u2019s a ton of passing, but with the Gen3 car, drivers were consistently running three-wide into that tight turn.</p><p>\u201c\u200b\u200bI think the racing has been phenomenal,\u201d James said. \u201cThere was a lot of talk at the beginning of the season about tires and the energy side of things, even the aesthetics of the car. But I actually think it's delivered.\u201d He noted that the start of Gen3 has \u201cmixed up the field\u201d and that the competition has been \u201cvery close.\u201d There have been six different winners in the first nine races and the championship lead has already changed hands multiple times.</p><p>There have also been <em>a lot</em> of overtakes. That\u2019s mostly because no one wants to lead at some of the tracks until the very end of the race. The Gen3 car has considerable drag aerodynamically, so you use a lot more energy staying out front than running in the pack. Starting in Brazil, this peloton effect became apparent where drivers willingly hand off the lead to conserve power until the closing laps. Even the leaders will back off and bunch up the field in a bid to maximize efficiency while out front. For example, Round seven in Berlin saw 23 lead changes with this in-line running.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of racing, but it\u2019s no less exciting,\u201d Barclay said. \u201cIn quali [the Gen3 car] looks spectacular because the drivers are on the limits, and the race looks spectacular because there\u2019s lots of overtaking. It\u2019s always about making sure we have the best balance of both things, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all working towards achieving within the championship.\u201d</p><p>McLaren\u2019s team principal also expressed the need to find \u201cbalance\u201d within the new style of racing for Formula E, but agreed what we\u2019ve seen out of the new car so far has been quite captivating. \u201cIt\u2019s about the drivers learning and anticipating, making sure they can turn that into their advantage,\u201d James said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be careful that it doesn\u2019t become the defining feature of Gen3 racing\u2026 but if we get the balance right, the racing is going to continue to be phenomenally exciting.\u201d The overtakes will continue, according to the McLaren boss, but there also stands to be \u201csome real speed\u201d from the Gen3 cars too.</p><h2>Teams have adapted quickly</h2><figure><img alt=\"Mitch Evans, Jaguar TCS Racing, Jaguar I-TYPE 6, \nWinner leads Jean-Eric Vergne, DS Penske, DS E-Tense FE23\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/8d854290-fb11-11ed-ba5b-b6532a50bd54\" /><figcaption>Jaguar's Mitch Evans leads during his win in Berlin</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LAT Images</div></figure><p>When I spoke to James <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mclaren-formula-e-gen3-interview-150058523.html\">before the season began</a>, he explained that teams would face \u201ca very steep learning curve\u201d starting at the first E-Prix of Gen3 in Mexico. That has been apparent in nearly every round of Season 9 so far. Teams like Porsche and Avalanche Andretti who started off strong have stumbled at times. And others, like Jaguar, who struggled at first have begun to find their form.</p><p>\u201cWhat we have seen in these first races of the year is how quickly it has evolved,\u201d Barclay said. \u201cFrom where we were in Mexico [with] everyone getting to grips with the new car and the new tech, now everyone is absolutely flat out in quali and we\u2019re into really complex race strategies because we\u2019re really on top of the cars.\u201d For Jaguar, its ability to get \u201con top of\u201d Gen3 was most apparent in two particular races. In Berlin, the team scored its first 1-2 finish and in Sao Paulo Jaguar cars locked out the podium for the first time with Envision\u2019s Nick Cassidy swiping third (Envision runs Jaguar powertrains).</p><p>While there have been some temporary issues that caused teams to pull cars from practice sessions out of caution, a major catastrophe has so far been avoided. Perhaps the biggest incident occurred in Cape Town when Mahindra and ABT Cupra pulled all of their cars from that event due to a suspension issue (the latter runs Mahindra powertrains as a customer team). The decision was made before qualifying citing safety concerns over running on a particularly bumpy track. <a href=\"https://the-race.com/formula-e/mahindra-formula-e-suspension-concerns-known-before-season/\"><em>The Race </em>reported</a> afterwards that rear suspension problems were discovered during manufacturer testing before the season began. Mahindra apparently modified the suspension afterwards, but the issue wasn\u2019t sufficiently resolved for the cars to run in South Africa.</p><h2>The new tires are a challenge, but that\u2019s a good thing</h2><figure><img alt=\"Formula E 2022-2023: S9 Pre Season Testing\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/c6ab3c00-fb11-11ed-9fbf-b812a8e12862\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Bloxham/LAT Images</div></figure><p>Heading into the season, drivers were vocal about the challenges of the new Hankook tires that were developed for Gen3. The compound is much harder than the previous version from Michelin, but it\u2019s also more durable. Previously, tires would degrade so much over the course of the race that what began as treaded rubber would end up almost completely slick. Now, the series uses a compound that performs more consistently throughout an E-Prix</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is we have a car with less mechanical grip, because we have a harder compound tire,\u201d Barclay explained. \u201cYet, we\u2019re going faster.\u201d</p><p>The tires posed the biggest challenge for the two races in Berlin, where Formula E runs on a temporary street circuit at the decommissioned Tempelhof Airport. The concrete surface is much more abrasive than asphalt. Combine that with the long curves and straights in the track layout and you can easily overheat the tires if you\u2019re not careful. Sure, these two races are outliers for teams looking to unlock the full potential of the new compound, but it only made matters worse for those like McLaren who were already struggling with traction.</p><p>\u201cBerlin was definitely the most acute circuit for that particular problem for us,\u201d James said. \u201cIt's something that we're working hard together with Nissan to understand and hopefully bring some improvements in the future that will start to close the gap to the competition.\u201d (McLaren runs Nissan powertrains as a customer team)</p><p>McLaren doesn\u2019t have an issue with one-lap pace; the team has put its cars on pole twice already. James explained that the larger issue is due to the lack of overall traction and maximizing the energy usage simultaneously. \u201cThat\u2019s when things start to become a little bit trickier,\u201d he said. As a result, McLaren is seeing a compounding effect as each lap passes in a race, which James admitted \u201cputs us on the backfoot.\u201d He noted that some teams have figured out how to unlock the potential of the tires in different ways, but for others it\u2019s still a fight. And at times it can be quite costly in terms of overall pace.</p><h2>Formula E had to introduce in-season fixes</h2><figure><img alt=\"Antonio Felix da Costa, TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E Team, Porsche 99X Electric Gen3 Pascal Wehrlein, TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E Team, Porsche 99X Electric Gen3 Pit Lane (Antonio Felix da Costa, TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E Team, Porsche 99X Electric G\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/c7e43bc0-fb12-11ed-9e1c-bbb2b3389906\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Carl Bingham</div></figure><p>Following several big crashes in pre-season tests, Formula E made the decision to introduce a secondary braking system as soon as possible. Because the Gen3 car is regenerating power under braking on both the front and rear powertrains, there wasn\u2019t a backup system in place if those systems became unusable \u2013 like in the event of a powertrain failure or a software issue. This led to several incidents where drivers weren\u2019t able to safely slow down their cars. Formula E moved quickly to find a fix, with the first on-track tests of the emergency-use system occurred at the second race in Diriyah.</p><p>\u201cThe FIA, ourselves, we\u2019re all learning and we\u2019re working together to find the best outcome,\u201d Barclay explained. \u201cI think we have addressed those [issues], whether it be the secondary brake system or the change to the traction control regulations.\u201d He said that all of the critical problems that have popped up are somewhat expected with a new car as both the teams and the series is \u201cin this mode of optimizing Gen3.\u201d</p><p>The traction control monitoring system is another area Formula E has addressed with an in-season change. Teams aren\u2019t allowed to have traction control to ensure no one gains an unfair advantage and the FIA polices those regulations with torque sensors mounted on the driveshafts. This setup is meant to uncover any software-based tricks being used to unlock better grip. <a href=\"https://the-race.com/formula-e/formula-e-introduces-new-traction-control-investigation-system/\">Speaking to The Race</a><em>, </em>the new system was described as \u201can evolution\u201d of previous monitoring tech by Formula E\u2019s technical boss Alessandra Ciliberti. The change had been in the works for months, in consultation with the car manufacturers who were also performing tests. Formula E decided the new tech, which monitors for consistent oscillations that differ from those caused by bumps and kerbs, was ready for use in Monaco earlier this month.</p><h2>There\u2019s still more to come</h2><figure><img alt=\"Jake Hughes, NEOM McLaren Formula E Team, e-4ORCE 04\nleads Sacha Fenestraz, Nissan Formula E Team, Nissan e-4ORCE 04\n (Jake Hughes, NEOM McLaren Formula E Team, e-4ORCE 04\nleads Sacha Fenestraz, Nissan Formula E Team, Nissan e-4ORCE 04, ASCII, 118 co\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/e8cd86c0-fb12-11ed-bf8f-9f3d2038aa97\" /><figcaption>McLaren's Jake Hughes leads the pack in Monaco</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LAT Images</div></figure><p>Before the first race of the season, Formula E announced that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-will-trial-a-30-second-quick-charging-stop-in-some-races-next-season-170257427.html\">it planned to test</a> quick-charging pit stops at a few races this year. These cars don\u2019t visit pit lane during an E-Prix unless there\u2019s a problem, mostly because it ends any chance you have of keeping up with the pack and remaining in contention. In the early days of the series, teams had to swap cars to complete the races, but battery tech advanced enough that hasn\u2019t been a requirement since 2018.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s not only the act of stopping for 30 seconds \u2014 you also have to learn how to use the technology that makes it possible. And there will also be changes to the race format. Currently, drivers leave the racing line to activate Attack Mode for a temporary power boost while remaining on track. With the reintroduction of pit stops, drivers will instead earn two Attack Charges, but it\u2019s unclear how and when they\u2019ll be deployed.</p><p>When Formula E <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/formula-es-fast-charging-pit-stops-wont-arrive-until-next-year-185813092.html\">announced it would postpone the stops</a> until next year, series co-founder Alberto Longo explained that the technology was ready but that supply chain issues meant the system couldn\u2019t be implemented until the last three or four races. <a href=\"https://us.motorsport.com/formula-e/news/formula-e-to-delay-introduction-of-fast-charging-stops-until-2024/10460141/\">He admitted</a> changes to the race format that late in the season made testing the system \u201cnot the right decision.\u201d Teams up and down the paddock are in agreement.</p><p>\u201cWe need to understand the implications of bringing it in on the race itself and make sure it\u2019s done in a way that adds value rather than detract from the show,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd because we've afforded ourselves the time to be able to do that analysis, I think we'll put ourselves in a much better position.\u201d He further explained that he\u2019s less worried about the impact the fast-charging stops will have on the team as he\u2019s confident in their ability to adapt, mostly due to their years of experience in the series.</p><p>Barclay echoed those thoughts on behalf of Jaguar. \u201cThe amount of newness in this Gen3 car, from the new tires to the slightly different race format (number of laps vs. time), there was a lot to go out,\u201d he said. \u201cI think adding those extra things add more complexity and [could have] potentially taken away from what we\u2019ve seen.\u201d He noted that the team has had plenty to tackle already, but they\u2019re looking forward to the new challenge of Attack Charge when it comes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten into a place where we\u2019ve seen some great races, and I think that will only be more of the case as the season unfolds,\u201d he said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-gen3-car-is-living-up-to-its-potential-after-a-rocky-start-130007090.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-gen3-car-is-living-up-to-its-potential-after-a-rocky-start-130007090.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-26 13:00:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget Podcast: Microsoft\u2019s Panos Panay on bringing AI to Windows 11", "description": "<p>It\u2019s a bigger than usual AI week for Microsoft, thanks to its Build developer conference.

The companies will each hold a stake of 50 percent in the joint venture, which will start construction on the new plant in the second half of 2023. Their new manufacturing facility will be located in Savannah, Georgia, where Hyundai is also building its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ev-factory-us-georgia-213034691.html\">first all-EV factory</a> in the US. The battery plant is expected to be operational by 2025 at the earliest. After it starts production at full capacity, it will be able to produce 30GHWh of battery every year, which is enough to support the production of 300,000 electric vehicles.</p><p>LG and Hyundai are just the latest companies to invest in US-based battery manufacturing facilities over the past couple of years. Toyota announced in 2021 that it will build a battery plant in the country as part of a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/toyota-us-battery-investment-155141624.html\">$3.4 billion investment</a>, while Ultium Cells (GM's and LG's joint venture) <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gm-energy-department-loan-ev-battery-manufacturing-190736000.html\">secured a $2.5 billion loan</a> from the Energy Department for the construction of EV battery facilities.

Lithium iron phosphate, which can tolerate more frequent and faster charging, costs less than other battery technologies and could bring down the cost of EVs.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Other companies could follow suit, seeing as the Biden administration is pushing to bring more EV and battery manufacturing to the US. Last year, it launched the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/biden-doe-2-8-billion-ev-battery-mineral-production-190544545.html\">American Battery Materials Initiative</a>, which will give 20 companies $2.8 billion in grants in hopes of encouraging manufacturers to start battery production stateside and making sure that the US won't be heavily dependent on &quot;unreliable foreign supply chains.&quot;</p><p>Hyundai and LG believe that the new facility can help create &quot;a stable supply of batteries in the region&quot; and allow them &quot;to respond fast to the soaring EV demand in the US market.&quot; Hyundai Mobis, the automaker's parts and service division, will be assembling battery packs using cells manufactured in the plant.

The 12.4-inch OLED display, 2,800 x 1,752 screen and microSD trays made it stand out against its competitors. It's also smaller than its predecessors at 1.24 pounds with a 0.22-inch thickness and, Samsung claims, has a 33 percent harder frame than the S7 models.

For $270, you get a 10.4-inch display, 2000 x 1200 screen, a 7,090 mAh battery, and weighs in at about one pound.

The carmaker has signed a deal, starting spring 2024, so selected Ford EVs can slurp down power at some <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ford-ev-drivers-will-get-access-to-12000-north-american-tesla-superchargers-next-spring-221752191.html\">Tesla Supercharger stations</a>. As part of the pact, Ford said, from the 2025 model year, it\u2019ll switch to Tesla\u2019s open-source North American Charging Standard (NACS) on its vehicles. Meanwhile, existing models that still use the (more or less) global standard Combined Charging System (CCS) will be able to pick up a Tesla-designed adapter to bridge the gap.</p><p>The deal is surprising, especially given the relative power, size and prestige of the two companies involved. Ford, one of the world\u2019s biggest car makers, is ceding control of its charger future to a relative minnow, albeit one that built a sizable own-brand charging network. Not to mention it runs the risk of creating a NACS\u2013CCS EV-charging format war, which may erode consumer faith in EVs. After all, if you pull up at a gas station anywhere in the US, there should be a one-size-fits-all way to get fuel in your tank without worrying about the size of the pipe.</p><p>\u2013 Dan Cooper</p><p><em>The Morning After isn\u2019t just a</em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/\"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> \u2013  it\u2019s also a daily podcast.

In a Washington, DC-based speech attended by some members of Congress and non-governmental organizations, Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith remarked that &quot;the rule of law and a commitment to democracy has kept technology in its proper place&quot; and should do so again with AI. Another part of Microsoft's &quot;blueprint&quot; for regulating AI involves mandating redundant AI circuit breakers, a fail-safe that would allow algorithms to be shut down quickly.</p><p>Smith also strongly suggested that President Biden create and sign an executive order necessitating that the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework\">risk management framework</a> be followed by any federal agencies engaging with AI tools.

Yet, Altman previously suggested pulling OpenAI from the European Union if the company doesn't agree with new policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Kent Walker, CEO president of global affairs for Google and Alphabet, recently released a statement calling for &quot;broad-based efforts \u2014 across government, companies, universities, and more \u2014 to help translate technological breakthroughs into widespread benefits, while mitigating risks.&quot; Concerns about AI have also led to people walking away from its development. Former Google VP and engineering fellow Geoffrey Hinton, commonly referred to as &quot;The Godfather of AI,&quot; notably <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/godfather-of-ai-leaves-google-amid-ethical-concerns-152451800.html\">resigned in April</a> to openly warn about AI's risks.</p><p>Alongside voicing his concerns, Smith's hour-long speech also served as an opportunity for him to laud recent AI advancements.

According to <a href=\"https://jalopnik.com/whistleblower-drops-100-gigabytes-of-tesla-secrets-to-g-1850476542\"><em>Jalopnik</em></a>, the collection contained 23,000 internal files, with complaints from as far back as 2015 and as recent as March 2022.

The latter included 139 complaints about unintentional emergency braking and 383 about phantom stops from false collision warnings.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, the files reportedly included more than 1,000 crash reports and a table of 3,000 incidents wherein drivers expressed safety concerns about Tesla's driver assistance system. While most of the reported incidents happened in the US, some of the complaints came from owners in Europe and Asia. <em>Handelsblatt</em> said it contacted dozens of customers from the files to confirm their reports, and some were even able to share videos with the publication.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Aside from containing details on thousands of safety complaints, the files reportedly included instructions for employees on how to communicate with customers.

Instead, Joseph Alm, Tesla's Managing Counsel for Litigation, told the publication that the data was stolen and that media reporting of illegally obtained information is not allowed absent exceptional circumstances. Alm also said in his response (via <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2023/05/25/tesla-files-insider-stole-100gb-data-media/\"><em>Electrek</em></a>) to the publication that the company believes a &quot;disgruntled ex-employee&quot; used his access as a service technician to &quot;exfiltrate information in violation of his signed non-disclosure agreement&quot; before he left the company.
