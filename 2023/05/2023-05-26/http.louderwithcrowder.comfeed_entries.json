You can't change our minds.

The next day he is Vince Vaughn's lawyer defending him against 142 paternity suits.  The next day, he's a Lego. Chris Pratt is all of us.</p><p>He's also one of the few Hollywood A-listers to proclaim his love of America whenever he can. Both seriously, as well as with his tongue firmly in his cheek. It's what he did in this video, before working out with Jay Glazer. And I know what you're thinking. How can someone get more patriotic than an American flag hoodie?</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">This Chris Pratt post is almost too patriotic. <a href=\"https://t.co/v4c3ymGU3F\">pic.twitter.com/v4c3ymGU3F</a><br />\u2014 Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1658102189015932929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>It's an American Flag hoodied OVER an \"America: Land of the Free\" t-shirt. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3a88d\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33754230&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>I won't say we need more celebrities like Chris Pratt. I'm sure there are more than a few who agree with him and disagree with the viewpoint commonly associated with their Hollywood peers.

That also was considered too pro-America, something the left hates. And they already hate Pratt for all the reasons you assume they do, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75C9grGZPxk\" target=\"_blank\">as Joe Rogan laid out</a>:</p><blockquote><em>\"He\u2019s the nicest f*cking guy I\u2019ve ever met in my life.

[...] He\u2019s kind of outside the lines in terms of his ideology, he\u2019s a Christian, and pretty open about it. Because of that they attack him.\"</em></blockquote><p>At the end of the day, he's Chris Pratt, and they're not. He's going to continue living life as Chris Pratt. His haters are going to continue being losers. Chris Pratt isn't going to care. And America will be better of for it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

NYC voters, when they can be bothered to vote, turn out every year to elect the same progressive officials who support more and more illegal immigration among other failed progressive policies. You get what you vote for.</p><p>The difference is that when it comes to the pro-criminal policies that NYC voters also vote for, shoplifting is still illegal in the suburbs. I live in a New York City suburb. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lee-zeldin-rnc-chair\" target=\"_blank\">We turned out in droves to vote AGAINST everything NYC stands for the last two years</a>.

Join us. Let people know the true story of what New York is.</blockquote><p>Savanah's video IS the true story of what New York is. And if you live in a red suburb outside a progressive city it's your problem too.</p><p>Expecting laws to be enforced, not wanting people in the country illegally, and not wanting what Carlos Arrellano exposes in this video happening a block away from YOUR family makes YOU the problem. That's what Kathy Hochul thinks. That's what Joe Biden thinks. And it's what guides the entire Democrat Party's illegal immigrant agenda.</p><p>Keep exposing it. Make sure everyone currently employed by the White House is no longer employed there in 2024.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Someone in the audience at a Cleese show <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12100471/ALISON-BOSHOFF-John-Cleese-forced-cut-Life-Brian-scene-men-having-babies-new-show.html\" target=\"_blank\">told the Daily Mail</a> that's what he said.

Who exactly are you concerned about offending? It isn't Python fans who have been laughing at this material for close to fifty years and will be the ones driving ticket sales.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">That was what was so surprising<br /><br />These were absolutely top-class Broadway performers and they were adamant that we would not get away with doing the scene in NYC!<br /><br />I asked them \"Are Python fans not going to come because we're doing a scene they've been laughing at for 40 years ?\" <a href=\"https://t.co/EJX6pQdKWe\">https://t.co/EJX6pQdKWe</a><br />\u2014 John Cleese (@JohnCleese) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnCleese/status/1661680748020080640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 25, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The scene in question features \"Loretta,\" a man, who wants to have a baby and claims no one could tell -- her -- she couldn't. In 1979, this was silliness. In 2023, it's a conversation between a woke activist and a normie on Twitter. Right after the woke activist celebrates the normie's daughter having her hopes and dreams crushed in High School track.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">The following scene has apparently been sacked from the stage production of Monty Python\u2019s \u201cThe Life of Brian\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/wPolPqdQXj\">pic.twitter.com/wPolPqdQXj</a><br />\u2014 Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1660966044335316992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The stage show is based on the 1979 film of the same name satirizing the life of Jesus Christ. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/los-angeles-dodgers-sisters-indulgence\" target=\"_blank\">As we have seen this week with the Los Angeles Dodgers</a>, insulting Christians is A-OK in 2023. But a joke about a man wanting to have a baby -- an idea that forty years ago was ludicrous and not the cornerstone of Democrat Party it is today -- goes too far in the eyes of a handful of thespians. I'm guessing the theatre critics too.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
