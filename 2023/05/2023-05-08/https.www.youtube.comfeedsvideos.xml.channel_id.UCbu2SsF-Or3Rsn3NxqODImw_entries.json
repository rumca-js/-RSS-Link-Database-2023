The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is coming May 12 2023. Even as close as we are, though, there's a lot that\u2019s still a mystery. Nintendo is notoriously secretive about its games before launch, and it seems especially inclined to keep this anticipated Zelda game under wraps, but here\u2019s everything we do know about Tears of the Kingdom.\n\nOf all its most closely guarded secrets, the plot of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is perhaps the one held tightest to Nintendo\u2019s proverbial chest. The game will serve as a direct sequel to its predecessor Breath of the Wild, which makes it the title set farthest in the series\u2019 timeline. For a full rundown of how all the games in the franchise link to one another, check out our complete Zelda timeline video, but for now, here\u2019s a quick recap of the events of Breath of the Wild to get you caught up on the immediate story.\n\n\n#thelegendofzelda  #TearsofTheKingdom #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HBoS9OZLO0", "date_published": "2023-05-08 17:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Zelda: Breath of the Wild Full Story Recap", "description": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild unpacks a lot of story across its vast playtime.
