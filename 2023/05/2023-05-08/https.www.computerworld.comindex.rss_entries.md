<p>In a pattern we’ve seen in the prelude to every <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3691893/apple-reality-tidbits-continue-to-leak-is-the-product-really-ready.html">significant Apple product introduction</a>, we’re reading the usual negative reporting. To understand the market Cupertino is getting into a little better, I spoke with Rolf Illenberger, managing director of <a href="http://www.vrdirect.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">VRdirect</a>.</p><p>Illenberger's company builds VR software for enterprise clients such as Siemens, Porsche, and Nestle. He believes Apple’s decision to <a href="https://www.applemust.com/apple-delays-reality-plans-wwdc-unveil-report-claims/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">enter the market now</a> (presumably at next month's Worldwide Developer Conference) reflects a desire to stake a claim in the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3693254/apples-new-patent-hints-at-powerful-video-collaboration-tools.html">enterprise VR space</a>, as it’s too early yet to make a consumer play.

<p>You’ve probably heard that Windows 11 is a “meh” operating system. And Window 12 is little more than a dream at this point. But with Microsoft <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3694932/with-windows-10-going-away-time-to-get-serious-about-windows-11.html">no longer updating Windows 10</a> (except for security fixes), what’s a PC geek got to do to get the most from Windows now?</p><p>In helping people with their computers, I’ve found there are often three types of Windows users: Those with a viable computer that supports Windows 11; those with a decent computer that for one hardware reason or another just won’t support Windows 11 and those whose PC sorely needs hardware upgrades or an outright replacement to be a viable computer for the next two years.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3695692/for-windows-10-pcs-out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
