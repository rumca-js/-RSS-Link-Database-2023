To call this hour-long whiz through the basic history of the event an “ultimate guide” is a touch misleading. The presenters, comedian Jason Manford and footballer/musician Chelcee Grimes, are fairly clear that it’s more of a beginners’ guide, and Manford aims much of his shtick at newcomers or recent converts. As a result, it’s not likely to enlighten any hardcore fans, but it might convince the previously unpersuaded to have a look.</p><p>Manford kicks things off by admitting that until last year, he had largely ignored the competition.

<p>The muckiest, grubbiest of away wins would have sufficed for Everton but this was not one of them. They took Brighton apart with as lethal a counterattacking display as any team will produce all season, scoring three times in the first half and not being remotely flattered. Abdoulaye Doucouré was on target twice, one of them inside the first minute, before Dwight McNeil forced an own goal from Jason Steele. Sean Dyche’s players could have added to that tally in a rampant spell.</p><p>Incredibly, more was to come. When the outstanding McNeil tapped in 14 minutes from the end, Everton’s bench exploded with jubilation at a mission expertly accomplished. He would better it with a thudding fifth deep into added time. Alexis Mac Allister’s consolation did not change the fact they are now out of the bottom three and will surely stay up with a couple more performances of this quality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/08/brighton-everton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on tuition fees: Labour needs an alternative solution | Editorial

<p>The opposition should fix a system that benefits the highest earners and those with wealthy parents</p><p>Since the coalition government raised the cap on tuition fees in 2012, student debt <a href="https://www.suttontrust.com/research-paper/degrees-of-debt-student-finance-comparison/" title="">has soared</a>. Due to interest on student loans, many graduates will spend most of their working lives paying off a debt that is greater than what they borrowed. The system has produced intractable problems: students are paying more than ever to get degrees, but many will not get <a href="https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/work/skills/graduate-employment-gap-report" title="">graduate-level jobs</a>. The declining value of tuition fees has left some universities struggling to cover their costs. Increasingly, they rely on recruiting international students and selling expensive master’s courses.</p><p>Labour’s initial solution was to scrap tuition fees altogether. Sir Keir Starmer has now reneged on this promise. The question is what will replace it. The current system magnifies inequity. In 2022, the government <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/publications/student-loans-reform-leap-unknown" title="">lowered the threshold</a> at which graduates start repaying their loans to £25,000 and extended it to 40 years. Some low- and middle-income earners, who would have previously only paid back a portion of their debt, will now pay it back in full. The government’s decision to reduce the interest rate on loans was a small improvement. But the setup remains fundamentally unfair as high earners who can pay off their loans quickly will end up <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/student-loans-tuition-fees-changes/" title="">repaying</a> less.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/08/the-guardian-view-on-tuition-fees-labour-needs-an-alternative-solution">Continue reading...</a>

The director of Plan 75, about a programme of voluntary suicide, explains why her film is ‘far from impossible’</p><p>Japan is ageing faster than any other country in the world, boasting one of the highest life expectancies. Women typically live to 87 and men to 81. Almost 40% of its population is over 60, a figure expected to continue expanding as the population shrinks. Couples in Japan now have an average of just 1.3 children – far below the 2.1 children societies need to remain stable.</p><p>Japan once placed its elderly at the top of the social hierarchy, even holding a national holiday to honour their contributions to society. But no longer: Fumio Kishida, the country’s prime minister, recently said the ageing population poses an “urgent risk to society”. Announcing a new government agency to address the issue, he said: “Japan is standing on the verge of whether we can continue to function as a society.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/08/plan-75-ageing-japan-euthanasia-suicide">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Chelsea appear to hit title stride, a miserable weekend for the Royals and tactical masterstroke helps Arsenal</p><p>Ruthless is a word that has been bandied around many a time to describe this Chelsea side. Their first-half display against Everton encapsulated why. Five shots on target, five goals scored were the stats at the break as the Blues eventually cruised to a 7-0 victory. Emma Hayes’s options in attack are enviable. Guro Reiten and Sam Kerr got one apiece, a partnership up front that has defined their season. When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/08/sam-kerr-scare-puts-spotlight-on-injured-matildas-ahead-of-world-cup">Kerr was forced off early</a>, on came Pernille Harder to score with her first touch. The Denmark captain has been missing for much of this campaign with a long-term hamstring issue but announced her return in style with a double and a player-of-the-match performance. Goals from midfield – Sophie Ingle, Jessie Fleming and later Erin Cuthbert – completed the scoring. Chelsea are up to second, Manchester United and that top spot firmly in their sights. It is getting harder to see how anyone will prevent them from lifting their fourth successive WSL title. <strong>SD</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/08/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

## Our newly crowned king has made ‘service’ his brand. But whose interests will he be serving? | Simon Jenkins

<p>From climate activists to arts bodies, every interest group will be crying out for the support of our outspoken monarch</p><p>So much for the magic, now for business. The coronation weekend reasserted Britain not as a modest, symbolic, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/30/opinion/dutch-monarchy-lessons/index.html">“bicycling” monarchy</a> of the sort adopted by many of Europe’s other hereditary kingdoms. Its royal family remains spectacular, drenched in history, religion, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/08/coronation-desperate-nation-rotten-system">ritual and extravagance</a>, an all-bells-and-whistles celebrity institution. Heredity is indefensible as a basis for high office, but it can survive if legitimised by consent. A king should indeed enjoy popular support, or he is nothing. But the question remains: is this popularity more safely guaranteed by unobtrusive moderation or by great congregations of soldiers, golden coaches, screaming jets, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/07/coronation-concert-review-a-cobbled-together-bunch-of-b-listers">pop stars</a>, bishops and God?</p><p>In his <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/49/3/407/1592600">study of monarchy</a>, the constitutionalist Vernon Bogdanor classified Britain as a “magic monarchy”. It respected the writer Walter Bagehot’s concept of a “mystical and theatrical” institution, kept wholly distinct from the grimmer realities of democratic government. That was the past weekend in spades. I lost count of the references to God, but there was no mention of parliament or democracy. Not even China’s Xi Jinping or Russia’s Vladimir Putin would have dared summon millions to watch them unclothe and disappear into a cubicle to <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/what-anointing-king-charles-covered-26837280">commune with the almighty</a> as the central legitimating act of their office.

<p>Lyon have steadily improved in the second half of the season and their striker’s goals and leadership qualities have been key</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_">Eric Devin</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>One could be forgiven for having doubts when Alexandre Lacazette returned to Lyon at the start of the season. Some players have done well since returning to Ligue 1 after spells abroad – Steve Mandanda and Wissam Ben Yedder are probably the best recent examples – but many others have not, with Laurent Koscielny, Morgan Schneiderlin, Yohan Cabaye turning in disappointing displays.</p><p>With Corentin Tolisso also joining, and Dejan Lovren arriving mid-season, the deal for Lacazette looked like a ploy to win over disgruntled fans who were pining for the days when the club reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2020. Tolisso has slowly improved during the season, having struggled with the same injury issues that plagued his time at Bayern Munich, but Lacazette has been an unqualified success.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/08/alexandre-lacazette-four-lyon-montpellier-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

He would return to Ravel for his encore, too, with Jeux d’Eau, in a performance that owed as much to Liszt as it did to any notion of musical impressionism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/08/benjamin-grosvenor-review-virtuosic-pianist-schumann-ravel-prokofiev-busoni-bach">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We might think the sky is blue and trees are green, but the truth is rather stranger </p><p>In February 2015, a Scottish woman uploaded a photograph of a dress to the internet. Within 48 hours the blurry snapshot had gone viral, provoking spirited debate around the world. The disagreement centred on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/22/thedress-internet-divided-cecilia-bleasdale-black-blue-white-gold" title="">the dress’s colour</a>: some people were convinced it was blue and black while others were adamant it was white and gold.</p><p>Everyone, it seemed, was incredulous. People couldn’t understand how, faced with exactly the same photograph of exactly the same dress, they could reach such different and firmly held conclusions about its appearance.

It was nearly called Squeezed. Actually, it was almost called all manner of dreadful things.</p><p>When I saw Russell Tovey’s audition tape, I knew within seconds he was right. It was very hard to find someone to take the part of Becky, though – partly because, in the script that went out, she spent quite a lot of time naked.

<p>Charles has long been known for his interest in ecology.

But the new job presents opportunities to set his own house in order that may prove the more impactful.

<p>Two brave women stand up for human rights as hordes of Uzbeks are dragged from their workplaces to pick state cotton, in this compelling documentary exposing farming practices only just outlawed</p><p>As a child growing up in Uzbekistan, film-maker Michael Borodin spent weeks at a time in the fields picking cotton when he should have been in class. The country is the world’s sixth-largest cotton producer; two million Uzbeks are involved in the production of “white gold”. Until recently, the state still had a monopoly on the industry and every year, doctors, teachers and other government workers – as well as schoolkids – were frogmarched to the fields at harvest time.</p><p><a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_838396/lang--en/index.htm">Last year, a UN agency</a> reported that forced labour for cotton picking had been finally abolished in Uzbekistan. This documentary, filmed before that report was published, follows two women involved in the industry. To be honest, the film is a tough sell to anyone outside Uzbekistan, with not much in the in the way of detail or<em> </em>context to explain what’s happening on screen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/08/cotton100-review-how-forced-labour-paid-the-price-of-uzbekistans-white-gold">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is chocolate mousse the ultimate party dessert? Centuries of experience seem to suggest it is. Here’s how to make it properly – bowl of whipped cream on the side compulsory</p><p>Pudding – maybe my favourite ever – arrived in two bowls. The first was glass and filled to the brim with chocolate mousse. The second, of white, fluted plastic, was twice the size of the first and full of whipped cream. Both were put on the living room sideboard along with a pile of plates and a remarkable selection of spoons: tea, soup, table, plastic, serving. Also a few forks and what seemed to be a catering ladle, which someone decided was the best thing for the cream. So in a small flat filled with dozens and dozens of people under a light covered with tissue paper, we all helped ourselves to mousse and large amounts of cream that required flicking to get it out of the ladle.</p><p>In his book <a href="https://curiouscook.typepad.com/site/on-food-and-cooking.html">On Food And Cooking</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/03/harold-mcgee-food-science">Harold McGee</a> notes: “The full foaming power of egg white seems to have burst forth in the early 17th century.” Of course, eggs’ ability to foam was known long before this, but the extent of foaming was no doubt limited by tools, or the lack of them. Then “sometime around 1650, cooks began to use more efficient whisks, of twigs or bundled straw”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/08/rachel-roddy-recipe-chocolate-mousse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After absorbing the culture shock of moving to the US from Zimbabwe, and spending two decades toiling in obscurity, Woods has become America’s most feted underground MC</p><p>‘Genius.com makes me very sad about the state of reading comprehension in the US,” frowns Billy Woods. Given his often oblique wordplay and prolific output – nine albums in the last decade alone, plus more with his groups Super Chron Flight Brothers, the Reavers and Armand Hammer – the veteran rapper’s work must drive heavy traffic to the song lyrics database, whose users attempt to decode arcane wordplay and volunteer their own song interpretations. But, he sighs via phone from his New York apartment, “sometimes I want to tell them: ‘This song is about a date I went on, not the devastating toll of capitalism and racism.’ They come in with preconceived ideas and the belief that a song can only mean one thing, which is the strangest way to approach my music.”</p><p>Woods is used to being misunderstood. A recording artist for two decades now, he spent the first half of his maverick career languishing in obscurity (and still obscures his face in photos), but remained true to his voice and built a following that appreciates his kaleidoscopic rhymes and bruising worldview. His new album Maps is his finest and most accessible yet, and today, he’s the most feted underground rapper in the US – Earl Sweatshirt described him as “<a href="https://twitter.com/earlxsweat/status/1578095417643761665">the rawest ever</a>” and said he hoped to be “<a href="https://twitter.com/earlxsweat/status/1167642002768285698">like billy woods when I grow up</a>”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/08/david-attenborough-weed-and-american-apartheid-the-awesome-mind-of-rapper-billy-woods">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Theatre Royal Brighton</strong><br />Searing collection of diary excerpts, brought to life by prominent queer voices, recalls the devastation of Aids with fury and frankness</p><p>A mesmeric reckoning with the devastation of Aids, Blue Now is an ode to an extraordinary artist and his lost generation. Created in 1993, completed just a few months before his death, Blue was Derek Jarman’s final feature film. Originally voiced by his long-term collaborators and featuring nothing but a wide expanse of International Klein Blue, the film is a searing collection of diary excerpts from a period when Aids took his friends, his sight – he began to be able to see only in blue – and when he knew it would soon take his life.</p><p>In four performances across four cities, the script is today given new, vivid life by Russell Tovey, Joelle Taylor, Travis Alabanza and Jay Bernard. These prominent queer voices from across the worlds of theatre and poetry sit in front of a large blue screen, perfectly still in the near-darkness, a heady, tragic lullaby on their lips. Where Jarman’s original was a rejection of the visual, Neil Bartlett’s new presentation gives us a little more to look at. The light gently bounces off the faces of the performers and original composer Simon Fisher Turner, and Jarman’s words turn into a fluid, lyrical dance in the hands of BSL interpreter Ali Gordon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/08/blue-now-review-remarkable-retelling-of-derek-jarmans-final-film">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Records for countries broken just weeks after temperature in Thailand rose above 45C for the first time</p><p>All-time temperature records were broken in Vietnam and Laos last week. On 6 May, Hoi Xuan in Vietnam reached a scorching 44.1C, breaking the previous record for the country of 43.4C, set in 2019. On the same day, Laos recorded its highest-ever temperature, , which reached 43.5C in Luang Prabang. These records were set just a few weeks after temperatures in Thailand rose above 45C for the first time.</p><p>A breakdown of the heat in south-east Asia is expected to occur in the next few days as a tropical disturbance is likely to develop nearby. Forecast models suggest that, over the coming days, the Bay of Bengal will have the perfect conditions for cyclogenesis to occur. By later next week, several factors, including enhanced vorticity and very high sea surface temperatures, will enhance the chance that a tropical storm will edge north-eastwards into parts of Myanmar. This will bring some strong winds and significant rainfall to south-east Asia, including the areas that have recently seen their temperature records broken.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/08/weather-tracker-vietnam-and-laos-set-records-for-highest-ever-temperatures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Startups say their AI-powered, therapist-trained bots can help us navigate life’s challenges. I decided to put them to the test</p><p>For the last several months I have been a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. We <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/10/i-bought-my-own-home-last-year-i-now-have-big-regrets">moved to a new house</a> last year only to find the place next door was about to undergo a massive construction project. Since then we’ve been living with a constant soundtrack of hammering and drilling. I’ve tried various coping methods – everything from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/22/one-minute-i-was-in-the-sauna-the-next-i-was-in-a-steamy-panic">saunas</a> to noise-cancelling headphones to fantasies of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/09/what-would-i-do-if-i-won-19bn-make-life-a-misery-for-the-man-who-bought-the-house-next-door">revenge</a> – but the noise and dust still raise my blood pressure to dangerous levels every day.</p><p>Yet there was one thing I hadn’t tried until this week: An “emotional support chatbot”. Yes, those are a thing now: in our brave new world, where artificial intelligence is seemingly on the brink of disrupting every industry, not even therapists are safe from having their jobs taken by technology. On Tuesday a prominent startup called Inflection AI <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/ai-startup-co-founded-by-reid-hoffman-mustafa-suleyman-debuts-friendly-chatbot?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">launched a chatbot called Pi</a> (short for “personal intelligence”) which is designed to give friendly advice. It’s obviously not meant to replace a real-life therapist (not yet anyway), but is pitched as a supportive companion that can help you talk through your problems. The algorithm has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/03/technology/personaltech/ai-chatbot-pi-emotional-support.html">trained by around 600 “teachers”</a>, including mental health professionals, to be sensitive and conversational.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/08/emotional-support-chatbot-ai">Continue reading...</a>

## King Charles ignited a battle of styles in architecture - is it time for a truce?

<p>The monarch loves traditional buildings and hates a lot of modern design. In this long-running battle, is there any middle ground?</p><p>Once upon a time I found myself in a very small waiting room in St James’s Palace, furnished like a posh-but-thrifty dentist’s with old Sotheby’s catalogues and ancient copies of <em>Country Life</em>, the sound of clock bells and tramping guardsmen percolating from outside. I was ushered into a large room, to be grilled by associates of the then Prince of Wales as to my suitability to be his architectural adviser. Where did I live? Stoke Newington (wrong answer). Would I do other work to supplement the tiny pay I would receive for a supposedly part-time position. Yes (wrong answer). Could I type?</p><p>I made it onto a shortlist of two, but the job went to the other candidate. This was a bullet dodged – I would not have thrived in the scheming world of the prince’s architectural court – but it’s fair to ask why I accepted the invitation to apply in the first place. I did not, after all, share his taste for clumsy traditionalist architecture. Because, I naively told my 25-year-old self, the prince had some good instincts: he wanted beautiful new buildings and urban spaces, as did I. We only disagreed on the means. Perhaps, if I got the job, I could educate him towards more intelligent approaches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/08/king-charles-ignited-a-battle-of-styles-in-architecture-is-it-time-for-a-truce">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Can long Covid make it harder to identify acquaintances, friends, even close relatives? Scientists are investigating a possible link</p><p>The other day a man waved at Stanley Chow, and went over to him. “I said: ‘Have we met before?’ Which is kind of the last thing you want to say.” It happens a lot – he finds it hard to remember new people’s faces. “Anyone I’ve spoken to once or twice I do forget quite instantly,” he says. “If I meet someone new, I’ll make a point of following them on Instagram or Facebook so their face becomes ingrained in my memory somehow.”</p><p>Around six months ago, a friend phoned Chow to complain he had “blanked” a mutual friend, but the 48-year-old illustrator just hadn’t recognised him. “That unsettled me for a few weeks.” Now, he says, “I always make an excuse, like: ‘Since Covid I can’t remember faces as well as I could.’” He’s not plucking that idea out of thin air. He says he has always had a small degree of face blindness – where people have difficulty recognising or remembering faces – but he believes the Covid infection he got in early 2021 made it worse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/08/sometimes-i-dont-recognise-my-own-family-life-with-face-blindness">Continue reading...</a>

Across Europe and in the US, populists of right and left, often under the cloak of nationalism, are on the rise. UK politics during the past decade has been a rollercoaster, both main parties having succumbed to takeovers by cults. Meanwhile the world beyond fortress Europe appears to be disintegrating, and looming ever larger over our comfortable little lives are the potentially existential threats of global heating and mass migration.</p><p><em>Politics: A Survivor’s Guide: How to Stay Engaged Without Getting Enraged</em> by Rafael Behr is published by Atlantic (£20).

<p>David de Gea gives Manchester United a headache, Ryan Mason shows his nous and Thiago Silva sets the standard for Chelsea</p><p>Arsenal have made huge strides over the last 12 months. When they ended last season with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/newcastle-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">two emphatic defeats</a> in three games to miss out on a top-four finish, their prospects of then competing for the title looked fanciful. But the summer signing of Gabriel Jesus changed the mood from despondency to excitement, and after what looks like a second consecutive run-in disappointment – despite their fine win at Newcastle – Mikel Arteta could do with pulling off the same trick: picking a player so obviously the right fit his arrival inspires teammates and supporters with the certainty of progress. Most likely, the plan is to recruit a midfielder to replace Granit Xhaka, as good at St James’ as he has been all season but still lacking the class required in a champion team. If rumours are to be believed, Declan Rice will be the man, and though his lack of finesse might be a problem, his physicality would make facing Arsenal an even more unpleasant task than it is already. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/07/newcastle-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Newcastle 0-2 Arsenal</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/07/west-ham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">West Ham 1-0 Manchester United</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/06/manchester-city-leeds-premier-league-match-report">Manchester City 2-1 Leeds</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/06/tottenham-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Tottenham 1-0 Crystal Palace</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/06/bournemouth-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">Bournemouth 1-3 Chelsea</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/08/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

## Like me, Eve Babitz was driven by corrosive relationships – and idolised women | Emma Forrest

<p>Lust and longing turned me on to Eve Babitz – the writer who spells out that the real female equivalent of male power is not beauty but self-possession</p><p>Before apps were invented, doing celebrity profiles was how I dated. I didn’t drink or take drugs, so I wasn’t going to meet anyone at bars or clubs. And who’s going to make a pass at someone who spends her time alone listening to Leonard Cohen? For me, the only one who tried was Leonard Cohen himself, backstage at the Royal Albert Hall. Almost Famous has a very different tone if the precocious teenage writer is female.</p><p>The one man I married was also the only one who wasn’t intimidated by my list of exes. When it did emerge, and I awaited his disapprobation, still haunted by the judgment of previous men, he merely shrugged and said: “I take it as a compliment. You’ve got great taste in cock, girl.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/08/like-me-eve-babitz-was-driven-by-corrosive-relationships-and-idolised-women">Continue reading...</a>

## Manchester City’s history shows there never was a golden age of ownership | Nicholas Blincoe

<p>Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia have different visions of future in football with aims and models not interchangeable</p><p>It’s an exhilarating time to be a Manchester City fan, though I am muting my optimism with a selection of the most miserabilist chants ever heard in a football stadium. “We’re not really here”; “Empty seats at home”; and “Spent all my money on drugs and City<em>”</em>. City’s rise has been so rapid that the fans are still very Mancunian, and perhaps less familiar than followers of other big teams. Yet they resemble other fans in their obsessive scrutiny of every aspect of the team, from the pitch, to the training field, to the corporate decisions. The idea that City fans ignore the importance of the club’s ownership in our success – even an “elephant in the room” – is far from the mark.</p><p>My own fan story sounds unusual, though I suspect it isn’t. I released a hip-hop 12-inch on Factory in the late 1980s, and became a City supporter under the infectious enthusiasm of A&amp;R man Mike Pickering and co‑founder Rob Gretton. I was in my 20s, which is late to adopt a team, but I was living close to Maine Road, and the team embodied ideals that I appreciated: fun in adversity, jangling nerves and comic timing. By 2002, I was living in the Middle East and feeling homesick. I began to follow City more obsessively, as a bizarre soap opera. This was the era when Stuart Pearce was manager, the owner was Thailand’s fugitive politician Thaksin Shinawatra, and the agent with the most formidable reputation was Richard Dunne’s wife, Helen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/08/manchester-city-ownership-qatar-abu-dhabi">Continue reading...</a>

Why? Because it’s rare for one mascara to do everything you need.

## ‘I don’t worry about holding back’ – how Qualeasha Wood turned being doxed into wild tapestries

<p>When the artist was targeted online, it left her too terrified to go out. But she finally got her life back on track – by stitching the whole experience into works of tapestry art</p><p>When New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art came knocking, Qualeasha Wood almost said no. It was mid-2021, and the young Philadelphia-based textile artist and photographer was experiencing one of the biggest waves of attention in her career to date: <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/853462">The [Black] Madonna/Whore Complex</a>, a large tapestry inspired in equal measure by Freud and Kanye, had recently graced the cover of an Art in America issue edited by esteemed young curator Antwaun Sargent. Then the Met got in touch, saying that the surreal mashup of Wood’s own self-portrait with exalted religious imagery and glitched-out web art would be perfect for an upcoming show called <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/alter-egos-projected-selves">Alter Egos | Projected Selves</a>. But Wood felt she could do better. “At first I was like ‘No, you guys can’t have it’, which I think is, like, insane,” she says over Zoom from her Brooklyn studio. “Most people don’t say no to the Met – but at the time, I thought, ‘This piece is good, but it’s not my best piece – there have to be pieces better than that one, right, or else it’s too good too soon!’”</p><p>Eventually, Wood reneged – “My mom and my gallerist were like, ‘Just give the Met the piece.’” But her initial refusal speaks a lot to the way Wood moves through the world. Throughout our conversation, the 26-year-old – dressed in a Super Bowl T-shirt and denim jacket, her head recently shaved, looking far more casual than the glamorous, gown-wearing priestess she depicts herself as in her art – describes herself as “bold”, “brash” and “liking a challenge”. She’s still picky about where her art goes, and will decline a sale if she senses a collector just wants her art because they “find it controversial”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/08/qualeasha-wood-doxed-wild-tapestries">Continue reading...</a>

## Revolutionary Spring by Christopher Clark review – the revolts that reshaped Europe

<p>This magnificent reappraisal of the 1848 revolutions illuminates their impact on the fraught relationship between liberals and radicals</p><p>“We are standing at a turning point in Europe’s fortunes,” warned the Prussian diplomat Joseph von Radowitz in February 1848. He was speaking of the year in which revolution spread through Europe at startling speed. In January, Sicily erupted in revolt against the Bourbon king Ferdinand II. Six weeks later, an insurrection in Paris overthrew the French king Louis-Philippe. By March, the flames of revolution were engulfing cities from Milan to Vienna, from Berlin to Budapest.</p><p>The 1848 revolutions occupy a strange place in European historiography. Most historians acknowledge their significance as a Europe-wide set of uprisings. Yet they remain largely a submerged presence in European consciousness, viewed not so much as Radowitz’s “turning point” but “the turning point at which modern history failed to turn”, in GM Trevelyan’s pithy phrase.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/08/revolutionary-spring-by-christopher-clark-fighting-for-a-new-world-revolts-that-reshaped-europe-1848">Continue reading...</a>

The script was developed with two French cinema heavyweights, producer and screenwriter Geoffroy Grison and director Bertrand Bonello and it premiered at Cannes in 2022 in the Directors’ Fortnight section.</p><p>It is a drama teetering on the verge of a heatstroke hallucination, with flourishes of violence. The setting is the hydroelectric Merowe dam in northern Sudan on the Nile; it’s 2019, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/11/quran-and-ak-47-the-30-year-rule-of-sudans-omar-al-bashir">President Omar al-Bashir is about to be deposed</a> by the army after months of protests. Maher (Maher El Khair) is working by the riverbank making bricks in the burning sun, for a foreman who is always liable to dock people’s pay. Listlessly succumbing to a kind of metaphysical torpor, Maher listens to news reports about the revolution’s gathering momentum and every evening he goes off to build a strange pagan statue, something like a Wicker Man for the Arab spring, which appears to be having a life of its own. Meanwhile, Maher is developing his own alarming physical symptoms: a wound that may be the entry point for a supernatural intelligence introducing Maher to new ideas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/08/the-dam-review-eerie-hallucinatory-tale-of-sudan-on-the-brink">Continue reading...</a>

## The coronation pulled a screen across a desperate, failing nation – just as intended | Nesrine Malik

<p>Those who opposed it must be portrayed as radical, or the whole rotten system it represents might come crashing down</p><p>The biggest illusion – and utility – of royal events such as the coronation is that we are somehow a part of them. We are, of course, in a way; we need to be for the institution of monarchy to have any meaning at all. But not as equals. We have the worst of both worlds: the royal family gives us nothing, and we in turn legitimise it, give it meaning and audience and pay, through <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-30/uk-to-pay-new-27-3-million-subsidy-to-royal-family-as-taxpayers-face-cost-of-living-squeeze#xj4y7vzkg">subsidies</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/07/british-royal-family-wealth-finances-cost-of-the-crown-summary">tax exemptions</a>, for its ability to wow us. The monarchy does provide a service, but not to us. It is to an entire system of political decline and economic inequality that cannot withstand closer scrutiny, and so it must be embellished and cloaked in ceremony.</p><p>And it was ever thus. The historian David Cannadine, in an essay on the “invented traditions” of royal ceremonies, wrote: “in a period of change, conflict or crisis”, unchanging ritual “might be deliberately unaltered so as to give an impression of continuity, community and comfort, despite overwhelming contextual evidence to the contrary.” That evidence to the contrary cannot be more overwhelming than reports that money for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/coronation-extravaganza-sits-badly-in-todays-britain">food banks</a> has been diverted to pay for coronation events. What those funds bought was a coronation, much like the screens assembled to hide King Charles as he derobed, that for a moment erected an ornate cover that hid the nation’s hunger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/08/coronation-desperate-nation-rotten-system">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The villagers are sipping coronation cocktails and glamming up for Eurovision – but will the return of Rob Titchener cast a pall on the festivities?</p><p>I’ve just been in Ukraine, where the basic barometer of a city’s security status is whether McDonald’s has reopened (open in Kyiv, still closed in Kharkiv). In Ambridge in the English Midlands, the basic barometer of having your wits about you is whether you can see through George Grundy. To his doting but dim grandmothers, Clarrie and Susan, the lad can do no wrong. Chelsea and Jazzer, on the other hand, know better. “That boy’s a jail sentence waiting to happen,” as the latter put it. Or is he? George seems to have a remarkable capacity to come up from every crisis smelling of roses – unlike Chelsea’s poor brother Brad, George’s unwilling accomplice in a Friday-night break-in of Grey Gables, which is currently a building site. A dozen overthought scruples delayed Brad’s apology to Oliver Sterling for the ruination of the memorial bench dedicated to his late wife, Caroline Bone. Sterling, a massive fail on the George Grundy Perspicacity Test, read Brad’s hesitation as turpitude.</p><p>The coronation has been competing with the Eurovision song contest for villagers’ attention. For the latter event, veterinary nurse Paul is intent on bringing a night of sequins and glitter to the Bull, in a fitting alliance with his only rival for the status of Ambridge’s campest character, Linda Snell. Jim, a person after my own heart at the best of times, owing to his curmudgeonly mien and habit of dropping into Latin quotation, has revealed himself as the village’s token republican. While the forelock-tugging peasantry picnic on the green is in full feudal array, having got sloshed on Kenton’s coronation cocktails in the Bull, he intends to listen to “uplifting music” at home with his curtains firmly closed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/08/charlotte-higgins-on-the-archers-ambridge-in-sequins-and-gothic-shadows">Continue reading...</a>

Ishbia grabbed the ball and Jokic tried to retrieve it. Shortly after the ball flew back into the seats, Jokic and Ishbia made contact. Predictably the 6ft 11in, 285lb Jokic got the better of the tussle and Ishbia was knocked backwards. It was unclear if Jokic saw Ishbia clearly or was even aware of who he was.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/07/nikola-jokic-mat-ishbia-suns-owner-nuggets-shove-nba-playoffs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda et al go on a bookish holiday after keeping their reading club going through lockdown, but jokes are thin on the ground</p><p>Bill Holderman’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/31/book-club-review-simulated-sexcom-for-the-over-60s">2018 silver-years comedy Book Club</a> had the amusing idea of showing us four prosperous female friends – Vivian (Jane Fonda), Diane (Diane Keaton), Sharon (Candice Bergen) and Carol (Mary Steenburgen), given to drinking balloon glasses of wine and laughing life-affirmingly in picture-perfect kitchens – who are radicalised by reading Fifty Shades of Grey and inspired to overhaul their personal relationships. Now for the sequel: it is a few years later, the heroines have gone through the Covid lockdown and kept their book club going on Zoom, flirting with Sally Rooney’s Normal People, but heart-sinkingly sticking with lite fare such as Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist.</p><p>Yet books are irrelevant to their new adventure: a bachelorette holiday together in Italy before Vivian marries to her boyfriend Arthur (Don Johnson). The wacky quartet have adventures in Rome, Florence and Venice before a romantic finale looms for more than one of them. There are some reasonable moments, but the feelgood mission seems to have ruled out any real jokes. Setting to one side what might ungallantly be called the inscrutability issue, the stars’ performances are subdued and de-feisted by the limp script, which for some reason permits only Bergen to be anything approaching funny: she is tough, shrewd, looks like a real person and getting laid is her prerogative also.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/08/book-club-the-next-chapter-review-diane-keaton-jane-fonda-smirking-sequel">Continue reading...</a>

Writing on <a href="https://t.me/medvedev_telegram/322">Telegram</a>, Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said that any suspects, “like other criminals, will be tried for the attack and sentenced to long prison terms”.
