The Denmark captain has been missing for much of this campaign with a long-term hamstring issue but announced her return in style with a double and a player-of-the-match performance. Goals from midfield \u2013 Sophie Ingle, Jessie Fleming and later Erin Cuthbert \u2013 completed the scoring. Chelsea are up to second, Manchester United and that top spot firmly in their sights. It is getting harder to see how anyone will prevent them from lifting their fourth successive WSL title. <strong>SD</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/08/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/08/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action", "date_published": "2023-05-08 14:00:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Lion Sleeps Tonight: one song\u2019s journey from 1930s South Africa to Disney money-spinner", "description": "<p>Mbube \u2013 the vocal harmony song that ended up on The Lion King soundtrack \u2013 made its writer $2.
