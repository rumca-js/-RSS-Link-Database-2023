Long before taking a seat in the home dugout Cooper inhaled deeply and a prolonged puff of the cheeks followed. Perhaps he had anticipated the wild ride that was to come.</p><p>This was not a night that was good for the blood pressure but by the end Forest, courtesy of a Taiwo Awoniyi double, a Morgan Gibbs-White penalty and a late strike by Danilo, had wrapped up a brilliant win over bottom club Southampton and a precious three points, breathing life into their bid for Premier League survival. With three games to play, Forest\u2019s heads are above water. How they fare at home to Arsenal and away at Chelsea and Crystal Palace, the latter on the final day, will determine their season. Mathematically, Southampton can survive but it will take a miracle from here.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/08/nottingham-forest-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/08/nottingham-forest-southampton-premier-league-match-report", "date_published": "2023-05-08 21:08:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "First there was Brexit.
