Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Karol Markowicz discuss many of the topics found in her new national best-selling book, “Stolen Youth.” Together, they break down the current state of K-12 academia, the pornographic books being pushed into your child's hands, and the broader discussion we need to have about woke-ism in the West and where to draw the line.

Karol Markowicz is a weekly columnist at the New York Post and FoxNews, a contributor at Spectator World, and a contributing writer to Washington Examiner magazine. She has written for USA Today, Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, Time, Forward, National Review, Daily Beast, Business Insider, Haaretz, and many others. She appears regularly on Fox News, Newsmax, OANN, and Fox Business Network and is featured frequently on national radio programs. Karol was born in the Soviet Union, grew up in Brooklyn, and now lives in Florida with her husband and three children.
