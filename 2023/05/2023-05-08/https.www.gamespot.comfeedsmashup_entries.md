Fortunately, there's no shortage of books and compendiums out there that help piece together the timelines of various games, fill in gaps and provide a comprehensive look at Link's many quests. Hyrule Historia is a gigantic tome to read through, its companion book Art and Artifacts provides a deep dive into the art of the series, and Creating A Champion chronicles the development of Breath of the Wild through gorgeous art. Meanwhile, the Deluxe Edition of The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia has an iconic cover.</p><ul><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Hyrule-Historia/dp/1616550414">Hyrule Historia</a> </span></li><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Art-Artifacts/dp/1506703356">Arts and Artifacts</a> </span></li><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Encyclopedia-Deluxe/dp/1506707408">Encyclopedia</a> </span></li><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Encyclopedia-Deluxe/dp/1506707408">Encyclopedia Deluxe Edition</a> </span></li><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Creating-Champion/dp/1506710107">Creating a Champion</a> </span></li></ul><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Legend of Zelda fused bead kit</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/3994887-lozmerch%2827%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Beads are fantastic for a number of decorative reasons, especially when they kind of resemble classic video game pixels.

<p dir="ltr">Bungie has spent quite a bit of time and effort going after Destiny 2 cheat-makers, and it seems that the campaign is paying off. As first uncovered by Stephen Totilo of Axios, Bungie recently won a $6.7 million judgment against Lavicheats in a US district court.</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1655640429105143835">court documents</a> read, roughly $5.5 million of that sum is for violations of the DMCA, $300,000 of it is for violations of the Copyright Act, about $600,000 is for violations of the Lanham Act, and the remaining $250,000 is for court fees and costs.</p><p dir="ltr">This was a default judgment, meaning that Lavicheats never responded to the suit. According to Totilo, the Lavicheats owner is believed to live in India, which may account for this. Earlier in May, it was announced that Bungie won a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-another-cheat-distributor-for-12-million/1100-6513797/">similar lawsuit</a> against VeteranCheats, AKA Mihai Claudiu-Florentin, for just over $12 million dollars. This was also a default judgment. Back in February, it won a lawsuit against a cheat-seller called AimJunkies for $4.3 million.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-keeps-winning-lawsuits-against-destiny-2-cheaters-for-millions-of-dollars/1100-6513922/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-everything-we-know/1100-6492308/">The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom</a> finally releases soon, and it serves as a direct continuation of Breath Of The Wild's story. Given that it's been more than six years since Breath of the Wild released in 2017, you're forgiven if you have some trouble recalling all the details of that game's events. Don't worry, as we have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-full-story-recap/2300-6461332/">recap</a> of the game's story for you to enjoy.</p><p dir="ltr">In the 15-minute video below, narrator Adam Mason explains the events of the game. It all starts with the the forming of Calamity Ganon 10,000 years in the past, with four Divine Beasts and an army of Guardian automotons created by the Sheikah helping seal him away. From there, it proceeds to 100 years before the events of Breath of the Wild, and how Link and Zelda worked together with the four champions to prepare for the Great Calamity.</p><p dir="ltr">This all leads to the unfortunate downfall of Link, Zelda, and the four champions, with Link being sealed underground for his wounds to heal. 100 years later, Link wakes up and proceeds to explore the post-apocalyptic Hyrule, eventually regaining his memories, defeating the four Divine Beasts, and rebuilding himself to take another shot at Ganon. The game ends with our heroes finally overcoming Calamity Ganon seemingly once and for all, but with the incredible task of rebuilding Hyrule still ahead of them.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-story-recap-video-will-get-you-ready-for-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6513918/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## WoW: Dragonflight's New "Simple" Upgrade System Is Resulting In Some Complex Cheat Sheets

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft: Dragonflight's</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-embers-of-neltharion-update-will-take-players-deep-underground-to-discover-deathwings-secrets/1100-6512139/">Embers of Neltharion update</a> introduced a new, more universal gear upgrade system that Blizzard hoped would make gearing in the MMORPG simpler. And while the new system certainly has its share of benefits over the old system, it has also left some players scratching their heads and consulting some complicated-looking charts in order to grasp it.</p><p dir="ltr">The new system makes it so PvE gear earned from raids, the open world, and Mythic+ dungeons can be upgraded using currencies called Flightstones and Shadowflame Crests, replacing one-off systems like the old Valor system that was used exclusively to upgrade Mythic+ gear. It sounds good on paper, and it is definitely a great way for those who are more focused on open world content or raiding to continue progressing their characters by doing a wider variety of content. Blizzard said in a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/more-frequently-asked-questions-about-the-new-upgrade-system/1546495">FAQ</a> the goal of the system was to keep the "base player experience simple."</p><p dir="ltr">Simple, however, seems up for debate. While Flightstones are earned from just about any endgame activity and are fairly straightforward, the real confusion surrounding the new system stems from the multiple different types of crests, crest fragments, and sub-divisions of gear that dictate how powerful a particular piece of gear can become. Depending on the difficulty of the content the gear was acquired from, it requires different types of crests to be upgraded. That has led to confused players attempting to help their fellow gamers make sense of it all in the form of various different flow charts and "cheat sheets," like the one below from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ernest314/">ernest314</a>. Another chart from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/12x594t/i_made_a_cheat_sheet_for_101_upgrades/">ChiefSach</a> breaks it down in a different way.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-new-simple-upgrade-system-is-resulting-in-some-complex-cheat-sheets/1100-6513919/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Has A Clever Warning If You Break The Game

<p dir="ltr">Sequence-breaking video games is a long and veritable tradition that dates back to the early days of the hobby, but Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has an unusual way of dealing with it. As shown by <a href="https://twitter.com/StellaNoxEclair/status/1655344344134459392">several players</a> on social media, if you manage to skip significant portions of the game, an error message will pop up and ask you to reload a save. </p><p dir="ltr">As shown in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FallenOrder/comments/133ux8x/survivor_found_a_sequence_break_on_the_3rd_planet/">this post</a>, the prompt cites an "unexpected error" and reads as follows: "You seem to have bypassed certain story elements. Continuing to play from this point may encounter issues. If you choose to proceed anyway, loading any future saves from the Title Screen will give you the option to reload prior to this point."</p><p dir="ltr">This sort of warning is quite unusual in video games--I asked other members of GameSpot's staff if they've seen this before, and the only one that comes to mind is The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind. That game displays a message that says "the thread of prophecy is severed," which has become an <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/with-this-characters-death">internet meme</a>. However, that warning only appears when you kill an NPC that is necessary to the plot, rather than accessing an area. And just like in Morrowind, it's nice that the game gives you the option of continuing if you know what you're doing, rather than forcing you back. That would be a real bummer for speedrunners.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-has-a-clever-warning-if-you-break-the-game/1100-6513916/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Despite speculation among fans, Gilroy put the rumors to rest with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/rogue-one-directors-cut-deleted-scenes-1235479864/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm not going to go into any more detail," Gilroy told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview before the writers' strike. "But the more authority that you hear people talk about online about what happened on that movie, the less they know. That's all that needs to be said."</p><p dir="ltr">Gilroy went on to say that while there may have been unused footage that could have resulted in a different story, the version released in theaters was "the absolute best version of that movie that you could possibly imagine in the time that was given."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-gilroy-shuts-down-rogue-one-re-edit-rumors/1100-6513913/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Author George R.R. Martin has clarified how the ongoing Hollywood writers' strike is affecting his various projects, including his Game of Thrones shows, House of the Dragon Season 2 and The Hedge Knight. Martin also revealed that one of his planned new shows, Wild Cards, is not moving ahead at its current network.</p><p><a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2023/05/07/strike/">In a blog post</a>, Martin confirmed reports that House of the Dragon Season 2 will continue in London and Wales because the scripts were already locked "long before the strike began."</p><p>"Every episode has gone through four or five drafts and numerous rounds of revisions, to address HBO notes, my notes, budget concerns, etc. There will be no further revisions. The writers have done their jobs; the rest is in the hands of the directors, cast and crew‚Ä¶ and of course the dragons)," Martin said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-on-how-writers-strike-affects-his-game-of-thrones-shows/1100-6513911/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Antiques Roadshow Says This 1999 Collection Of Pokemon Cards Is Worth Up To $10,000

<p dir="ltr">Pokemon cards are a big deal these days, and while the market has come down to Earth a bit in the past two years, they're still worth quite a bit of money. Case in point: One person who took a binder of original cards to Antiques Roadshow for appraisal was told that they're likely worth in the $5,000 to $10,000 range.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">As shown in the above video, the owner says that their mother bought the cards on the internet sometime in the late 1990s. Appraiser Travis Landry explains that the continued popularity of Pokemon as a media franchise led to an explosion of card values during the pandemic. Landry further states that the binder of cards is the 1999 base set, which is the first 102 cards. The set also includes the 16 original holographic cards, which are among the most valuable.</p><p dir="ltr">Landry also explains that there was a brief period of time where cards were printed without shadows, which resulted in "shadowless" cards that are highly prized by collectors. The appraiser estimates that the shadowless Mewtwo card is in the $800 to $1,200 range, and that the shadowless Charizard is $2,000 to $3,000. However, Landry notes that the market for Pokemon cards is "extremely volatile," and that shadowless Charizards sold for up to $15,000 in early 2021. As a whole, though, it's likely that the owner will have to get the cards graded by a third party like CGC in order to get their full value.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/antiques-roadshow-says-this-1999-collection-of-pokemon-cards-is-worth-up-to-10000/1100-6513912/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">If you ever thought Scarlet Witch's storylines in WandaVision and Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness didn't quite fit together, you're not alone. In fact, Scarlet Witch herself Elizabeth Olsen noticed the quirks while filming the movie sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfK0JmirhHU">Vanity Fair</a> (and spotted by <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1278238/elizabeth-olsen-says-the-doctor-strange-2-writers-hadnt-seen-wandavision/">/Film</a>), Olsen revealed there apparently was a disconnect between the creatives behind Disney+'s WandaVision and the Doctor Strange sequel. "It's a similar arc in Multiverse of Madness that it is in WandaVision. There could be parallel stories being told there of dealing with grief and loss. Well, I proposed that to the writers of Multiverse," Olsen said with a laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">"I said, 'Do you know what we're doing in WandaVision? Have you seen it?'

## Payday 3 Trailer Is Literally Just A Guy Standing In A Dark Room, Gameplay Coming This Summer

<p dir="ltr">We already knew that Payday 3 is on the way, but we'll soon see how it's shaping up this summer. An incredibly short new teaser trailer has let us all know that its gameplay reveal is coming this summer, though a specific date was not mentioned.</p><p dir="ltr">The teaser trailer depicts the silhouette of a man in a trenchcoat in a darkened room lit only by the glow of screens. The man says: "Alright, it's a simple job." That line is followed by the reveal that gameplay is coming this summer. It's a simple teaser, but judging by the social media response, it got the job done. "Words cannot describe how hyped I am for this game," reads the current top YouTube comment.</p><p dir="ltr">Payday 3 is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-payday-3-details-revealed-about-the-setting-story-and-more/1100-6497340/">soft reboot</a> for the franchise that takes place several years after Payday 2, featuring the original four characters of Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf. It takes place in New York City and will feature new hazards and opportunities such as the dark web, cryptocurrency, and mass surveillance. Starbreeze boss Tobias Sjogren said in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/finally-starbreeze-eyes-up-its-payday">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that he feels <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-dev-knows-pressure-is-on-to-deliver-with-sequel/1100-6513008/">pressure to deliver</a> with the sequel, especially given that the franchise has already reached 40 million people. Starbreeze's last game, Overkill's The Walking Dead, was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overkills-the-walking-dead-failed-to-meet-quality-/1100-6465217/">major disappointment</a>, but Payday 3 has already been "fully financed" through a deal with Koch Media.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-trailer-is-literally-just-a-guy-standing-in-a-dark-room-gameplay-coming-this-summer/1100-6513904/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

If you're looking to jump into Nintendo's latest Zelda game, you're going to need the right gear to set the mood, and we've rounded up the best Hylian fashion below. While we (sadly) can't offer you a doctor's note that <em>definitely </em>isn't legal, we can point you in the right direction to get some stylish hoodies and T-shirts.</p><p>The T-shirts below feature a wide range of prints. If you want something simple but distinctive, there are some lovely shirts featuring magical seals and crests found throughout the game world. For something bolder, you can also grab vibrant prints of Link, Princess Zelda, and a Boss Bokoblin on this clothing.</p><p>Summer is creeping up, but seeing as how there's still a chill in the air, you can grab some official hoodies as well. There's nothing too fancy or ostentatious here, with the majority of the hoodies being your usual black pullovers that have a front pocket, but the Hylian designs and seals lend themselves really well to this warm clothing.</p><p>If clothing isn't what you're looking for, you can also check out this deal on the official <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-collectors-edition-strategy-guide-preorders-are-live/1100-6513899/">Tears of the Kingdom strategy guides</a>, but don't be surprised if the collector's edition sells out real fast.

<p>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3. director James Gunn has revealed that he came up with the backstory for the Infinity Stones in an hour and a half.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukt8H1yGcYY&amp;t=173s&amp;ab_channel=PhaseZero">Phase Zero</a>, Gunn and the cast played a quiz revolving around the MCU and when asked to name all six Infinity Stones, the filmmaker revealed that he didn't put much thought in when coming up with the backstory for each of them.</p><p>Gunn explained that the scene in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1. where The Collector told the Guardians the history of the Infinity Stones--which laid the groundwork for the Infinity Saga--was written quickly and ultimately led to everything in the MCU being based around this scene.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-gunn-came-up-with-mcu-infinity-saga-in-90-minutes-i-just-made-up-this-bullsht/1100-6513907/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Today, Respawn gave players a good look at the stylish new cosmetics scheduled to hit Apex Legends when Arsenal goes live tomorrow, May 9.</p><p dir="ltr">With this season's debut legend, Ballistic, being known for taking down the competition in style, it's no surprise that the Arsenal battle pass would lean into Ballistic's over-the-top aesthetic. As seen in the trailer, the Arsenal battle pass is stuffed to the gills with 110 levels of eye-catching cosmetics with a deadly-but-beautiful flair.</p><p dir="ltr">Horizon's new "Singularity Specialist" Legendary-tier cosmetic skin takes center stage in the new trailer--or was meant to, anyway. But for all its charm, Horizon's new skin was immediately overshadowed by Wattson's Legendary-tier "System Shock" cosmetic skin, a brightly-colored cyberpunk getup that features a purple-haired Wattson sporting heterochromatic eyes--one of which appears to be artificial. New legend skins for Lifeline, Gibraltar, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-ballistic-abilities-lore-and-everything-we-know/1100-6513514/">Season 17's debut legend, Ballistic,</a> are also featured in the trailer, but players will have to wait until launch day to learn more about those skins.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wattson-skin-steals-the-show-in-apex-legends-season-17-battle-pass-trailer/1100-6513905/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A new clip for Transformers: Rise of the Beasts has rolled out, showing off the first meeting between the Optimus Prime's Autobots and the Maximals led by Optimus Primal. It's not exactly a friendly get-together judging by the number of ion blasters that have been drawn, but if you've been looking to get a more detailed glimpse at Primal, Cheetor, and Rhinox, then the clip below will help reignite some Beast Wars nostalgia.</p><div>          </div><p> </p><p>On top of that, Paramount has also released stylish new posters for the film, which feature Prime, Primal, Bumblebee, Arcee, Cheetor, Rhinox, Airazor, and Mirage all striking a pose. If you squint closely, you'll also spot Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback in the main poster, with the two actors playing new allies of the Autobots. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts also marks the first full live-action appearance of Unicron, after he was previously teased in Transformers: The Last Knight, with the ancient planet-eater's forces led by his herald Scourge.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-gets-new-clip-and-stylish-posters/1100-6513903/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The guide includes a full walkthrough, but it promises to be convenient to use if you simply want to just use it as a reference point.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-collectors-edition-strategy-guide-preorders-are-live/1100-6513899/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Nintendo's first-party games seldom go on sale, and with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom testing the waters for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-says-70-switch-game-pricing-will-be-evaluated-on-a-case-by-case-basis/1100-6511366/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">$70 games from the company</a>, that price keeps rising. There is a way around this though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/preorder-zelda-and-pikmin-4-with-switch-game-vouchers-to-save-30/1100-6511086/">Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers</a> can grant you a sizable discount, but you might want to read the fine print first before you grab them.</p><p>Nintendo's elevator pitch for these game vouchers is that once you've purchased them, you'll be able to use them on two games from Nintendo's library. The Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers cost $100 and can only be purchased if you have a Nintendo Switch Online account, effectively saving you $20 in the process as Nintendo's games typically have a $60 price tag. The list of eligible games includes some heavy-hitters like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but the catch here is that these vouchers have an expiration date attached to them.</p><p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/">Per Nintendo's website</a>, you'll have 12 months to redeem the vouchers <em>and </em>you must have an active Nintendo Switch Online membership. "Paid Nintendo Switch Online membership required at the time of purchase and redemption of Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers. Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers must be redeemed within 12 months from purchase date, have no cash value, and cannot be transferred, returned, or redeemed for cash," the text reads.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-game-vouchers-have-a-requirement-you-might-not-have-realized/1100-6513895/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
