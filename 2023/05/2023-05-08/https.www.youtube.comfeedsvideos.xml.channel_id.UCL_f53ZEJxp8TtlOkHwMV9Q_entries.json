Peterson and Karol Markowicz discuss many of the topics found in her new national best-selling book, \u201cStolen Youth.\u201d Together, they break down the current state of K-12 academia, the pornographic books being pushed into your child's hands, and the broader discussion we need to have about woke-ism in the West and where to draw the line.\n\nKarol Markowicz is a weekly columnist at the New York Post and FoxNews, a contributor at Spectator World, and a contributing writer to Washington Examiner magazine. She has written for USA Today, Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, Time, Forward, National Review, Daily Beast, Business Insider, Haaretz, and many others.
