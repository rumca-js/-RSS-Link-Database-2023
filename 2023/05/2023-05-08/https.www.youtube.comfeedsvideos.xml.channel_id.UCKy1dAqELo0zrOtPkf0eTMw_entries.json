IGN spoke to two of the speedrunning community's most prolific Breath of the Wild speedrunners to see what they're planning for Nintendo's next big game. In other news, Forbes assembled a list of the top 15 worst-reviewed games on Steam, and Bethesda's recent dud, Redfall, made the cut. Hopefully users will re-evaluate the game after some necessary patches have been released. Another teaser for Payday 3 has dropped, and true to its teaser nature, it didn't show much of anything. It's been nearly 10 years since Payday 2, so we're betting fans can wait until later this year for gameplay. And finally, Sony has announced the closure of PixelOpus, a small developer under the Sony banner that was behind Concrete Genie and Entwined.\n\n#IGN #LegendOfZelda", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCl2rBWllzw", "date_published": "2023-05-08 23:12:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Street Fighter 6 - Official Open Beta Announcement Trailer", "description": "Watch the latest trailer for Street Fighter 6 revealing the open beta for the fighting game will be available from May 19 to May 21 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam. \n\nThe content of the open beta, which is the same as the closed beta test #2, will feature 8 characters, the Battle Hub experience, and online crossplay.\n\n#IGN #SF6", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCMXkq1TNPw", "date_published": "2023-05-08 23:00:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Meg 2: The Trench - Official Trailer (2023) Jason Statham, Wu Jing, Sophia Cai", "description": "Check out the trailer for Meg 2: The Trench, an upcoming movie starring Jason Statham, Wu Jing, Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Skyler Samuels, and Cliff Curtis.\n\nDive into uncharted waters with Jason Statham and global action icon Wu Jing as they lead a daring research team on an exploratory dive into the deepest depths of the ocean.
