It was reported by the LA Times as (emphasis mine) <em>"she saw what she <strong>believed</strong> to be a male penis."</em> As if you saw a penis, you would be the weird one for assuming it belong to a dude. Turns out, that was just a preview of what's to come. LAT laid the groundwork so that the Daily Mail could drop this headline on us: "<strong></strong><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12054769/Trans-woman-cleared-flashing-penis-YMCA-shes-FAT-genitals-visible.html" target="_blank">Trans woman is cleared of flashing her penis at three women using Ohio YMCA after judge ruled she's too FAT for her genitals to be visible</a>."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Trans woman is cleared of flashing penis because she's too FAT <a href="https://t.co/S5laD8F1J0">https://t.co/S5laD8F1J0</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/MailOnline?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MailOnline</a><br />‚Äî Bo Snerdley (@BoSnerdley) <a href="https://twitter.com/BoSnerdley/status/1655342747706851331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Darren and/or Rachel Glines (not sure how he/she/they were identifying at the time) liked to stay at the YMCA. So did several women and their children. What those women did not like to see was Glines' naked body in the women's locker room. Complaints were made. The women were told by the YMCA that Glines was a woman and that they, quote, "shouldn't have been disturbed by the incident" of a naked female penis in front of minors.</p><p>Side note. Is it me, or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ymca-elderly-woman-banned" target="_blank">does this happen at the YMCA</a> more than it does <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ycma-city-council-lockerroom-complaint" target="_blank">at other fitness centers</a>?</p><p>A lawsuit was filed. Now that I'm reading, the case was filed against Darren Glines. But since then, Darren goes by Rachel. Oh, and she still has her ding dong.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="38051" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33621597&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Glines had *checks notes* <em>her</em> day in court in front of Judge David McNamee. Judge McNamee ruled that while Glines' being in the locker room was not in question, they were allowed to be in the women's locker room because he was identifying as a she.</p><p>Then there is this ruling:</p><blockquote>Quiet simply, the facts do not exist to support a find of guilt, as charges. Glines' genitalia was not visible as a result of other portions of her body covering same.</blockquote><p>I know what you're thinking: "Brodigan, that's fat-shaming!" You would think so! But as it turns out it was PART of the defense. Glines' lawyers argued that because -- <em>she</em> -- was such a fat f*ck, her giant gut covered her penis. So there is no way those women, including the three minors, could have been exposed to the penis. It wasn't fat-shaming. it was brilliant lawyering.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Just when I think 2023 can't get any more 2023ish, a fat transwoman is found not guilty because she is too fat too show off her penis. This is now legal precedence in America.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Also, it was recorded on a school iPad. Also, it happened in the classroom. Also, the teacher was present. Also, it was a week before parents were notified. Please take a moment to punch a hole in a wall if need be.</p><p>Heather Gonzales, an older cousin of the six-year-old, said the girl's parents were not aware anything happened until they noticed a change in their daughter's behavior. It was then the SIX-YEAR-OLD told her parents she was pressured to perform a sex act on a student while a second student recorded it on the school-issued iPad. The teacher was distracted with another student, and it appears missed the sexual assault happening in her classroom.</p><p>A state investigator didn't make it to the school until the following week. Gonzales says, "So, you mean to tell me abuse has been happening for a week and a half and these kids are still at the same desk? My cousin is still at a desk with all boys, having to see her abusers every day?"</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Hotel üè® and car üöó Booked‚Ä¶ Be seeing you soon <a href="https://twitter.com/PlainviewTX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PlainviewTX</a> with every media outlet in the country THIS WILL NOT BE SILENCED AND THAT GIRL AND HER FAMILY WILL HAVE JUSTICE AS WELL AS ANY TOO SCARED TO COME FORWARD! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hiddeninplainviewtx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#hiddeninplainviewtx</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wetheparents?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#wetheparents</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/plainviewisd?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#plainviewisd</a> <a href="https://t.co/SdHXrHgMG6">pic.twitter.com/SdHXrHgMG6</a><br />‚Äî Highly Versed (@imhighlyversed) <a href="https://twitter.com/imhighlyversed/status/1655137489273892864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The girl's great-aunt spoke out at a protest last week as parents demandd answers and, more importantly,  firings.

The incident -- where a six-year-old was sexually assaulted by another six-year-old while another six-year-old filmed it and screamed "Do it" -- occurred away from the full vision of the teacher. She was busy working with other students. </p><p>This was on 4/19. On 4/20, no longer distracted as she was the day before, the teacher noticed the password on the iPad had been changed and took it to IT, which is where the material was found.</p><p>The teacher, who didn't notice a sexual assault going on in her classroom while she was in the classroom, has been put on leave pending an investigation.</p><blockquote>The two parents/guardians of students suspected to be on the video were called. One parent/guardian answered, and the other was not able to be contacted until Monday April 24, 2023. The two parents/legal guardians were notified that concerning content was identified on the device and that Child Protective Services would be notified of the matter.</blockquote><p>It is unclear whether the victim's or the suspect's parents were spoken to on the 19th or the 24th. Or, in the case of the victim's parents, why the school superintendent didn't show up at their house to address them face to face. </p><p>I gotta be honest. I have nothing else to say here. I'm legit too disgusted to form sentences right now.</p><p>The best I can come up with is, in the name of justice, the parents of the victim should be allowed to show up and beat the shit out of the parents of the six-year-old rapist. His friend's parents too. If your son assaulted, filmed the assault, or cheered the assault on, you needed to be assaulted for raising such monsters.</p><p>Someone needs to be bludgeoned to within an inch of their life. Due to the age of the suspects, their parents are the most viable options.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## An overwhelming majority of Americans support science, oppose biological males competing in women's sports

One side of the debate, the side that believes in biology, feels that because boys are born with certain biological advantages in strength and athletics, it is unfair for them to compete against girls. Effectively robbing girls of opportunities like scholarships and being able to discover themselves as they learn, grow, and develop.</p><p>The other side of the debate is anti-science, votes Democrat, and thinks you're a transphobe. And according to a new Washington Post poll, there are a heckuva lot of transphobes in America.</p><p>In an article titled "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/05/05/trans-poll-gop-politics-laws/" target="_blank">Anti-trans laws backed by GOP find support</a>" -- remember, the media does NOT have a political viewpoint and is NOT the enemy of the people -- a majority oppose trans women (aka dudes) competing in women‚Äôs sports.<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/799032216692719686/1105098901100437554/image.png" target="_blank"></a></p><ul><li>62% oppose for youth sports</li><li>66% for high school sports</li><li>65% for college sports</li><li>65% for pro sports</li></ul><p>It's not the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/transgender-poll-girls-sports-man" target="_blank">first time polling has gone against the leftist narrative</a>. Shocking that after a few years of bullying and girls who went through puberty as boys <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/volleyball-player-north-carolina" target="_blank">giving other girls concussions</a>, the numbers didn't shift in the progressives' favor. If anything, they solidified on the side of fairness. </p><p>This poll comes after the entire Democrat Party voted against protecting girls' sports. Democrats have declared themselves the party of watching girls having <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/skateboarding-29-year-old" target="_self">their hopes and dreams</a> (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rugby-coach-transgender-ban" target="_self">and bones</a>) crushed <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chloe-barnes-track-state-championship" target="_self">by boys</a> who <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-riley-gaines" target="_self">went through male puberty</a>. It makes sense. These same Democrats also don't think <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/girls-school-sports-minnesota" target="_self">girls won't amount</a> to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-pennsylvania-girls-sports" target="_self">much in sports</a> anyway.</p><p>Fairness in sports wasn't the only bad news for the Democrat Party platform. A majority of respondents do not want gender issues discussed in elementary and middle schools.<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/799032216692719686/1105101814292033536/image.png" target="_blank"></a></p><ul><li>K-3rd grade: 77%</li><li>4th-5th grade: 70%</li><li>6th-8th grade: 52%</li><li>9th-12th grade: 36%</li></ul><p>And 57% of those polled believe in science and agree you're born either a boy or a girl.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## New video destroys media narrative about Jordan Neely's death: other passengers PRAISED the Marine?

I know, right? Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) tend to wait for facts to come in before trying to start a race war. They NEVER take an already volatile situation and douse it with gasoline. But this ONE time, they did.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The story we were given, based on one video, is that a white Marine murdered a black unhoused Michael Jackson impersonator and was released after being questioned by the police. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/subway-choke-show-notes" target="_blank">Details like his 40+ priors or him telling subway passengers he was ready to die?</a> Didn't matter. The narrative was cast.</p><p>And now it's been busted.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Why isn‚Äôt the media covering the fact that Daniel Penny was complemented by other passengers and also put Jordan Neely in the recovery position? <br /><br />Seems like key details to leave out. <a href="https://t.co/hA8qSNtrCu">pic.twitter.com/hA8qSNtrCu</a><br />‚Äî Mythinformed (@MythinformedMKE) <a href="https://twitter.com/MythinformedMKE/status/1655336512261611525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>We see that after subduing Neely, the Marine put him in what's called the "recovery position." It's done to open the airways and help the person regain consciousness. You can also see Neely still moving after being put in the recovery position. Now, if those two things don't lead you to believe that this wasn't a cold-blooded racist murder, maybe this third point will.</p><p>THE OTHER PASSENGERS THANKED THE MARINE FOR SUBDUING NEELY.</p><p>That would lead a rational person to believe Neely wasn't performing "Billie Jean" as much as he was making the subway car feel unsafe. You know, what with the way he was screaming "I'm not afraid to die" and New York City being New York City.</p><p>What happened BEFORE Neely was put in the chokehold, as of now, is unclear. That would provide additional context. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-neely-weekend-protests-subway" target="_blank">Though not do anything to convince protestors who have already been given their marching orders.</a> Maybe social media influencers like Rep. AOC will tweet they were wrong and apologize.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

The reason why he's one of the few is because of how vicious progressive haters get when you so much as acknowledge one of the Jesus-based religions. To which Pratt says, "Meh."</p><p>The star of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em> told the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-war-elon-musk" target="_blank">New York Post</a> that this is the way it's always been.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúIf I was of this world, they would love me just like that but as it is, I‚Äôve chosen out of this world. That‚Äôs John 15:18 through 20,‚Äù he shared.</blockquote><blockquote>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way it is, nothing new, 2,000 years ago they hated him, too,‚Äù he added, referencing Jesus Christ.</blockquote><p>Though, the Bible's teachings are only one way he deals with haters.</p><blockquote>Like a rhino, stick your head down, you keep driving forward, you have thick skin and if anyone gets in your way, you stick the horn right up their ass!</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>While Pratt has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-giant-cross-easter" target="_blank">never been afraid to share his faith</a>, the hate he gets for it is a bit much. The same people who hate him for being Christian <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-flag-shirt" target="_blank">also hate him for loving America</a>, so there's also that. The actor's most significant public profession of his faith was at the MTV Awards last decade, where he was asked to give the younger audience some life advice.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Chris Pratt throws back to being 'given 3 minutes to impart wisdom' to MTV. <br /><br />He spent it talking about God. <a href="https://t.co/5FmMhDIZQn">pic.twitter.com/5FmMhDIZQn</a><br />‚Äî Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1655544905081430018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>You also question how much hate there is, versus how much loud hate comes from a tiny group of people. "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-james-gunn-thor" target="_blank">Cancel Chris for being Christian</a>" was all the rage on Twitter.

## Oh my: Tucker Carlson is ready to launch network to go to war with Fox News, and has been talking with Elon Musk

We know Tucker Carlson has been fired from Fox News for unknown reasons (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-vanity-fair-show" target="_blank">though the most ridiculous is also the most likely</a>). According to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/07/fox-news-tucker-carlson" target="_blank">a report from Axios</a>, Tucker is ready to go to battle. And MAY be teaming up with Elon Musk.</p><p>A lot of this is based on sources talking under the condition of anonymity. It's a coin toss whether these are authorized leaks, or someone who heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend who heard it from another Tucker's messing around with Elon. The only notable on-the-record quote is from Carlson's attorney Bryan Freedman: "The idea that anyone is going to silence Tucker and prevent him from speaking to his audience is beyond preposterous."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Fox News is prepared to pay Carlson the TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS a year he's owed to keep him off the air. His Fox News contract runs until January 2025.</p><blockquote>"Now, we're going from peacetime to Defcon 1," the friend added. "His team is preparing for war. He wants his freedom."</blockquote><p>Tucker wants to build his own media outlet, but can't unless Fox lets him out of his current deal. This is where it being fargin' war comes in, because when it comes to Fox News, a source says Tucker "knows where a lot of bodies are buried and is ready to start drawing a map."</p><p>(Pssst...<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/megyn-kelly-tucker-carlson-fox" target="_blank">Megyn Kelly reported last week that Fox is down</a> in the 8:00 PM time slot 47% overall and FIFTY-NINE PERCENT in the 25-54 demo.)</p><p>Tucker launching his own network isn't newsy, per se. It's what all assumed he would do. The last time he got fired, he launched The Daily Caller. What's different this time is Carlson has an ally who hates the corporate media as much as he does.</p><blockquote>Behind the scenes: Axios has learned that Carlson and Elon Musk had a conversation about working together, but didn't discuss specifics.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Tucker Carlson. Elon Musk. ::cough::RUMBLE::cough::. If nothing else, it will make 2024 waaaaaaay more interesting.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
