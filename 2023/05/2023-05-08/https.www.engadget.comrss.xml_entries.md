<p>About 25 light years away from Earth lies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomalhaut">Fomalhaut</a>, one of the brightest stars in the night sky. The Fomalhaut system has captivated astronomers for decades, but it’s only now that we’re developing a better understanding of it thanks to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/jwst/">James Webb Space Telescope</a>. In a study published in the journal <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zNDE1NTAtMDIzLTAxOTYyLTYiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ3MDdjM2ZkLWIxZDctNGJlMy05M2JjLTFjZTIyNjAyYjVlMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdLiyxdbvfyImvaO0U9npvJEYv4eKVHpySxYeeXlt9rb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41550-023-01962-6"><em><ins>Nature Astronomy</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>on Monday, a group of scientists made up primarily of astronomers from the University of Arizona and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory say the Fomalhaut system is <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-109"><ins>far more complex than previously thought</ins></a>.</p><p>Since 1983, astronomers have known the 440 million-year-old Fomalhaut is surrounded by dust and debris, but what they didn’t expect to find was three different debris fields surrounding the star.

Outside of Fomalhaut’s inner asteroid belt, there is a second debris belt that is tilted at 23 degrees from everything else in orbit of the star. “This is a truly unique aspect of the system,”  András Gáspár, lead author on the study, told <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/webb-telescope-asteroids-fomalhaut-star"><em><ins>Science News</ins></em></a>. He added that the tilted belt could be the result of planets in orbit of Fomalhaut astronomers haven’t discovered yet.</p><p>“The belts around Fomalhaut are kind of a mystery novel: Where are the planets?” said George Rieke, one of the astronomers involved in the study. "I think it's not a very big leap to say there's probably a really interesting planetary system around the star.”</p><p>Yet out further out from Fomalhaut is an outer debris ring similar to our solar system’s Kuiper belt. It includes a feature Gáspár and his colleagues have named the Great Dust Cloud. It’s unclear if this feature is part of the Fomalhaut system or something shining from beyond it, but they suspect it was formed when two space rocks more than 400 miles wide collided with one another.  According to Gáspár and company, there may be three or more planets about the size of Uranus and Neptune orbiting Fomalhaut. They’re now analyzing JWST images that may reveal the existence of those planetoids.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/jwst-captures-images-of-the-first-asteroid-belts-seen-beyond-the-solar-system-192847989.html?src=rss

<p>The Chase Bliss MOOD MK1 micro-looper and delay pedal is now available for $245, which is a 30 percent cut from the original price of $350. The deal is available through <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e8c90726-6d93-44f8-97b0-21ecdf65b81e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Reverb&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlOGM5MDcyNi02ZDkzLTQ0ZjgtOTdiMC0yMWVjZGY2NWI4MWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9yZXZlcmIuY29tL2l0ZW0vMzMyNzk0NTEtY2hhc2UtYmxpc3MtYXVkaW8tbW9vZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWFkYzE4ZDEtNmQ0Yi00NDRmLThlY2MtZTE4YjM3MDM3NDMxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdlwLRGBfKLhBmfNuS2jR12uGgU_gS9Yu-df9_PM9egz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Freverb.com%2Fitem%2F33279451-chase-bliss-audio-mood">music retail giant Reverb</a> and <a href="https://www.chasebliss.com/mood">directly from Chase Bliss</a> and is only active “while supplies last." New Chase Bliss pedals and musical doodads rarely go on sale, and Reverb is offering free shipping, so this is a big one.</p><p></p><p>For the uninitiated, the MOOD MK1 has been one of the most popular delay pedals since originally launching in 2019, though it was discontinued after this year's launch of the MK2. The MK1, however, is no slouch, with two channels of granular delay along with the ability to bounce audio back and forth between each channel to create unique and evolving soundscapes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can also run loops through delay-powered effects and overdub additional content whenever you want. This is a modern pedal, so expect full MIDI implementation, dip-switches and the ability to both create and recall presets. The MK2 tidies up the sound a bit and implements some unique customization options, but it also costs $400, which likely accounts for the MK1 still sitting at number four on Reverb’s top seller’s list for pedals.</p><div id="81e156fd708b4ca1a27e350148a213f4"></div><p>Chase Bliss specializes in delay-adjacent pedals with similar design layouts and plenty of bells and whistles. We reviewed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chase-bliss-habit-review-guitar-effects-pedal-delay-looper-130017678.html">Chase Bliss Habit</a> last year and called the hardware a “step ahead of the competition."

## Bank of Canada asks for public feedback about a national digital currency

<p>The Bank of Canada wants the public’s opinions on a potential digital Canadian dollar. Although the country’s central bank says a national digital currency isn’t yet needed, it wants to remain flexible and ready should that ever change.</p><p>“As Canada’s central bank, we want to make sure everyone can always take part in our country’s economy. That means being ready for whatever the future holds,” said Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers in a <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/05/bank-canada-launches-public-consultations-digital-dollar/">press release</a> published today. The bank cites the diminishing use of cash, potential competition with cryptocurrencies and national economic stability as reasons to prepare for the potential shift.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The Bank has been providing bank notes to Canadians for more than 85 years,” its announcement states. “Cash is a safe, accessible and trusted method of payment that anyone can use, including people who don’t have a bank account, a credit score or official identification documents. However, there may come a time when bank notes are not widely used in day-to-day transactions, which could risk excluding many Canadians from taking part in the economy.”</p><div id="288f64364f6043ad9f53afcf3b624c0d"></div><p>Although cryptocurrency is less of a threat to traditional financial institutions after last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftx-collapse-could-affect-more-than-one-million-investors-111742474.html">epic collapses</a>, it’s still a looming danger that likely motivated this move. If decentralized currencies ever became widely enough used to reduce demand for the Canadian dollar, that could threaten the bank’s (and government’s) ability to assert control over the economy, maintain stability and implement policies. “A digital Canadian dollar would ensure Canadians always have an official, safe, and stable digital payment option issued by Canada’s central bank,” the bank says. But it also emphasized that, even if it eventually launched a national digital currency, it would still issue bank notes for anyone who wants them. “Cash isn’t going anywhere,” it unequivocally states.</p><p>The survey is a standard <a href="https://survey.forumresearch.com/SE/1/BCA1/">online questionnaire</a> about how Canadians would likely use digital currency, which security features are essential, and their concerns about accessibility and privacy. “We want to hear from Canadians about what they value most in the design of a digital dollar. This will help us make design choices and ensure that it is secure, reliable and meets the needs of Canadians,” said Rogers. The bank says Canadians’ feedback “will be kept anonymous, confidential, and be reported in aggregate only.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bank-of-canada-asks-for-public-feedback-about-a-national-digital-currency-172630056.html?src=rss

## The Ayaneo Air Plus is the next would-be Steam Deck killer

<p>If you’ve been following the handheld PC craze of late, you’ll know it’s a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/handheld-gaming-pc-retro-indie-handhelds-steam-deck-playdate-150038001.html">very kinetic category</a>. And with ASUS throwing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-hands-on-possibly-the-most-powerful-handheld-gaming-pc-yet-140054506.html">its hat in the ring</a>, expect to see even more gaming handhelds trying to steal a bit of the Steam Deck’s lunch. Ayaneo, a relatively unknown player just a couple of years ago, has become one of the more prolific names in this space and its newest handheld - <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-air-plus-slide-handheld-gaming-pc-143046438.html">the Air Plus</a> - is its latest effort to tempt folk over to the warm waters of portable PC gaming.</p><p>If the Air Plus looks familiar, that’s because it’s the third iteration of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-air-pro-gaming-handheld-review-180003707.html">Ayaneo’s “Air” series</a> and it comes with a choice of either AMD or Intel chipsets. The model we’re looking at here has the Ryzen 6800U processor meaning it’s technically very similar to the Ayaneo 2 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-2-review-specs-price-a-more-premium-and-pricier-take-on-the-steam-deck-143039617.html">we reviewed in Spring</a>. Why make two handhelds with very similar specs? Because many people want the performance of the Ayaneo 2 in a more portable formfactor. While both are portable in the broadest sense of the word, the Air Plus is a shade smaller than a Nintendo Switch (albeit somewhat thicker), unlike the Ayaneo 2 which has a profile closer to the Steam Deck.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We should clarify right up top that this generation of Windows-based gaming handhelds don’t come cheap. While the base/64GB Steam Deck costs $400, the entry level Ayaneo Air Plus will set you back <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-air-plus-the-lightest-amd-6800u-handheld#/">$790 for early birds</a> before it retails for $979. That’s a <em>lot </em>more money - even if you chose the Steam Deck with the same internal storage (512GB), that would still only cost $649. That said, a lot of people really don’t like the size and weight of Valve’s handheld and appreciate the extra flexibility and power most of these alternatives offer. The success of Ayaneo’s<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-2-completely-different-amd-6800u-handheld#/"> last Indiegogo campaign</a> tells us there’s an appetite for these devices regardless.</p><figure><img alt="Ayaneo Air Plus." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/b312d1b0-edb2-11ed-9ff7-61a094b9ea51" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>While size is a key selling point here (the Steam Deck is over 2 inches wider and an inch taller), perhaps more importantly, Valve's handheld is over 5oz (145g) heavier. That extra heft does allow for more controls — there are no touchpads or rear buttons here. That said, the Ayaneo sneaks in a few clever controls along the top and on the lower edge for tasks like bringing up the onscreen keyboard or jumping out of Ayaspace to the desktop. The Air Plus also sports two USB-C ports which opens up the possibility to use peripherals at the same time as charging it.</p><p>The Air Plus isn’t quite a straight processor upgrade from the Air Pro — there’s also a larger battery (46.2Wh up from the Pro’s 38Wh and the original Air’s 28Wh), along with a new 6-inch 1080p display.  There are also some other minor cosmetic tweaks that put the power button and headphone jack on the left and right respectively - the inverse of the models before them. The Plus is also about half an inch (13mm) wider than the original Air and Air Pro, which means if you had a case for one of those, it won’t fit the new model, sorry.</p><p>The first time you turn on the Ayaneo Plus, you’ll go through a minor bit of Windows setup. After that you’ll be dumped into Ayaspace, the company’s launcher that is designed to make the experience feel a bit more like a console than a tiny PC. It’s worth pointing out that Ayaspace is functional but you’ll regularly find yourself dealing with Windows. Navigating it is easy enough, with the left analog stick controlling the mouse aided by a physical shortcut button up top that brings up the on-screen keyboard. But it’s also not the smoothest experience if you’re coming over from something like the Steam Deck.</p><figure><img alt="Ayaneo Air Plus." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/1e265170-edb3-11ed-baa7-c751a1697efd" style="height: 1279px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Aaron Souppouris / Engadget</div></figure><p>For the most part, compatibility with the Air Plus should be greater than that of Valve’s rival, just by virtue of it running vanilla Windows. And as true as that is, you can still find yourself hitting a few bugs and glitches. When I installed <em>Red Dead Redemption 2 </em>(RDR2)<em>&nbsp;</em>I had to google around to find out how to enter full screen mode (hint: change the graphics API in advanced settings to DirectX 12). When I tried to install <em>Hotline Miami</em>, I was prompted to install the .NET framework, which is about as fun as it sounds and then it loaded in a window far too big for the display (using Ayaspace’s resolution picker and then alt-tabbing out and back into the game fixed).</p><p>Quirks like this are definitely the exception not the rule, but common enough that if you’re looking for that dedicated gaming console experience, know that it’s not quite there yet. You can disable Ayaspace if you wish and use something like Steam’s Big Picture mode if that’s where your games are. You could also just launch things right from the desktop, too. But for all its shortcomings, Ayaspace does have some handy features and is a decent experience <em>most</em> of the time. Some industrious folks have even managed to get SteamOS running on Ayaneo devices, but the compromises still don’t make it an attractive alternative. After all, once you’re in a game you soon forget about the OS behind it.</p><p>However you get there, once launched, everything look great on the 6-inch IPS display. It’s a shame that it’s not an OLED panel like the one on the Air Pro, but the larger size more than makes up for it, and it’s nice and bright with a decent contrast ratio and color reproduction. Side by side with the equally-sized display on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ayn-odin-review-203045715.html">Ayn Odin</a>, the two are pretty close, but the Ayaneo is a little more vibrant.</p><figure><img alt="Ayaneo Air Plus." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/836756b0-edb3-11ed-afe6-7bb6f031140c" style="height: 1416px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>I’ve been chipping away at <em>Disco Elysium</em> for too long now, but having the chance to bring it with me on my travels with the Air Plus has exponentially increased my play time. While it’s not the most processor-intensive game, its unique art style looks fantastic here, and it runs at a full 60 fps at720p using just 10W TDP (thermal design power) - broadly speaking the setting that determines the amount of power you’re willing to give to the CPU at the expense of battery life. With these settings I was typically getting about three hours of play time per charge.</p><p>With something more intensive, like <em>RDR2</em>, you’ll have to jack the TDP up as it won’t run smoothly at 10W. With medium settings and even just 12 TDP I was enjoying 40-50 fps and about 2.5 hours of battery life. If I wanted Arthur’s expeditions up into the snowy mountains to look extra slick, 15- or 20W TDP would make 1080p and 60 fps possible but with a severe hit on play time - dropping down to about 1.25 hours. This can reach back up to 2 hours if you sacrifice either fps or drop back down to 720p.</p><p>So yeah, that’s not a fantastic outlook for more demanding games on higher settings, but with a few minor concessions you can still have a great experience, one that will see you through a good chunk of a flight or kill a lazy afternoon without having to hangout near an outlet. If you’re into less demanding games like <em>Persona 4 Golden</em> or certainly things like <em>Hotline Miami</em>, <em>Trine </em>or <em>Celeste </em>you can likely get away with a lower TDP and flirt with around four hours of play time. There’s enough anecdotal evidence that the Steam Deck can often run games well at lower TDPs, giving it longer play times for certain titles, but either way these machines are all power hungry right now.</p><figure><img alt="Ayaneo Air Plus" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/9ff7cee0-edb3-11ed-bffa-04f02e87da3d" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>For the brave, the Plus will go up to a maximum of 28W TDP, which means it can run quite a lot of AAA titles at higher settings, but you’re going to want to do that while plugged in. And, arguably, that defeats half the purpose of a portable device. But if you want to bring your games with you when you travel, rather than rely on WiFi for streaming, or simply prefer to play on something like this even when at home on the couch (which is me, to be fair), this is obviously less of an issue. In fact, right now, one could argue that these handhelds are most attractive to those looking for a hybrid option that allows them to break free from the PC even if that is just to play in the lounge and take on the odd flight.</p><p>Regardless of your motives, if you’re excited by handheld gaming PCs, then the Air Plus is a competent, if decadent alternative to the Steam Deck that offers generally higher performance. If Ayaneo can refine the software experience and, (at least going forward), the price, then this whole category could get a lot more interesting.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-air-plus-mini-steam-deck-163047036.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/samsung/"><ins>Samsung</ins></a> has revealed that the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the Health Monitor app's irregular heart rhythm notification (IHGN) feature for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/galaxy-watch/"><ins>Galaxy Watch</ins></a> devices. The company says that, along with the wearable's electrocardiogram (ECG) capabilities, the feature can help to identify signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), a type of arrhythmia.</p><p>AFib is widely believed to be an alarm bell for potentially major cardiovascular issues that can lead to increased risk of stroke, heart failure and other complications. In some cases, those with AFib are asymptomatic.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Galaxy Watch's BioActive Sensor will look for irregular heart rhythms in the background after the wearer activates the function in the Samsung Health Monitor app. If the sensor picks up several irregular measurements consecutively, the watch will alert the wearer to possible AFib activity. The notification will suggest that the user takes an ECG reading for a more accurate measurement. If the reading detects signs of AFib, the watch will urge the wearer to consult their doctor.</p><p>Except for the original model, every Apple Watch has offered an IHGN feature in certain markets <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-28-apple-watchos-ecg-app.html"><ins>since 2019</ins></a>.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-portable-wireless-speakers-spring-2021-140023128.html">Sony's X-Series party speakers</a> typically have few tricks up their sleeves to power your gatherings.

Besides a built-in light show, karaoke mode and more, this speaker is also equipped with an optical port to connect to your television.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to a TV Sound Booster feature, the SRS-XV800 can add "deep bass and room-filling sound" to any TV. Sony says the speaker's two rear tweeters and X-Balanced Speaker units combine to offer "realistic" highs and upgraded low-end tone to movies and shows. The company explains that sound from the XV800 bounces off the walls to "surround the listener" and enhances things like live performances. To use TV Sound Booster, you'll need to connect your TV to the speaker with an optical cable, so you'll need a display with that connection in order to employ the tool. This feature is currently available <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/speakers/wireless-speakers/p/srsxv900">on the SRS-XV900</a>, but that larger unit will cost you $150 more.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In terms of core party speaker features, the SRS-XV800 offers omni-directional sound that Sony says can deliver audio to "every corner of the room." There are five tweeters total, sending "clear" treble to both the front and the back of the unit. Two X-Balanced drivers pump out "higher clarity, less distortion and punchy bass" to complete the sound profile. As a reminder, those X-Balanced speakers are rectangular instead of round or square, which Sony says not only increases area but also increases sound pressure that leads to improved bass and overall clarity. My colleague Jon Turi has observed "big and bassy" sound on Sony's party speakers in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html">best portable Bluetooth speaker guide</a>, noting that the SRS-XP700 is a good option for "loud, thumping beats."&nbsp;</p><p>Sony says you can expect up to 25 hours of battery life on the XV800, but that's with the customizable, built-in light show turned off. If you find yourself in a pinch, a 10-minute charge will give you up to three hours of use. This speaker is portable, but it's also a beast. Sony added wheels and a handle so you don't have to carry this behemoth when you need to relocate it. In terms of entertainment, the XV800 has inputs for a karaoke mic and guitar alongside the ability to manage playlists, karaoke voice effects and more inside the Music Center and Fiestable apps. Lastly, the speaker's IPX4 rating protects your investment from errant splashes (IPX2 when horizontal).</p><figure><img alt="Sony SRS-XB100" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/7fc70a00-eda9-11ed-bbfe-95f95a614216" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption>Sony SRS-XB100</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>Sony is also debuting a new, tiny portable speaker today. <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/speakers/wireless-speakers/p/srsxv800">The SRS-XB100</a> replaces <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-portable-wireless-speakers-spring-2021-140023128.html">the SRS-XB13</a> in the company's compact Bluetooth lineup with a familiar design. The short, cylindrical unit has a Sound Diffusion Processor to spread sound further in any environment, powered by a passive radiator and an off-center diaphragm. Sony says these components muster big sound that remains clear even at higher volumes. And yes, you can use two of these for a stereo pair or connect even more for a louder setup. The XB100 is IP67 rated so you don't need to worry even if you drop it in the pool. The company says the speaker will last up to 16 hours on a charge and a built-in microphone can be used for calls. Sony explains the mic is equipped with Echo Cancelling tech so that two people can talk at the same time without being cut off.</p><p>Both the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LVNSUy1YVjgwMC1TcGxhc2gtUmVzaXN0YW50LUhvdXItQmF0dGVyeS1PbW5pZGlyZWN0aW9uYWwvZHAvQjBDMjlSR0M4TD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby14NS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmI2MmNiNjgtZjMxOS00NzQ2LTk3ZWYtN2M2ZjdmMWQwZjAyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeD1QXypY4De-E99oKk7IqDQeVmOW4-mreZG5Zy_hLz2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-SRS-XV800-Splash-Resistant-Hour-Battery-Omnidirectional%2Fdp%2FB0C29RGC8L">SRS-XV800</a> and the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LUxpZ2h0d2VpZ2h0LVN1cGVyLUNvbXBhY3QtRXh0cmEtRHVyYWJsZS1XYXRlcnByb29mL2RwL0IwQzI5Qkw4QlM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8teDUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJiNjJjYjY4LWYzMTktNDc0Ni05N2VmLTdjNmY3ZjFkMGYwMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAezPWp0J_NPhfuBzNxkQpgIVBAzoKQIGZq6cCgMoX6c3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-Lightweight-Super-Compact-Extra-Durable-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB0C29BL8BS">SRS-XB100</a> will be available for pre-order starting today.

## 'Oppenheimer' trailer shows Chris Nolan's take on the birth of the atomic bomb

<p>You'll soon see Hollywood's treatment of one of the most important (and dangerous) moments in scientific history. Universal has <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj11WVBiYmtzSnhJZyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWI0MzJjMmEtNmUwNS00MmQ5LTg1NTctY2ZiYzFlZGY4ZTIwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbBLHP4Vn-vXVA-jw2FbETx9y0jcrfuwsjvbO1Js1SWN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DuYPbbksJxIg">released</a> a trailer for <em>Oppenheimer</em>, Christopher Nolan's biopic of the physicist who played a key role in developing and testing the first atomic bomb. The clip underscores the ethical issues surrounding the Manhattan Project and its work. While the team is hopeful that nuclear weapons will end World War II and usher in a new era of peace, they're also worried abut sparking an apocalyptic arms race — the movie doesn't end with the detonation.</p><p>The adaptation of Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin's <em>American Prometheus</em> book stars Cillian Murphy (<em>Peaky Blinders</em>) as its namesake scientist, with Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Katherine. Matt Damon plays Manhattan Project directo Gen. Leslie Groves Jr., while Robert Downey Jr. plays US Atomic Energy Commission co-founder Lewis Strauss. Rami Malek, Matthew Modine and Alden Ehrenreich also star.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="439cb11b245c4ff98c35e5cb01546aa5"></div><p>Nolan's reputation and the top-tier cast will be the draws for many. However, this is also a rare movie that explores the role science played in WWII, not to mention in setting the stage for the Cold War and nuclear energy. The production of the movie is also notable. This is the first movie to feature sections of IMAX black-and-white film footage, so it may be worth heading to a supporting theater to get the full experience.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/oppenheimer-trailer-shows-chris-nolans-take-on-the-birth-of-the-atomic-bomb-152022327.html?src=rss

<p>Graduating high school is a huge milestone, but the transition to young adulthood that comes just after can be as overwhelming as it is exciting. If you know a recent graduate, a good gift to celebrate the occasion could also make their next chapter more manageable. We’ve compiled a list of gadgets, gear and services that might help, whether the grad in your life is heading to college or entering the workforce.</p><h2>Anker Soundcore Life Q30</h2><p></p><p>A good set of noise-canceling headphones can help your grad get in the zone while studying, quiet the bustle of a new commute or just keep them relaxed on a flight back home. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb3VuZGNvcmUtQ2FuY2VsbGluZy1IZWFkcGhvbmVzLUNvbWZvcnRhYmxlLUJsdWV0b290aC9kcC9CMDhITVdaQlhDP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8teDAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE1MjdhOTI5LTM0ODQtNDdiYy1iYWZlLTE2NjBiMWQ1YjQ2MSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATFpPQ7Az_-YlDmbEloledu1xE-IZJRg6tuEBcSfg23y&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSoundcore-Cancelling-Headphones-Comfortable-Bluetooth%2Fdp%2FB08HMWZBXC%3Fth%3D1">Anker’s Soundcore Life Q30</a> are some of the few worthwhile noise-cancelers available for less than $100.

Its underside is soft yet stable, while its smooth top surface is easy to clean and large enough to fit a 17-inch laptop. There’s a stop at the bottom that helps keep their stuff from sliding off when the desk is slanted at an angle, as well as an elastic band for holding pens and notepads and a storage slot for phones. The accessory only weighs about two pounds on its own, while a built-in handle makes it easier to carry around.</p><h2>Google Chromecast with Google TV</h2><p></p><p>Cable TV isn’t known for being reasonably priced, but with a media streamer like <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOEtSVjdTMjI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8teDAtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE1MjdhOTI5LTM0ODQtNDdiYy1iYWZlLTE2NjBiMWQ1YjQ2MSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQissysQhdxHTbUoD_hZFd0mi0bUG3u_Dj9_OwtDmw6W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08KRV7S22">Google’s Chromecast</a>, your grad can cut the cord without missing what’s on. Though it launched back in 2020, the Chromecast still runs fast enough, supports all the major apps and can stream video in 4K and HDR (including Dolby Vision).

The bag folds up for tidier storage, and there are a few built-in handles that make it easier to lift up stairs or carry around campus. All told, Hulken says the bag can carry up to 66 pounds. Something like this might be <em>most</em> useful for city dwellers, but if your grad hasn’t done their own laundry and grocery shopping much before, it should take some weight off their shoulders, literally and figuratively.</p><h2>Away Carry-On suitcase</h2><p></p><p>The popular <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6c7ea5e4-08f7-4d5d-b49b-e40deacae105&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Away&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2YzdlYTVlNC0wOGY3LTRkNWQtYjQ5Yi1lNDBkZWFjYWUxMDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXdheXRyYXZlbC5jb20vc3VpdGNhc2VzL2NhcnJ5LW9uIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxNTI3YTkyOS0zNDg0LTQ3YmMtYmFmZS0xNjYwYjFkNWI0NjEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARfuSxa6RmIhnxth2AkRFKDWNk-1wqEQKq5KY70dpF_N&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.awaytravel.com%2Fsuitcases%2Fcarry-on">Away Carry-On</a> is a stylish and sturdy hard-sided suitcase your grad should appreciate when it’s time to come back home.

## Jack Dorsey-backed Bluesky is having a moment

<p>Bluesky, the Jack Dorsey-backed decentralized social network, isn’t publicly available yet but it’s already become one of the buzziest Twitter alternatives. Scoring an invite to the service, which has been in a closed beta for barely two months, has become a sought-after status symbol with invite codes selling for hundreds of dollars on <a href="https://gizmodo.com/bluesky-invite-codes-ebay-sell-buy-jack-dorsey-twitter-1850399628">eBay</a>.</p><p>The iOS app has been downloaded more than 375,000 times, according to analytics from data.ai, and the app has already become one of the most popular social media apps in the Play Store barely two weeks after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorseys-twitter-like-bluesky-app-arrives-on-android-063526715.html">launching</a>. Those numbers may not seem particularly impressive, but considering the app only has about 65,000 users – it’s clear that demand for the service is far outstripping the number of available invites.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>What is Bluesky?</h2><p>Bluesky started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-twitter-open-social-media-standard.html">in 2019</a> as an internal project at Twitter with the goal of creating an open source decentralized standard for social media. Dorsey, a longtime proponent of decentralized networks, had long championed the idea of such a standard, saying he hoped Twitter could one day “be a client of this standard.”</p><p>Bluesky went independent in 2021, and officially ended its association with Twitter in 2022 following Musk’s takeover of the company. Bluesky is now overseen by CEO Jay Graber, along with a small team of developers. Dorsey is still attached to the project — he has a seat on Bluesky’s board — but isn’t running the show like he once did at Twitter. “Jack doesn’t have unilateral power,” Graber wrote in a recent post on Bluesky. “I have the most control over this endeavor.”</p><p>Dorsey, who these days posts more often <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8wMy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2RvcnNleS1tdXNrLXR3aXR0ZXItYmx1ZXNreS1ub3N0ci5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlM2ViZTg3MS01NmVmLTQ1YmQtOGUxMi04MDAyMTE1NzgxM2IifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZCyvS6UKdyK1c0j10GgeWaybP30YnbYBI_ig6my_Pu4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F05%2F03%2Ftechnology%2Fdorsey-musk-twitter-bluesky-nostr.html">on Nostr</a>, his other decentralized social media of choice, is at least an occasional Bluesky user. He recently took to Bluesky to share his latest thoughts on Musk and how he has handled the Twitter acquisition. The former CEO, who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-elon-musk-twitter-takeover-034408777.html">once said</a> “Elon is the singular solution I trust,” said he thought Musk should have walked away from the Twitter deal, and that the company <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c74dfa40-0819-4a77-bf8d-8f48c11fd1b6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Life+Time+Fitness&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNzRkZmE0MC0wODE5LTRhNzctYmY4ZC04ZjQ4YzExZmQxYjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueWFob28uY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9qYWNrLWRvcnNleS1zYXlzLWVsb24tbXVzay0yMzMwMDA5MjcuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTNlYmU4NzEtNTZlZi00NWJkLThlMTItODAwMjExNTc4MTNiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQryuAGbuhVhmBmlYXZm-_KNA3tjnzbj1vQySuc3nveU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Flifestyle%2Fjack-dorsey-says-elon-musk-233000927.html">“went south”</a> after his acquisition.</p><p>The service itself looks and feels a lot like Twitter. Bluesky defaults to a chronological timeline of accounts you follow, but there’s also an algorithmic “what’s hot” feed that surfaces popular posts or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23701551/bluesky-skeets-now">“skeets”</a> as early users have dubbed them. It doesn’t yet have as much functionality as Twitter — for example, there are no direct messages or video support — but the interface is almost identical to Twitter.</p><p>Bluesky is also invitation-only, which has so far helped fuel its viral success. The platform began opening its waitlist more widely last month, and new users receive one invite code every two weeks (though some of the more prolific users get codes more often). Graber has said the invite system is meant to prevent spammers and others from easily gaining access to the platform, and to ensure it grows “organically.”</p><h2>How is it different from Mastodon?</h2><p>Both Bluesky and Mastodon are open source and decentralized, but there are some significant differences between the two. Mastodon is built on a protocol called <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/why-activitypub-is-the-future/">Activity Pub</a>, which has since been embraced by <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/10/protocol-based-social-media-is-having-a-moment-as-meta-medium-flipboard-and-mozilla-all-get-on-board/">other platforms</a> like Medium, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/flipboard-is-leaning-into-mastodon-and-away-from-twitter-160036103.html">Flipboard</a> and even <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/meta-mulls-a-twitter-competitor-codenamed-p92-that-will-be-interoperable-with-mastodon-10223961.html">Meta</a>.</p><p>Bluesky is building its own protocol, called the <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/10-18-2022-the-at-protocol">AT Protocol</a> or Authenticated Transfer Protocol. As the company notes on its <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/why-activitypub-is-the-future/">website,</a> Bluesky, the app, is meant to show off what the AT Protocol can do, similar to how early browsers demonstrated the potential of the web.</p><p>According to Bluesky, one of the biggest differences between AT and other decentralized social networking standards is how it handles account portability. “With the AT Protocol, you can move your account from one provider to another without losing any of your data or social graph,” the company <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/10-18-2022-the-at-protocol">explains</a>.</p><figure><img alt="Bluesky uses labels for moderation." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/fc280270-eb8d-11ed-9eb7-e38480860b3c" style="height: 540px; width: 1224px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bluesky</div></figure><p>Right now, Bluesky itself is running the only instance of the platform. But just as Mastodon has <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/servers">thousands</a> of servers available, there could eventually be numerous Bluesky servers run by other entities. That’s also where the emphasis on account portability comes in: it should make moving between servers fairly seamless, including taking your social graph with you when you move, which isn’t currently possible on Mastodon.</p><p>Bluesky is also taking an interesting approach to algorithms and moderation. On Mastodon, each server sets its own norms and moderation guidelines, which are enforced by admins. But while Bluesky’s team is to some extent setting their own norms for what’s currently <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-rival-bluesky-has-a-nudes-problem/">acceptable</a>, the app allows users to customize what level of moderation they want, ranging from “hide,” “warn,” or “show,” for things like hate speech, spam and impersonation.</p><figure><img alt="Bluesky lets you choose what level of moderation you want." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/619e96a0-eb8e-11ed-9aee-71b04e856212" style="height: 1086px; width: 984px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bluesky</div></figure><p>Right now, there are some moderation labels that appear on posts containing things like impersonation, but Graber says the goal is for labels to eventually be community-led so that moderations can function independently of individual servers. Graber has <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">dubbed</a> the approach “composable moderation.”</p><p>Similarly, the platform is planning a customizable take <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorseys-bluesky-is-building-a-marketplace-of-algorithms-184601024.html">on algorithms</a>. Graber has said Bluesky wants to create a “marketplace of algorithms” so users can be in control of how their feeds are filtered.</p><h2>Why is it suddenly so popular?</h2><p>Like many other Twitter-like services, there’s been increased interest in Bluesky since Elon Musk took over the company. Its early ties to Dorsey and Twitter has also fueled the curiosity of those searching for a new platform.</p><p>But it wasn’t until Bluesky began opening more of its waitlist over the last couple weeks that it started to become more widely known. As the service approached its first 50,0000 users last week, more and more prominent Twitter users have joined. Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, James Gunn, Chrissy Teigen, Rian Johnson and other celebrities have joined in recent days. So have other recognizable Twitter users like WeRateDogs, Dril, darth and Musk nemesis ElonJet.</p><p>It’s not just former blue checks though. Black and transgender voices have also found Bluesky <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/trans-cluesky-safe-fun-twitter-1234728106/">welcoming</a>. So have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/bluesky-black-twitter-sex-workers-culture/">sex workers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/27/blueskys-best-shot-at-success-is-to-embrace-shitposting/">shitposters</a>. Needless to say, things have also gotten very weird, very quickly.</p><p>The massive influx of users exposed a technical glitch that soon became known as the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/hellthread-hellrope-bluesky">“hellthread.”</a> The glitch meant that long threads with lots of replies would break in the app’s main feed but users would continue to see notifications for new replies. “Just don’t reply to the thread to stay out,” Graber posted. Bluesky users, naturally, had other ideas. People not only kept replying, they tagged others into the phantom thread. At some point, users began <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-rival-bluesky-has-a-nudes-problem/">dropping nudes</a> into the hellthread, ultimately causing the app’s developers to <a href="https://staging.bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3jup7ormwjc2p">block nudity</a> from Bluesky’s “What’s Hot” feed.</p><p>Weirdness and nudity aside, Bluesky’s current popularity seems to be driven by both novelty of the service and because it’s so much smaller and simpler than its predecessor. The small user base and invite system has also so far mostly kept out trolls and bots and spam that tend to make Twitter a lot less usable for high-profile accounts or people from marginalized backgrounds. At a time when Twitter has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-quietly-reversed-its-policies-to-allow-for-intentional-deadnaming-and-misgendering-181754382.html">reversed rules</a> protecting trans people, unbanned Nazis and harassers, and algorithmically favors those paying for blue checks, Bluesky is a reminder of how good “old Twitter” used to be,</p><h2>Will it last?</h2><p>Just how long the good vibes will last is another question. Bluesky isn’t the first Twitter alternative to take off and see a surge in interest from former Twitter power users. Mastodon surged for months last year following Musk’s takeover of Twitter, and inspired high-profile Twitter users and developers to flock to the platform. But that growth seems to have now leveled off, and the number of active users <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-mastodon-bump-is-now-a-slump/">has declined</a> after months of growth.</p><p>Bluesky has some advantages over Mastodon: it’s easier to use and much more intuitive for Twitter users, assuming you can score an invite. But whether Bluesky remains as popular as it is now will likely depend on if the platform can sustain the same level of interest once it expands beyond the current invite system. Many viral apps start off as invite only (Clubhouse, for example) only to fade into the background once they are no longer exclusive and novel.</p><p>On the other hand, Twitter is still a mess and there is clearly sustained demand for a non-Musk operated alternative.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-backed-bluesky-is-having-a-moment-133039184.html?src=rss

## Nacon’s MG-X Pro smartphone gamepad is comfortable but a little too basic

<p>Nacon, now both a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/robocop-rogue-city-has-been-delayed-to-september-190942430.html">games publisher </a>and peripheral maker, has been making gamepads for consoles for a while. It was one of the companies that Sony chose to make its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-27-ps4-esports-gamepads.html">wired ‘pro” PS4 controllers</a> before Sony announced its own ‘pro’ controller for the PS5.</p><p>Not that it stopped Nacon. It has introduced two mobile controllers, including, most recently, an iPhone-compatible model that lands in the middle of smartphone gamepad pricing. It’s cheaper than Backbone and Razer’s technically impressive gaming peripherals, and unfortunately, Nacon made some sacrifices to get to that price.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OYWNvbi1XaXJlbGVzcy1Nb2JpbGUtQ29udHJvbGxlci1BbmRyb2lkLVNtYXJ0cGhvbmVzL2RwL0IwQkg2UDhKUTEvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXduLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5YjcwN2I2YS1mOTM4LTQxZDgtOTkyNi1hZmEwOWFiYWMwOWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcUj3HiN805OpQdj965neqleRaMgfdtoQnPZCnI1S5Rn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNacon-Wireless-Mobile-Controller-Android-Smartphones%2Fdp%2FB0BH6P8JQ1%2F">MG-X Pro</a> is light, even with its built-in battery. Compared to some smartphone controllers, the grips are more substantial and closer to typical console gamepads. This is the most comfortable smartphone gamepad I’ve ever tried by a wide margin. It feels controller-sized, with similar spacing between the d-pad and analog controls and full-sized trigger buttons at the back, making it far more comfortable during long gaming sessions.</p><figure><img alt="Nacon MG-X Pro " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/2a64ea30-eb49-11ed-af3e-6e1a4541a3b9" style="height: 1125px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>The buttons are responsive but a little too squishy. I couldn’t notice any latency difference between wireless and wired smartphone controller options when playing through several Apple Arcade titles, <em>Into The Breach</em>, and some <em>Overwatch 2</em> streamed on PS Remote Play. The buttons don’t wobble around in their housing, but the d-pad feels a little doughy and loose. The two analog sticks are made of sturdier stuff, fortunately.</p><p>Between the two controller halves, the vice part of MG-X Pro has a ridged rubberized surface to keep your iPhone locked in, with a little lip on both sides to keep everything in place. The vice works on every iPhone I have, from the Mini to the Max models. And, unlike some other vice controllers, even with a protective case, my iPhone 14 Pro fits in fine.</p><p>It’s easy to while away the hours with the MG-X Pro – until your phone battery runs out. Unlike more expensive options like the Backbone, this is a wireless model. There’s no lighting cable plug to connect your iPhone into) which means there’s no power throughput.</p><p>This problem is compounded when you’re using cloud gaming services, like Xbox Cloud and PS Remote Play, which need a lot of power to stream games. If you want to play for extended periods, you’ll have to be prepared to take similarly extended breaks. Other shortcomings include a companion app that doesn’t offer enough to warrant its download. There’s the ability to calibrate the two analog sticks – which makes me worry that they could drift in the future – and walkthroughs of what the MG-X Pro is capable of. That’s not all that much.</p><figure><img alt="Nacon MG-X Pro " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/2a678240-eb49-11ed-9fff-ca972c1b0c96" style="height: 1125px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>The MG-X Pro is the most comfortable smartphone gamepad I’ve ever used.

<p>Qualcomm has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/qualcomm-acquire-israeli-auto-chip-maker-autotalks-2023-05-08/">agreed to acquire</a> an Israeli fabless chipmaker called Autotalks, and according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/08/qualcomm-autotalks-safety/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, the deal will cost the company around $350 to $400 million. Autotalks creates chips and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication technologies dedicated towards boosting road safety for both ordinary and driverless vehicles. In its <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/05/qualcomm-to-acquire-autotalks">announcement</a>, Qualcomm said that Autotalks' &quot;production-ready, dual mode, standalone safety solutions&quot; will be incorporated into the Snapdragon Digital Chassis, its set of cloud-connected assisted and autonomous driving technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Nakul Duggal, senior VP of automotive for Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., said in a statement: &quot;We have been investing in V2X research, development and deployment since 2017 and believe that as the automotive market matures, a standalone V2X safety architecture will be needed for enhanced road user safety, as well as smart transportation system... We share Autotalks’ decades-long experience and commitment to build V2X technologies and products with a focus on solving real-world road user safety challenges. We look forward to working together to deliver global V2X solutions that will help accelerate time-to-market and enable mass market adoption of this very important safety technology.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For makers of driverless and driver-assisted vehicles and systems, ensuring people that their technologies are safe is of utmost importance if they want to win them over. They may have to offer safety features that can assuage people's fears in order to get ahead of their rivals, since most people <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-than-3-in-4-americans-feel-less-safe-in-self-driving-cars-survey-finds-301623530.html">remain apprehensive</a> about self-driving cars.</p><p>Qualcomm expects the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-ride-vision-semi-autonomous-cars-191513939.html">automotive industry</a> to be one of its biggest sources of growth and revenue over the coming years. At CES last year, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-ride-vision-semi-autonomous-cars-191513939.html">unveiled the Snapdragon Ride Vision platform</a>, which is an &quot;open, scalable and modular&quot; tech automakers can use to build cars. And in late 2022, it said its automotive business pipeline, or its revenue-generating opportunities, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chipmaker-qualcomm-says-automotive-future-business-expands-30-bln-2022-09-22/">had jumped to $30 billion</a> from the $10 billion it announced during its previous earnings report. The company also said back then that it estimates its automotive business revenue to hit $4 billion by fiscal year 2026. It credited the Snapdragon Digital Chassis for the expansion of its future business opportunities, and Autotalks' acquisition could grow its customer base and client offerings even further.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-is-buying-auto-safety-chipmaker-autotalks-120131989.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: What to expect at Google I/O 2023

<p>Google’s annual <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-at-google-io-2023-120024438.html">developer conference</a> not only delivers on the software and web-based announcements but also on whatever hardware it’s been cooking up. In the past, that included smart speakers, phones, Chromebooks and everything else. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-at-google-io-2023-120024438.html">For I/O 2023</a>, we’re expecting lots of Pixel things. Rumors (and subsequent official teasers) point to Google’s first foldable smartphone, the Pixel Fold, as well as the latest midrange Pixel, the Pixel 7a.</p><p>The Pixel Fold will open like a book, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold. Rumors suggest a 5.8-inch external screen and a foldable 7.6-inch 120Hz internal display. It has thicker bezels than the Z Fold, but it’s supposed to feature a durable, almost-gapless hinge and a battery that lasts 24 hours in normal use. It could cost up to $1,700.</p><p>At the other end of the “how much?!” spectrum, the Pixel 7a doesn’t appear too different from its predecessor; it might have a faster 90Hz display and a 64-megapixel main camera. Google reportedly plans to price the new phone at $499 – a little more than last year’s Pixel 6a, but still a fraction of the price of the Pixel Fold.</p><p>That’s not all. There is also the Pixel tablet, previewed at Google I/O last year, Android 14 (in testing since February) and maybe even a tease of the Pixel 8?

The Model S Plaid vehicles the company delivered after they became available could only reach around 163MPH, which is fast, but not 200MPH fast. Turns out Tesla put a limitation on its software to prevent it from reaching its full potential. According to <em>Electrek</em>, the company wanted the vehicle to have bigger brakes first, so they could slow down better. The automaker first started offering the ceramic brake kit for $20,000 back in 2021, but it has yet to start installing it on customers' vehicles.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-unveils-model-s-plaid-track-package-that-unlocks-a-top-speed-of-200-mph-085856818.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-iphone-15-pro-probably-may-not-feature-solid-state-buttons-as-previously-rumored-174416328.html">The iPhone 15 Pro may not have solid-state buttons</a></h2><h3>A supplier suggested the parts are delayed.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-iphone-15-pro-probably-may-not-feature-solid-state-buttons-as-previously-rumored-174416328.html"><figure><img alt="TMA" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/e1dd7880-ed83-11ed-afbd-f1e90ea2e8df" style="height: 450px; width: 675px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>You may recall rumors about the iPhone 15 Pro featuring touch-sensitive solid-state buttons.

In a shareholder letter spotted by <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple supplier Cirrus Logic said, “A new product that we mentioned in previous shareholder letters as being scheduled for introduction this fall is no longer expected to come to market as planned.” Cirrus already provides components for the iPhone’s Taptic Engine, so it’s got the Apple relationship. Cirrus previously told investors it was working on a new high-performance component that would arrive in smartphones sometime in 2023.
