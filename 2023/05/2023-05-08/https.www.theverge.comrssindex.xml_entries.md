  <p id="iOesqX">Google’s I/O event is less than two days away, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/google-io-to-feature-ai-updates-showing-off-palm-2-llm.html">a new CNBC report</a> might have just revealed some of the major AI-focused updates to be announced at the show.</p>
<p id="x4x5cN">One big component will be a new large language model (LLM), PaLM 2, which CNBC describes as a “general-use” LLM that is Google’s “most recent and advanced.” The LLM has apparently performed “a broad range of coding and math tests as well as creative writing tests and analysis,” according to CNBC, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see Google show off some of those capabilities onstage. (The first PaLM <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html">was announced in April 2022</a>, months before the recent AI boom fueled by applications like ChatGPT.)</p>

  <p id="ZmFjyM">Virgin Galactic is gearing up for its first crewed flight in nearly two years. The <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/news/virgin-galactic-announces-crew-for-return-to-space/">space tourism company announced</a> that it will launch its Unity 25 crew into space later this month but didn’t provide a specific date.</p>
<p id="WPkrc6">The upcoming spaceflight is “the final assessment of the full spaceflight system and astronaut experience” ahead of Virgin Galactic’s first commercial flight that’s planned for the end of June. Unity 25 marks the company’s fifth spaceflight and will launch four Virgin Galactic employees — Beth Moses, Luke Mays, Jamila Gilbert, and Christopher Huie — to the edge of space.</p>

  <p id="Q44UWl">Dodging spoilers is becoming more difficult than ever. Thanks in large part to the many algorithmic social media feeds you can scroll through at any given time, just hanging out on the internet means you might be unwittingly served new information about a show or game you haven’t experienced for yourself. </p>
<p id="UDbONX">I’ve been particularly sensitive to this with <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. </em>I can’t wait to explore all of the new secrets <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/13/23680631/tears-of-the-kingdom-final-trailer-nintendo">hidden around and above Hyrule</a>.

  <p id="IvGrr6">Flying sucks. On the one hand, it still feels sort of miraculous to climb into a metal tube and be whisked across the country, flying hundreds of miles per hour through the clouds. But on the other hand, almost everything about that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/27/23528333/southwest-airlines-flights-canceled-winter-storm">experience is bad</a> and is <a href="https://theweek.com/travel/1020014/the-growing-problem-of-flight-cancellations">getting worse</a> over time. </p>
<p id="RniJOi">The question of who should pay for airfare when things go awry has been lingering in the air for a while now. The obvious answer is the airlines, but the major carriers have been resistant, preferring instead to make passengers pay for all their own accommodations when flights get delayed or canceled. But that way of doing things may be coming to an end. </p>
