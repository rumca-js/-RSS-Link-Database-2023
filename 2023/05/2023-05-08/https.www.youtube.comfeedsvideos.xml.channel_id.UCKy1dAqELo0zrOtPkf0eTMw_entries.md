In today's Daily Fix
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is out later this week, but speedrunners aren't wasting time trying to break the game. IGN spoke to two of the speedrunning community's most prolific Breath of the Wild speedrunners to see what they're planning for Nintendo's next big game. In other news, Forbes assembled a list of the top 15 worst-reviewed games on Steam, and Bethesda's recent dud, Redfall, made the cut. Hopefully users will re-evaluate the game after some necessary patches have been released. Another teaser for Payday 3 has dropped, and true to its teaser nature, it didn't show much of anything. It's been nearly 10 years since Payday 2, so we're betting fans can wait until later this year for gameplay. And finally, Sony has announced the closure of PixelOpus, a small developer under the Sony banner that was behind Concrete Genie and Entwined.

Join members of the cast and crew of The Little Mermaid for a behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming live-action movie, including discussions on the film's characters, like Daeed Diggs' Sebastian, Javier Bardem's King Triton, and more. This reimagining of the studio’s animated musical classic stars Halle Bailey as Ariel, Daveed Diggs as the voice of Sebastian, Jacob Tremblay as the voice of Flounder, Awkwafina as the voice of Scuttle, Jonah Hauer-Kingas Prince Eric, Art Malik as Sir Grimsby, Noma Dumezweni as Queen Selina, Javier Bardem as King Triton, and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula. 

The Little Mermaid is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. 

The Little Mermaid is directed by Rob Marshall, and written by David Magee, with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker.

The film is produced by Marc Platt, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver serving as executive producer. The score is by Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”), who won two Oscars for the music in the animated version of The Little Mermaid, with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham. Music is by Alan Menken, lyrics are by Howard Ashman and new lyrics are by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

The Little Mermaid opens in theaters on May 26, 2023.
