<p>Your number of browser tabs may the the source of your stress online. Well, part of it, anyway. According to a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580690&amp;xcust=2-2-1813173-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">study performed by students at Aalto University</a> in Finland (and spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/are-you-stressed-out-maybe-you-have-too-many-browser-tabs-open/&amp;xcust=2-2-1813173-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), browser clutter appears to be a problem for most people.</p>



<p>But just what is browser clutter? The research, which involved 400 online survey respondents and 16 in-person interviewees, breaks that concept into several components&mdash;one of which involves the amount of tabs that spark stress and frustration. Also folded into this concept are advertisements, pop-up notifications, and disorganized information on a page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, however, did not identify a magic number of tabs that helped avoid becoming overwhelmed. Survey participants only identified if they saw browser clutter as a problem, which most people do. (About 57 percent see it as a mild issue, while almost 25 percent see it as a somewhat or serious concern. The remaining 18 percent aren&rsquo;t bothered at all.) Instead, the tipping point for tab usage&mdash;or in the words of the study, &ldquo;tab limit&rdquo;&mdash;is personal, as hinted by the habits of study responders. While the average was 5 to 10 open tabs and 1 to 3 open windows at one time, the full range included one person with less than three open and another with about 400. (I see you, my fellow tab enthusiast.) Basically, when you start to feel annoyed by your open tabs, you&rsquo;ve found your tab limit.</p>

<p>The good news is if you have a bunch of tabs open for research&mdash;a common reason for tab clutter among the study respondents&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have to oscillate between peacefulness and visual overload. We&rsquo;re not scientists here at PCWorld, but we <em>do</em> know a little bit about web browsers. Chrome and Edge users can make use of a built-in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/705698/this-one-feature-in-chrome-makes-my-life-far-less-chaotic.html">tab group feature</a>, which lets you cluster together tabs related to the same topic. When they&rsquo;re not in use, you can collapse the group down so those tabs temporarily disappear from view. Edge also has a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397408/heres-how-microsoft-collections-edges-new-research-tool-will-work.html">Collections</a> feature that functions somewhere between tab groups and bookmarks, where your saved links are saved a bit more permanently, yet still segregated for easier reference.</p>



<p>There are fixes for webpage elements that melt your brain in aggregate, too. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1676214/chrome-is-finally-getting-an-official-reader-mode-but-its-weird.html">Reader modes</a> in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox strip a page down to its basic elements for quicker parsing. As for ads, those can be removed through use of an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631993/5-free-chrome-browser-extensions-need-to-try.html">ad-blocking browser extension</a>. (You can support your favorite sites by adding them to the extension&rsquo;s approved list, or otherwise donating or subscribing.) While those who took part in the Aalto University study said that third-party extensions like SessionBuddy became too much, these tricks are built into your browser or only require minimal active maintenance. It&rsquo;s how I manage dozens and dozens (sometimes hundreds) of browser tabs with very little stress.</p>

## Alert: MSI and Intel software keys are in the wild

<p>The next time you need to download drivers for your MSI laptop or motherboard, make damn sure you&rsquo;re getting it straight from the source. That&rsquo;s pretty good advice for any kind of software update, but it&rsquo;s particularly relevant since <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1780409/msi-confirms-ransomware-attack-asks-customers-to-be-alert.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">hackers stole a huge trove of proprietary data last month</a>. The company has reportedly refused to pay the ransom, so private software keys were posted to the dark web last week. </p>



<p>The danger here is that hackers can download MSI device firmware, modify it to include malware or spyware, then sign it with MSI&rsquo;s official keys, letting it slip right past the usual authenticity checks. It also makes it much harder for standard antivirus scanners to find, though there are ways to identify the leaked keys and run double-checks against existing databases. According to security firm <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/binarly_io/status/1654287041339998208&amp;xcust=2-1-1812981-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Binarly</a> (via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/hackers-leak-private-keys-for-msi-products-making-it-easier-to-attack-them&amp;xcust=2-1-1812981-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC Mag</a>), the released files affect 57 different MSI products, including laptops in the Creator, Crosshair, Katana, Modern, Prestige, Pulse, Raider, Stealth, Summit, Sword, and Vector series.  </p>



<p>But that&rsquo;s not all. The leaked data also includes keys for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/below-the-os-security-white-paper.pdf&amp;xcust=2-1-1812981-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Intel&rsquo;s proprietary Boot Guard system</a>, a part of UEFI Secure Boot. Those keys are applicable across a wide array of hardware from multiple vendors, including industry giants like Lenovo. Binarly says that those keys affect a further 166 products. </p>



<p>It is, in terms that might be too kind, a mess. MSI&rsquo;s refusal to pay ransom to hackers is understandable, and even laudable&mdash;giving in to hackers wouldn&rsquo;t guarantee that the data remains safe and would only incentivize further criminal acts. But it&rsquo;s now more or less inevitable that cracked firmware will show up somewhere, just begging a search engine to crawl the page and place it above MSI&rsquo;s official downloads.  </p>

## Western Digital hacked: Your deeply personal data might be stolen

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard, Western Digital had a pretty serious security breach in March of this year. How serious? Serious enough that the company <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681254/western-digitals-my-cloud-goes-down-after-hack.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">manually suspended its My Cloud service for over a week</a>, during which customers lost all access to their remote files. Six weeks later, the company has published the results of its internal investigation, and it isn&rsquo;t pretty. </p>



<p>According to emails sent to Western Digital customers (via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-images-to-taunt-western-digitals-cyberattack-response/&amp;xcust=2-1-1812843-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bleeping Computer</a>), the company says that hackers were able to obtain a database of customers containing names, phone numbers, shipping addresses and billing addresses, email addresses, and partial credit card numbers. Password data was also stolen, though those files were encrypted, hashed, and &ldquo;salted,&rdquo; meaning that the danger for those particular files is particularly low. </p>



<p>The data appears to be mostly connected to Western Digital&rsquo;s online store, not the My Cloud service&hellip;though there&rsquo;s probably a good bit of overlap in those two groups. Western Digital is closing its online store for the time being, with access expected to return next week. </p>



<p>According to Bleeping Computer, the hackers showed evidence of at least some level of access to Western Digital&rsquo;s network as recently as April 28th, presumably in an attempt to extort ransom money. Anyone with a Western Digital store account or My Drive account is encouraged to change their password (and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">might want to look into a password manager</a>, too). </p>

<p>Convertible laptops are a lot of fun to use. The 2-in-1 form factor allows you to swing the screen around 360 degrees and use it like a tablet or, if you prefer, you can prop it up like a painter&rsquo;s easel for watching movies. If you&rsquo;re in the market for a convertible laptop with a lovely AMOLED screen, we&rsquo;ve got a solid deal for you today. Best Buy&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book2-360-13-3-amoled-touch-screen-laptop-intel-12th-gen-core-i7-evo-platform-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-graphite%2F6501594.p%3FskuId%3D6501594&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Book2 360 for $799.99</a>, which is a savings of $350. Getting an AMOLED screen on a 2-in-1 laptop for $799.99? Sign me the heck up. That&rsquo;s an absolute steal right there.</p>



<p>We actually <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/693933/samsung-galaxy-book2-pro-360-review-a-thin-light-powerful-beauty.html">reviewed</a> a slightly different configuration last year. We really loved the high-contrast OLED screen and stellar battery life. It earned four out of five stars plus an Editor&rsquo;s Choice award. The battery also lasted over 14 hours on a single charge.</p>



<p>This model is packing an Intel Core i7-1255U CPU, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. It should have no problem zipping through general use tasks like browsing the web, scrolling through social media feeds, and so on. The 13.3-inch 1080p AMOLED display is smaller than the 15.6-inch one we tested, but it&rsquo;s still lovely and is capable of producing vibrant visuals with deep, inky darks. And according to the manufacturer, this laptop can last up to 18 hours on a single charge. That&rsquo;s nothing to sneeze at, folks.</p>



<p>This is a phenomenal laptop at an awesome price. Don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>

## How to turn on Dark Mode in Windows 11

<p>Like Windows 10, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/539183/windows-11-review-an-unnecessary-replacement-for-windows-10.html">Windows 11</a> comes with two primary options for its menus, settings, and other primary interface elements: dark or light. While it&rsquo;s easy to change from one to the other, it isn&rsquo;t immediately apparent how to access that option. That said, activating dark mode is a &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; option in our guide to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1782303/5-windows-11-settings-worth-changing-immediately.html">5 Windows 11 settings worth changing immediately</a>. </p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s how you do it.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397575/how-to-get-windows-cheap-or-even-for-free.html">how to get Windows for cheap (or even for free)</a></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="switch-from-light-to-dark-or-dark-to-light">Switch from Light to Dark or Dark to Light</h2>



<p>From the Windows 11 desktop, right-click on any open space on your wallpaper, then click &ldquo;Personalization.&rdquo; </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 personalization" class="wp-image-548179" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-11.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Scroll down a bit and click &ldquo;Colors.&rdquo; The first option on this screen Is &ldquo;Choose your mode.&rdquo; This is what you&rsquo;re looking for, more or less. You&rsquo;ve got three options:</p>



<ul><li>Light &mdash; most backgrounds and visual elements will be white or light grey</li><li>Dark &mdash; most backgrounds and visual elements will be shades of dark grey</li><li>Custom &mdash; choose between Light and Dark modes for both Windows settings menus and apps</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 personalization, light, dark, custom" class="wp-image-548180" height="756" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-5.png" width="960" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Most people will probably prefer either light mode or dark mode for both, but you can mix and match using the Custom setting. For example, here&rsquo;s a Custom setup with the Windows taskbar and Start menu set to dark and apps set to light:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 colors, mixed dark" class="wp-image-548181" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-6.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>And here&rsquo;s the opposite configuration:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 colors, mixed light" class="wp-image-548182" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-7.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Note that not every app supports automatically switching between light and dark modes with Windows.</p>



<h2 id="color-choices">Color choices</h2>



<p>Scrolling down a little further, you can customize your PC&rsquo;s theme even more by choosing an accent color. This is the color (and related colors) that will appear on Windows elements that require contrast to be easily visible, like the notification icon in the bottom-right corner of the taskbar, or the selected buttons on the Action Bar. By default Windows 11 will choose an accent color based on the colors of your desktop wallpaper. This tends to look pretty good and contributes to a consistent overall theme.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 accent color" class="wp-image-548183" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-12.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>But if you&rsquo;re not thrilled with the automatic choice, you can select &ldquo;Manual&rdquo; from the drop-down bar on the right. If even the tiles on the main view aren&rsquo;t enough, you can scroll down to Custom colors and click &ldquo;View colors&rdquo; to choose from an RGB palette.</p>



<p>The last options are to apply your accent color to your Start menu and taskbar, and to show an accent color on title bars and window borders. This lessens some of the transparency of Windows 11, and makes it look more like some of the older versions of the operating system. It looks like this:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 color taskbar edge " class="wp-image-548184" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-10.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>All of these options are cosmetic &mdash; they won&rsquo;t affect how your computer performs at all &mdash; and can be adjusted or undone at any time.</p>

## AMD’s Ryzen Z1 for Steam Deck rivals is more than a rebadged laptop CPU

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>After the reveal of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1796614/hands-on-the-rog-ally-is-the-steam-deck-for-gamers-who-want-more-power-and-options.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Asus ROG Ally handheld last month</a>, AMD took the wraps off its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1797689/amd-ryzen-z1-chips-will-power-a-new-generation-of-pc-gaming-portables.html">shiny new Ryzen Z1 chips</a>, a line of APUs designed specifically for Steam Deck-style portable gaming devices. But on paper, the chips (or at least what portions of their hardware was revealed) seem pretty similar to a couple of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1806031/amd-launches-ai-powered-ryzens-for-thin-notebooks.html">fresh ultraportable laptop CPUs from AMD</a>, specifically the Ryzen 7 7840U (for the Z1 Extreme) and the Ryzen 5 7640U/7540U (for the Z1). A few new details have come to light, illustrating the differences. </p>



<p>While it&rsquo;s hardly surprising that AMD would use its processor know-how for multiple low-power devices at the same time, the devil appears to be in the details. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amds-ryzen-7040u-and-z1-chips-for-handhelds-are-nearly-identical&amp;xcust=2-3-1812672-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware quotes an AMD representative</a> who says that the company had to &ldquo;validate entirely new power ranges and optimize the voltage curves&rdquo; for the Z1 and Z1 Extreme, even if the hardware is superficially similar. </p>



<p>Crucially, the Z1 and Z1 Extreme can run on as little as nine watts or as much as 30, depending on the demands of the software. Compare that to the more restrictive 15-30w range of the Ryzen 7040U series. A six-watt difference might not seem like much, but in a form factor like the Asus ROG Ally (or indeed, the Steam Deck) every tiny bit of extra battery life makes a difference. That&rsquo;s especially true if you&rsquo;re playing a less demanding 2D game, or perhaps streaming one from GeForce Now or Xbox Game Pass. The Z1 processors also have their Ryzen XDNA AI co-processors disabled, though apparently the physical hardware will remain &mdash; it might not make sense for the Ally&rsquo;s power-sipping hardware profile. </p>



<p>I asked AMD&rsquo;s Frank Azor (a frequent guest on our <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpks--1fio&amp;xcust=2-3-1812672-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Full Nerd podcast</a>) if AMD was planning on using the Z1 processors for form factors beyond something like the Ally or Steam Deck. He replied that these designs were specific to this class of device, and plenty of other AMD processors were available for laptops that required similar capabilities. That would seem to line up with the customizations made for the Z1 line outlined in these latest details. </p>



<p>The ROG Ally will have an official launch <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801086/rog-ally-leaked-pricing-could-be-big-trouble-for-the-steam-deck.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">later this week on May 11th</a>. The juiciest detail yet to be revealed is the pricing, though <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801086/rog-ally-leaked-pricing-could-be-big-trouble-for-the-steam-deck.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">if early leaks are accurate</a>, Valve might have something to worry about. </p>

<p>Follow any tech site with regularity and you&rsquo;ll hear the same refrain over and over&mdash;<em>back up your files</em>. The longer you wait, the more you flirt with disaster, and you don&rsquo;t have as much time as you might think. In March, a Los Angeles storage recovery service revealed that on average, their clients&rsquo; failed hard drives died <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671102/hdds-may-be-falling-and-failing-in-popularity-but-not-with-me.html">within the first three years of use</a>. And now a study from Backblaze has corroborated that finding with much more data.</p>



<p>In the original report, Secure Data Recovery came to its discovery by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.securedatarecovery.com/blog/how-long-do-hard-drives-last&amp;xcust=2-1-1810214-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">cataloging the details</a> of 2,007 faulty drives from six prominent manufacturers, with capacities ranging from 40GB to 10TB. Backblaze&rsquo;s latest release of drive statistics (which the cloud storage and backup service publishes quarterly about the storage powering its data centers) paints a similar picture. </p>



<p>In fact, for the Q1 2023 info drop, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-q1-2023/#:~:text=in%20this%20report.-,The%20Average%20Age%20of%20Drive%20Failure,-Recently%20the%20folks&amp;xcust=2-1-1810214-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the company purposely dug into its own data</a> from the past ten years, after seeing the Secure Data Recovery info. Turns out that Backblaze&rsquo;s 17,155 failed drives clocked an average age of two and half years&mdash;or a little bit less than the average of two years and 10 months in the SDR report. The longest-wearing drives survived for almost five years while the shortest lived bit the dust in less than a year.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Need to back up your files? If so, check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">best Windows backup softwar</a>e available right now.</p></blockquote>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Backblaze Average Age of Drive Failure by Model chart" class="wp-image-1810234" height="830" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/6-Average-Failure-Age-by-Model.webp" width="550" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Backblaze</p></div>



<p>Backblaze also breaks out the dead drives by their model numbers and capacities, providing a deeper glimpse into individual drive reliability&mdash;sort of. The company cautions against making assumptions about capacity influencing potential lifespan, especially the data initially suggests that smaller drives last longer than larger ones. Backblaze&rsquo;s data centers have completely retired lower capacity storage while the fate of some bigger models remains to be seen. But in case you were curious, the average age of Backblaze&rsquo;s failed drives no longer in operation is&hellip;two years and seven months.</p>



<p>Backblaze just drove a stake into any assumptions that a bigger data pool would soften or disprove Secure Data Recovery&rsquo;s results. If your drive is going to bite the dust, it&rsquo;ll happen sooner than most people expect&mdash;though the <em>chances</em> of it happening aren&rsquo;t as high as some people might fear. Backblaze found that of 236,893 drives and 30 different models, they had a 1.4 percent lifetime annualized failure rate (or general rate of failure within any given year of service since Backblaze began tracking this data). So the likelihood of <em>your </em>storage dying is pretty low, especially considering the drives in Backblaze&rsquo;s data centers is being run much harder than in an average person&rsquo;s computer.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Backblaze Hard Drives Lifetime Annualized Failure Rates chart" class="wp-image-1810255" height="960" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/8-Q1-2023-Lifetime-AFR-Table.webp" width="730" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Backblaze</p></div>



<p>Still, 1.4 percent of the millions of drives out in the world is still a big number and you won&rsquo;t know if you fall into that unlucky group until your drive stops responding. And that&rsquo;s a point that Secure Data Recovery stressed in its post, recommending the classic 3-2-1 approach. (See, tech journalists aren&rsquo;t trying to scare you unnecessarily). That translates to three copies of your data on at least two different forms of media (e.g., two separate drives or one drive and the cloud), with one copy stored off-site.</p>

<p>Do you need a gaming keyboard to play PC games? Of course not. And spending triple-digits on one won&rsquo;t automatically make you a winner, winner, chicken dinner. But getting a gaming-specific keyboard can make playing for long sessions more comfortable, and can also unlock a lot of customization options that add convenience to your favorite PC games. And we&rsquo;d be lying if we said that the gamer aesthetic&mdash;complete with optional rainbow LEDs, of course&mdash;didn&rsquo;t hold a certain appeal. </p>



<p>New gaming keyboards, with more and more flashy features, are being released almost constantly. Below are the best on the market at the moment, and we&rsquo;ll be keeping this roundup current as often as we can to make sure you can find the best boards in this wide and competitive field. </p>

<p>Razer&rsquo;s latest revision of its bread-and-butter gaming keyboard is a worthy successor to the long-running BlackWidow line, this time with multi-device wireless headlining a long list of features. Though it lacks some of the features mechanical keyboard enthusiasts crave, like PBT keycaps or hot-swap sockets, its gaming-focused build and software put it at the head of the pack if what you&rsquo;re really after is a high K/D ratio. </p>

<p>Razer&rsquo;s super-smooth Green switches are great for long gaming sessions, as is the cushy magnetic wrist rest, which thankfully doesn&rsquo;t require a separate purchase. The default media controls are a highlight, making this board great as a standard desktop companion for non-gaming, too. And of course you can tweak the layout and lighting to your desire in Razer&rsquo;s flashy but functional Synapse software. </p>

<p>If the price is giving you sticker shock, the same features are available in a cheaper wired setup, as well as tenkeyless (TKL) and 65% &ldquo;mini&rdquo; flavors. </p>

<p>The G.Skill KM250 isn&rsquo;t just the best budget gaming keyboard we&rsquo;ve seen. With its long list of high-end features and a rock-bottom price, it&rsquo;s the best value for a mechanical keyboard, period. With stylish PBT &ldquo;pudding&rdquo; keycaps, a rotary dial, hot-swap switches for deep customization, and even vibration-damping foam underneath the plate, it&rsquo;s shocking how much G.Skill managed to cram into a keyboard in the $50 range. Even the default Kailh Red switches are great for gaming. </p>

<p>The board lacks wireless, and there&rsquo;s no way to reprogram either its layout or its lighting. But these are minor quibbles for such a fantastic budget design, especially when most gamers will customize their layouts within the settings of individual games. Use the savings to buy some fancy switches or keycaps and customize the KM250 to your heart&rsquo;s content. </p>

<p>The Asus ROG Falchion isn&rsquo;t the most flexible wireless keyboard around&mdash;you&rsquo;ll want one with better programming and multi-device capabilities for that. But if you want a keyboard specifically for gaming on the go, the design choices here are hard to beat. RF-only wireless means it&rsquo;s incredibly fast, the long battery life means it won&rsquo;t die out on you, and the included protective cover/tray means it&rsquo;ll stay safe in your laptop bag. </p>

<p>The Falchion is pricey for its relatively short list of features, but its speedy switches and gaming focus make it ideal for this very specific niche. Just remember to bring an adapter if your gaming gadget of choice doesn&rsquo;t have a USB-A port. </p>

<p>There are thinner gaming keyboards out there, but if you get much thinner than the low-profile switches and keycaps in the new DeathAdder, you start to lose a lot of comfort. (And add a lot of cost.) The V2 Pro is ideal if you&rsquo;re looking for something a little thinner and more modern, but which preserves all of Razer&rsquo;s gaming bells and whistles at the same time. </p>

<p>The &ldquo;floating&rdquo; keycaps on the DeathAdder manage to feel more like a full-sized keyboard than a laptop board, even with much shorter key travel, so this board should slide right into your desktop gaming setup with no trouble. The DeathAdder V2 also comes in a shorter TKL variety, and a wired version if you want to save some money. </p>

<p>Technically, Keychron&rsquo;s high-quality, super-customizable Q keyboards aren&rsquo;t meant for gaming. But with a selection of switches (including speedy Linears) and a 1000Hz polling rate via the USB-C wired connection, it can keep up with pretty much any board on this list in terms of gaming prowess. And that&rsquo;s before you customize it with QMK or VIA programming, the go-to choices for mechanical keyboard fans. </p>

<p>On top of that, the Q series comes in a wide variety of layout choices, with high-quality aluminum bodies, hot-swappable switches, PBT keycaps, double-gasket mounting for that &ldquo;thocky&rdquo; feeling, and even case foam for reduced noise and vibration. They&rsquo;re also mod-friendly and easy to open if you want to really dig into customization. For a keyboard that can handle gaming, writing, and anything else you can throw at it, any member of the Q series is a great choice. The new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502685/keychron-q1-pro-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Q Pro variants</a> add wireless options, too. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block"><div class="faq-save-content"><span class="faq-rank">1.</span>
<h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-a-gaming-keyboard-and-a-regular-keyboard">What&rsquo;s the difference between a gaming keyboard and a regular keyboard?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Of course you can play PC games on any keyboard, assuming they were designed for it and not a controller. What separates a regular keyboard from a &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; keyboard is its intent&mdash;gaming keyboards are designed for speed and comfort across long play sessions. While &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; is subjective, and somewhat limited in making a gadget that conforms to standard typing, speed is readily quantifiable. </p>



<p>There are a couple of specific ways of measuring speed. One is the latency, the time it takes for a key press to translate into an action on your screen. Normally this is the relevant character appearing in a text window, but for a game it&rsquo;s a sword swing, a foot movement, a grenade toss, a special ability activated. Gaming keyboards have special hardware that can minimize this latency: gold-plated connections on a USB port, for example. </p>



<p>The easiest way to reduce latency is to increase the amount of times the keyboard&rsquo;s circuit board checks for key presses. This is called the polling rate, expressed in hertz. A standard keyboard has a polling rate of 100 to 200Hz, checking every tenth of a second or so. A gaming keyboard might have a polling rate of 1,000Hz or more&mdash;typically so fast that even the fastest human reflexes won&rsquo;t be able to spot any gap in between a key being pressed and its relevant action on screen.</p>
</div>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block"><div class="faq-save-content"><span class="faq-rank">2.</span>
<h3 id="are-mechanical-keyboards-good-for-gaming">Are mechanical keyboards good for gaming?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes&mdash;if it&rsquo;s the right mechanical keyboard. While any mechanical keyboard can be used for PC gaming, just like any standard keyboard, most gamers prefer a specific kind of switch. Linear switches, with a smooth action from zero pressure to the point where the switch &ldquo;bottoms out&rdquo; and can&rsquo;t be pressed further down, allow for each key to be depressed faster and return to its resting position faster, too. Tactile or Clicky switches, while excellent for typing, are a bit slower and not preferred for gaming.</p>



<p>Cherry MX Red switches are the go-to choice for mechanical keyboards designed for gaming. There are tons of varieties, in a ton of colors that might not correspond to the actual properties of the switch itself. Some have a higher actuation point (the point in the key travel at which the keyboard registers a press), or lighter springs for a softer touch, or even less key travel to shorten the distance between pressing the key and bottoming out by a few millimeters. Some fancy &ldquo;silent&rdquo; switches are much quieter than normal ones. </p>



<p>But the important part for most gamers is that Linear switch type for smooth, fast presses. Unless your tastes are very unconventional, you want Linear switches for gaming, not Tactile or Clicky. </p>
</div>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block"><div class="faq-save-content"><span class="faq-rank">3.</span>
<h3 id="are-wireless-keyboards-good-for-gaming">Are wireless keyboards good for gaming? </h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes! Even before modern wireless gaming keyboards arrived on the scene about 10 years ago, most keyboards using standard dongles and RF connections were fast enough to beat gamer reflexes. More specialized models make this wireless connection even faster, as quick as 1 thousandth of a second&mdash;again, far faster than any human being can tell, and essentially identical to the speed of any wired connection. </p>



<p>There is an exception. Many wireless keyboards use Bluetooth, and that&rsquo;s not ideal for gaming. Bluetooth is just slow enough that a gap between the key press and the action on screen is noticeable, even if you don&rsquo;t have super-human reflexes. And it&rsquo;s also on a very crowded wireless spectrum, so Bluetooth accessories are more prone to interference. </p>



<p>Even if your wireless gaming keyboard offers Bluetooth as a multi-device pairing option, you should go with the RF USB connection whenever you have the option.</p>

<h3 id="do-gaming-keyboards-need-rgb-lights">Do gaming keyboards need RGB lights?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>No. But they&rsquo;re fun, aren&rsquo;t they? </p>



<p>RGB lights can be programmed to indicate specific key bindings, and some driver programs even include custom decorative patterns for specific games. But since you&rsquo;ll be looking at your monitor and not your keyboard most of the time, the lights are basically just for show, no matter what they happen to be doing. And if you&rsquo;re not a fan, you can always turn them off (which can save a huge amount of battery life on wireless keyboards).</p>

<p>AMD&rsquo;s well-priced but powerful Ryzen 7000 CPUs make the perfect nucleus for a mid-range laptop like the A16 that&rsquo;s easy on the hip pocket, but reasonably powerful. In 2022 we saw the same thing with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394673/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-review.html">Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition</a>, which we applauded for its stupidly good price-to-power ratio.</p>



<p>What these laptops have in common is the &ldquo;AMD advantage&rdquo;&ndash;meaning they meet specific AMD guidelines to perform at their peak for mid-range laptops. But, of course, there&rsquo;s more to laptops then just CPU performance.</p>



<p>Indeed, the A16 also has an exceptionally long battery life and a large, gorgeous 16-inch 16:10 ratio display. An extra sweetener is its robust chassis that&rsquo;s as strong an ox, factors that make this a real gem for 1080p gamers.</p>

<h3 id="asus-tuf-gaming-a16-advantage-edition-specifications-and-features">Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition: Specifications and features</h3>



<p>The Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition is available with either AMD Rembrandt Zen3+ (Ryzen 7 7735HS) or AMD Phoenix (Ryzen 9 7940HS) CPUs. Two display options are available also &ndash; a FHD+ with 165 Hz refresh rate or QHD+ with 240 Hz refresh rate. The specification of our review model are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="asus-tuf-gaming-a16-advantage-edition-design-and-build">Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition: Design and build</h3>



<p>The A16&rsquo;s design reflects the mid-range focus of the Asus Advantage series laptops. It won&rsquo;t melt your eyeballs with luxurious extras like flashy RGB lighting or curves that resemble samurai swords. Indeed, it has neither of these things, but it does get the basics right.</p>



<p>Returning legacy features like its immovable plastic chassis and rigid metal lid have passed US military grade certification for toughness, which is very reassuring for a pack horse like me. The lid also comes well adjusted&mdash;it stayed put in all of the myriad angles I tested it.</p>



<p>The A16&rsquo;s chassis is a very versatile size. While its big sibling the 2023 Asus ROG Strix G18 is a little too big and heavy to use on the fly&mdash;like for finishing a quest with the laptop balanced on one knee&mdash;the A16 is reasonably spacious, but still small enough for moving around. It measures 13.88 x 9.92 x 0.87 inches and weighs just 4.85 pounds, which is lightweight for a gaming laptop.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition" class="wp-image-1802000" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-TUF-Gaming-A16-Advantage-Edition_FA617_Scenario-rendering-photo.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asus</p></div>



<p>So much of the A16&rsquo;s design is expertly engineered for your viewing pleasure. In fact, the saying &ldquo;all roads lead to Rome&rdquo; can be applied here; only the roads are its ultra slim bezels that frame up the 16:10 ratio panel so beautifully. An elaborate hinge mechanism pops the display up well above the laptop&rsquo;s lower edge so you&rsquo;re not just looking at bezels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&rdquo;I began running our PCWorld battery test at 6:35am one morning, and when I arrived home from the office at 7pm, much to my astonishment, it was still going.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Another thing I loved about the A16&rsquo;s design is its modest styling. For a gaming laptop, the A16 looks a little under-cooked, with not much more than an unobtrusive TUF logo on the lid and a crest in the track pad. But alas, the upside is it won&rsquo;t attract any unwanted attention in the office&mdash;it&rsquo;s just as geared towards work as it is play. This versatility is further validated by its excellent battery life (but more on that later).</p>



<p>This year, in addition to a black model, the A16 also comes in a new Sandstorm color. Both models feature a matte finish on their lids that reduces fingerprints to mere dull smudges. However, it also holds them firm, so you&rsquo;ll need quite a bit of elbow grease to rub them off.</p>



<h3 id="asus-tuf-gaming-a16-advantage-edition-keyboard-and-trackpad">Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition: Keyboard and trackpad</h3>



<p>The A16&rsquo;s keyboard is large and spacious and has a generous 1.7 mm travel between keys. There&rsquo;s also ample room to rest your hands either side of the trackpad, so you can relax into your game.</p>



<p>Although they don&rsquo;t have multi-colored RGB, the keys are backlit by an attractive white light that&rsquo;s easy to see. The keys feel low-set and soft, which makes typing quick, but a little fatiguing during long stints. Personally, I would have preferred them to be a little bouncier like in the ROG Strix G18.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition" class="wp-image-1802016" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Keyboard_edited.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The A16 has a large keyboard with a generous key configuration.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>That said, the keyboard configuration is very generous. You get a full-sized number pad, all the Fn keys and a set of convenient audio controls at the very top. Below the keyboard, the decent sized track pad feels neither too slippery nor too grippy&ndash;just ideal for gaming.</p>



<h3 id="asus-tuf-gaming-a16-advantage-edition-display-and-webcam">Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition: Display and webcam</h3>



<p>I&rsquo;ve played with my fair share of laptops with 4K displays, and in my opinion some of them are just too high resolution for their hardware to provide really seamless experiences.</p>



<p>The A16 by comparison packs a more modest FHD+ display so it doesn&rsquo;t suffer from this problem. Its colors really pop off the 100 percent sRGB panel and look rich and varied. Despite having a peak brightness level of just 250 nits, there&rsquo;s a surprising depth to the blacks and greys too.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition" class="wp-image-1802025" height="763" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-28-095101.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>A Rise of the Tomb Raider screenshot captured on the Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>But the panel&rsquo;s best feature is undoubtedly its fluid video playback&ndash;the 165Hz panel ticks over without the slightest hint of stutter or glitching. I never once saw it skip a beat, which is the kind of performance I&rsquo;d take any day over a juiced-up 4K display that struggles to keep up.</p>



<p>For webcam, the A16 sports a 720p High-Definition camera. It does a respectable job for sound and imagery, but like a lot of gaming laptop webcams, it can&rsquo;t compete with the quality you get from some productivity laptops&ndash;especially in low light conditions where it can look a bit grainy.</p>



<h3 id="asus-tuf-gaming-a16-advantage-edition-connectivity-and-audio">Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition: Connectivity and audio</h3>



<p>The TUF A16 Advantage Edition locates most of its ports on the left side, which frees up plenty of space for your mouse hand if you&rsquo;re right-handed, but isn&rsquo;t so great for lefties.</p>



<p>As expected, there&rsquo;s no Thunderbolt 4 ports, but the inclusion of multiple USB-A and USB-C ports and one HDMI 2.1 port means there are still plenty of great options for your devices. Conveniently both USB-C ports feature DisplayPort 1.4. Additionally, one of the USB-C ports features 100W Power Delivery so you can charge devices quickly on the fly.</p>



<p>The A16&rsquo;s two speakers sound clear and balanced, yet the bass won&rsquo;t bedazzle you. It levels out to become quite flat toward the lower end. You do get Hi-Res Audio and Dolby, however, so it will produce close-to-cinematic sounding audio.</p>



<h3 id="asus-tuf-gaming-a16-advantage-edition-cpu-performance">Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition: CPU performance</h3>



<p>Our A16 came with an AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS CPU, an 8 core (16 thread) CPU based on AMD&rsquo;s Zen 3+ microarchitecture. For a yard-stick comparison, it&rsquo;s basically a refresh of the Ryzen 7 6800HS, just with higher clock speeds and TGP settings.</p>



<p>To test the laptop&rsquo;s CPU performance, I pitted it against a variety of gaming laptops, mostly consisting of 2022 models&ndash;since it&rsquo;s still early days in our 2023 review schedule. Most I chose because they had similar mid-range CPUs&ndash;for example, the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 boasts a Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU, which in 2022 didn&rsquo;t top the charts, but performed solidly in some PCWorld reviews.</p>



<p>First up we ran Maxon&rsquo;s Cinebench R20 Single-Threaded benchmark which flexes just a single core of a laptop&rsquo;s CPU. In the graph we generated below, you can see the A16&rsquo;s CPU was just a moderate performer against our comparisons. Even so, this result indicates the A16 will have no trouble running lightweight apps and programs.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition" class="wp-image-1802033" height="583" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Cinebench-R20.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>In the Cinebench R20 Multi-Threaded benchmark, the A16&rsquo;s Ryzen 7 7735HS CPU fared somewhat better, proving its suitability for AAA games and CPU-demanding tasks like video editing and encoding. What&rsquo;s noteworthy is that it out-performed the MSI Katana GF76, which features an Intel 12th-gen Core i7-12700H CPU.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition" class="wp-image-1802042" height="568" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-28-103345.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Next, we ran a bespoke test we created specifically for the free HandBrake utility. This gave us an indication of how well our laptop could keep processing a CPU-intensive task before it got too hot and needed to throttle performance. The result? The A16 did a decent job staying cool and powering on, finishing the test in a respectable time of 1,072 seconds.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition" class="wp-image-1802056" height="546" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-28-105346.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<h3 id="asus-tuf-gaming-a16-advantage-edition-gpu-performance">Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition: GPU performance</h3>



<p>Under the hood, my A16 review unit came with a mid-range AMD Radeon RX 7600S GPU. GPUs in AMDs new 7000 Mobile Series feature AMD RDNA 3 architecture; they include new compute units that share resources between rendering, AI and ray tracing and make full use of each transistor for faster, more efficient performance.</p>



<p>While our benchmarks specifically tested for GPU performance, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the A16 incorporates AMD SmartShift technologies too.</p>

<p>AMD says one SmartShift technology, SmartShift RSR, works by &ldquo;intelligently distributing the rendering, upscaling and presentation demands between the APU and GPU resources to deliver the best possible performance&rdquo;&mdash;which, in case you&rsquo;re wondering, makes it similar to Advanced Optimus in some Nvidia supported laptops.</p>



<p>The results from 3DMark&rsquo;s Time Spy benchmark gave us a general overview of the GPU&rsquo;s performance for both gaming and other graphics-based tasks. As you can see below, the A16 appears in the middle of our comparison field, close behind the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and Razer Blade 15.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition" class="wp-image-1802060" height="557" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-28-110146.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Moving to our gaming benchmarks and for <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em> the results are more promising. Here you can see our laptop produced faster framerates than most of our comparisons.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition" class="wp-image-1802076" height="564" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-28-114832.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>In the <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> game benchmark, the A16 also performed very well, outpacing the competition&mdash;except for the Aus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16, which although a little older, has more premium graphics hardware.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition" class="wp-image-1802079" height="559" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-28-115738.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>What do these results tell us? Overall, they confirm that the A16&rsquo;s GPU delivers mid-range graphics performance, but also prove that it&rsquo;s definitely powerful enough for decent gaming at FHD+ resolution. It&rsquo;s what I saw the laptop achieve during my testing&mdash;that is, consistently high frame rates and a smooth seamless motion on the display.</p>



<h3 id="asus-tuf-gaming-a16-advantage-edition-battery-life">Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition: Battery life</h3>



<p>The A16 has a number of energy efficiency advantages over 2022 Advantage Edition models&mdash;the aforementioned AMD SmartShift technologies included&mdash;and these really made a difference in the longevity of the A16&rsquo;s battery life.</p>



<p>I began running our PCWorld battery test at 6:35 a.m. one morning, and when I arrived home from the office at 7pm, much to my astonishment, it was still going. In total, it ran for a whopping 11 and a half hours that day.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition" class="wp-image-1802083" height="569" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-28-121326.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Admittedly, PCWorld&rsquo;s battery test is quite lightweight, but these results still suggest the A16&rsquo;s 90Whr battery will see you through approximately seven hours of gaming away from an AC outlet. If you&rsquo;re only running light productivity apps, you&rsquo;ll most likely get more than a full day&rsquo;s operation, which is quite extraordinary for a gaming laptop.</p>



<h3 id="asus-tuf-gaming-a16-advantage-edition-should-you-buy-it">Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition: Should you buy it?</h3>



<p>The A16 (which is currently $1,099, USD at <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3Fst%3DAsus%2BTUF%2Bgaming%2BA16%26%23038%3B_dyncharset%3DUTF-8%26%23038%3B_dynSessConf%3D%26%23038%3Bid%3Dpcat17071%26%23038%3Btype%3Dpage%26%23038%3Bsc%3DGlobal%26%23038%3Bcp%3D1%26%23038%3Bnrp%3D%26%23038%3Bsp%3D%26%23038%3Bqp%3D%26%23038%3Blist%3Dn%26%23038%3Baf%3Dtrue%26%23038%3Biht%3Dy%26%23038%3Busc%3DAll%2BCategories%26%23038%3Bks%3D960%26%23038%3Bkeys%3Dkeys%26%23038%3Bintl%3Dnosplash&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Best Buy</a>) makes an excellent case against more expensive laptops like the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 and the MSI Katana GF76, especially if you&rsquo;re into 1080p gaming. However, although its affordable, it doesn&rsquo;t skimp on performance or a robust chassis.</p>



<p>But for me, the biggest factor that sets it apart from these options is its incredible battery life. In my time reviewing laptops, I can&rsquo;t remember when I last saw a gaming laptop lasted 11 and a half hours on a single charge, which makes the A16, in my book, truly outstanding.</p>
