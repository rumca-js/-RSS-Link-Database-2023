There ended up being about thirty of us, I learned a good\nbit about how DCF approaches their work, and I'm glad I went.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOverall, my main takeaway was that this kind of situation, DCF\ndeciding that a parent is neglecting their child by allowing them to\nplay independently, is very little of what DCF spends their time on.\nThis meant there was a bit of a mismatch in what the representative\nand the parents wanted to get out of the event.  The representative\nwanted us to think about and avoid the kinds of issues that come up\nthe most: sexting, getting into their parents' edibles, truancy, etc.\nBut how much of \"insufficient supervision in a public place\"\ntriggering very few DCF cases is due to parents being very cautious\nout of fear of DCF's response?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe parents were generally very interested in how DCF decides whether\nsome level of supervision is sufficient, and what we got was that\nthere are no hard rules or even guidelines, and that every situation\nis handled on its own with discretion and judgment.  MA is not a state\nwith age-based rules for any of this, and DCF doesn't give advice or\ncomment on hypotheticals.  I both see why the parents overall found\nthis frustrating (I think my kid is ready to be at the park by\nthemselves how do I know I won't get in trouble?) and why the system\nis that way (every kid is different, context matters enormously, human\nbehavior is complex). It seems like what the DCF representative wanted\nus to take away was that we should be thoughtful and make the best\ndecisions we could for our children, which on its face sounds really\ngood! What gives me pause, though, is that in a culture where it's\nrelatively rare for younger kids to be out on their own, I could still\nsee a caseworker disagreeing about whether our kids were mature\nenough.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt seems to me that despite the potential downsides of issuing\nguidelines they would still be pretty helpful on balance.  For\nexample:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nChildren vary dramatically in what they are ready for at different\nages, and there are no firm rules for when a level of independence is\nappropriate.  Based on our experience with children and families\nacross Massachusetts, however, here are some rough benchmarks.  For\neach situation we give the age at which we'd guess the typical child\ncan learn to handle it safely, along with ages for especially mature\nand immature children.\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Staying home alone for 15min: ...\n</li>\n<li>Staying home alone for 3hr: ...\n</li>\n<li>Staying home alone overnight: ...\n</li>\n<li>Crossing a low-traffic street: ...\n</li>\n<li>Playing at a playground they can walk home from: ...\n</li>\n<li>...\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\nWe hope these guidelines give you an idea of what our expectations are\ngoing in before learning more the specifics of your situation.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nOn the other hand, when you look at states that do give guidelines\nyou tend to see very conservative guidelines.  For example, here's <a href=\"https://portal.ct.gov/DCF/Families/Leaving-your-child-alone\">CT</a>:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nExperts believe a child should be at least 12 before he is left alone,\nand at least 15 before he can care for a younger brother or\nsister. These are the minimum ages. Not every child is ready then.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nAnd <a href=\"https://ocfs.ny.gov/programs/cps/FAQ.php#supervision\">NY</a>:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nSome children are responsible, intelligent, and independent enough to\nbe left alone at 12 or 13 years of age. Likewise, there are some\nteenagers who are too irresponsible or who have special needs that\nlimit their ability to be safe if they are left alone.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nHaving no guidelines is probably better than having very limiting\nones, so maybe I should be thankful that MA DCF doesn't give any?\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0jwMwAU4Pn4BRxTFE8LRWPf4iuKA6JRJjDDsQeppCtMnz39TqXuTLLESbD54a6zmpl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/dcaHJwWSutBEgumsY\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110385178997857972\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/dcf-event-notes", "date_published": "2023-05-17 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
