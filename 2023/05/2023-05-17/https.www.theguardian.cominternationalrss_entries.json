With a contract until 2027, he could become the first player to win the golden boot in England for four straight seasons. A few players have managed this feat in the big European leagues: Jean-Pierre Papin (1988-1992), Carlos Bianchi (1976-1979) in France, Robert Lewandowski in Germany (2018-2022), Lionel Messi (2017-2021) and Hugo S\u00e1nchez in Spain (1984\u201388).</p><p>S\u00e1nchez won the Pichichi for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 1984\u201385 before moving to Real Madrid and winning it in each of the next three seasons. His most eye-catching achievement, however, came in the 1989-90 season when he claimed his fifth Pichichi in six years. Not only did he match Telmo Zarra\u2019s record of 38 league goals \u2013 which was set in 1950-51 and was only surpassed 60 years later when Cristiano Ronaldo scored 40 in a season \u2013 but <a href=\"https://youtu.be/H6rTsKUQYks\">he scored all 38 of his goals with one-touch finishes</a>. By comparison, 86% of Haaland\u2019s 36 goals have come from one-touch finishes, including seven penalties. Of the previous six golden boot winners, only Mo Salah in 2018-19 has come close to that level of efficiency, with 73%.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/17/hugo-sanchez-38-goals-real-madrid-first-touch-erling-haaland-manchester-city\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/17/hugo-sanchez-38-goals-real-madrid-first-touch-erling-haaland-manchester-city", "date_published": "2023-05-17 09:00:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018The reality is worse\u2019: can TV drama end legal woes of Egypt\u2019s bereaved?", "description": "<p>As a hit series puts patriarchal guardianship laws under the spotlight,  campaigners say proposed reforms are not enough</p><p>The day before Aly Hegazy graduated from high school in June 2020, his father died from cancer after a long illness.
