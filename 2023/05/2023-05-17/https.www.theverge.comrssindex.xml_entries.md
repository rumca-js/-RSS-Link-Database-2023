  <p id="6XrVLm">Are you a hacker who happens to miss their Blackberry? Looks like there’s <a href="https://beepberry.sqfmi.com">a new product</a> that’s just your speed: the “Beepberry.” It literally grafts the keyboard of a Blackberry Classic onto a pocketable custom board designed to fit a Raspberry Pi Zero W, all paired with a 400 x 240 “Memory LCD” screen that looks like it was ripped from an old graphing calculator — but is a bit more sophisticated. </p>
<p id="TCc0gq">Beepberry is designed by Eric Migicovsky, founder of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/19/20921584/pebble-smartwatches-second-life-rebble-alliance-fitbit-github-kickstarter">gone-but-not-forgotten</a> Pebble smartwatch and more relevantly co-founder of Beeper: the hacky <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242143/beeper-universal-chat-app-imessage-whatsapp-signal-telegram-pebble-founder">all-in-one messenging app</a> that stuffs every service from WhatsApp to iMessage (using a jailbroken iPhone) into one place. </p>

  <p id="kGAb5v">Montana Governor Greg Gianforte has signed a bill banning TikTok within the state — the first ban of its kind in the United States.

<p id="weq8Kf">“To protect Montanans’ personal and private data from the Chinese Communist Party, I have banned TikTok in Montana,” Gianforte <a href="https://twitter.com/GovGianforte/status/1658948119285964802">tweeted today</a>.</p>
<p id="AStKlp">TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter responded with a statement on Twitter. “Governor Gianforte has signed a bill that infringes on the First Amendment rights of the people of #Montana by unlawfully banning #TikTok, a platform that empowers hundreds of thousands of people across the state,” <a href="https://twitter.com/brookeob1/status/1658966895230369798?s=61&amp;t=-OWBWFnLYwHzH1uVuP5nNw">O...</a></p>

<p id="bAYb51">“Max Ad-Lite subscribers get all the same content as ad-free subscribers,” Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said during the event. “See only three or four minutes of ads per hour and pay just $9.99 a month.”</p>
<p id="8oR3IC">That puts the service on par with HBO Max, which <a href="https://help.hbomax.com/us/Answer/Detail/000001285">currently offers four ads per hour</a> on its ad-supported plan. In addition to sharing similar commercial break lengths, Max will also have the same $9.99 per month or $99 per year pricing for its “Ad-Lite” plan, with options...</p>

We’re not sure how much longer it’ll stick around, so it might be smart to buy it sooner rather than later. In most instances, we’ve seen it sell out in a matter of hours.</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="kNxF34"><div></div></aside></div>
<p id="P8Uawm">In case you’re unfamiliar with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, it’s basically split into two tiers.

  <p id="HaholI">Out of the blue, Amazon dropped a slew of new Echo devices today. One of these, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/17/23726684/amazon-echo-pop-smart-speaker-new-show-5-display-price">the Echo Pop</a>, is a brand-new smart speaker with a semi-sphere form factor we haven’t seen before. The other two are revamped versions of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/17/23725378/amazon-echo-buds-3-announced-features-price">Echo Show 5</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/17/23725378/amazon-echo-buds-3-announced-features-price">Echo Buds</a>, both of which feature more than just a few changes. </p>

  <p id="NdTF2o">Uber announced a new account for teenagers that allows minors to take rides without their parent or guardian present. </p>
<p id="q4FC4Y">Prior to today’s announcement, unaccompanied minors were not allowed to request Uber rides. Uber has required users to be at least 18 years of age to sign up for an account since it was founded over a decade ago. But now, the company is allowing teens aged 13 to 17 to have their own account and take their own rides — as long as it’s linked to their guardian’s account. </p>
<p id="GX5D7j">“Our approach here is to solve a problem that is unsolved, that is a massive pain point in our users’ lives, both the guardians as well as the teens,” Sachin Kansal, vice president for product at Uber, said in an interview. </p>

In the movie’s latest trailer, trying to save (or in some cases, destroy) the world seems to be synonymous with risking one’s life while doing absurd stunts, which makes sense for the franchise. But watching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17566014/mission-impossible-fallout-review-tom-cruise">Ethan Hunt</a> jump from all these great heights, it’s hard not to want to see him <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/11/23718295/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-early-hours-death">pull out a glider to descend from the sky</a> rather than bank on the plot armor we all know is going to keep him from falling to his death.</p>

Two years after releasing its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price">second-gen set of noise-canceling earbuds</a>, Amazon has returned with a different approach. The new Echo Buds ditch noise cancellation and ear tips altogether in favor of a semi-open design <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review">not unlike the regular AirPods</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fusa.1more.com%2Fproducts%2Fcomfobuds-true-wireless-headphones&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F5%2F17%2F23725378%2Famazon-echo-buds-3-announced-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1More ComfoBuds</a>. The overhauled design has led to a far more affordable $49.99 price compared to the $139.99 Echo Buds — now known as “Echo Buds with Active Noise Cancellation” to differentiate the two.

  <p id="S3dBPx">Even though so much of our world is now wireless, most of those wavelengths are still made possible by a worldwide network of hardwired cables — from the huge backbones of internet service providers to the ethernet lines in people’s homes. The cables that connect continents under the ocean alone span a length of more than 700,000 miles. Just 50 years after the invention of ethernet, our planet Earth is now literally wrapped in the embrace of the internet. It’s the cord that can’t be cut.</p>

  <p id="KmS0I5">It’s time to talk about my good buddy RJ. RJ45, that is. Well, technically, we’re going to talk about how ethernet cables, which tend to use an RJ45 connector, are glue that once bound so many of us together in multiplayer gaming bliss (before then, too, but my part of this story began at the turn of the century). It was a joyous copper pipeline for so many who might have looked askance at the four-player couch multiplayer that was the only context in which most ordinary people could relate to gaming with friends. That’s right; we’re talking LAN parties.</p>
<p id="OFRbpN">You know the ones. You heft, in multiple trips, your whole gaming rig — a beefy CRT monitor, honkin’ water-cooled desktop machine, keyboard, headphones (or outboard speakers if you’re...</p>

  <p id="sNqFQq">The next five years are almost guaranteed to be sweltering, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned today. Climate change has already raised baseline temperatures for the planet. Now, a weather pattern known as El Niño is going to make things even hotter when it develops later this year.</p>
<p id="fvx3n6">That one-two punch from El Niño and climate change is expected to “push global temperatures into uncharted territory,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en">said</a> in a press release today. “This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment. We need to be prepared.” </p>

  <p id="QE4BeX">In an interview with CNBC Tuesday evening, Elon Musk defended spreading conspiracy theories about the deadly mass shooting in Texas earlier this month.</p>
<p id="pFNtXF">On May 9th, open-source intelligence research group Bellingcat posted a story with <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/05/09/tracing-the-odnoklassniki-profile-of-the-texas-mall-shooter/">details about the shooter</a> that indicated he held white supremacist and neo-Nazi views. Bellingcat’s story included social media posts from the Russian social network Odnoklassniki that traced back to the shooter, including photos featuring a large swastika tattoo and body armor with a RWDS (Right-Wing Death Squad, <a href="https://www.adl.org/glossary/rwdsright-wing-death-squad">a far-right slogan</a>) patch. The Texas Department of Public Safety <a href="https://www.fox4news.com/news/allen-outlets-shooting-livestream-fbi-dps">has also said</a> that the shooter showed indications of holding neo-Nazi ideology, with an official saying that “He had patches.

  <p id="jmDl4G">During an interview on CNBC, Elon Musk defended his right to say inflammatory things on Twitter, even if those statements lose him money. He appeared to disassociate briefly after being asked why even bother tweeting. And he eventually quoted <em>The Princess Bride</em> to explain his cavalier attitude toward what he shares on Twitter. </p>
<p id="j2Ccn8">It was a very weird interview.</p>
<p id="XJWuMZ">The interview came after a particular troubling run of tweets for Musk, in which he promoted conspiracy theories about a mass shooting in Texas, was accused of antisemitism after claiming that George Soros “hates humanity,” and retweeted discredited theories about crime and race. </p>
