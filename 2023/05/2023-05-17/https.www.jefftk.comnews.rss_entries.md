Whenever I post about letting our kids be more independent, especially
when it involves being on their own in public, people comment with
fears of </span>

<a href="https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-department-of-children-families">DCF</a>
(or 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protective_services">CPS</a>
in other states): "did you hear about that family in 

<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/free-range-parents-cleared-in-second-neglect-case-after-children-walked-alone/2015/06/22/82283c24-188c-11e5-bd7f-4611a60dd8e5_story.html">Maryland</a>?"
The same thing happens when talking to other parents: "I think my
oldest is ready to go to the park by themself, but I'm worried someone
would call DCF on them." We're also worried about cars, or if they
fall and get hurt, but DCF is a different kind of worry: it's not
something where we can just use our best judgment, it's something
where our best judgment could be called into question.



<p>

A neighborhood parent friend organized <a href="https://somervillepubliclibrary.assabetinteractive.com/meeting-and-study-rooms/encouraging-kids-independence-helping-parents-understand-dcfs-role/">a
meeting</a> with a DCF representative for parents to learn more about
the report handling process, how they make their decisions, and ask
questions. There ended up being about thirty of us, I learned a good
bit about how DCF approaches their work, and I'm glad I went.

</p>

<p>

Overall, my main takeaway was that this kind of situation, DCF
deciding that a parent is neglecting their child by allowing them to
play independently, is very little of what DCF spends their time on.
This meant there was a bit of a mismatch in what the representative
and the parents wanted to get out of the event.  The representative
wanted us to think about and avoid the kinds of issues that come up
the most: sexting, getting into their parents' edibles, truancy, etc.
But how much of "insufficient supervision in a public place"
triggering very few DCF cases is due to parents being very cautious
out of fear of DCF's response?

</p>

<p>

The parents were generally very interested in how DCF decides whether
some level of supervision is sufficient, and what we got was that
there are no hard rules or even guidelines, and that every situation
is handled on its own with discretion and judgment.  MA is not a state
with age-based rules for any of this, and DCF doesn't give advice or
comment on hypotheticals.  I both see why the parents overall found
this frustrating (I think my kid is ready to be at the park by
themselves how do I know I won't get in trouble?) and why the system
is that way (every kid is different, context matters enormously, human
behavior is complex). It seems like what the DCF representative wanted
us to take away was that we should be thoughtful and make the best
decisions we could for our children, which on its face sounds really
good! What gives me pause, though, is that in a culture where it's
relatively rare for younger kids to be out on their own, I could still
see a caseworker disagreeing about whether our kids were mature
enough.

</p>

<p>

It seems to me that despite the potential downsides of issuing
guidelines they would still be pretty helpful on balance.  For
example:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
Children vary dramatically in what they are ready for at different
ages, and there are no firm rules for when a level of independence is
appropriate.  Based on our experience with children and families
across Massachusetts, however, here are some rough benchmarks.  For
each situation we give the age at which we'd guess the typical child
can learn to handle it safely, along with ages for especially mature
and immature children.

<p>

</p>
<ul>

<li>Staying home alone for 15min: ...
</li>
<li>Staying home alone for 3hr: ...
</li>
<li>Staying home alone overnight: ...
</li>
<li>Crossing a low-traffic street: ...
</li>
<li>Playing at a playground they can walk home from: ...
</li>
<li>...
</li>
</ul>

<p>

We hope these guidelines give you an idea of what our expectations are
going in before learning more the specifics of your situation.
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>

On the other hand, when you look at states that do give guidelines
you tend to see very conservative guidelines.  For example, here's <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DCF/Families/Leaving-your-child-alone">CT</a>:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
Experts believe a child should be at least 12 before he is left alone,
and at least 15 before he can care for a younger brother or
sister. These are the minimum ages. Not every child is ready then.
</blockquote>



<p>

And <a href="https://ocfs.ny.gov/programs/cps/FAQ.php#supervision">NY</a>:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
Some children are responsible, intelligent, and independent enough to
be left alone at 12 or 13 years of age. Likewise, there are some
teenagers who are too irresponsible or who have special needs that
limit their ability to be safe if they are left alone.
</blockquote>



<p>

Having no guidelines is probably better than having very limiting
ones, so maybe I should be thankful that MA DCF doesn't give any?
