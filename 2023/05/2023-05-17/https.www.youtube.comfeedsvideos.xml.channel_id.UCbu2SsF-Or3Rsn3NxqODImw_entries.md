Capcom keeps making VR modes for Resident Evil games, so today weâ€™re gonna see if they are worth playing.
#gaming #ResidentEvil #gamespot 

Do you know who loves VR? Thatâ€™s right baby, it's Capcom. More specifically the resident evil team. They have put out 3, soon to be 4, major VR experiences for the iconic horror franchise. Resident Evil VII: Biohazard for the PlayStation VR, Resident Evil 4 for the Meta Quest 2, and Resident Evil Village for the PlayStation VR2. But are any of these actually worth playing?

After all, these arenâ€™t spinoff games or side stories, but mainline Resident Evil games playable from start to finish in VR. Much like how Half-Life Alyx showed how VR can evolve and elevate a beloved series, the same is possible for Resident Evil.

In this video weâ€™re going to explore how each of these games handles VR, what's great and not so great about them, and in one case provide an alternative way to play.
