Instead, the future seems more likely to offer a hung parliament and talk of coalition deals.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/17/keir-starmer-vision-new-labour-20-election\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/17/keir-starmer-vision-new-labour-20-election", "date_published": "2023-05-17 15:56:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Slovakia on brink of blocking legal recognition for trans people", "description": "<p>International human rights champions and LGBTQ+ campaigners appeal to MPs to vote against bill proposed by rightwingers</p><p>Slovakian MPs are under mounting international pressure to reject a bill that would see the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/15/hungary-passes-law-banning-lbgt-content-in-schools\">follow Hungary</a> in effectively putting a stop to decades of legal gender recognition for transgender people.</p><p>A vote is expected in parliament within days on a law proposed by conservative and far-right parties that would require someone to have the \u201ccorrect\u201d set of chromosomes to match their legal gender.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/17/slovakia-block-legal-recognition-trans-people-lgbtq\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/17/slovakia-block-legal-recognition-trans-people-lgbtq", "date_published": "2023-05-17 15:43:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Anselm review \u2013 Wim Wenders\u2019 reverent 3D portrait of artist Anselm Kiefer", "description": "<p>The director\u2019s serious examination of the German artist\u2019s life and work has an architectural quality as it moves around some monumental art \u2013 and studios</p><p><br />Wim Wenders brings a certain awe, or even shock, or even a kind of reverently docu-dramatised PTSD to his film about the German artist Anselm Kiefer. The creator of paintings, photographs, colossal installations and illustrated book artefacts is celebrated but in some quarters criticised for his engagement with German fascism and the Holocaust, mediated through his lifelong love for the poetry of Paul Celan. The film shows us his work in all its giganticism, with minimal archival interview material, though there are some fancifully conceived but successfully executed fantasy scenes of the artist in boyhood and young adulthood. The title perhaps intends the use of his first name not in any relaxed way, but in a style comparable to Leonardo or Michelangelo.</p><p>This is a film which Wenders presents in 3D, just as he did with his study of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/21/pina-review\">Pina Bausch in 2011</a> \u2013 the effect of the three dimensions there was to accentuate the physicality of the dancers. Here it has a more architectural effect, especially when we are in Kiefer\u2019s studio areas, such as his huge 40-hectare atelier site La Ribaute in Barjac, near N\u00eemes in the south of France, which, with all its huge exhibition spaces and sculpture gardens is virtually this creator\u2019s own city state. The 3D delineates the vast forms and monumental structures that loom up and out of the screen: we are immersed in this place in the way visitors would be, maybe even more so, as the camera is mounted on drones and platforms, and the film always encourages you go into cathedral-rubbernecker mode.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/17/anselm-review-wim-wenders-reverent-3d-portrait-of-artist-anselm-kiefer\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/17/anselm-review-wim-wenders-reverent-3d-portrait-of-artist-anselm-kiefer", "date_published": "2023-05-17 15:33:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "YouTube found to push content about guns to children watching games videos", "description": "<p>Video site recommended videos related to weapons, shooting and murderers to accounts for boys aged nine and 14, report says</p><p>YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm continues to direct young video game fans down dark paths of violent and dangerous content, a report has found, years after critics first raised concerns about the system.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/youtube-leads-young-gamers-to-videos-of-guns-school\">A report</a> from the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), a Washington DC-based nonprofit, observed the effects of the video sharing site\u2019s recommendation algorithms on a spread of accounts identified as those of boys aged nine and 14.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/17/youtube-found-to-push-content-about-guns-to-children-watching-games-videos\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/17/youtube-found-to-push-content-about-guns-to-children-watching-games-videos", "date_published": "2023-05-17 15:30:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Off-key Novak Djokovic bundled out of Italian Open by Holger Rune", "description": "<ul><li>Talented Dane prevails 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 in an epic quarter-final</li><li>Djokovic appeared to be struggling physically in defeat</li></ul><p>Holger Rune sent an off-colour Novak Djokovic tumbling out of the Italian Open on Wednesday as the talented Dane prevailed 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 in an epic battle against the defending champion to secure his place in the semi-finals.</p><p>Rune outlasted Djokovic in three sets in last year\u2019s Paris Masters final and the 20-year-old got off to the perfect start in search of another upset by breaking the world No 1 in the opening game of the match.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/17/novak-djokovic-out-of-italian-open-holger-rune-tennis\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/17/novak-djokovic-out-of-italian-open-holger-rune-tennis", "date_published": "2023-05-17 15:28:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Johnny Depp on comeback trail in Cannes amid criticism of festival organisers", "description": "<p>With protesters banned, the premiere of Depp\u2019s first film in three years saw him receive a seven-minute standing ovation \u2013 but opponents argue he is being given a free pass</p><p>The protesters were banned, the red carpet rolled out and Johnny Depp strolled into Cannes like a conquering hero.

His mother had recently died and the whole family had gathered in Tucson in the house of an uncle. I hadn\u2019t seen my father for three years. It was the Fourth of July. I remember some desultory conversation about the holiday, before my father, who had a penchant for making abrupt sotto voce pronouncements, offered an opinion about our treatment of North American Indigenous people. His tone wasn\u2019t argumentative. His words just hung there and drifted away. He died later that day in a tragic and sudden accident, so we never got a chance to pursue the discussion.

Of course, it was not that at all, as we gradually realised. It was layered.

These famous cards \u2013 both intensely guarded and instantly recognisable \u2013 continue to be used for psychological diagnosis around the world. New copies are only printed every five years or so, and no one has ever been allowed to document the process.

He had been born in Z\u00fcrich 37 years earlier, the first of three children \u2013 two boys and a girl \u2013 to Philippine and Ulrich. His father was an extremely skilled artist and wrote a 100-page treatise titled Outline of a Theory of Form in which he considered many aspects of visual perception, asking: \u201cWho among us has not often and with pleasure turned our eyes and imagination to the ever-changing shapes and movements of the clouds and the mist?\u201d. Hermann became a gifted student and joined the elite academic Gymnasium in Schaffhausen, northern Switzerland. His skill as an artist was perhaps his defining characteristic, however, and led to his admiringly mocking nickname of Klex, a shortening of <em>klexen</em> or <em>klecksen</em>, which means something like \u201cto daub\u201d. <em>Klex</em> also means ink blot.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/17/no-one-has-been-allowed-to-document-the-process-before-a-first-ever-look-at-the-making-of-the-rorschach-test\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/17/no-one-has-been-allowed-to-document-the-process-before-a-first-ever-look-at-the-making-of-the-rorschach-test", "date_published": "2023-05-17 13:00:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Wales votes to ban \u2018cruel\u2019 animal snares", "description": "<p>Critics say traps regularly catch non-target species and animals can suffer for days</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/may/17/pmqs-keir-starmer-speech-rishi-sunak-oliver-dowden-angela-rayner-g7-michael-gove-housing-latest-updates\">UK politics live \u2013 latest updates</a></li></ul><p>Wales is on track to become the first UK nation to ban snares, after a vote in the Senedd backed criminalising what campaigners say is a cruel and indiscriminate way to trap wild animals.</p><p>The wire traps are used by gamekeepers and farmers across the country in efforts to catch foxes, which would otherwise hunt lambs and gamebirds.

HG Wells dreamed up this template in 1897, with Martian invaders laying waste the home counties in The War of the Worlds. Half a century later, John Wyndham\u2019s The Kraken Wakes (1953) envisaged the melting of the ice caps not as the by-product of human negligence but as the result of a hostile intervention by alien forces.</p><p>In writing my novel <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/conquest-9781529420777?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Conquest</a>, I was determined to subvert these violent stereotypes. What I find most compelling about earlier alien invasion narratives is the way they highlight how vulnerable we are, not to aliens so much as our own irrational behaviour in the face of the unknown. I wanted to reveal the theme of alien invasion as infinitely flexible, adapting itself to subtle, ambiguous stories in which the divide between human and alien is not always clear cut. My protagonist Frank Landau stands in permanent danger of losing his sanity to his obsessions. And yet Frank has a brilliant mind; in many ways, he is the most sensitive and compassionate individual in the novel. The tension between these two truths is the engine that drives Conquest, and it is this irreconcilable contradiction between delusion and epiphany I find most fascinating in other alien invasion stories.

The internal monologue of a mother (the Soldier of the title) addressed to her son (Sailor), it exists, almost, outside of time.

It\u2019s her account of the feeling of finding herself torn out of what she had believed was her real life and deposited in a sleep-deprived, incoherent parallel universe where achieving anything is momentous but anything that is achieved is both negligible and banal. \u201cI produced a shoe only to find you\u2019d pulled off your sock,\u201d she says of the teeth-grinding process of trying to leave the house. \u201cI put the sock back on while you pulled off the other one.

In South Bend, Indiana, James Bond Jr first got into trouble as a teenager with the police when he merely told them his name and the cop thought he was taking the piss, because this Bond happened to be black. Years later he was accused of murder, and during the manhunt the name was in the news a lot, causing problems for another James Bond who lived in the same town.
