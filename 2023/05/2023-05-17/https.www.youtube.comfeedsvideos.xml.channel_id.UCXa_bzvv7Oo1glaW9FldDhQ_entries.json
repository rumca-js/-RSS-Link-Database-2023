As series fans will gladly tell you though, that couldn't be further from the truth. There is a startling amount of narrative content packed into Street Fighter, and across multiple releases, it has built up quite the rich universe.\n\nAnd though it also has a massive roster of characters that has only expanded with each new game, there are some that have always been more strongly associated with the series than others. One of them is Ryu, who is effectively the protagonist of the Street Fighter franchise, and here, we're going to cover his entire story from beginning to end, in preparation of Street Fighter 6's launch in June.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwVDltc_lBU", "date_published": "2023-05-17 15:30:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "10 Things HARDCORE FANS HATE About Tears of the Kingdom", "description": "Well, it\u2019s finally here.
