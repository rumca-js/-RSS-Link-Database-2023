<p>Europe must manufacture its own cutting-edge chips or risk being left to build old-style chips, said EU Commissioner Thierry Breton during a keynote speech to semiconductor companies this week.</p><p>Europe must refuse “any attempt of geographical segmentation where Europe would produce mature nodes, while Asia and the US would produce advanced nodes,” Breton said while speaking at the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre’s annual event in Antwerp. </p><p>He added that Europe “cannot and will not” be considered an observer when it comes to chip manufacturing, saying “I want a Europe that knows how to lead in semiconductors.”</p><p>Breton highlighted how important European research and technology has been to the advanced chips manufactured today but acknowledged that “excellent research” is not enough.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3696752/europe-must-lead-in-semiconductor-manufacturing-eu-commissioner.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
