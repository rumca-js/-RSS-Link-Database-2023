Fast X reviewed by Tom Jorgensen. Video edited by Tristan Oglivie. Opens in theaters on May 19, 2023.

Fast X is the beginning of the end, but the race to the end of that beginning is a bumpy ride, saved nearly single-handedly by Jason Momoa’s bonkers performance as Dante Reyes, which deserves instant canonization on the Mt. Rushmore of Fast & Furious villains. There’s still time for the Fast franchise to cross the finish line in first, but this flat tire of a “part one” will make the last lap a nailbiter.

Link may be missing his right arm, but his feet haven’t forgotten how to shield surf since Breath of the Wild. Riding down slopes is as fun as ever, but with Link’s new abilities comes a whole new way for you to channel your inner Tony Hawk. Here are the numerous different ways that you can Shield Surf and Shield Skate in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

We'll show you the basics of Shield Surfing as well as how to combine Shields with Minecarts, Springs and Bombs with the Fuse ability, and how that can transform your Shield Surfing adventures in Hyrule.

Here's how the Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom opening sequence is perfect! With the vast majority of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom beholden to the players' imagination and drive to discover, no two journeys through Hyrule will ever be completely alike. The only true power Nintendo has over your adventure is the start and end point of its main story, with the former needing to be expertly curated in its direction to give you everything you'll need to flourish from that point onwards. It’s a level of bold authorship that trusts the player to write the rest of their story. Watch to find out why we think the Tears of the Kingdom intro is so good.

Join star John Cena (who plays Jakob) for a behind-the-scenes look at Fast X. Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious saga, stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jason Momoa, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Sung Kang, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior, Scott Eastwood, Leo Abelo Perry, with Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, and Rita Moreno.

Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever. 

In 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. 

Dante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. 

Fast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum, and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis, and Mark Bomback.

Fast X, directed by Louis Leterrier, opens in theaters on May 19, 2023.
