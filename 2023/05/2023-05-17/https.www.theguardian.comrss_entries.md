<p>This heartbreaking documentary looks at a decades-long battle with drugs and alcohol that’s torn the musician’s family apart. It’s a moving look at how it’s affected not just him, but his wife too</p><p>Matt Willis: Fighting Addiction begins with the Busted bass players’ wife, Emma. In their big, light-filled house in Hertfordshire, the TV presenter opens a drawer that tends to remain shut. She retrieves a diary she hasn’t read since she wrote it in the run-up to their wedding in 2008. It contains, she says with a tight smile, “notes of what I knew he had consumed”. She reads a couple of entries: “bottle of champagne … couple of wines … couple of wines … another bottle of champagne.” The words “and more” refer to drugs. There are entries for every single day. “I used to drive around looking for him,” she says, welling up.</p><p>It sets the scene for this intimate, often tearful exploration of Willis’s decades-long battle with drug and alcohol addiction. A story of the ricochet back and forth between relapse and sobriety that focuses as much on Emma’s pain as Willis’s. Celebrity addiction is a well-trodden subject, but less explored is its devastating impact on families. Willis’s film, in which he sets off around the country and into his own past to try to find out why he is as he is, is in equal parts Emma’s film. His last relapse happened when the youngest of their three children was 10 months old. His first words to camera are about his wife: “I’ve hurt her so many times I don’t know where to begin.”</p><p>Matt Willis: Fighting Addiction aired on BBC One and is available on BBC iPlayer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/17/matt-willis-fighting-addiction-review-the-busted-bassist-is-frequently-in-tears">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Koepka and Johnson could be in the mix at Oak Hill which would make things awkward for the US Ryder Cup captain</p><p>Brooks Koepka and Dustin Johnson want to play in the Ryder Cup. There are influential members of the United States team who want Brooks Koepka and Dustin Johnson to play in the Ryder Cup. Yet speaking on the eve of the US PGA Championship, team captain Zach Johnson was as dismissive of the prospect of LIV rebels boarding September’s charter to Rome as someone of his mild disposition could possibly be.

<p>Director Hirokazu Kore-eda offers a deliberately dense but ultimately hopeful examination of how to negotiate family dysfunction with intelligence and humanity</p><p>Hirokazu Kore-eda challenges us with intricacy and complexity in this family drama about bullying, homophobia, family dysfunction, uncritical respect for flawed authority, and social media rumour-mongering; all working together to create a monster of wrongness. Kore-eda is collaborating with screenwriter Yûji Sakamoto and the late composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, whose score creates a layer of nuance and meaning. Its plangent, sad piano chords will often counterintuitively be added to a scene of apparent drama or tension, implying that the meaning of this scene has not yet been disclosed. Monster is a movie that does not render up its meanings easily in general, and its repeated motif is to replay the same events from a different viewpoint; in another type of film this might deliver the smooth and gratifying narrative click of a twist-reveal falling into place, but here it has a way of raising more questions than answers.</p><p>The action begins with a building burning to the ground, a dramatic blaze against the night sky, and this spectacular event makes a convenient starting point when the action is replayed. The building is the site of a sleazy hostess-bar, and a scandalous rumour runs around that local schoolteacher Mr Hori (Eita Nagayami) was one of the customers. Single mum Saori (Sakura Ando) has heard this tale and is thus perhaps already disposed to think ill of the man; her son Minato (Soya Kurokawa) then comes home from school saying that Mr Hori has humiliated him with a bizarre “pig brain” insult (or has Minato appropriated that insult from elsewhere?) and the teacher also appears to have hit him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/17/monster-review-hydra-of-modern-morals-and-manners">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prime minister has a duty to resist the capture of his party by xenophobic nationalism</p><p>The campaign to leave the EU promised many things, but hard agricultural labour was not among them. Seasonal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/14/why-uk-farms-recruiting-fruit-pickers-from-7000-miles-away" title="">fruit picking</a> is physically demanding, poorly paid work that was, before Brexit, done mostly by migrants exercising their freedom to live in any EU member state. Ending that freedom is one of the few Brexit pledges that has been delivered. But enthusiasts for the project are dissatisfied. Net migration <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/commentaries/why-has-non-eu-migration-to-the-uk-risen/" title="">has not fallen</a>. Last year it was estimated at around 500,000.</p><p>That number is inflated by exceptional cases – Ukrainian refugees and Hong Kong passport holders – but no downward trend is forecast.

Farmers still <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/15/ministers-call-for-immigration-and-uk-food-prices-to-increase" title="">need fruit pickers</a>.

<p>Proposals unveiled by Andy Burnham could transform vocational learning for the better</p><p>Well over half of young people do not go on to university after leaving school, and our education system is letting many of them down. Further education colleges and sixth forms offering technical pathways into work have been grievously underfunded for years. New vocational qualifications, designed as an alternative to more academic GCSEs and A-levels, have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/dec/11/furthereducation.uk" title="">poorly understood</a> and <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/39333/documents/193104/default/" title="">insufficiently valued</a> by employers. The value and importance of apprenticeships is routinely acknowledged in Westminster; but the education select committee last month reported a steep and long-term decline in the number of under-19s actually doing one.</p><p>The net result is a shameful waste of the potential of millions of school pupils, with knock-on economic effects in terms of growth and productivity. The challenges represented by the green economy, artificial intelligence and an ageing population mean that Britain can ill afford to neglect the formation and prospects of the majority of its future workforce. But a reset is required to restore status, value and resources to non-university routes to employment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/17/the-guardian-view-on-technical-education-manchester-can-blaze-a-trail">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Vin Diesel et al return for an overstuffed Fast and Furious chapter that delivers giddily effective action but an outsized and silly villain</p><p>The Fast &amp; Furious franchise reached the ideal level of sublime ridiculousness with Fast Five, which brought Dom Toretto, Brian O’Conner and four films’ worth of gearhead rogues together for a compact heist thriller that’s basically Ocean’s Eleven with cars. It peaks with the ultimate smash-and-grab job, as Dom and Brian attach a giant bank vault to their Dodge Chargers and drag it through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, occasionally thwacking their pursuers like an improvised wrecking ball. The films that followed have tried nobly to top the simple, lizard-brain pleasure of this moment – the skydiving cars in Furious 7 come the closest – but recent entries have started to grind like metal-on-metal, scrambling to figure out how to top itself.</p><p>Fast X seems to recognize Fast Five as the top of the franchise bell curve, because it starts there, by retconning a super-villain out of a previous villain’s son. (It turns out there are unforeseen consequences for killing a crime boss with a flying bank vault.) By flashing back to the heist sequence, the film also announces itself as a return to the giddy excesses of the series’ best moments, embracing high camp and cartoonishly destructive violence while leaving behind the glum tone of entries like The Fate of the Furious. It may be dumb as a box of rocks, but there’s still something irresistibly vulgar about a film that nearly blows up the Vatican as a throat-clearing exercise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/17/fast-10-movie-review-fast-and-furious-sequel-vin-diesel">Continue reading...</a>

## Keir Starmer does have a vision – and it’s not New Labour 2.0 | Martin Kettle

<p>Defying political orthodoxy, the leader believes he can win an election outright by reuniting his party’s working- and middle-class wings</p><p>For some, any idea that Keir Starmer and audacity are words that can sit comfortably in the same sentence will seem nonsensical. To many who define themselves as Labour supporters, the most salient characteristic of the opposition leader is not his audacity but its opposite, timidity. In this critique, Starmer’s strategy, if he really has one, is to do as little as possible to offend the voters, and wait for the Conservatives to eject themselves from government by their own divisions and incompetence rather than to drive them from it.</p><p>Seen thus, the English local elections of 2023 were quickly interpreted as an object warning on the limits of this supposed approach. The Conservative vote share on 4 May was predictably down after the negligence and bloodletting of 2022. Labour’s lead, though, was more modest, so the spoils were shared with the Liberal Democrats and Greens. After the voting, a Labour landslide no longer beckoned as brightly. Instead, the future seems more likely to offer a hung parliament and talk of coalition deals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/17/keir-starmer-vision-new-labour-20-election">Continue reading...</a>

## Anselm review – Wim Wenders’ reverent 3D portrait of artist Anselm Kiefer

<p>The director’s serious examination of the German artist’s life and work has an architectural quality as it moves around some monumental art – and studios</p><p><br />Wim Wenders brings a certain awe, or even shock, or even a kind of reverently docu-dramatised PTSD to his film about the German artist Anselm Kiefer. The creator of paintings, photographs, colossal installations and illustrated book artefacts is celebrated but in some quarters criticised for his engagement with German fascism and the Holocaust, mediated through his lifelong love for the poetry of Paul Celan. The film shows us his work in all its giganticism, with minimal archival interview material, though there are some fancifully conceived but successfully executed fantasy scenes of the artist in boyhood and young adulthood. The title perhaps intends the use of his first name not in any relaxed way, but in a style comparable to Leonardo or Michelangelo.</p><p>This is a film which Wenders presents in 3D, just as he did with his study of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/21/pina-review">Pina Bausch in 2011</a> – the effect of the three dimensions there was to accentuate the physicality of the dancers. Here it has a more architectural effect, especially when we are in Kiefer’s studio areas, such as his huge 40-hectare atelier site La Ribaute in Barjac, near Nîmes in the south of France, which, with all its huge exhibition spaces and sculpture gardens is virtually this creator’s own city state. The 3D delineates the vast forms and monumental structures that loom up and out of the screen: we are immersed in this place in the way visitors would be, maybe even more so, as the camera is mounted on drones and platforms, and the film always encourages you go into cathedral-rubbernecker mode.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/17/anselm-review-wim-wenders-reverent-3d-portrait-of-artist-anselm-kiefer">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Comfortable is not good’: Kym Marsh on the horror of Hear’Say – and landing the Take That musical

Her 26-year-old daughter, Emilie Cunliffe, has arrived from rehearsals and they’re going out tonight. Marsh switches into mothering mode: “Do you want some dinner? Get some food.” The pair are starring in <a href="https://greatestdaysmusical.com/">Greatest Days</a>, a musical based around Take That songs – renamed from its 2017 version, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/27/the-band-review-take-that-musical-manchester-opera-house">The Band</a> – which has just started touring the UK.</p><p>Both Marshes play the lead character Rachel, who, as an adult, gets back in touch with her old mates to see their favourite boyband from their teen years. It’s a musical about the passing of time, friendship, loss, and the place and power pop music has in our lives. A majority of the audience will be familiar with the Take That hits – so are they worried about people dancing and singing along, which has caused <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/10/bodyguard-police-fighting-urinating-seats-ugly-new-side-of-theatre-audiences">disruption at other shows</a> recently? “It’s Take That – people are going to know the tunes,” says Marsh. “There’s always a part in a musical where the audience are encouraged to join in, usually at the end. I think it’s a fine line between enjoying yourself and disrupting the entire thing. It’s nice when people are enjoying it, but we’ve got a job to do.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/17/kym-marsh-take-that-musical-hearsay-greatest-days-corrie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The trio’s Police-inspired sound shot them to Latin megastardom. 40 years later, audiences worldwide are finally tuning in – including Bono and Chris Martin</p><p>Rudy Pensa, the Argentine-born owner of New York guitar store <a href="https://rudysmusic.com/">Rudy’s Music Stop</a>, was in a back room polishing merchandise when one of his store’s most frequent visitors stopped by. On this particular day in 1988, Carlos Alomar – David Bowie’s longtime collaborator – didn’t want a new instrument. Instead, he was keen to produce a Latin rock band, and needed pointing in the right direction. Pensa retrieved a notebook to find a phone number he’d jotted down for a singer, Gustavo Cerati, who’d recently visited the shop, and asked Alomar: “Have you ever heard of a band from Argentina called Soda Stereo?”</p><p>Today, that’s a question that would draw a puzzled look from just about any Latino. To ask it in 2023, on the 40th anniversary of the band’s public debut, is a little like asking an American or Briton if they know who the Beatles are. “<em>Everybody</em> in the Hispanic market knows about Soda Stereo,” Alomar, now 72, says about a band that packed stadiums and arenas across the continent, sometimes with crowds of more than 100,000: an unheard of level of success for a Latin rock band.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/17/soda-stereo-argentina-biggest-band-rediscovery">Continue reading...</a>

## Navajo cowboys impersonating John Wayne: Roswell Angier’s best photograph

<p>‘This was taken in the Indian Head Bar, a seedy place in New Mexico. The men were fascinated by John Wayne since The Hallelujah Trail was filmed around there. Yet Wayne wasn’t in it’</p><p></p><p></p><p>Before I actually went there, I knew nothing about the town of Gallup in New Mexico. I was familiar with a <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/265011">Robert Frank photograph of a sombre Navajo cowboy,</a> taken surreptitiously in a bar there in the 1950s that was published in his classic book The Americans. The picture stayed with me. The place did not. But I decided to go there because of an exchange I had with my father in 1966. His mother had recently died and the whole family had gathered in Tucson in the house of an uncle. I hadn’t seen my father for three years. It was the Fourth of July. I remember some desultory conversation about the holiday, before my father, who had a penchant for making abrupt sotto voce pronouncements, offered an opinion about our treatment of North American Indigenous people. His tone wasn’t argumentative. His words just hung there and drifted away. He died later that day in a tragic and sudden accident, so we never got a chance to pursue the discussion. More than a decade later, my wife Susan – a painter – and I secured funding to produce some work. Thinking of my father and of Robert Frank’s Navajo cowboy, we chose to do so in Gallup.</p><p>At first glance, the town seemed like the edge of the world, with an upside-down exotic appeal. Of course, it was not that at all, as we gradually realised. It was layered. It was an in-between place, where people from different cultures collided with each other, often struggling to maintain their identities and not be overwhelmed by other people’s assumptions about who they were. Sometimes it seems as if the world has become increasingly consumed by this battle, but it’s a very old story.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/17/navajo-cowboys-john-wayne-roswell-angiers-best-photograph-hallelujah-trail">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The ink blots have been used as a diagnostic tool for 100 years, but the making of new ones, every five years, has been a closely guarded secret – until now</p><p>For images that have been reproduced for more than a century and looked at, quite intently, by millions of people, there is a great deal of secrecy surrounding the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/14/why-do-we-see-so-many-different-things-in-rorschach-ink-blots" title="">Rorschach ink blots</a>. These famous cards – both intensely guarded and instantly recognisable – continue to be used for psychological diagnosis around the world. New copies are only printed every five years or so, and no one has ever been allowed to document the process. So when I asked the publisher recently if I might do so, I had not expected them to say yes. There were conditions, of course: the most perplexing of which was that if I were to document the printing of the Rorschach ink blots, I must do so without revealing any information about the printing of the Rorschach ink blots. It seemed a test as exquisitely elegant as the one for which the cards themselves are used.</p><p>The ink blots are named after Hermann Rorschach, a Swiss psychologist who died so young that he only makes it halfway through <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/227750/the-inkblots-by-damion-searls/" title="">his biography</a>. One Sunday in late March 1922 he is taking his wife Olga to see Peer Gynt at the theatre and a week – five pages – later he’s dead. He had been born in Zürich 37 years earlier, the first of three children – two boys and a girl – to Philippine and Ulrich. His father was an extremely skilled artist and wrote a 100-page treatise titled Outline of a Theory of Form in which he considered many aspects of visual perception, asking: “Who among us has not often and with pleasure turned our eyes and imagination to the ever-changing shapes and movements of the clouds and the mist?”. Hermann became a gifted student and joined the elite academic Gymnasium in Schaffhausen, northern Switzerland. His skill as an artist was perhaps his defining characteristic, however, and led to his admiringly mocking nickname of Klex, a shortening of <em>klexen</em> or <em>klecksen</em>, which means something like “to daub”. <em>Klex</em> also means ink blot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/17/no-one-has-been-allowed-to-document-the-process-before-a-first-ever-look-at-the-making-of-the-rorschach-test">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bill Forsyth’s happy-sad tale about a fishing village under threat from US oil money is as wonderful as ever, with standout turns from Burt Lancaster and youthful Peter Capaldi</p><p>Bill Forsyth’s wonderfully wistful and charming comedy is rereleased after 40 years, and its happy-sad aroma is still as pungent as ever. It has a claim to be the last movie with the authentic spirit of the Ealing comedies; although with a longer perspective we can also see how it’s also indirectly influenced by producer David Puttnam in its high-minded spirit of Anglo-American amity.</p><p>The scene is a fictional fishing village in western Scotland, making its modest living from the lobster bound for the fancy restaurants of London and Paris, but which the locals can’t afford to eat. Peter Riegert plays Mac, a junior oil executive from Texas obsessed with work and material values, who has been tasked by his eccentric billionaire boss, Felix Happer, to travel to this village and persuade the entire community to sell up so that Happer can build a refinery there and capitalise on the new gush of North Sea oil. (There is a scene in which Happer appears to get a call from Margaret Thatcher in person.) Happer is played with unique brio and gusto by Burt Lancaster, whose legendary presence in itself confers something magical on the proceedings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/17/local-hero-review-wistful-80s-comedy-snares-your-heart-with-charm-and-beauty">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It turns out there were two winners in the Wembayama sweepstakes: the French teen hailed as the best NBA prospect since LeBron James could not have handpicked a better organization to develop his craft</p><p>The NBA draft is still more than a month away, but its biggest question has already been answered. After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/16/victor-wembanyama-san-antonio-spurs-nba-draft-lottery">winning Tuesday night’s draft lottery</a>, the San Antonio Spurs are almost certain to use this year’s No 1 pick to select teenage French basketball prodigy Victor Wembanyama. “Almost certain” is no exaggeration – according to oddsmakers at time of writing, a $100 wager on the Spurs to take Wembanyama with their pick would net the bettor just 50 cents.</p><p>It’s easy to see why Wembanyama is a shoo-in to be drafted first. At 19 years old and 7ft 4in tall, he’s already bigger than nearly everybody in the NBA and is possibly still growing. His height, however, is only a (metaphorically) small part of Wembanyama’s appeal. He does things on a basketball court which people have never seen before. He can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QeKhvu1KKE">collect his own missed three-point shot for a putback dunk</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKm6jza27zw">score at will over one of the best defenders in basketball</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hoops_bot/status/1549880197486243841?lang=en">dribble past opponents</a> like a player half his size. In what may be the greatest accomplishment of his nascent career, Wembanyama even seems to have already won the admiration of his NBA elders (not always a given, <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-news-cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-carlos-boozer-darius-miles-how-cavs-players-badmouthed-lebron-james-before-he-turned-the-teams-fate-around/">even for most heavily hyped prospects</a>).

<p>Malaysian director Amanda Nell Eu’s debut about a young girl discovering the truth behind her rebellious nature bristles with supernatural energy thanks to a tremendous young cast</p><p>There are some arresting images and bright performances in this bristling debut feature from Malaysian film-maker Amanda Nell Eu, who heads off into a jungle of the mind for a supernatural-realist drama and coming-of-age chiller about the female body and sexuality, with hints of Brian De Palma, David Cronenberg and Apichatpong Weerasethakul. It is possibly a little bit derivative and sometimes seems to be treading water in narrative terms, but only after making us submit to a very woozy and hallucinatory experience.</p><p>The scene is a Muslim school for girls in Malaysia whose pupils are required to submit to conservative dress and attitudes; in the English language class, they are presented with sentences such as: “The father goes to work. The mother cooks at home.” Twelve-year-old Zaffan (Zafreen Zairizal) hangs out with her friends Farah (Deena Ezral) and Mariam (Piqa), and from the very first we see that she is a natural rebel and leader: she is being filmed on someone’s phone in the toilets, dancing and removing her headscarf, a dangerously transgressive act. The teaching staff are highly annoyed at the girls getting up to no good in this semi-private place and the headteacher (Fatimah Abu Bakar) harangues them for their bad attitudes, and laments the fact that Chinese pupils beat the Malaysian in exam results.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/17/tiger-stripes-review-coming-of-age-body-horror-releases-the-monster-inside">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We ask ChatGPT to recreate scenes from recent TV classics – and the results are hilariously dreadful.

It touches on something much bigger: making sure that screenwriting will continue to exist as a profession. Recently, at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, a number of executives sang the praises of AI programs such as ChatGPT. “In the next three years, you’re going to see a movie that was written by AI made … a good one,” said film producer Todd Lieberman. Fox Entertainment CEO Rob Wade added: “Not just scripts. Editing, all of it … storyboarding a movie, anything … AI in the future, maybe not next year or the year after, but if we’re talking 10 years? AI is going to be able to do absolutely all of these things.”</p><p>Television written by AI is a terrifying prospect. Civilisation was built by humans telling stories. We’ve been doing it for tens of thousands of years, so the prospect of giving all of that up and relying on the equivalent of a random number generator to save executives a few pennies is horrifying. Still, there is at least some good news: for now, AI absolutely sucks when it comes to screenwriting.</p><p><em>SHIV (on phone, hesitant): Hello, Tom?</em></p><p><em>TOM (gently): Shiv, it’s Tom.

Set in the quaint, leafy Potsdam suburb of Babelsberg, a stadium that has witnessed so many of its residents’ highest moments was now playing host to their worst. As the whistle blew on Turbine Potsdam’s 5-1 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen, the curtain finally came down on their 26-year period in the top flight of German football. The home fans watching on were well aware they were witnessing a moment in history; one they would all probably rather forget. The end of an era, as one of the Frauen-Bundesliga’s last independent teams dropped out of the division.</p><p>It was a result that sent shockwaves through women’s football far beyond German shores.

## Top 10 strangest alien invasion novels

<p>We don’t need crash-bang confrontations in moral black and white. These novels tell more subtle stories, where the line between human and other blurs</p><p>Say the words “alien invasion” and the stories most people think of are those told in movies like Roland Emmerich’s Independence Day (1996), in which the battle lines between good and evil are cleanly divided. HG Wells dreamed up this template in 1897, with Martian invaders laying waste the home counties in The War of the Worlds. Half a century later, John Wyndham’s The Kraken Wakes (1953) envisaged the melting of the ice caps not as the by-product of human negligence but as the result of a hostile intervention by alien forces.</p><p>In writing my novel <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/conquest-9781529420777?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Conquest</a>, I was determined to subvert these violent stereotypes. What I find most compelling about earlier alien invasion narratives is the way they highlight how vulnerable we are, not to aliens so much as our own irrational behaviour in the face of the unknown. I wanted to reveal the theme of alien invasion as infinitely flexible, adapting itself to subtle, ambiguous stories in which the divide between human and alien is not always clear cut. My protagonist Frank Landau stands in permanent danger of losing his sanity to his obsessions. And yet Frank has a brilliant mind; in many ways, he is the most sensitive and compassionate individual in the novel. The tension between these two truths is the engine that drives Conquest, and it is this irreconcilable contradiction between delusion and epiphany I find most fascinating in other alien invasion stories. Here are 10 of my favourites:</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/17/top-10-strangest-alien-invasion-novels-nina-allan-conquest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Set in 1970, the year Blume’s novel was published, the sweet-natured story is engaging but does feel a little out of date</p><p>Judy Blume’s proto-YA classic from 1970 gets a screen adaptation; it is a sweet-natured, undemanding, oddly inconsequential movie about a lonely, smart 12-year-old anxious about the onset of puberty and adulthood. Blume herself gets a producer credit and a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo. The movie is played as a 1970 historical piece rather than being updated to the modern world, which would of course require LGBTQ+ plot additions, though I suspect a completely original drama of this sort set in 1970 would not tacitly consent, as this does, to the invisibility of gay people.</p><p>Ant-Man’s Abby Rider Fortson is engaging as Margaret, who has to move from New York to New Jersey when her dad Herb (Benny Safdie) gets a big, though unspecified, job and his wife Barbara (Rachel McAdams) agrees to quit her art teaching career to be a stay-at-home mom for Margaret out there in the burbs. Margaret desperately misses her New York-based grandma – that is, her dad’s mother Sylvia, a nice performance from Kathy Bates – and there are other problems. Barbara is bored and unsatisfied (are they living in the same street as Mad Men’s Don and Betsy Draper?). Her mother’s devoutly Christian and bigoted parents objected to her marrying a Jew, which means Margaret has never met them. And then there is Margaret’s black comic embarrassment-ordeal of growing up: the boys, the training bras and the sanitary towels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/17/are-you-there-god-its-me-margaret-review-judy-blumes-classic-pre-teen-tale-retold">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Derided at first, in the 20 years since its launch this cartoonish high-seas adventure has claimed its rightful place as one of the best Zelda games</p><p>When people ask what my favourite video game of all time is and I tell them, they inevitably wrinkle their nose and say: “What, the one with all the sailing?” To many, that’s all The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is: a 20-year-old GameCube release in which toon Link endlessly sails the vast sea on his trusty talking boat. In 2013, when the game was re-released on Wii U a decade after its debut, Nintendo took the criticisms on board (the talking boat) and added a “swift sail”, allowing players to bypass hours of sluggish seafaring. For shame. The seafaring was the <em>point</em>.</p><p>It has now been two decades since the original Wind Waker was released in Europe in May 2003 and it’s time that landlubber critics accepted they were wrong. The game’s expansive ocean was not only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN_x1rpGbY8&amp;t=3s&amp;ab_channel=TektiteTriforce">soundtracked stunningly</a>, but filled with endless side quests and mini-games, emphasising exploration in a way not seen again in a Zelda game until 2017’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review-link-nintendo-switch">Breath of the Wild</a>.

## Raised by addicts, abused, neglected, broke: how Katriona O’Sullivan escaped her fate

<p>Pregnant at 15, and soon to be homeless, O’Sullivan never expected to succeed – but became a leading academic. The author of Poor talks about everything that conspired to keep her down – and her ‘miraculous and rare’ ascent</p><p>In a lecture room at Ireland’s most elite university, a woman in a hoodie and jeans, her hair in a messy bun, was sorting out some chairs. A student came in and told her that she couldn’t clean in there because a class was about to start. “I know,” the woman told her. “I’m teaching it.” It is one of my favourite moments in Dr Katriona O’Sullivan’s new memoir, not just for the delicious awkwardness, but because, despite O’Sullivan’s path from virtually unimaginable poverty and trauma to a top-level education, it exposes the truth about whom we believe those institutions are really for.</p><p>What was funny, but also difficult, says O’Sullivan now, “was that I was struggling at that time with: ‘Who am I?’” She had completed her PhD at Trinity College, Dublin, where she was lecturing in psychology and working in its access programme to encourage people back into education. “There’s a uniform of the middle classes,” she says, and she was wrestling with it (a colleague had even suggested she dress more like them). “I just wanted to be myself. I want to wear my hoops, and my tan, and I think it’s important that we see people who are diverse.” She smiles. “So I was being brave, going: ‘I’m going to be me.’” The student read that look and saw a cleaner. “That’s the vision they have of a person from the underclass, or a working-class background. I got up and taught my class, and I was amazing, because I’m a good teacher.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/17/raised-by-addicts-abused-neglected-broke-how-katriona-osullivan-escaped-her-fate">Continue reading...</a>

## Soldier Sailor by Claire Kilroy review – immersive dive into the baby years

<p>The chaos and horrors of early motherhood are vividly, remorselessly evoked in a woman’s monologue to her son</p><p>Claire Kilroy’s first novel in 10 years is a whole-body experience: reading it was, for me, like being elbowed through a rip in the space-time continuum back into the chaotic, exhausting, lovesick fog of the baby and toddler years. Anyone who has endured “the blurred days and the blurred nights” of early motherhood – or indeed anyone contemplating the possibility of embarking on them – be warned. You’re looking at a book-length panic attack.</p><p>The novel is brief but utterly remorseless – it comes at you full-throttle, as if delivered on a single breath. The internal monologue of a mother (the Soldier of the title) addressed to her son (Sailor), it exists, almost, outside of time. No context is provided, and only Soldier’s perspective is given; this is her description, unqualified and unquestioned, of “all I had lost and all I had gained”. That she’s an unreliable narrator – manifestly, almost luxuriously so – is neither here nor there. The point is that, in a world that has diminished her, reduced her to the near-voiceless role of “mother”, <em>this</em> <em>is</em> <em>her</em> <em>experience</em>. It’s her account of the feeling of finding herself torn out of what she had believed was her real life and deposited in a sleep-deprived, incoherent parallel universe where achieving anything is momentous but anything that is achieved is both negligible and banal. “I produced a shoe only to find you’d pulled off your sock,” she says of the teeth-grinding process of trying to leave the house. “I put the sock back on while you pulled off the other one. I put that one back on while you pulled off the first. Oh, it was all so stupid. People think that looking after an infant is basic. I know this because I once thought so myself.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/17/soldier-sailor-by-claire-kilroy-review-immersive-dive-into-the-baby-years">Continue reading...</a>

<p>These tails and travails of ordinary people who share a name with the famous spy are often fun and funny – but the shifts in tone are uncomfortable</p><p>The title of this documentary about real-world men who are named James Bond echoes a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swqR39aRynU&amp;ab_channel=JamesBond007">famous, winking moment</a> in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service when a young woman runs away after being rescued instead of staying to smooch with her saviour; George Lazenby as Bond, taking over the role from a temporarily retired Sean Connery, wryly says: “This never happened to the other fellow.” The reference is apt because the stories recounted here are all about that glamour gap between the heroic exploits of fictional spy 007 and the regular guys who share his name.</p><p>Many of the James Bonds met here clearly loathe it when, for the zillionth time, strangers remark that they don’t look like Connery, Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan or Daniel Craig. Some parents named them James Bond before Dr No came out in 1962, or if it was out already, they didn’t think the franchise would become that big a deal. In South Bend, Indiana, James Bond Jr first got into trouble as a teenager with the police when he merely told them his name and the cop thought he was taking the piss, because this Bond happened to be black. Years later he was accused of murder, and during the manhunt the name was in the news a lot, causing problems for another James Bond who lived in the same town. We meet an ex-James Bond who changed his last name, and a kooky Swedish superfan who changed his name <em>to</em> James Bond and runs a museum featuring his collection of adorably shonky Bond memorabilia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/17/the-other-fellow-review-whimsical-doc-about-non-famous-james-bonds-spiked-with-awkward-moments">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An impressive account of the origins and early stages of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</p><p>At the time of writing this review, we still await the big Ukrainian counter-offensive. On its success or failure will depend the future course of the war. In February, when the detailed planning for the Big Push was already starting, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told me how nervous he was about it. Such frankness is typical of him. A charming, natural-seeming former actor, he has brought his professional abilities to the job of representing Ukraine at the highest level: providing the roar, he says, channelling Winston Churchill.</p><p>We know that the United States believes Ukraine’s counter-offensive won’t ultimately succeed, because <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/us-ukraine-counter-offensive-pentagon-leaks-reveal" title="">we’ve seen the leaked documents</a> that say so. But, of course, on the morning of 24 February 2022, Washington was sure the Russians would capture Kyiv within days – as were the Russians themselves. Zelenskiy’s decision to stay put, against American advice, was one of the main reasons Ukraine has proved so successful. So, as historian Serhii Plokhy shows in this sober, thoughtful, honest account of the war up to now, was the courage and grit of the 300 Ukrainian soldiers guarding Hostomel Airport outside Kyiv, who shot down several Russian helicopters and ensured that even when the others landed they didn’t have control of the skies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/17/the-russo-ukrainian-war-by-serhii-plokhy-review-the-first-draft-of-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Documentary shows the awe-inspiring vocation of this avant garde disruptor, who foresaw the internet and meme culture’s importance in the 1970s</p><p>Nam June Paik was a Korean video art pioneer, experimentalist and avant garde disruptor whose amazing, anarchic career – which flourished in 1960s and 70s New York – is recounted in this amusing and engaging documentary, the title of which is taken from one of his works: a luminous disc on a screen, telling us we gaze at the TV in the submissive way we once stared at the moon.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/01/minari-review-lee-isaac-chung-korean-family-farm-arkansas">Minari</a>’s Steven Yeun provides the voiceover for the artist’s own words and, among other things, this film shows us how exhausting it must be to do what he did: to insist, for decades, that his art, an art which bore no resemblance to anything that had gone before, had validity and meaning, while always being on the verge of poverty and physical breakdown. The overwhelming sense of vocation necessary for such a life is almost awe-inspiring, although Paik’s own jokey, opaque persona seems to exist as a rebuke to any reaction as bourgeois as that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/17/nam-june-paik-moon-is-the-oldest-tv-review-video-warhol">Continue reading...</a>

Is this some kind of GM-nightmare leaf, you might be wondering? Has big lettuce deviously planted cells in order to create a super-curvy salad? I wouldn’t rule it out, but in this instance it seems the lettuce’s shape is natural and the result of a particular seed being grown in a way that results in ruffled edges. Can you trademark that? US trademark experts seem to think it’s a long shot, but possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/17/us-company-trademark-lettuce">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A burst pipe in our street damaged our flat but we are still waiting for a repair and suffering the effects</p><p><strong>Four months ago, a water pipe burst in our street and flooded the bathroom in our lower-ground-floor flat. The damage forced us to move out and we are still waiting for Thames Water and its insurer for a repair. When the burst pipe was discovered, the mains water was not shut off and it was five days before engineers came. By then, water had flooded a large area of the street and leaked through the light fittings in our bathroom. A dehumidifier made little difference and, three weeks later, we were moved into an apart-hotel while builders stripped the bathroom.</strong></p><p><strong>That was two months ago and no one has returned since. In the meantime, our landlord commissioned a survey, which recommended a programme of works, but repeated calls to Thames and its insurer have been ineffective. I suffered a miscarriage shortly after the flood, and believe severe stress was a factor. I am now seven weeks pregnant, and we are desperate to return home.
