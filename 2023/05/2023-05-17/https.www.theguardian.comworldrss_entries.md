<p>Leaders will instead meet on sidelines of G7 in Hiroshima this weekend. Plus, how mifepristone became a target of the US anti-abortion movement</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>Anthony Albanese has confirmed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/17/quad-summit-meeting-cancelled-joe-biden-calls-off-australia-trip">the Sydney Quad meeting will not go ahead</a>, after the US president, Joe Biden, pulled out of his Australian visit to deal with domestic issues.</p><p><strong>When will the trip be rescheduled for?</strong> It is not known when Biden will be able to reschedule his Australia trip. The postponement, due to hostile negotiations with the Republican-heavy US Congress over the government’s debt ceiling, comes at a delicate time in the US’s engagement with the Pacific region. The visit was supposed to help cement the US’s renewed interest in the Indo-Pacific and help quell regional concerns over the Aukus agreement.</p><p><strong>What does the legislation say?</strong> Last week, Republicans had rushed the bill through the house, drawing criticism from other legislators and abortion rights advocates. The 46-page bill, in addition to banning abortion after 12 weeks, extends the waiting period for people seeking abortions to 72 hours, requires providers to send sensitive information to the state department of health and human services, and requires clinics to obtain special licensing that would result in clinic closures throughout the state.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/17/first-thing-quad-summit-cancelled-after-joe-biden-calls-off-trip-to-australia">Continue reading...</a>

And he has got a big message to publicise; Labour will go on a building spree, and it is willing to relax planning restrictions to do so.</p><p>This is what he will tell the BCC:</p><p>You can’t be serious about raising productivity, about improving the supply-side capacity of our economy and about arresting our economic decline, without a plan for the windfarms, the laboratories, the warehouses and the homes this country so desperately needs.</p><p>Mark my words: we will take on planning reform. We’ll bring back local housing targets. We’ll streamline the process for national infrastructure projects and commercial development and we’ll remove the veto used by big landowners to stop shovels hitting the ground.</p><p>[The Conservatives] have killed the dream, the aspiration of homeowning for a whole generation. It will fall to us to deal with that.</p><p>We choose the builders, not the blockers; the future, not the past; renewal not decline.
