The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (2023 action / adventure video game), developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch as reviewed by Charlie and Jackson.

The Moist Meter is an experimental measurement system that you can use to safely gauge just how moist a video game or movie is going to be before playing it or viewing it. Avoid the dry products and only use the wettest.
