He then immediately launched into a beautifully crafted, vocally stunning four piece set.\n\nBeginning with a special arrangement of \u201cBefore You Go,\u201d Capaldi was flanked by a full band, including two horns \u2014 something new for the Scottish singer. His second song, \u201cWish You the Best,\u201d is the latest, Capaldi-style heartbreaking single from his upcoming album Broken by Desire to Be Heavenly Sent. Capaldi joked that he didn\u2019t have much to say about the exclusive premiere of his next song, \u201cHeavenly Kind of State of Mind,\u201d describing it solely as simply being three minutes long. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t know anything about Capaldi before watching his Tiny Desk, the self-deprecating humor mixed in between gut-wrenching vocal ballads will quickly catch you up to speed. Capaldi had NPR\u2019s audience in tears, both from laughing at sexually suggestive jokes about the size of the Desk and lyrics about the complexities of moving on after a relationship ends. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d Capaldi asked the Tiny Desk team as he wrapped up \u201cSomeone You Loved,\u201d the final song of his set. Time to put the video on repeat and grab a tissue box. \n\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cBefore You Go\u201d\n\u201cWish You The Best\u201d\n\u201cHeavenly Kind of State of Mind\u201d\n\u201cSomeone You Loved\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nLewis Capaldi: vocals, guitar\nAiden Halliday: piano\nFreddy Sheed: drums\nAidan Beattie: bass, keys\nAndy Black: guitar\nMatt Owens: trumpet, keys\nReginald Chapman: trombone\n\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Jill Britton\nDirector/Editor: Sofia Seidel\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Sofia Seidel, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Zayrha Rodriguez\nAudio Assistant: Brian Jarboe \nProduction Assistant: Pilar Galv\u00e1n\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Hazel Cills, Marissa Lorusso, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galv\u00e1n\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #lewiscapaldi", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4WrRKSgGI0", "date_published": "2023-05-17 09:00:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
