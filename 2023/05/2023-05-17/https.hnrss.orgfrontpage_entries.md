<p>This is like 4 years old, but I’m braver now and ready to share stuff with this community.  I’ve been a lurker for a while.<p>I made this tool - it’s kind of like “explain” but it tells you about what locks would be required by the query.<p>I was making it as part of a larger tool that would try to prevent deadlocks during migrations at my last company, I never finished it.</p>

## Has HN Changed? I assume it's just me

<p>I've been reading HN for a while. I made my first comment May 31, 2018. And have gone through cycles of engagement during that time. But for the last few weeks, even months, I still scan the top articles daily, but something has changed for me. Historically, there's almost always been at least one thing in the top 30 I would be interested in. Sometimes many. But of late, none of it interests me near as much anymore.<p>My guess is that this is just pretty much burnout/age me changing.<p>But I was curious if maybe it was a wider spread effect that others are experiencing. Perhaps the downturn in the tech industry has just led to less of a "this is the place to be and things to know!" experience in general.</p>

## Retool (YC W17) is hiring hackers to combine visual programming with AI
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35978151](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35978151)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage

<p>Hi HN,<p>We’re Retool (<a href="https://retool.com" rel="nofollow">https://retool.com</a>), a visual programming environment for building internal tools. Here’s a 3 minute demo video: <a href="https://d3399nw8s4ngfo.cloudfront.net/videos/intro-to-retool.mp4" rel="nofollow">https://d3399nw8s4ngfo.cloudfront.net/videos/intro-to-retool...</a>.<p>You can think of Retool as something like Visual Basic, but in the cloud. The idea is that there are lots of internal applications that businesses need, and today, build from scratch (probably via React). But while React is great for many things (our landing page is built in React, our product is built in React, etc.), it’s possible that it might be overkill for building a simple form that POSTs data back to your API. (Who _wants_ to worry about debouncing the submit button, handling errors from the backend, and authenticating and authorizing the users?)<p>We launched on HN around five years ago (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17725966" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17725966</a>). Since then, we’ve launched three new products – a native mobile product (<a href="https://retool.com/products/mobile" rel="nofollow">https://retool.com/products/mobile</a>), an automation product for developers (<a href="https://retool.com/products/workflows/" rel="nofollow">https://retool.com/products/workflows/</a>), and a database product (<a href="https://retool.com/products/database/" rel="nofollow">https://retool.com/products/database/</a>).  We’ve hired and grown the team to over 350, and are proud to have businesses like Doordash, NBC Universal, Mercedes Benz, and the NFL using Retool.<p>The network at Retool is also fairly strong — our lead investors in the Series B and C were Sequoia, along with Elad Gil, Nat Friedman, as well as John and Patrick Collison. Other investors include the founders of Github, Gusto, Segment, PagerDuty, Plaid, etc.<p>This year, while other companies are downsizing, we’re doubling down. (Literally.) We’re attempting to double our engineering, product, and design orgs this year. We think the opportunity to invent the future of programming is enormous, and we’re looking for more hackers to join our team.<p>We think that AI is going to change the way people build software. We think that there is tremendous potential in building interfaces that help humans and AI collaborate together to build software. We want to build a world where humans can quickly assemble full applications by just providing high level directions to AI.<p>We believe we’re set up especially well to do just that – we have all the building blocks for creating software (frontends, backend compute, data storage) as well as a live interactive builder environment. Why entangle yourself with messy things like Webpack, Docker, and Kubernetes when you can directly manipulate a live app, running right in front of you?<p>We also think that the world, as a whole, is under-utilizing AI. Businesses are broadly interested in generative AI and LLMs, but don’t know how yet to leverage and use them. It should be simple for businesses to quickly set up flows to have AI automatically triage bug reports, summarize customer feedback, and enrich datasets.<p>We’ve shared a sneak peak of what we think some of this could look like (<a href="https://retool.com/blog/gpt4-in-retool/" rel="nofollow">https://retool.com/blog/gpt4-in-retool/</a>), and there’s a bunch more coming up that we’re really excited to talk about soon.<p>If you’re interested in working with AIs and LLMs to change the way companies build software, we’d love to hear from you. We've made multiple hires from HN in the past, so we’re posting here. But if you know any friends who are interested, feel free to tell them to reach out as well.<p>Please email us at snir AT retool with “HN” in the subject line.<p>Thanks!</p>

## Show HN: Beepberry – a portable e-paper computer for hackers
 - [https://beepberry.sqfmi.com/](https://beepberry.sqfmi.com/)

<p>Hi. I heard HN likes e-paper gadgets so I wanted to share a little side project I’ve been working on with @sqfmi. We’re building Beepberry - a portable e-paper computer for hackers, designed for chatting on Beeper. My day job is running Beeper [0], but I will always have a soft spot for building hardware.<p>I wanted to create a ‘weekend’ device that would let me stay in touch with friends and family, without the distractions of a full smartphone. I imagined a tiny, hackable e-paper screen with a physical keyboard, powered by a Raspberry Pi, that I could use to chat around my home…and pretty much nothing else.<p>Before Beeper, the idea probably would not have gone anywhere. Most chat apps do not have an API, making it practically impossible to hack something like this together. Enter Beeper, with connections to 15+ chat networks. Built on top of Matrix, Beeper is fully hackable. You can write alternative fun clients [1], bots [2] and more!<p>Today, sqfmi is starting to take pre-orders at <a href="https://beepberry.sqfmi.com" rel="nofollow">https://beepberry.sqfmi.com</a> for the first batch. It’s $79 (or $99 including a Pi Zero). Specs: Sharp Memory LCD (same display tech as in Pebble!), Pi Zero (BT/WIFI), physical keyboard, 2000mAh lipo.<p>On top of being an amazing Beeper chat device, it’s basically an e-paper Cyberdeck that fits in your pocket. It’s a ton of fun to hack on. Keep in mind - THIS IS NOT A REAL FINISHED PRODUCT. It’s basically a devkit.<p>More info in the blog post: <a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/beeper-x-sqmfi-beepberry">https://blog.beeper.com/p/beeper-x-sqmfi-beepberry</a>, or join the Discord/Matrix channel <a href="https://beepberry.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started#join-the-beepberry-discord" rel="nofollow">https://beepberry.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started#join-the-be...</a>. I’ll hang out a bit here to answer questions as well.<p>[0] <a href="https://beeper.com">https://beeper.com</a>

<p>Tldr; OpenAI registered the brand GPT and wants us to take down our gptsomething.io domain. The domain was a blank page.<p>OpenAl brand guideline outreach<p>Dear Team,
We are contacting you on behalf of our client OpenAl, Inc. ("OpenAI"). Our job is to work with developers to ensure that they are marketing their products in accordance with OpenAl's brand guidelines https://openal.com/brandand in a way that doesn't create confusion for the consumer.<p>Today, we're writing regarding your use of the mark "GPT" in connection with your GPT' product.<p>https://branddb.wipo.int/en/quicksearch/brand/CH502023000001493?
by-brandName&amp;v=GPT&amp;rows=30&amp;sort=score%20desc&amp;start=0& -1682836548861&amp;fcstatus-Registered&amp;fcdesign
ation=CH&amp;I=Q<p>Stating "GPT" is inaccurate and may imply a partnership or endorsement where there isn't one. If your project uses GPT-3, GPT-4, or ChatGPT you may choose to say in the Product description (not in the Product/Site name) that it is "Powered by GPT-3" or "Powered by GPT-4" or "Powered by ChatGPT" and/or "Powered by DALLE" as applicable. We do not permit model names in products/site titles because there is concern that it can confuse end users, and it also triggers our enforcement mechanisms. It's important to identify the GPT-3, GPT-4, or ChatGPT (or DALL-E) model specifically, as opposed to just referencing GPT.<p>Please reply to this message by 05.10.2023 to let us know that you received it and intend to make the applicable changes. If you have any questions, please contact us directly at openal@brandshield.com.<p>Sincerely,<p>BrandShield Ltd.</p>

## Show HN: Speeding up the code-test cycle for Java developers
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35972112](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35972112)

<p>Hello HN, I am Parth. In my experience, the current form of testing automation takes too long. To solve this, I am creating a developer tool to speed up the code-test cycle for Java developers. It has two main parts:<p>Direct Invoke - lets you call any Java function directly, without the need to execute the whole call hierarchy. (e.g. an HTTP endpoint) In my normal coding workflow, I use the “Evaluate Expression” feature inside IntelliJ IDE. I usually put a breakpoint somewhere in the code and after hitting the breakpoint by calling an HTTP api, let the execution remain paused while I explore and see the return values of functions. “Evaluate Expression” was quite useful in exploring new codebases and checking return values of my own functions as a sanity test. The direct invoke feature implements the same functionality without needing to hit a breakpoint. Now, I can just navigate to any function in the editor and execute it. The parameter values are input as JSON and deserialize to an object of the required class instances.<p>Atomic Run - lets you hot-reload the code changes and highlights the difference in the return values of the changed function before and after the hot-reload. I feel Atomic Run has the potential of replacing unit test cases, but there is a long way to go. I am thinking of implementing<p><pre><code>  - Option for mocking dependency calls: We want to give the developer more control over the testing environment by allowing them to mock downstream dependency calls.


  - Customizing assertions: Not all differences in return values indicate breaking changes. Assertions should be flexible to accommodate non-breaking changes.


  - Workflow to save this data to a file (thinking something like JSON based fixtures): making it easier to organize and reuse test data.

</code></pre>
This plugin is still in the early stages, so we'd appreciate your help in ironing out any bugs you come across. Get in touch with me on my discord channel.<p>To try it out, install Unlogged from the IntelliJ Marketplace and start your java application using the java agent (the plugin has instructions to download)<p>Link to try the plugin: <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18529-unlogged" rel="nofollow">https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18529-unlogged</a></p>
