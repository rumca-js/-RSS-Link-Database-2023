<p>Montana’s TikTok ban is now <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90aWt0b2stYmFuLWluLW1vbnRhbmEtc2V0cy1vZmYtZmlyc3QtYW1lbmRtZW50LWxlZ2FsLWZpZ2h0LTVhMDZkNzAxIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzZmI4NTRhNC03MjdiLTQyOWUtOWM5Mi00MTgyNzA5M2M2MDcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc82QWB9QSQYcquZ52WFdnu6KOpBKcfqelEsD9h8xHoq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Ftiktok-ban-in-montana-sets-off-first-amendment-legal-fight-5a06d701"><ins>official</ins></a>. Governor Greg Gianforte signed a bill banning the app in the state, one month after it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/montana-is-about-to-become-the-first-state-to-ban-tiktok-211845076.html"><ins>passed</ins></a> by the state’s legislature. The law is scheduled to take effect in 2024, though legal challenges could potentially delay that timeline.</p><p>The law prohibits the company from operating in the state and requires app stores to block users in Montana from downloading TikTok. The app’s users won’t face repercussions for using the service, but app stores and TikTok face daily fines of $10,000 for violating the law.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The statewide ban, and the expected legal challenge to it, offers a preview into how future attempts to ban the app could play out around the country. In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said the Montana law “unlawfully” violates the First Amendment rights of its users.</p><p>“Governor Gianforte has signed a bill that infringes on the First Amendment rights of the people of Montana by unlawfully banning TikTok, a platform that empowers hundreds of thousands of people across the state,” the spokesperson said. “We want to reassure Montanans that they can continue using TikTok to express themselves, earn a living, and find community as we continue working to defend the rights of our users inside and outside of Montana.”</p><p>Like other officials who have proposed bans or restrictions on TikTok, Montana lawmakers have claimed that TikTok’s ties to ByteDance, a Chinese company, puts the personal data of US users at risk. The company has long denied that it would turn over such data to the Chinese government, and has invested more than $1 billion into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/can-tiktok-convince-the-us-its-not-a-national-security-threat-173030115.html"><ins>Project Texas</ins></a> to address data security concerns raised by US regulators.</p><p>But officials have reportedly said those efforts don’t go far enough, and the US government is now trying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-us-government-is-trying-to-force-bytedance-to-sell-tiktok-005751763.html"><ins>to force</ins></a> ByteDance to sell TikTok. If it doesn’t, TikTok will face a nationwide ban and, likely, another massive legal fight.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/montanas-governor-signs-bill-banning-tiktok-225326086.html?src=rss

## US adults are spending less time on Twitter since Elon Musk took over

<p>We’re starting to get a clearer picture of how Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter has changed the platform. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/17/how-us-adults-on-twitter-use-the-site-in-the-elon-musk-era/"><ins>new data</ins></a> from Pew Research, a “majority” of US Twitter users have “taken a break” from the platform over the last year, and many of the site’s “most active” users are tweeting less often than they used to.</p><p>“Six-in-ten Americans who have used Twitter in the past 12 months say they have taken a break from the platform for a period of several weeks or more during that span,” Pew writes in a report based on a survey of 10,701 Twitter users. In a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/17/how-us-adults-on-twitter-use-the-site-in-the-elon-musk-era/"><ins>separate report</ins></a>, Pew also studied the “actual behavior” of 1,002 of Twitter’s “most active” users and found “a noticeable posting decline in the months after” Musk’s acquisition. “These users’ average number of tweets per month declined by around 25% following the acquisition,” Pew noted.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Together, these stats suggest that engagement on Twitter has declined since Musk’s takeover, at least among formerly active users. That’s particularly notable because, as Pew notes, the vast majority of Twitter users <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/16/5-facts-about-twitter-lurkers/"><ins>are lurkers</ins></a>, not posters. Twenty percent of Twitter users send 98 percent of all tweets.</p><p>At the same time, it seems many of Twitter’s most active users haven’t given up on the platform entirely. According to Pew, only 25 percent of “highly active” users said they are “not very or not at all likely to be on Twitter a year from now.”</p><p>Pew didn’t poll Twitter users on the reasons for their pullback from Twitter, or if Musk’s actions were directly responsible for the shift. It also doesn’t take into account how many new users may have joined Twitter in the last year. But the new numbers offer new insight into the growing ranks of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/theres-never-been-a-better-time-stop-tweeting-150020412.html"><ins>Twitter quitters</ins></a> who may be spending more time on alternative platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-client-developers-fleeing-twitter-mastodon-130031551.html"><ins>Mastodon</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-backed-bluesky-is-having-a-moment-133039184.html"><ins>Bluesky</ins></a> since Musk’s takeover,</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Pew also found that Musk himself has become even more of a main character on Twitter over the last year. “On average, adult Twitter users in the U.S. mentioned Musk in a tweet just once between Jan. 1 and April 13, 2022, before he announced his intention to acquire the platform,” the report says. “Since then, however, references to Musk have become much more common on the site. These users tweeted about him an average of three times between April 14 and Oct. 26, 2022 – while Musk was in the process of acquiring the platform – and an average of six times in the months after the sale was finalized.”</p><p>The reports come as Musk has named a new CEO in former NBCU executive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-names-nbcu-ad-exec-linda-yaccarino-new-twitter-ceo-155537363.html"><ins>Linda Yaccarino</ins></a>. Yaccarino, who is slated to start in the coming weeks, is expected to draw on her ad industry experience to try to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-advertisers-media-finances-185425994.html"><ins>win back</ins></a> advertisers, many of whom <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-losing-advertisers-boycott-193748977.html"><ins>have fled</ins></a> following controversial policy changes by Musk. Whether she'll be able to win back the much sought-after “highly active tweeters,” though, is unclear. With Musk remaining as CTO and executive chairman, he’s likely to continue to be Twitter’s most influential — and controversial — user for the foreseeable future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/us-adults-are-spending-less-time-on-twitter-since-elon-musk-took-over-192939586.html?src=rss

## BMW’s all-electric luxury boat comes with a custom Hans Zimmer soundtrack

<p>Electric cars have certainly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ev-revolution-became-an-eventuality-in-2022-160022818.html"><ins>gone mainstream</ins></a> over the past decade or so, with many auto manufacturers shifting at least some of their production over to battery-powered cars. But going from gas to electric in other forms of transportation hasn’t really taken off in quite the same way.</p><p>BMW is looking to change that – sort of. In collaboration with TYDE, which typically builds luxury yachts, the duo has come up with a fully-electric boat. The company used its yacht racing technology (yep, you read that right!) to build this boat. However, this is not a yacht – it’s a single-deck boat that appears to seat maybe a dozen people. The boat has a top speed of 30 knots, or about 34 miles per hour. In comparison, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-17-jaguar-breaks-electric-boat-world-record.html"><ins>Jaguar’s gas–powered boat</ins></a> that set the speed record back in 2018 clocked 77 knots or about 88 miles per hour.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To add another oddity into the mix, Hans Zimmer (known for composing the score for <em>The Lion King</em>, <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> and many others), developed the onboard soundtrack for the boat. It does make you wonder if the sound system is capable of playing anything but Hans Zimmer scores, but sadly the press release doesn’t say. According to <a href="https://www.bmwusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=4160&amp;mid=1"><ins>that press release</ins></a>, the onboard sound system supports Dolby Atmos, to deliver “superb sound quality,” though that likely won’t matter with the amount of environmental noise that typically accompanies you when on water (especially with the boat’s semi-open design).</p><p>But at the end of the day, even though it’s an odd partnership all around, it’s good news that one more vehicle isn’t burning gasoline and is instead being powered by renewable energy. Whether or not this will make an impact on the broader boating industry? That’s a whole other can of worms.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bmws-all-electric-luxury-boat-comes-with-a-custom-hans-zimmer-soundtrack-191052673.html?src=rss

## Astronomers identify volcano-covered planet that could have water on its surface

<p>Astronomers have found a planet they believe is blanketed by active volcanoes. In a study published Tuesday in the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zNDE1ODYtMDIzLTA1OTM0LTgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE4ZjE2ODdkLTIxODgtNGYwMC1iZWE0LWE0NzU4NWMyYmQ4YyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdLqGwxKzSNepeQUdNz0jMeISm_ybr0GcT1y1PVMA4hf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-05934-8"><ins>journal </ins><em><ins>Nature</ins></em></a>, a multi-national team of scientists said they discovered an Earth-sized exoplanet they believe may have water on part of its surface.

LP 791-18 d orbits a red dwarf it is tidally locked to, meaning the planet doesn’t have a day and night cycle like Earth. Instead, one part of LP 791-18 d is constantly scorched by sunlight, while the other is always in darkness.</p><p>“The day side would probably be too hot for liquid water to exist on the surface. But the amount of volcanic activity we suspect occurs all over the planet could sustain an atmosphere, which may allow water to condense on the night side,” Björn Benneke, one of the astronomers who studied the planet, told NASA’s <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-spitzer-tess-find-potentially-volcano-covered-earth-size-world"><ins>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The LP 791-18 system contains at least two other planets, called LP 791-18 b and c. The latter is two-and-a-half times larger than Earth and more than seven times its mass. It also affects the orbit of LP 791-18 d, making it travel along an elliptical path around the system’s sun. That path means LP 791-18 d is deformed every time it completes an orbit. “These deformations can create enough internal friction to substantially heat the planet’s interior and produce volcanic activity at its surface,” according to NASA.</p><p>“A big question in astrobiology, the field that broadly studies the origins of life on Earth and beyond, is if tectonic or volcanic activity is necessary for life,” study co-author Jessie Christiansen said. “In addition to potentially providing an atmosphere, these processes could churn up materials that would otherwise sink down and get trapped in the crust, including those we think are important for life, like carbon.”</p><p>NASA, ESA and CSA already plan to turn the James Webb Space Telescope’s infrared imaging instruments on LP 791-18 c. The team that discovered LP 791-18 d thinks the exoplanet would make for an “exceptional candidate for atmospheric studies by the mission.” Notably, the retired <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-30-nasa-decommissions-spitzer-space-telescope.html"><ins>Spitzer Space Telescope</ins></a> helped spot LP 791-18 d before NASA decommissioned it in 2020.

<p>Analogue’s universally compatible TurboGrafx-16 console, the Duo, will finally be available for preorders later this week, on May 19th. The company <a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1658850318640193536"><ins>made the reveal on Twitter</ins></a> and also noted that preorders begin sharply at 8AM PDT. These kinds of niche gaming consoles tend to sell out of preorders quickly, so set your alarm.</p><p>There’s a spot of bad news to go along with the announcement. The Analogue Duo was first revealed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-duo-turbografx-pc-engine-turboduo-fpga-console-150059918.html"><ins>all the way back in 2020</ins></a> and was set to launch for $200. The updated price tag is now $250.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For the price, you do get an all-in-one system that promises to play every single TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine title, thanks to dual media readers that play both the originally manufactured cartridges and the compact discs that came later. The console even runs games that require the Arcade RAM add-on that comprised the unsuccessful SuperGrafx console that was only released in Japan.</p><p>The Duo includes some modern bells and whistles, like an HDMI port, 1080p resolution, an SD card slot, two USB ports for wired controllers and Bluetooth for wireless accessories. The console doesn’t come with a controller, though it works with plenty of budget-friendly offerings by 8BitDo and others.</p><p>To the uninitiated, the TurboGrafx-16, called the PC Engine in Japan, was a competitor to the NES and SNES that saw some success in its home country but only modest sales in the US. Despite never reaching the heights of Sega and Nintendo, the console holds a place in the hearts of retro gamers, thanks to a robust library of hundreds of titles.</p><p>Just like all Analogue consoles, the Duo isn’t an emulation machine, as it features near-identical internal components that integrate with physical media. The company has made popular recreations of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-11-26-the-analogue-cmvs-a-649-wooden-neo-geo-for-the-gamer-who-has-e.html"><ins>many iconic consoles,</ins></a> including the Pocket device that plays games from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-16-analogue-pocket-game-boy-advance-game-gear-ngpc-atari-lynx.html"><ins>nearly every retro portable console.</ins></a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/you-can-preorder-analogues-turbografx-inspired-duo-console-this-friday-182539002.html?src=rss

<p>The first episode of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-summer-2023-200205286.html"><em><ins>The Expanse: A Telltale Series</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>at last has a release date. You'll be able to jump in to the game on July 27th on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC via the Epic Games Store.</p><p>Unlike previous Telltale titles, which often left fans <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-02-telltale-expects-the-next-walking-dead-episode-to-hit-this-month.html"><ins>hanging for months</ins></a> between episodes (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-20-telltale-the-walking-dead-final-season-epic-games-store.html"><ins>sometimes due to external issues</ins></a>), you won't have to wait long for more installments. Telltale says that a new episode will drop every two weeks until all five are out in the wild. The standard version of the game costs $40 and the deluxe edition is $45. Pre-order either on PlayStation or the Epic store and you'll get to play a day early, while the deluxe edition will include access to more content that's on the way in the future. Expect to learn more about that at a later date.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game acts as a prequel to <em>The Expanse, </em>a TV show that originally ran on Syfy for three seasons before Amazon Prime <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-26-the-expanse-amazon.html"><ins>picked it up</ins></a> and produced another three seasons. Cara Gee reprises her role as Camina Drummer, the game's playable character.</p><p><em>The Expanse </em>is said to have the &quot;largest and most immersive exploration&quot; of any Telltale game to date. Drummer, who helps run a scavenger crew, will scour shipwrecks, walk on ceilings and walls using mag boots and use zero-gravity thrusters to float through open space. You'll need to deal with the threat of a mutiny and, since this is a Telltale game, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-29-telltale-the-walking-dead-finale.html"><ins>make difficult decisions</ins></a> that impact the future of The Artemis' crew.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-first-episode-of-the-expanse-a-telltale-series-will-arrive-on-july-27th-171001556.html?src=rss

## Panic and Sony drop trailer for unique soccer game with a narrative twist

<p>Game developer Panic, the studio behind <em>Firewatch</em> and <em>Untitled Goose Game</em>, is dropping a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/11/despelote-a-slice-of-life-soccer-game-for-everyone-hits-ps5-in-2024/"><ins>unique soccer title on PS5 next year.</ins></a> It’s called <em>Despelote</em> and is described as a “beautiful slice-of-life adventure” about childhood and the world’s favorite sport. The title’s set in Ecuador in 2001, which was when the country had its first qualifying run for the World Cup.</p><p>Gameplay involves exploring the city of Quito, playing soccer and engaging in “playful, funny interactions” with various townspeople. It boasts a first person perspective and a highly unique art style that merges grainy photo realism with flourishes of animation. Not sure what that means? There’s a teaser trailer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e68077e5cc7e4ab7aff52f9dd042e8fe"></div><p>Panic says the game was inspired by lead co-creator Julián Cordero’s childhood and it boasts full voice acting in Spanish with the option for localized subtitles. Much of the dialogue was actually captured in real life on the streets of Ecuador to give it a bit more flavor. The same goes for the background ambient noise.</p><p>It’s worth noting that this is a narrative title first and a soccer game second, so don’t expect a full-on sim like FIFA. There looks to be plenty of opportunities to kick things, pass things and dribble, however, as you explore the town, “getting caught up in mischief and soaking in the local culture.”</p><p><em>Despelote</em> first appeared on the scene in 2021 at that year’s Summer Games Fest, but there wasn’t an official publisher or release platform back then. As for Panic, the company’s been busy meeting the demands of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panic-has-sold-more-than-50000-playdates-so-far-171010089.html"><ins>PlayDate portable console owners</ins></a> in addition to publishing nifty indie titles.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/panic-and-sony-drop-trailer-for-unique-soccer-game-with-a-narrative-twist-164017770.html?src=rss

## Logitech joins the growing list of companies with self-repair programs

<p>Logitech and iFixit announced a new partnership today to let customers repair their devices. iFixit will supply spare parts and out-of-warranty support for “select products” while developing guides for DIY repairs on Logitech gear. The program will kick off this summer in the US with support for two popular accessories: the Logitech MX Master and MX Anywhere mouse models.</p><p>The self-repair program, found on a new <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/logitech">Repair Hub website</a>, will use genuine Logitech replacement parts and batteries. iFixit says you can order parts a la carte or in kits with everything you need for a specific repair, including the requisite part(s), tools and a precision screwdriver bit set. The companies haven’t yet announced pricing for the bundles or replacement parts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The initiative is part of a broader trend in recent years. Apple launched an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-release-date-122332505.html">iPhone repair program</a> last year; it’s since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-mac-desktops-studio-display-self-service-repair-205016531.html">added support</a> for Macs and the Apple Studio Display. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-repair-diy-parts-ifixit-182931322.html">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-self-repair-program-galaxy-right-to-repair-150018106.html">Samsung</a> have added similar programs for some of their flagship devices. Cutting down on e-waste by extending product lives is the most obvious advantage, as well as potentially saving repair-minded customers a few bucks. However, the companies may be motivated even more by Right to Repair legislation passed in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-right-to-repair-law-kathy-hochul-184654713.html">New York</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motor-vehicle-data-question-1-081059455.html">Massachusetts</a> — while perhaps trying to head off <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">potential federal legislation</a> requiring them to offer self-repairs for a broader array of products.</p><p>“Consumers often struggle to find avenues to repair and extend the life of their product,” said Prakash Arunkundrum, chief operating officer at Logitech. “More can be done by brands and by broader value chains who wish to play an active role in the shift to a more circular economy. I am excited that we are able to collaborate with iFixit to develop better designs and make it easier for consumers to have a self-repair option to extend the life of our products.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/logitech-joins-the-growing-list-of-companies-with-self-repair-programs-162537620.html?src=rss

<p>Virgin Galactic's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-again-delays-space-tourism-flights-to-second-quarter-2023-084540843.html">lengthy road to space tourism</a> is nearing an end. The firm now <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/news/virgin-galactic-is-a-go-for-launch/">expects</a> its final VSS Unity test flight to launch as soon as May 25th at 10AM Eastern, with specialist training starting on May 22nd. The mission will check the technical functionality and the &quot;astronaut experience&quot; one more time before commercial service begins.</p><p>The company hasn't narrowed down the official start to paid service. It has delayed the rollout multiple times, most recently due to challenges upgrading the VMS Eve &quot;mothership&quot; that carries Unity to 50,000 feet. Virgin launched its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html">first fully crewed spaceflight</a> in July 2021, with founder Richard Branson aboard.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A successful test may be crucial for Virgin. The company is still bleeding money, and lost <a href="https://s29.q4cdn.com/417755062/files/doc_financials/Annual/597dc024-73a5-41a0-947b-f5bba6a3ff6f.pdf">just over</a> $500 million in 2022. When <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-wants-you-and-999-other-people-to-sign-up-for-a-space-flight-135020170.html">tickets cost $450,000 each</a> and require a $150,000 deposit, commercial service could help Virgin stem those losses and fund its long-term ambitions, which include a next-gen spaceship (the VSS Imagine) due to enter service in 2025.</p><p>There's also external pressure. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-new-shepard-launch-date-164633239.html">carrying civilians into space</a>, and SpaceX is slowly moving closer to its dreams of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/space-x-first-civilian-lunar-mission-dearmoon-bigbang-top-dj-steve-aoki-095722626.html">lunar tourist trips</a>. While these flights will also be out of reach for many people, Virgin still doesn't want to be seen lagging behind rivals competing for wealthy passengers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactics-final-vss-unity-flight-test-is-slated-for-may-25th-161034011.html?src=rss

<p>Get ready to deal with things that go clank in the night on the big screen. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/five-nights-at-freddys/"><em><ins>Five Nights at Freddy's</ins></em></a> movie is on the way later this year, and Universal Pictures has revealed the first teaser for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-29-five-nights-at-freddys-movie-director.html"><ins>long-gestating adaptation</ins></a>. The clip doesn't seem to hold too many surprises for those who are familiar with the jump scare-laden FNaF games, but it captures the aesthetic well enough.</p><p>It focuses on a character played by Josh Hutcherson as he starts a new gig as a night-time security guard at a family entertainment center. However, the animatronics at Freddy Fazbear's pose a terrifying threat to anyone still in the building after the doors close. The animatronics look spot on, which isn't exactly a shock given that Jim Henson's Creature Shop brought them to life.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Five Nights at Freddy's </em>will arrive in theaters and on Peacock on October 27th.

## Montreal's iconic brutalist building has finally been finished inside Unreal Engine

<p>Designers aren't just using Unreal Engine to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-02-unreal-engine-4-free.html">preview buildings</a> — they're using it to complete buildings that were never fully realized. Neoscape and Safdie Architects have <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/hillside">released</a> Hillside Sample Project, a virtual rendition of Moshe Safdie's original vision for Montreal's brutalist Habitat 67 housing complex. The modular, floating pyramid structures are clearly the highlight, but there's also exceptional detail elsewhere — you can see complete interiors, lush plant life along the walkways and the distinctive Montreal landscape.</p><p>A young Safdie designed Habitat 67 for Montreal's 1967 World's Fair, also known as Expo 67. It was meant to combine the advantages of suburbia (such as gardens and multi-level housing) with the affordability and density of apartments. The affordability didn't pan out, and Safdie ended up producing a smaller-scale version for the fair. Habitat 67 ultimately launched Safdie's career, though, and it's still one of the better-known landmarks in the city.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4389c92167ef461aace86117589e69b0"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>You have a few options for exploring the complex. You can watch a video if you just want a quick overview, but you can also navigate a 3D space using either Google Chrome or a downloadable app. The interactive models let you either roam freely or have Safdie guide you through the project with narration at key points.</p><p>This probably won't sell you on a new home when the <a href="https://www.rslefebvre.com/Properties-for-sale-habitat-67.html">currently available</a> Habitat 67 units sell for about $1 million CAD and beyond. However, it does illustrate the potential for real-time 3D renditions of architectural work. They can help pitch building concepts where canned artistic renders and physical mock-ups might not be sufficiently convincing.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/montreals-iconic-brutalist-building-has-finally-been-finished-inside-unreal-engine-153005115.html?src=rss

<p>Even for someone like me who spends a ton of time testing phones and laptops, it can be hard to keep up with innovations across every category of device  – especially when it comes to things like fixtures and appliances that aren’t meant to be replaced very often. So a little while ago when my kitchen faucet sprung a leak I was faced with a question: Are today’s new-fangled touch-activated models a worthwhile purchase or are they just a waste of money?</p><p>At first, I was annoyed by the whole affair since we had only moved into our place in 2018 and as it was new construction, I expected the faucet to last longer than five years. But after getting it checked out things got worse as we learned it would cost more to fix it than to just buy a new one. So after the plumber told us to “treat yourselves” and we learned that apparently Delta is the Colgate of faucets (four out five plumbers recommend it!), we started looking at our options.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Unlike a traditional faucet, it feels like the best way to use the Touch20 tech is leaving the handle open all the time and rely entirely on touch inputs to turn the water on and off.

We started by looking at models that had a similar design to what we already had because we knew it would fit. But eventually, my love of gadgets drew me to Delta’s Touch2O line, which lets you control water simply by tapping instead of yanking the handle around. So even though I was already aware that some prominent chefs like J. Kenji Lopez-Alt aren’t a fan of touch-activated faucets, since I had never used one before, I figured why the hell not?</p><p>However, there are a couple of important considerations that come into play when buying one of these. The first is that they’re more expensive than a regular faucet due to the extra electronics and whatnot. Thankfully, despite being listed at <a href="https://www.deltafaucet.com/kitchen/product/9659T-DST.html">around $1,000 on Delta’s website</a>, the Trinsic Pro Touch2O we eventually settled on was available for half that <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Ucmluc2ljLVNpbmdsZS1IYW5kbGUtS2l0Y2hlbi1NYWduZXRpYy05NjU5LURTVC9kcC9CMDFKQlRMS0ZZP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8teWwtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg2NzU2Y2EyLTExZTUtNDI1NC1hOTZhLTRmYzg3ZjM4MGQ4OSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAd2e_n5aplLqlUkZvnb2hrso8g-eyo1BAPCGXbWLFG_i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTrinsic-Single-Handle-Kitchen-Magnetic-9659-DST%2Fdp%2FB01JBTLKFY%3Fth%3D1">on Amazon</a>. And, compared to a traditional non-touch model, we were looking at about a $100 premium, which isn’t nothing, but it was low enough that my curiosity ultimately won out.</p><figure><img alt="One of the really nice things about the Trinsic Pro with Touch20 is that you can basically tap anywhere on the faucet to turn the water on and off. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/76dbdef0-f369-11ed-8cff-bab8a3bdfb78" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption>One of the really nice things about the Trinsic Pro with Touch20 is that you can basically tap anywhere on the faucet to turn the water on and off. </figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>But more importantly, the only reason the Touch2O model wasn’t rejected outright is because we already had an outlet installed under our sink. By default, Delta’s Touch2O faucet runs on six included AA batteries that the company says should last about a year (or up to three years if you buy some larger C batteries). And while swapping in fresh cells every 12 months isn’t that much of a hassle, it’s something I’d rather not have to think about., Not to mention the waste of tossing dead akalines in the trash on a semi-regular basis isn't ideal. Thankfully, Delta sells <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=346ae41c-5265-49ce-a119-79bad16046d5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Home+Depot&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNDZhZTQxYy01MjY1LTQ5Y2UtYTExOS03OWJhZDE2MDQ2ZDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9tZWRlcG90LmNvbS9wL0RlbHRhLTItaW4teC0xLTEtNC1pbi1QbGFzdGljLUEtQy1Qb3dlci1BZGFwdGVyLWZvci1Ub3VjaDJPLVRlY2hub2xvZ3ktRmF1Y2V0cy1FUDEwMjE1Ny8zMjAyMTg2NzIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg2NzU2Y2EyLTExZTUtNDI1NC1hOTZhLTRmYzg3ZjM4MGQ4OSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXy7F3wlaj2bQE3hun2nCRdiOGw-g4UBJgCto9ZCPg4I&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FDelta-2-in-x-1-1-4-in-Plastic-A-C-Power-Adapter-for-Touch2O-Technology-Faucets-EP102157%2F320218672">an AC adapter</a> for its faucets that’s relatively cheap (about $40), which means that you only need to rely on the batteries if your power goes out (which is quite rare for us because we live in the city).</p><p>If it wasn’t for this, buying a touch-activated faucet that requires a constant power supply would have been a non-starter. Regardless, if you’re considering getting a Touch2O faucet from Delta, expect to pay about $150 or so more than a basic version. At least when it comes to installation, things are relatively straightforward. The main differences are making sure you don’t get your wires crossed and remembering to save a spot to stash the AC adapter so that it stays dry and out of the way.</p><figure><img alt="Another nice feature of Delta's Touch20 faucets is a built-in temperature sensor that makes it easy to tell if the water is hot or cold, which can be really helpful around small children. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/02585620-f36a-11ed-bf7f-d91ceab615d1" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption>Another handy feature on Delta's Touch20 faucets is a built-in temperature sensor that makes it easy to tell if the water is hot or cold, which can be really helpful around small children.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Anyways, now that I’ve been using a Touch2O faucet for about three months, here are my thoughts. First, it takes a little getting used to, because ideally, you should leave the handle open all the time and rely entirely on touch controls to turn the water on and off. And after years of muscle memory telling me to do that exact opposite, this practice felt really unnatural for a couple weeks. But once I got past that, I really started to like it. Sure, it’s a small thing, but being able to touch the neck of the faucet quickly to shut off the water is nice when you’re trying to multitask. I think it’s slightly more sanitary too, because I can use the back of my hand to tap the neck of the faucet instead of reaching for the handle, which is nice if you’ve been trimming chicken or whatever.</p><p>After a while, using the faucet becomes one less thing to think about and I also really appreciate that Delta’s touch activation works pretty much anywhere, which makes it more fun for my toddler to play with when we’re washing our hands. And if he gets out of control, I can simply use the handle as normal to prevent unnecessary splashing. Another little bonus is that the Trinsic Pro Touch2O also features a little temperature indicator built into its base, which makes it easier for children to tell if the water is too hot to touch (red means stop). Finally, while it's not directly related to the touch technology, I also really like how sturdy the coil is that supports the gooseneck.</p><figure><img alt="While the touch model costs slightly more than the standard version, Delta's Touch20 tech adds some nice (but not essential) functions so it doesn't feel like a complete gimmick. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/a6c88c30-f369-11ed-bd96-871252f9d71d" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption>While the touch model costs slightly more than the standard version, Delta's Touch20 tech adds some nice (but not essential) functions so it doesn't feel like a complete gimmick.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>So in the end, I will fully admit that although a touch faucet is hardly a game-changer, having one in my kitchen offers a few small perks that I think were worth the extra $150. That said, it still remains to be seen how this thing will hold up over time. I’m hoping that because Delta’s Touch20 devices use solenoid valves – which have been around since as far back as the early 1900s – there shouldn’t be any major tradeoff on durability. Because I really don’t want to think about buying another faucet for a long time.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/what-we-bought-are-touch-activated-faucets-smart-or-silly-140058186.html?src=rss

<p>At its annual product showcase, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/uber/"><ins>Uber</ins></a> announced a raft of updates, including the introduction of teen accounts. Starting on May 22nd, the company will start rolling out teen accounts in select cities in the US and Canada with the aim of helping younger folks travel more safely by themselves.</p><p>Uber says that only screened drivers who are experienced and highly rated will be able to carry out trips with teens. Drivers will be able to opt out of such rides. Teen accounts have a series of built-in safety features, including audio recordings, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-uber-ridecheck-live-us.html"><ins>RideCheck</ins></a> (which proactively checks in with riders if the vehicle has stopped for a while) and the option to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-uber-pin-code-verified-ride.html"><ins>use a PIN</ins></a> to ensure young users are getting in the right car.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Parents and guardians will be able to track the progress of the trip. They can contact the driver or Uber support directly, and report any problems on their teen's behalf.</p><p>Teen accounts will also be available for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/uber-eats/"><ins>Uber Eats</ins></a>. Using family profiles, parents will be able to keep an eye on what their kids are ordering and to pay for food and rides from a centralized account.</p><p>Uber had another update to share on the family front — the company is starting to offer rides with car seats for younger kids. It's using Nuna's Rava car seat, which can support kids from birth up to 65 lbs (29.5 kg). These rides will be available in New York City and Los Angeles to start with, and Uber will roll them out to more cities later.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/uber-will-start-rolling-out-teen-accounts-with-safety-features-next-week-150018174.html?src=rss

<p>Uber is really leaning into getting users to collaborate more through a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2cd8d8eb-701c-4377-94c5-920a8345ffac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Uber&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyY2Q4ZDhlYi03MDFjLTQzNzctOTRjNS05MjBhODM0NWZmYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudWJlci5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vZ28tZ2V0LTIwMjMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1ZDUyMDQ4ZS02NjEwLTQwNTEtOWQxZC00ZmZmMjJjNmE3NTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe8gW-bI3-dKRZvc-3c7hCs8rxU6kLx5BO4bZUkT4H-m&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fgo-get-2023%2F">series of new features across its core app and Uber Eats</a>. Many of the updates announced, including group rides and grocery orders, focus on digitally connecting friends and family.&nbsp;</p><p>On the primary <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-starts-offering-flight-bookings-in-the-uk-074558236.html">Uber</a> app, the company is removing any awkwardness for people who don't actually know their friends' addresses by heart (spoiler: almost everyone). Now each passenger can enter their own pick-up or drop-off location after being invited to the ride. According to Uber, other upcoming related features include changes to the stop order based on efficiency and charging each person for however long their part of the journey was.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-app-redesign-120016462.html">Uber is also trying a new feature</a> that has <em>never been done before</em>, especially not by taxis: calling to request a ride. People who don't have the app (or a smartphone) can now call the toll-free number 1-833-USE-UBER (1-833-873-8237) to schedule an immediate or future ride in English or Spanish. The rider will then get a text confirming their booking. It's a groundbreaking idea, to say the least.&nbsp;</p><p>On Uber Eats, there are two, slightly more unique, updates: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-eats-starts-offering-autonomous-food-deliveries-in-fairfax-virginia-100023523.html">group grocery shopping</a> and video messages with gifts. The option for group groceries means that, instead of shouting upstairs to see if whoever you live with needs anything from the store, you can instead invite them to a shared shopping cart. Each person can add deadlines for when they need certain groceries bought, create a recurring order, and send other members a reminder to add what they need. Most participating stores on Uber Eats will also split the bill.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who uses Uber Eats to send surprises to loved ones can make use of another update the next time they add one to their cart. Gifts on Uber Eats are getting a more personalized touch with the option for senders to record and attach video messages. Right now, this feature is only available for gift cards, but Uber claims it will soon work with anything you send.&nbsp;</p><p>These updates come alongside a few family-centric ones, including Uber accounts for teens and car seat requests in select cities.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/you-can-now-call-an-uber-like-a-normal-taxi-150006675.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-29-amazon-echo-buds-review.html">two generations</a> of Alexa-friendly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-29-amazon-echo-buds-review.html">Echo Buds</a> under its belt, and today it's introducing a third. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9lY2hvZGV2aWNlcz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby15bi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmRhOTIxOTctZDAwZS00NTcxLWIxYTUtMTdkNjA0ZWVmOTllIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAThBPHFEMy53EAN-m0JinwhvjNt6LZoDFZxCs0agY7XW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fechodevices">The new model</a> has been completely redesigned from the first two with an AirPods-like stickbud aesthetic many companies have adopted over the years. There are other changes too, but perhaps the most interesting one is what Amazon has done with the price. While the first two versions ranged from $100-$130, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlKVkczVFdYLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby15bi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmRhOTIxOTctZDAwZS00NTcxLWIxYTUtMTdkNjA0ZWVmOTllIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf-zxRupyyFrcAT4weg2IJjTCIEbdDsWVaV8qbBDmQ_T&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JVG3TWX%2F">third-gen Echo Buds</a> are just $50.</p><p>The company describes the new design as "lightweight and compact" but also "semi-in-ear." However, it didn't go into much more detail about the updated look in the press release. This likely means a fit akin to the "regular" AirPods: the earbuds stay put in your ears but don't have a tip to create a tight seal. As you might expect, Amazon is touting the new Echo Buds as a chance to take Alexa with you everywhere with quick hands-free access via voice cues. Inside, 12mm drivers offer "rich sound and balanced bass," according to the company. For calls there are two microphones and a voice detection accelerometer that work together to pick out your voice.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In terms of battery life, Amazon says you can expect up to five hours of listening time on the buds with three full charges in the case (20 hours total).

## Beats Studio Buds + review: A little bit better in every way
 - [https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-plus-review-140028329.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-plus-review-140028329.html?src=rss)

<p>An Amazon listing may have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-leak-on-amazon-with-a-may-18th-release-date-091639570.html">spilled the beans early</a>, but today Beats is officially debuting its latest true wireless earbuds. That premature appearance was mostly accurate: the Studio Buds + have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">a familiar design</a> with loads of improvements on the inside. Those upgrades include better battery life, retooled call performance and updated noise cancellation. There’s also a new transparent design option that offers a look at all of those internal components. However, they come with a slightly higher price tag at $170, which means the new version isn’t quite as good of a deal as the original.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>While the IPX4-rated Studio Buds + may look identical to the previous model at first glance, there are some subtle changes. The most significant is the addition of acoustic vents on both the front and the side. Beats says the updated design improves airflow to the transducer, which not only increases movement for sound but also allows for more effective active noise cancellation (ANC) and a better transparency mode. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.whathifi.com/features/i-spoke-to-apple-to-find-out-the-secret-behind-the-airpods-pro-2s-audiosound-success">changing up the airflow</a> was a key aspect of the improvements to sound quality Apple achieved in the second-gen AirPod Pro.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The vents also help relieve pressure so that the Studio Buds + are more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I found that claim of increased comfort to hold true throughout my testing. Additionally, Beats added an extra small ear tip size this time around. The company says it did this after analyzing “fit success” for a variety of people and conducting hours of testing. With the new size the company says it can provide a better seal, and in turn improved sound quality, for more people.</p><p>The overall design is unchanged, but Beats says 95 percent of the internal components have been swapped out for new parts. This list includes custom-built transducers which it claims delivers “cleaner” bass with minimal distortion while providing overall “powerful, balanced” sound. The new microphones are three times larger and there’s 16 percent more battery capacity. There are also upgrades to the battery in the charging case and Beats managed all of the power improvements without increasing the size of either the buds or their holder.</p><p>Another key aspect Beats tweaked is the “b” button that facilitates the onboard controls. With the original Studio Buds, it was very easy to accidentally hit when trying to adjust the fit. The company says it “revised the design” for “better product interactions” and to cut down on “accidental button presses.” Reliability of the controls was never an issue and that remains true on the Studio Buds +, but after testing I’m happy to report the errant presses are a thing of the past.</p><h2>Software and features</h2><figure><img alt="Beats Studio Buds + review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/f4b673a0-f4b1-11ed-bba9-82782788e8db" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>When it comes to the companion software for the Studio Buds +, there are no big changes. As before, everything is still baked into iOS for iPhone users. That includes one-touch pairing, iCloud device pairing and hands-free Siri. More settings are accessible via the device name on the Bluetooth menu, where Beats gives you battery percentage and noise control (ANC, transparency or off), alongside the ability to tweak the press-and-hold action, how you prefer to end calls and microphone priority. There’s also a shortcut to show the earbuds in the Find My app here. As is the case on other Beats devices, you can quickly access noise control via the volume slider in Control Center too.</p><p>On Android, there’s still a separate Beats app for button customization and firmware updates, but some features are available directly in the OS. One-touch pairing via Google Fast Pair as well as linking the earbuds to all of your Android and Chrome devices is here. Once those are synced, you can quickly switch between them thanks to the Studio Buds + multipoint pairing. These new Beats earbuds will also show up in Find My Device on Android, helping you locate them should they be misplaced.</p><p>The addition of onboard volume controls addresses one of my key gripes with the original Studio Buds. However, you’ll have to sacrifice noise control – the ability to toggle between ANC, transparency or off – directly on the earbuds. You’ll also forfeit the ability to summon a virtual assistant manually, which is key for Android users. Once you enable volume controls, the long press on one side turns the sound up while the other will turn it down. You can choose which you prefer on which side though, so there’s that.</p><h2>Sound quality and active noise cancellation</h2><figure><img alt="Beats Studio Buds + review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/82e65cf1-f4b0-11ed-b9e9-e9b92fb0bb39" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Beats hasn’t always been known for balanced sound and clean bass, but that’s what the company is promising on the Studio Buds +. The overall tuning here is indeed a solid mix of highs, mids and lows – all of which stand on their own and cut through the mix with ease. Even more bass-heavy tunes like Underoath’s “Damn Excuses” are quite neutral sounding. The thumping kick drum and driving bass line don’t overpower the gritty, distorted guitars, backing vocals or the more subtle synth and keys underneath.</p><p>In fact, I’d like <em>a little more bass</em> on the Studio Buds +. Or perhaps a little fuller bass. There are times where the low end feels flat, like on other songs from Underoath’s <em>Voyeurist</em>. Hip-hop tracks fare better, but the driving, almost droning quality across Run The Jewels’ catalog is noticeably subdued. Beats certainly succeeded in achieving a balanced sound, but it did so by zapping some energy from the bass section of the EQ. And this holds true with both spatial audio and “regular” tunes alike.</p><p>In terms of noise canceling performance, Beats touts a 1.6x improvement thanks to the upgraded microphones, vents and the company’s second-gen chip. It’s a modest gain, but there is a discernible jump in the ability to block constant noise sources. There’s still work to be done when it comes to things like human voices and the random racket, though. The first Studio Buds did an adequate job of noise suppression and these are slightly better.</p><p>I don’t usually call out transparency mode in reviews because most of the time it’s just… there. But Beats says it improved this ambient sound thanks to the new mics, vent design and sound processing I’ve already mentioned. Indeed, there’s a noticeable difference on the Studio Buds + as compared to the previous version, but it’s nowhere near the level of what Apple achieves on some of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html">AirPods</a>. Part of the reason for this is that Beats doesn’t feed the sound of your voice back through the earbuds. So while AirPods Pro and AirPods Max can make it seem like you’re not even wearing them in transparency mode, the Studio Buds + aren’t on that level.</p><h2>Call quality</h2><figure><img alt="Beats Studio Buds + review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/82e858c0-f4b0-11ed-bfaf-89be5c27790c" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Beats says it “completely redesigned” the voice setup in the Studio Buds +. It did so by swapping out components and adding a new algorithm with the aim of suppressing unwanted noise and better focusing on your voice. To develop the algorithm, Beats explains that it used machine learning for the first time to train the system versus “a wide variety” of noisy scenarios with more than 7,000 hours of testing. In addition to new mics and a redesigned port to house them, the company says the larger components have an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The voice mic port was also relocated to the bottom side to underneath the multifunction button for upgraded voice detection.</p><p>All of that looks great on paper, but plenty of audio companies make lofty claims about call quality that rarely pan out as advertised. The promise of better noise blocking from the voice system does hold true and I consistently noticed less background roar in calls and recorded memos. However, the overall quality is good but not great. There’s a slightly muffled quality to your voice, and it lacks the clarity some other earbuds can provide. What’s more, the Studio Buds + confusingly disables transparency mode when you start a call if you have it active. Couple that with the fact that the ambient sound feature doesn’t pipe in your voice and that’s a perfect recipe for you to get shouty during a meeting.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>Beats promises improved battery life with the Studio Buds + over the previous model. The new earbuds can muster six hours of use with ANC or transparency mode on with three additional charges in the case. Turn noise cancellation and ambient sound off and you can get up to nine hours in one go (up to 27 additional hours with the case). That’s one more hour in the buds themselves and 11 more in the case. It’s a significant improvement and during my tests was an accurate representation of battery performance.</p><p>Indeed, I managed to hit six hours easily during my testing with a mix of ANC and transparency mode for both music and calls. In fact, I still had six percent remaining at that time, so you’ll likely get slightly better than Beats’ stated figures out of the Studio Buds +. The one knock against this model when it comes to battery is the lack of wireless charging. The first Studio Buds didn’t have it either and the company didn’t see the need to add it this time around.</p><h2>The competition</h2><figure><img alt="Beats Studio Buds + review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/82e68401-f4b0-11ed-bf94-6eb3bbd21e99" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The best alternative to the Studio Buds + comes from Beats’ own stable of audio gear. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html">Beats Fit Pro</a> are my favorite in the company’s line right now, with fully adaptive ANC, and spatial audio that utilizes head tracking and personalization. I also enjoy the balanced, punchy bass on these. Battery life isn’t quite as good as the new model with ANC off, but it’s the same with noise cancellation enabled (six hours). No wireless charging here either, but the wingtip design offers a more secure fit for workouts. The Fit Pro debuted just months after the first Studio Buds in 2021, so perhaps they’re headed for a refresh too.</p><p>If you’re looking for a non-Beats option, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">Sony’s WF-1000XM4</a> remains our top pick for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds</a>. Simply put, no one comes close to the full suite of features the company offers. On top of great sound and effective ANC, the earbuds can automatically change settings based on your activity or location. What’s more, handy tools like Speak-to-Chat make quick convos a breeze thanks to automatic pausing via voice detection. iPhone users will have to sacrifice the tight integration with iOS, iCloud device sharing and hands-free Siri though.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>Like the Studio Buds were before, the Studio Buds + remain the best Beats option for most people. They have the design with the most general appeal and work in lockstep with iOS. The company has done significant work to make sure the earbuds sync up better with Android too. Factor in noticeable improvements to ANC and other tweaks, Beats has another compelling true wireless model here. With the price increase, these have crept out of the mid range and are approaching premium status. That makes them a less obvious value than the original model, but it’s far from a dealbreaker. Let’s just hope the company has some upgrades planned for the Beats Fit Pro too.</p><p>The Beats Studio Buds + are available starting today in black/gold, ivory and transparent color options for $170. The new model is currently for sale at Apple in the US, Canada and China.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-plus-review-140028329.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon updated its Echo speaker lineup today, including a new $40 model with a semi-spherical design, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9JbnRyb2R1Y2luZy1zb3VuZC1jb21wYWN0LXNwZWFrZXItTGF2ZW5kZXIvZHAvQjA5WlhKRFNMNT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby15ci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjQxZTgyYmYtZjUxNC00NjZiLTllOTctNWU2MjM5MDIwZmY2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWky-14eov2JZdC8nPuO8MbTgPTD9gNgEpQGYBt0u5g4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FIntroducing-sound-compact-speaker-Lavender%2Fdp%2FB09ZXJDSL5">Echo Pop</a>. Additionally, Echo Auto is coming to more countries.</p><p>The Echo Pop is Amazon’s newest entry-level Alexa-powered device. Its half-globe design uses a front-facing speaker with “full sound,” although it sounds like it will be a better fit for small spaces like dorm rooms where you only need to hear it from one direction. It also carries over two features from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-studio-echo-dot-audio-updates-163214979.html">latest Echo Dot</a>. First, it has Amazon’s AZ2 Neural Edge processor for on-device machine learning tasks.

## Adobe’s new AI automates PDF accessibility tags

<p>Depending on who you ask, AI can be mesmerizing, terrifying or some combination of both. But Adobe’s accessibility-focused artificial intelligence is a use case that (I hope) any reasonable person can get behind. The company’s new Auto-Tag API can remove the tedium from making accessibility-friendly PDFs for people with disabilities.</p><p>PDFs have built-in metadata providing structural information — headings, paragraphs, lists and tables — in documents for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/accessibility-in-tech-2020-150002855.html">assistive tech</a> like screen readers. But tagging digital documents for compatibility can be time-consuming, especially for those with complex layouts or companies with backlogs of old files lacking the proper metadata. Adobe estimates that over 90 percent of PDFs are at least partially inaccessible for people with disabilities, sometimes “appearing blank, blurry or as lines of distorted text.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Adobe’s PDF Accessibility Auto-Tag API automates the tagging process. The company says its Sensei-powered software will indicate the correct reading order for assistive technology, saving companies time and — more to the point — making PDFs more readable for people with disabilities. Adobe says the AI can quickly go through stockpiles of old documents lacking the proper structure.</p><p>The company is also launching a PDF Accessibility Checker, which will “enable organizations to quickly and easily evaluate the accessibility of existing PDFs at scale.”</p><p>In addition to the developer-facing API, Auto-Tag is coming to Acrobat Pro in June, offering automated metadata structuring within the app at no additional cost for all subscribers. The feature will also make its way to Acrobat Reader this fall.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/adobes-new-ai-automates-pdf-accessibility-tags-130019203.html?src=rss

<p>It's no secret that, regardless of skill level, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fifa-23-will-add-all-12-national-womens-soccer-league-teams-on-march-15th-183352449.html">women's sports are broadcast</a> and funded a whole lot less than men's sports. While serious structural shifts are needed to rectify this, small changes are always welcome. In that vein, Roku is launching the Women's Sports Zone, a hub for accessing live matches, alongside content like documentaries and movies that focus on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eas-last-fifa-game-is-finally-making-womens-soccer-a-priority-071056253.html">women's sports</a>, all in one place. The streaming platform credits a general spike in interest toward watching women's sports as responsible for the move.&nbsp;</p><p>Roku users can access the Women's Sports Zone in one of two ways, the first being by searching directly for &quot;women's sports&quot; or the name of a team or a league. Otherwise, users on the TV or mobile app can scroll to the sports section to find it. On the TV, the zone will pop up under the &quot;Browse by Sport&quot; category — yes, implying women's sports are one entity versus being just as multifaceted as men's sports, again, small changes. Once inside the zone, there's a breakdown of current games streaming live and upcoming matches with their dates listed.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The hub's launch is neatly timed to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wnba-2021-streaming-schedule-221651299.html">WNBA</a> season's imminent start, with live broadcasts currently including professional and collegiate basketball, soccer and golf. Supporting channels are responsible for providing each offering, and, according to Roku, additional content will be available in &quot;the coming months.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/roku-launches-the-womens-sports-zone-130017243.html?src=rss

## Google's latest AI tackles long and costly drug discovery

<p>It can cost billions of dollars to develop drugs and a large percentage fail at the trial stage, so a number of companies are deploying AI to help in that area. Google's Cloud division is the latest to join that race with two new suites aimed at addressing drug discovery while advancing precision medicine, it <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-cloud-launches-ai-powered-solutions-to-safely-accelerate-drug-discovery-and-precision-medicine-301825674.html">announced</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/healthcare-life-sciences/google-clouds-new-ai-powered-healthcare-research-products">Target and Lead Identification Suite</a> aims to help drug companies better understand proteins and amino acids that are key to drug development. Specifically, it's designed to help scientists identify biological targets that researchers can develop treatments around. This could effectively speed up drug discovery and lower costs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Early adopters for the suite &quot;include multinational pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and industry-leading biotech companies including Cereval,&quot; Google Cloud wrote in a press release. &quot;We are partnering with Google on exploring how AlphaFold2 can potentially accelerate our drug discovery process, speeding up our researchers' ability to conduct their experiments on Google Cloud's scalable, accelerator-optimized compute platform,&quot; said Pfizer's principal computational scientist, Nicholas Labello.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the Multiomics Suite is designed to tackle genomic data analysis. The idea is to find out how genetic variations affect disease in order to create appropriate and even personalized treatments. Genomic databases tend to be enormous, so the suite would give researchers fast access to the appropriate data, helping accelerate treatments.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We would not be anywhere near where we are today&quot; without the tool, Colossal Biosciences CEO Ben Lamm told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/google-cloud-launches-ai-tools-to-accelerate-drug-discovery.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. That company has been an early adopter of Multiomics, and Lamm said it would have been a &quot;massive burden&quot; for Colossal to try to build something similar itself.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-latest-ai-tackles-long-and-costly-drug-discovery-121959099.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: Samsung is reportedly sourcing OLED TV panels from rival LG

<p>Samsung and LG have a long-running rivalry, both Korean corporations, both make TVs, speakers, freezers, toothpaste (maybe?) and the rest. It’s a frosty relationship, with many trade shows revealing new TV products from both companies with nigh-on identical specifications and sizes. So it’s a bit of a shock to hear from <em>Reuters​</em> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-is-reportedly-buying-oled-tv-panels-from-lg-143246449.html"><ins>Samsung has inked a deal with LG</ins></a> to buy its white OLED (WOLED) TV panels.</p><p>The plan, according to the report, is for LG Display to supply two million panels next year, then three million and five million, respectively in 2025 and 2026. These high-end white OLED panels would be 77 and 83 inches, so they’re likely to be in Samsung’s most premium TVs.</p><p>Samsung could do with the OLED help: It has 6.1 percent of the OLED TV market, according to market research firm Omdia. LG Display's sibling LG Electronics is out in front with a 54.6 percent market share, while Sony has 26.1 percent. For the record, Sony also uses LG parts.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p></p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

Further, even if it does raise questions, they still wouldn't be enough to overturn her fraud conviction.&nbsp;</p><p>Holmes had asked the court to pause her sentence a couple of days before she was supposed to report to prison on April 27th, with her lawyers arguing that she wasn't a flight risk. The appeals court delayed her reporting date while it considered her request, but it has ultimately decided that she has to start serving her sentence. A district court that previously denied the same request from her camp recommended that she serve her time at a Bryan, Texas federal prison camp, which allows family visitations.

Immersion has accused Valve of infringing its patents with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-portable-pc-gaming-133008285.html">Steam Deck</a> handheld, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html">Valve Index VR</a> platform, Steam VR software and games including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23726295/valve-immersion-rumble-lawsuit"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported.</p><p>Immersion wants an injunction against Valve &quot;from deploying, operating, maintaining, testing and using the Accused Handheld Instrumentalities and Accused VR Instrumentalities,&quot; it stated in some fine legalese, and is asking for damages and royalties as well. It cited seven specific patents dating from 2002 to 2016.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If Valve wants to fight this, they've got a mountain of precedent to overcome. Both Sony and Microsoft ended up licensing Immersion's patents after settling lawsuits, and Apple, Google, Motorola and Fitbit did the same. Nintendo and Sony use a different form of rumble tech, but both elected to license Immersion's patents. Valve uses the same type of rumble tech as Nintendo and Sony.</p><p>It appears that Immersion didn't sue Valve for its Steam Controller, which was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-27-valve-steam-controller-sale-discontinued.html">killed back in 2019</a>. The Steam Deck appears to be a much bigger success <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/2023W20/">in terms of sales</a>, however, and has <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/feature/steam-deck-hardware-review">generally been a hit</a> with both critics and gamers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/valve-is-the-latest-company-to-be-sued-by-immersion-over-its-steam-deck-rumble-tech-095043279.html?src=rss

<p>Tesla is known for being <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-02-ad-averse-tesla-will-run-a-fan-made-commercial.html">ad-averse</a> and hasn't really ran traditional advertising since it launched in the early 2000's, choosing to rely on word of mouth to promote its vehicles instead. Now things could change for the automaker. During the company's latest shareholder meeting, <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/05/16/tesla-try-advertising-elon-musk-hates-it/">Tesla chief Elon Musk replied </a>to an <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vbGl2ZS9iWk5MXzhiVXo2QT9mZWF0dXJlPXNoYXJlJnQ9NDQ5MiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTE2ZGUwZjItYjAyZC00YmFkLTg3NGEtNDA2ZGY0OTNlYjk4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAT2XU1hWQIJTAR5iDGjKOR1pf9JWNhwa6g6Cuws2NvmA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Flive%2FbZNL_8bUz6A%3Ffeature%3Dshare%26t%3D4492">audience question</a> regarding advertising with: "We will try a little advertising and see how it goes." Apparently, the executive changed his mind about advertising after acquiring Twitter, which makes most of its money from ads.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's indeed ironic that Twitter is highly dependent on advertising. Here I am, never used advertising really before, and now I have a company that’s highly dependent on advertising. So, I guess I should say advertising is awesome, and everyone should do it." That's a total reversal from the executive's previous stance. He said a few years ago that <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1188890479401689088">he hated advertising</a> and that Tesla <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1129924410339495937">uses money</a> other automakers set aside for ads and endorsements "to make the product great."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In his response during the shareholder meeting, Musk said Tesla vehicles have functionalities and features that most people don't know about. The company does post them on its Twitter account, but he acknowledges that doing so is like preaching to the choir. In a follow-up interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/elon-musk-cnbc-interview-with-david-faber.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, he said ads could be "informative and entertaining" so that they're more content than typical advertisements. He suggested that future Tesla ads could take on that format and highlight its vehicles' lesser-known features.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/16/elon-musk-teases-two-new-evs-says-tesla-is-already-building-one/">teased two new EVs</a> during the shareholder meeting, where he said that the vehicles' design and manufacturing techniques "are head and shoulders above anything else that is present in the industry." He said that the company is already in the process of "building a new product," which could mean that Tesla is already working on a prototype for at least one of the EVs.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tesla-may-reverse-its-stance-and-start-advertising-060638995.html?src=rss
