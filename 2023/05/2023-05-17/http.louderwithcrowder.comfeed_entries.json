Quote: \"That's why I did it. It's my mother's dog, and he should obey me.\" The man also said he didn't think the dog was hurt. The owner (I'm assuming his mother) says the dog only has a broken leg and will be fine. </p><p>The man was arrested on suspicion of animal cruelty. The diverse group of heroes who beat on him may have some legal issues of their own. An attorney tells NBC News that \"continuing to beat the suspect after the dog is safe might raise some legal questions.\" I don't know why a reporter would think to ask that. What they should be asking is which Starbucks the heroes shop at so they can get each of them a gift card. But, you know.

Fair? Fair.

It's not the first time a parent has taken issue with a middle schooler having \"This Book is Gay\" thrust upon them by a teacher. Media outlets like NBC News want you to think it's about the word \"gay.\" When in actuality, it's about the words \"handjob,\" \"c*m,\" and the illustrations that go with it.

We didn't have graphic lessons about doing it doggy-style or reverse cowgirl. Nor was sixty-nining pitched as a method of safe sex. Yet, in the name of \"inclusion\" and stuff like \"equity,\" government-run schools have decided graphic sex is the only way to \"teach\" students to be tolerant of each other. It's <em>ALMOST</em> as if there is an anterior motive going on.<br /></p><p>The word \"gay\" is why the school boards have this on recommended reading lists because that makes the book about tolerance. As opposed to, say, a book called <em>This Book Fucks</em> teaching hetero students how to use sex apps to hook up, or the proper technique in giving a proper handjob. That's just porn. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/parental-rights-congresswoman-penthouse\" target=\"_self\">Not unlike the difference between award-winning LGBTQAIIP+EIEIO literature and Penthouse Forum letters</a>.</p><p><span></span>This parent in this video is from North Carolina, The parents from Illinois who filed a police report against Ms. Bonner might have different issues with the book.

After Bud Light's unfortunate, real-time experiment <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-fenway-park\" target=\"_self\">on the correlation between getting woke and going broke</a>, an opportunity was presented for another brewery to step up as America's beer.

And proceeds benefit a veterans' charity. Wendy Yuengling, Chief Administrative Officer, said of the collaboration: \"As the Oldest Brewery in America, we are dedicated to supporting the U.S. military and are always seeking ways to further show our appreciation to those that protect our country\u2019s freedom.

No one stood up for us, and so, that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing.</blockquote><p>It's not just the fairness aspect. Or how it's now a part of the Democrat Party platform that it's okay for your daughters to have <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/skateboarding-29-year-old\" target=\"_self\">their hopes and dreams</a> (<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rugby-coach-transgender-ban\" target=\"_self\">and bones</a>) be crushed <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chloe-barnes-track-state-championship\" target=\"_self\">by boys</a> who <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-riley-gaines\" target=\"_self\">went through male puberty</a>, but now want you to call them girls. And that your daughters will be just fine since -- and this is female leftists saying this -- <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/girls-school-sports-minnesota\" target=\"_self\">girls won't amount</a> to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-pennsylvania-girls-sports\" target=\"_self\">much in sports</a> anyway.</p><p>But we're also forcing girls and young women aged 18-22 (<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/locker-room-vermont-speaks-out\" target=\"_blank\">and younger</a>) to be exposed to male genitalia and act like they're the \"solve for x\"-phobes for feeling uncomfortable with it. At the time, Lia <a href=\"https://meaww.com/lia-thomas-women-uncomfortable-changing-in-locker-room-with-trans-u-penn-swimmer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">still had male genitalia, and still dated women</a> just like those who were born male and went through puberty as males with male genitalia have been traditionally known to do. Though <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-biden-title-ix\" target=\"_blank\">now that Lia has pink hair</a>, that may have changed.</p><p>Gaines and other other females confronted officials and asked how this was allowed. Easy. The officials found a technicality.</p><blockquote>No one told us. No one asked for our consent. We did not give our consent to undress in front of a male. ... I went up to one of the officials on the pool deck, and I said, 'How is this allowed to happen?\" He looks at me, and, word for word, he says, \"Oh, we actually got around this by making the locker rooms unisex. So, it's not a big deal.\"</blockquote><p>So in order to make it legal for one man to whip it out in the girls' locker room, they took away the word \"girls'\". That was the compromise. That's what is considered \"logic\" these days.</p><p>Odd, I've yet to see any clip of a Democrat defending their party's new platform, or even addressing Gaines' testimony. Though one Democrat let us know he didn't care when he got the school wrong that Gaines' was assaulted at.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
