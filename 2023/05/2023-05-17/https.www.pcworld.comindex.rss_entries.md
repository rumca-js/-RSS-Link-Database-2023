<p>Intel&rsquo;s new Arc Balanced Builds bundles address perhaps the most fundamental question in PC building: How can you get the most performance from a PC without overpaying?</p>



<p>Intel knows, at least where its own processors and Arc GPUs are concerned. And, based upon the results of its own (massive) internal tests, the company is working with retailers and system builders to discount bundles of its CPUs and GPUs to match the best combination for your buck.</p>



<p>PCs are rarely in &ldquo;balance&rdquo;: Some components are simply faster than others, so the flow of data from an SSD or hard drive through a motherboard&rsquo;s chipset to a CPU, back and forth to memory, and out to the GPU is inevitably limited by a component. Upgrading that component simply passes the bottleneck to elsewhere else in the system. What enthusiast and consumer sites like PCWorld try to do when testing a CPU is use the most powerful GPU possible, in the hope that the CPU will be the bottleneck. When testing a GPU, the same logic applies: We use the fastest CPU we can get.</p>



<p>In the real world, that&rsquo;s a bad strategy. There&rsquo;s no reason to pair a budget GPU with the fastest Core i9, because the GPU simply can&rsquo;t keep up. Ideally, then, you try to build a PC where the two components can scale up, hand in hand. </p>



<p>What Intel did internally was compare its Core microprocessors with its own Arc GPUs, testing them repeatedly across various configurations of CPUs and GPUs, as well as with various games, to try and answer the question of which CPU-GPU combination offered the most value without sacrificing performance <em>or </em>money. </p>



<p>The answer? The Arc A750/A770 pairs best with a Core i5 and Core i7, while the A380 really works best with a Core i3, and possibly a Core i5. While you&rsquo;re free to pair an A380 (or any Arc GPU) with any Intel Core CPU, exceeding Intel&rsquo;s recommendations will net you diminishing returns unless you upgrade the GPU.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a task that enthusiast sites could take on, of course, but Intel certainly has an advantage: It has access to every CPU and GPU it manufactures, naturally.</p>



<p>What Intel has also done is work with system builders and retailers to come up with optimum builds. At Newegg, for example, you can buy an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/asrock-arc-a770-a770-pgd-8go/p/N82E16814930077&amp;xcust=2-1-1921040-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Asrock Phantom Gaming Arc 770 card</a> for $329, but the specific <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100007709%208000%20601407265&amp;cm_sp=Cat_GPUs-Video-Graphics-Devices-_-22-1809%2fbanner-_-%2f%2fpromotions.newegg.com%2fintel%2f22-1809%2fbanner%2f1920x360.jpg&amp;icid=753683&amp;xcust=2-1-1921040-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Balanced Builds page</a> also offers a bundle of a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails?ItemList=Combo.4546586&amp;xcust=2-1-1921040-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Core i5-12600K with an A770</a> for $369.98&mdash;a $20 savings.

## Overwatch 2 abandons PvE Hero mode, completing the bait-and-switch

<p>In 2019 Blizzard announced <em>Overwatch 2</em>, an overhauled version of the original game bursting at the seams with the story-rich player-versus-environment content fans had been asking for since the original game&rsquo;s launch. In 2022 <em>Overwatch 2</em> finally came out&hellip;as a free-to-play title, lacking the cooperative mode so heavily featured at the Blizzcon debut, promising players would see it added later while the team battle mode launched. Now Blizzard has admitted it&rsquo;s not going to release a PVE mode for<em> Overwatch 2</em> at all.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-pve-mode-is-being-scrapped-blizzard-explains-what-happened-and-why/1100-6514242/&amp;xcust=2-1-1920679-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">an interview with Gamespot</a>, <em>Overwatch 2</em> director Aaron Keller said that the game would feature &ldquo;part of what the team has set out to do, but not the entirety of what was discussed back at BlizzCon 2019.&rdquo; Future &ldquo;seasons&rdquo; of <em>Overwatch 2</em> content will include some PvE story missions, as the original game did, but the dedicated co-op Hero mode with dynamic character and ability progression is off the table. <em>Overwatch 2</em>, like <em>Overwatch </em>before it, will be almost entirely focused on its team-versus-team shooter mode. </p>



<p>And with the co-op mode&rsquo;s death, perhaps the biggest change between <em>Overwatch </em>and <em>Overwatch 2</em> is its unasked-for new monetization system&mdash;which is a lot less player-friendly now than it used to be.</p>



<h2 id="waiting-for-stories-that-will-never-be-told">Waiting for stories that will never be told</h2>



<p>A vocal portion of <em>Overwatch </em>players past and present aren&rsquo;t happy with the news. <em>Overwatch 2</em> is both a sequel and a replacement for the original game &mdash; the original <em>Overwatch </em>is no longer playable, despite selling over 50 million copies. <em>Overwatch 2</em> was &ldquo;sold&rdquo; (if you can use the term for a free-to-play game) to its audience as an upgrade, largely predicated on this new PvE mode that would bring fresh content and storytelling to a world that had become stagnant after adding so many fresh, vibrant elements. Now we&rsquo;ll never see that story content, or at least, we&rsquo;ll only see a very small portion of what was promised. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Reinhardt PvE skill tree" class="wp-image-1921025" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/reinhardt-skill-tree-overwatch-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Activision-Blizzard</p></div>



<p>This exacerbates <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1359589/why-i-quit-overwatch-2-breakup-letter.html">the primary issues that I had with<em> Overwatch 2</em> back at launch</a>: That it&rsquo;s using some absolutely amazing character and production design, animation, and voice work, and never letting those characters tell a story beyond a bit of thin lore. <em>Overwatch </em>characters <em>can</em>&lsquo;<em>t </em>tell stories in the main team-based mode, because they&rsquo;re infinitely variable and replayable. They basically treat the characters as a kid&rsquo;s action figures, smashing them together for the gameplay without any further goals. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s fine for a game that&rsquo;s only a team shooter (or, indeed, a vehicle for a multi-billion-dollar esports league). But for a game that keeps teasing us with character-focused animated shorts, it&rsquo;s infuriating. The first trailer for the original <em>Overwatch </em>set up a very <em>GI Joe</em>-esque conflict between the Overwatch &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; and Talon &ldquo;bad guys,&rdquo; and the <em>Overwatch 2</em> announcement trailer teased epic cooperative fights against an implacable computer-controlled foe. Both of those trailers now feel like dishonest representations of the games we actually received. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>See all those characters with histories and relationships, working together to protect neo-Paris from a giant mecha? Good, because you&rsquo;ll never see it in<em> Overwatch 2</em> gameplay.</p>



<p>Keller says that at least some of that story content is still being planned. In Season 6 of <em>Overwatch 2</em>, single-player &ldquo;Hero Mastery&rdquo; mini-modes and three different event modes will be part of &ldquo;this big narrative where players do get to find out more about <em>Overwatch</em>, and they do get to find out more about what&rsquo;s happening in the world and what&rsquo;s happening with a lot of the characters in the game.&rdquo; Keller also describes new cinematics and a lore codex&hellip;but cinematics and lore weren&rsquo;t something the game was lacking. A dedicated medium for telling a story, one that doesn&rsquo;t reset after ten minutes of shooting, was. </p>



<h2 id="the-free-to-play-bait-and-switch">The free-to-play bait-and-switch</h2>



<p>And that&rsquo;s just the disappointing part of the gameplay and story. The other big change to<em> Overwatch 2 </em>was a shift to a free-to-play model, one that players didn&rsquo;t ask for and didn&rsquo;t receive gracefully. Arguably the original <em>Overwatch </em>felt somewhat like a free-to-play game (with a $40 price tag) thanks to its stingy randomized loot box system. But the remixed F2P model of <em>Overwatch 2</em> locked the full roster of interchangeable heroes, the signature feature of the original <em>Overwatch</em>, behind purchases and battle passes. It&rsquo;s more or less the same as <em>League of Legends</em>, or any number of free-to-play multiplayer mobile games you&rsquo;d care to mention. </p>



<p>In hindsight, it seems like the launch of <em>Overwatch 2</em> and the end of the original game was a decision made almost entirely to force a free-to-play model on existing players, while bringing in new players to inject cash to the never-ending live service model. As a mega-fan of the original game, who&rsquo;s been desperate for new and substantive story content for years, it&rsquo;s hard to see this as anything but a betrayal. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Overwatch 2 store page" class="wp-image-1921041" height="679" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overwatch-2-in-game-shop.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Oh, sorry, did you want some character development for this cast we&rsquo;ve been building for the better part of a decade? Best I can do is two skins for $22.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Activision-Blizzard</p></div>



<p>The executives in charge of <em>Overwatch </em>can say all they want about focusing resources and player experience. It&rsquo;s clear that <em>Overwatch </em>now exists to service its in-game store, not to deliver an engaging experience to players. Perhaps it was naive to expect anything else once the free-to-play structure of the game was revealed&hellip;but that wasn&rsquo;t made clear until years after the PvE mode was so heavily featured at Blizzcon, even going so far as to be a playable demo for attending fans and media. </p>



<p>With <em>Warcraft, Starcraft, </em>and <em>Diablo</em>, Blizzard built a legacy on decades of games with incredible quality and some of the best stories ever told in the medium. <em>Overwatch</em> was sold on that reputation, a new property and universe from a developer that gives them out so sparingly. But the story side of the equation never balanced out, and isn&rsquo;t interested in trying anymore. Between this broken promise, and a marked decrease in both quality and value with recent releases, Blizzard&rsquo;s legacy has never seemed more in peril&mdash;an ominous sign with <em>Diablo IV</em> set to release in mere weeks.</p>

<p>If you spend hours upon hours in front of a display, you should consider picking up the Asus VivoBook Pro 16X OLED. The tester described the 4K OLED display as &ldquo;more exceptional than stunning.&rdquo; Colors are vibrant and darks have quite the depth. This display produces clear images and is a good choice for those who suffer from eye strain. The VivoBook doesn&rsquo;t skimp on processing power, either.</p>

<p>The CPU is the Ryzen 9 5900HX, which should be plenty fast for most coding needs and general use tasks. It&rsquo;s also packing 32GB of RAM and a whopping 1TB of PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD storage. That&rsquo;s sufficient enough for multitasking or running a few applications simultaneously, and a near-ideal configuration for intense programming. There are a few knocks against this machine like the boring design, lackluster webcam, and finicky fingerprint reader. Those drawbacks are relatively minuscule, though. Overall, this is a well-rounded machine that any programmer would love.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re on a tight budget, the Acer Swift 3 is an excellent value. It features an Intel Core i7-11370H with four cores, 16GB of&nbsp;RAM, and a 512GB SSD. That&rsquo;s powerful enough for most programming tasks. As for the build quality, our tester described it as &ldquo;tightly constructed.&rdquo; The keyboard is also comfortable to use for extended periods and the display offers &ldquo;rich, lifelike color.&rdquo; Battery life is disappointing, however, as it managed to die in about five hours after light use. If you don&rsquo;t mind keeping this thing tethered to an outlet, then this is a fantastic budget option for most programmers, especially if you want a big screen on a modest budget.</p>

<p>The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is something of a rare gem in the sand dune, as it&rsquo;s both lightweight and powerful. It weighs a little over three pounds, which comfortably slots it under the ultraportable umbrella.&nbsp; You can&nbsp; also expect fast, reliable performance thanks to the AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS processor, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and the 1TB of PCIe 4.0 SSD storage&mdash;a great combination for heavy-duty programming sessions. The only trade-off is the keyboard, as it feels mushy and the backlighting is less than impressive. But if you&rsquo;re looking for a portable laptop that promises snappy performance, the Zephyrus G14 is the way to go.</p>

<p>The Lenovo Slim Pro 7 isn&rsquo;t quite as powerful as the ROG Zephyrus G14, but it&rsquo;s a good deal cheaper. That doesn&rsquo;t mean, however, that it doesn&rsquo;t come with enough hardware performance to still get your programming tasks done. It comes with a Ryzen 7 processor, RTX 3050 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB off SSD storage. It also nails some other important fundamentals such as a keyboard that is comfortable to write code on all day and solid connectivity for when you want to add peripherals. It also has a sleek, svelte design that measures in at only 0.71 inches thick and weighd just under 3.5 pounds. You&rsquo;ll have to be willing to make some compromises to save on the cost. Admittedly, the display quality is a bit of a weak point and you&rsquo;ll probably eventually want to invest in a larger portable hard drive. But the Slim Pro 7 is a versatile, affordable laptop and if you&rsquo;re looking for a portable laptop for programming that is more affordable than the G14, this Lenovo is hard to beat.</p>

<p>Programmers spend ages writing and updating code, so it&rsquo;s important to get a laptop with a comfortable keyboard. Well, it doesn&rsquo;t get much better than Lenovo&rsquo;s pillow-like ThinkPad keyboards. If it&rsquo;s comfort you&rsquo;re after, the Lenovo ThnkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 will serve you well. According to our tester, the keys &ldquo;feel snappy and are quiet when mashed and offer just the right amount of travel.&rdquo; You should be able to type for long periods without any disruptions, as there are no annoyingly shortened keys. As for performance, the X1 Carbon packs a decent punch.</p>

<p>This machine has an Intel Core i7-1185G7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD storage. While the CPU isn&rsquo;t as powerful as the newer 12th-gen processors, it should still deliver reliable performance.  In other words, you should be able to easily run apps and quickly compile code. We had only a few minor nitpicks with this machine. For one, the webcam is limited to 720p. That&rsquo;s not terribly surprising nor much of a deal-breaker. The display color is a bit cool as well. Aside from those points, we feel the X1 Carbon is a good performer with a fantastic keyboard, though some other options offer more hardware firepower for a similar price. </p>

<p>If you like 2-in-1 designs, the Lenovo Yoga 9i 14 will hit the spot. You can swing the screen around and use it like a tablet or prop it up like a tent, making it a rather versatile device. It has 16GB of RAM, 1TB of SSD storage,&nbsp;a crystal clear OLED display, and strong battery life. The 12th-gen Intel Core i7 processor seriously boosts performance, too, with four performance cores and eight efficiency cores. That&rsquo;s more than enough for most programming needs. The 74 watt-hour battery is pretty big for a compact convertible as well. When we ran our battery rundown test, the machine died in about 12 hours. That&rsquo;s more than a full work day. Although this laptop has a lot to offer, there are a few tiny caveats.</p>

<p>For one, the display&rsquo;s 16:9 aspect ratio makes things feel a bit cramped. It&rsquo;s not a huge deal, but we generally prefer taller displays, as it makes scrolling through documents and web pages a lot easier. It&rsquo;s also difficult to get accustomed to the trackpad because of its small size. That said, if you can deal with those nitpicks, the Yoga 9i is a great machine worth considering.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we&rsquo;ve tested. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a breakdown of each test and the reasons why we run them.</p>



<h3 id="windows-laptops">Windows laptops</h3>



<ul><li><strong>PCMark 10</strong>: PCMark 10 is how we determine how well the laptop handles lighter tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and so on.</li><li><strong>HandBrake</strong>: HandBrake is more intensive than PCMark 10. It basically measures how long a laptop&rsquo;s CPU takes to encode a beefy 30GB file. </li><li><strong>Cinebench</strong>: Cinebench is a brief stress test of the CPU cores. It does this by rendering a 2D scene over a short period of time.</li><li><strong>3DMark</strong>: 3DMark checks if 3D performance remains consistent over time by running graphic-intensive clips. </li><li><strong>Video rundown test</strong>: To gauge battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 10&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop dies.</li></ul>



<h2 id="what-kind-of-laptop-should-you-get-for-programming">What kind of laptop should you get for programming?</h2>



<p>Whether you&rsquo;re writing code for a cool mobile app or programming a brand new website, a laptop that&rsquo;s both fast and responsive is an absolute must. However, the top three things to pay special attention to are the processor, memory, and storage space. Although we consider those to be the holy trinity of what makes a laptop suitable for programming tasks, we&rsquo;ve also taken into consideration display resolution and portability. This is especially important for reducing eye strain and working on-the-go. As a programmer, you may need to regularly commute into an office and spend long hours in front of the screen. Check out the list below for more specifics.</p>



<ul><li><strong>CPU: </strong>You&rsquo;re going to want a laptop with a high-function processor. To get the most functionality out of your machine, we&rsquo;d recommend springing for an Intel Core i7 or i9 processor. The higher the number, the better the performance. If you&rsquo;re strapped for cash, an Intel Core i5 processor is plenty fast for basic coding needs and everyday tasks like web surfing. A single core processor is perfectly suitable for amateur programmers, but if you&rsquo;re a software developer, you may need a little more oomph, so we&rsquo;d suggest looking at ones with multiple cores. As for AMD processors, the Ryzen 3 and 5 are both functional and easy on the wallet. If you need more power, go for a Ryzen 7 or 9.</li><li><strong>GPU: </strong>A GPU isn&rsquo;t really necessary for most programming tasks, as it&rsquo;s mostly used for playing games or editing videos. However, if you&rsquo;re a video game developer, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to have either an Nvidia GeForce GTX or RTX, or their AMD Radeon equivalents. </li><li><strong>RAM</strong>: In order to achieve fast build times, you&rsquo;ll need an ample amount of RAM to keep things zippy. 16GB is the minimum, but 32GB is better, especially if you&rsquo;re doing a lot of multitasking and have many applications open at once.</li><li><strong>Storage: </strong>The amount of storage you need depends on the size of your project. 256GB is the bare minimum and likely the best fit for smaller projects. If you program video games, for example, we&rsquo;d recommend bumping it up to 512GB or 1TB. That&rsquo;s because video games mainly consist of high-quality graphics, sound files, and so on. </li><li><strong>Display size:</strong> If you&rsquo;re someone who commutes into the office everyday, a 13- or 14-inch display is the best in terms of portability and value, but bigger screens may cause less stress on your eyes during intense programming sessions. </li><li><strong>Resolution</strong>: Along those lines, if you&rsquo;re a programmer, you probably spend hours in front of a screen, so eye strain is likely a real problem. That&rsquo;s why you shouldn&rsquo;t go for anything less than 1080p. 1080p produces a picture that&rsquo;s sharp enough for coding, researching, and so on. If you want a crystal clear image and can stretch your budget, go for a 4K resolution display.</li><li><strong>Battery life:</strong> If you plan on taking your laptop anywhere with you, aim for something that can last 10 to 12 hours on a single charge. That&rsquo;s more than a full work day. Obviously, more is always better. Just know that the bigger the battery, the heavier the laptop. Read our round-up of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1915376/best-laptop-usb-c-pd-chargers.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">best laptop chargers</a>.</li><li><strong>Ports</strong>: A wide array of ports is always a plus, as it eliminates the need for an adapter. We&rsquo;d recommend a laptop that has both USB-C and USB-A. An HDMI port is good, too. This is useful for hooking up to an external monitor.</li></ul>

<p>Today, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ir.logitech.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/Logitech-Partners-with-iFixit-to-Advance-Circularity-Goals/default.aspx&amp;xcust=2-1-1920726-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Logitech announced a new partnership with iFixit</a>, a company that helps folks fix their broken devices. This partnership means that you can now extend the life of certain Logitech mice models and reduce unnecessary e-waste. Win-win!</p>



<p>Replacement parts and batteries for specific Logitech products will be available to buy on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/logitech&amp;xcust=2-1-1920726-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">iFixit Logitech Repair Hub</a>. As of right now, iFixit is only supporting the Logitech MX Master and Logitech MX Anywhere mice with replacement parts, likely due to their massive popularity. Logitech&rsquo;s official announcement post suggests there will be more coming in the future, however, and iFixit&rsquo;s Logitech hub already includes repair guides and stubs for dozens of different products, from headsets to webcams to speakers. </p>



<p>The Repair Hub is chock-full of robust information, which is how it&rsquo;s supposed to be. From <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Logitech+H800+Wireless+Headset+Battery+Replacement/145756&amp;xcust=2-1-1920726-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">battery repair guides</a> to loads of support questions, it&rsquo;s definitely the place to go for replacement parts and repair tools. iFixit has even worked with Google, Samsung, and Valve. Working with Logitech is the next step, a logical move for the DIY company. The two companies also share a goal of tackling the e-waste crisis, as electronic devices are often being disposed of instead of repaired or updated.  </p>



<p>There&rsquo;s nothing cooler than fixing up your own gear. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m such a big fan of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1669299/new-framework-laptops-coming-in-ryzen-and-16-inch-flavors.html">Framework laptops</a>, which encourage you to tinker to your heart&rsquo;s content. I&rsquo;ve always been a big believer in self-autonomy where tech is concerned. I love the idea of repairing your own gaming accessory or peripheral, as there&rsquo;s nothing more powerful than the power of choice.</p>



<p>Replacement parts for the Logitech MX Master and Logitech MX Anywhere mice will be available summer 2023. </p>

## Google will start deleting inactive accounts: Gmail, Docs, YouTube at risk
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1919355/google-delete-inactive-accounts-gmail-youtube-docs.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1919355/google-delete-inactive-accounts-gmail-youtube-docs.html)

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Your dormant Gmail accounts could get wiped later this year if you haven&rsquo;t logged in for a while&mdash;or interacted with any other of Google&rsquo;s services while logged in. A new update to Google&rsquo;s policy on inactive personal accounts now puts them on the chopping block after two years, a move that Google says is for better security.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/updating-our-inactive-account-policies/&amp;xcust=2-3-1919355-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">to a blog post</a>, Google reserves the right to delete the entirety of the fallow account, including your Gmail, Drive, YouTube, and Photos content. The purges will begin in December 2023, with ample notice to be provided in advance. Users will receive multiple email notifications to their Gmail address as well as the recovery email address on file (if one exists). Deletions will also happen in waves. The first batch will be accounts that were created and then never used again.</p>



<p>To avoid losing an account to inactivity, most people will need to either sign into the account or use one of Google&rsquo;s services. The actions can be small&mdash;reading an email, watching a YouTube video, and using Google search (among other activities) is sufficient. However, if the account has an ongoing subscription to Google One, an app, or a publication, it&rsquo;s automatically safe from deletion. Being signed into an Android device is also enough to avoid the chopping block, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://9to5google.com/2023/05/16/google-account-delete/&amp;xcust=2-3-1919355-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">according to 9to5Google</a>, though how active that device must be is unclear. (We&rsquo;ve asked Google for further clarification and will update the story with any additional details.)</p>



<p>Google says clearing its servers of unused accounts will better protect users, as most idle accounts may be only guarded by weak or compromised passwords. The company says inactive accounts often lack two-factor authentication, too. Breached accounts can end up being used to perpetrate identity theft or simply make the internet a worse place (e.g., send out spam). If you find yourself reactivating your old Google accounts, it might be a good time to also strengthen your password (and add that to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">your password manager</a>) and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1376010/how-to-use-two-factor-authentication-to-lock-down-your-accounts-the-right-way.html">enable 2FA</a>.</p>



<p>Should you forget about an account and it gets stricken from the rolls, you can breathe easy about someone impersonating you. 9to5Google also reports that account names will not be recycled&mdash;no one else will be able to use them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not too often we see a gaming laptop with an Nvidia RTX graphics card go on sale for under $1,000. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re turning the spotlight on the <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-14-fhd-144hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-16gb-ddr4-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-512gb-pcie-ssd-moonlight-white%2F6494633.p%3FskuId%3D6494633&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Asus ROG Zephyrus, which is currently on sale for $899.99 at Best Buy</a>. That&rsquo;s a savings of $500, which is plain ridiculous. Not only does this machine come loaded with an RTX 3060 GPU, but the slim design makes it an excellent traveling companion. As far as gaming laptops go, it really tics off a bunch of boxes.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve reviewed two versions of the ROG Zephyrus in the past, consistently praising the compact design and powerful CPU and GPU performance. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/617171/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-2022-review.html">most recent G14 we examined</a> earned 4.5 stars (out of 5) and our rare Editor&rsquo;s Choice award. Although the Zephyrus we reviewed is a different version of the one on sale today, we can confidently say that these laptops are truly phenomenal, especially if you value power and portability.</p>



<p>The ROG Zephyrus that&rsquo;s on sale is packing an AMD Ryzen 7 5800HS CPU, an Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. That&rsquo;s more than enough oomph for playing most modern games on the High or Ultra graphics preset. The 14-inch display has a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and a refresh rate of 144Hz. The laptop itself also weighs just 3.53 pounds, which is ideal for those who prefer to game on-the-go. Plus, the moonlight white color scheme is drop-dead gorgeous and a real head turner.</p>



<p>This is a killer deal. Get it now.</p>

## Steam’s new 90-minute trials are better than refunds

<p>It&rsquo;s been eight years since Steam introduced the ability to refund purchased games, a much-needed option for the de facto standard storefront of PC gaming. Users can get their money back, no questions asked, so long as they&rsquo;ve had the game for less than two weeks and played for less than two hours. But the system is awkward, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560810/how-to-refund-a-game-on-steam.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">requiring a dive into the support menu</a> and the approval of a Steam employee. There&rsquo;s a better and more straightforward option on the horizon, and it quietly became available yesterday. </p>



<p>The new feature is called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/&amp;xcust=2-1-1920575-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Timed Trial</a>, essentially a 90-minute demo of a full game. The first title to offer a Timed Trial is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/&amp;xcust=2-1-1920575-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EA&rsquo;s remade</a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/&amp;xcust=2-1-1920575-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/&amp;xcust=2-1-1920575-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">version of <em>Dead Space</em></a>. Users can click &ldquo;Play Now,&rdquo; download the full game, and play for an hour and a half without having to buy anything&hellip;and without needing to wait for Steam to review your request for a refund, or for a refund to hit your PayPal account. It&rsquo;s a more streamlined way to do things, and frankly it&rsquo;s long overdue. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dead space free trial on Steam" class="wp-image-1920655" height="698" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dead-space-trial.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="999" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Valve</p></div>



<p>Steam doesn&rsquo;t appear to be adjusting its existing refund policy, at least for the moment, and nothing is stopping developers from offering stand-alone demos if the first 90 minutes of a game isn&rsquo;t a great fit for a preview. (Some games like <em>Final Fantasy </em>or <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> would barely get through the opening cutscenes in that time limit.) At the time of writing, <em>Dead Space </em>is the only game that uses the new feature, spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-demo-timed-refund-pc-purchase-ea-dead-space-1850443748&amp;xcust=2-1-1920575-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a> &mdash; presumably Valve is working with publishers and developers to expand it more widely since this feature is part of Steam itself. </p>



<p>What&rsquo;s spurred on this change in the long-running status quo? My gut says Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft&rsquo;s buffet-style subscription service is still the best deal around for PC gamers (especially if you <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397667/get-3-years-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-tip.html">use this trick to get it cheap</a>), and it lets them sample a wide variety of titles with little to no commitment. PlayStation Plus has a similar feel, though it&rsquo;s less focused on offering brand new titles. Getting rid of the need to spend extra money on a game you&rsquo;re only kinda-sorta sure you want, and removing the annoying process of applying for a refund, is a win-win for Steam. </p>

## Asus Azoth keyboard review: Crazy customization ruined by software

<p>Keyboards are getting ridiculously expensive, and gaming keyboards doubly so. Roccat wants $230 for its best keyboard because it&rsquo;s really, really shiny. Corsair&rsquo;s is $280, because it&rsquo;s thin.&nbsp; Razer&rsquo;s most expensive model is $250, because it&rsquo;s Razer. Asus wants the same for the ROG Azoth&hellip;but might actually be able to justify it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See, the Azoth is indeed a gaming keyboard, but it&rsquo;s also a mechanical enthusiast keyboard. It&rsquo;s packing all the high-end features like a rotary wheel, pre-lubed switches, PBT keycaps, built-in case foam. And on top of that it also has some serious gaming chops, including a somewhat bodacious built-in OLED screen. I haven&rsquo;t seen one of those since before mechanical keyboards became the norm.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Is it worth it? Well, yes&hellip;if you&rsquo;re in the very specific niche of wanting <em>both </em>an enthusiast-grade mechanical keyboard <em>and </em>a high-end wireless gaming keyboard.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Is it worth it? Well, yes&hellip;if you&rsquo;re in the very specific niche of wanting <em>both </em>an enthusiast-grade mechanical keyboard <em>and </em>a high-end wireless gaming keyboard. It&rsquo;s also a pretty great starting point if you want to dive into the deep end of the mechanical keyboard customizing scene. But some of its signature features&mdash;the screen and three-way knob in particular&mdash;are let-downs. And the terrible software actually manages to make otherwise good hardware materially worse.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="asus-azoth-features">Asus Azoth features</h2>



<p>For the sake of brevity, I&rsquo;m going to list out the features of the Azoth instead of describing them in prose. Because I ain&rsquo;t got all day, and neither do you.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>USB, 2.4GHz wireless, and triple-device Bluetooth connection</li><li>Popular 75% layout (only the right Shift key is non-standard)&nbsp;</li><li>High-quality PBT keycaps&nbsp;</li><li>Pre-lubed ROG NX switches and stabilizers&nbsp;</li><li>Hot-swap switch sockets&nbsp;</li><li>RGB lighting&nbsp;</li><li>OLED screen for controls, animations, and system info&nbsp;</li><li>Three-way control knob&nbsp;</li><li>Gasket mounting&nbsp;</li><li>Triple-layer interior case foam&nbsp;</li><li>Aluminum-polycarbonate body with dual-stage keyboard feet&nbsp;</li><li>Onboard memory and on-the-fly macro recording&nbsp;</li><li>Switch lubing kit included&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>That is a <em>lot </em>of keyboard features, even for the high $250 price tag. It covers more or less everything you could ever want out of both a high-end gaming keyboard and a high-end, pre-made mechanical keyboard, with the possible exception of oddballs like optical switches. &ldquo;Azoth,&rdquo; an ancient alchemical term for an end-all, be-all cure, an &ldquo;endgame&rdquo; medicine if you will, is appropriate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I honestly can&rsquo;t decide what&rsquo;s the more outlandish feature: an OLED screen (previously seen years ago on devices like the Logitech G19, or in a more recent modular form in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BNDHDCT/?th=1&amp;xcust=2-2-1915729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Corsair&rsquo;s iCue Nexus</a>) or a built-in station that helps you disassemble and lube your switches. And yes, the kit includes lube and a brush.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="what-is-the-screen-on-the-asus-azoth-for">What is the screen on the Asus Azoth for? </h2>



<p>Let&rsquo;s focus on that screen, since it&rsquo;s the most obvious standout feature. It&rsquo;s about two inches diagonal, black and white only&mdash;because color would just be ridiculous, right?&mdash;and paired with what Asus calls a &ldquo;control knob&rdquo; sitting on the right side of the board. This includes a little toggle that can also click in, in addition to a big, round side button. It is NOT a wheel, though it&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;d expect a wheel to be on a keyboard like this.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Azoth OLED screen" class="wp-image-1915760" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC01855.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The screen switches between pre-programmed functions with a press of the big side button, at which point the toggle does different things. Pressing the button will cycle through volume adjustment, multimedia controls, lighting brightness, OLED screen brightness, and the keyboard&rsquo;s RGB lighting effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;Hey, there&rsquo;s nothing in there that I can&rsquo;t control with standard function keys.&rdquo; In which case, you&rsquo;re right! But on top of a new and more visual way to control all those functions, when not in active use the OLED screen can display system info like your CPU and GPU temperatures, show a music equalizer, a bit of custom scrolling text, or in its most superfluous mode, a pre-made or custom animation. These are, basically, screen savers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frankly, I found the screen an extremely superfluous addition to the keyboard. The only real benefit is a constant readout of system information, which can just as easily be shown in-game overlays on the monitor&mdash;you know, that thing your eyes are <em>already looking at</em>.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Azoth control knob" class="wp-image-1915767" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC01887b.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>But I&rsquo;d be able to ignore this, if it weren&rsquo;t for the knob. See, in going with a toggle with a click-in function (kind of like a thumbstick on a modern game controller), Asus has almost literally re-invented the rotary wheel. That click-in function&mdash;which defaults to a mute button in my preferred volume setting&mdash;is extremely finicky, and I often found myself pressing it while trying to raise or lower the volume. Ergonomically, it&rsquo;s a step backwards from the more common wheel design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Towards the end of my testing period, I found myself going to my custom-bound mouse controls, holding down a thumb button and using the mouse scroll wheel, to change my volume. Let me repeat that: I went to a sub-function of <em>mouse controls </em>rather than the dedicated knob that&rsquo;s supposed to make this function easier. That&rsquo;s a big L in terms of usability. So the most unique aspects of this keyboard&rsquo;s physical design, the screen and the knob, are superfluous at best and actively detrimental at worst. </p>



<h2 id="how-is-the-asus-azoth-as-a-mechanical-board">How is the Asus Azoth as a mechanical board?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, the Azoth ticks pretty much every single box in the premium boutique mechanical keyboard checklist. Our review unit came with Asus&rsquo; custom NX Brown switches, which are indeed a fair bit smoother than ordinary tactile Browns, presumably owing to being lubed from the factory.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Azoth control and USB dongle" class="wp-image-1915757" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC01971.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The triple-layered interior foam is impressive&mdash;even more than you usually get with premium designs&mdash;though somewhat wasted with tactile switches. If you want a &ldquo;silent&rdquo; build this is a great place to start, just swap out the switches for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WLYLR9Q?th=1&amp;xcust=2-2-1915729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">something with some sound damping</a> and you&rsquo;ll have it about as quiet as it can get. The stabilizers are pre-lubed as well for some nice, smooth travel, and even the space beneath the space bar has some extra-generous foam.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Azoth space bar foam" class="wp-image-1915765" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC01837.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Stylistically, I&rsquo;m not in love with the board. The PBT keycaps feel nice, a very rough texture that&rsquo;s great for typing. But the legends are very hard to spot when the backlight isn&rsquo;t on, and the white printing on the numerical and function keys clashes with the all-black gamer look. The case has a lot of extraneous geometry, very in keeping with the ROG theme, but I like the easy-to-find power mode switch and handy USB dongle both on the top side. Both are great choices for a board that makes a good traveling companion. It&rsquo;s definitely chunky and heavy, but less than it might have been thanks to a plastic bottom.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Azoth switches and sockets" class="wp-image-1915761" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC01822.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>In terms of typing, I found no faults. The customized switches and gasket mounting give it a premium feel with medium give. And if you didn&rsquo;t understand that sentence, that&rsquo;s fine, please indulge me in my keyboard nerddom: It&rsquo;s nice. But you&rsquo;ll have to forgive me again, because Asus include a whole extra set of tools on top of the usual keycap and switch puller&mdash;a bona fide switch lubing station.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="asus-azoth-switch-lubing-kit">Asus Azoth switch lubing kit</h2>



<p>For the uninitiated, it&rsquo;s possible to (very carefully and slowly) disassemble all the plastic parts in a keyboard switch and lube them up to make them feel even more smooth, optionally replacing bits like the stem or the spring from other switches. For those with the time, money, and saintly patience, this creates an incredibly custom experience. It&rsquo;s the keyboard equivalent of custom-tuning your car. And even as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479939/i-got-tired-of-waiting-for-a-wireless-gaming-pc-keypad-so-i-made-my-own.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a self-avowed mechanical keyboard nut</a> who&rsquo;s built several of his own by hand, I admit I&rsquo;ve never gone this far.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Azoth switch lube station" class="wp-image-1915762" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC02035.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The lubing station consists of a plastic brace to hold your switch, a grabber tool to help you pull it apart and put it back together, a tray on which to rest your disassembled switches, a brush, and a small bit of lube in a tube. It should be noted again here that all the switches that come with the board and even the stabilizers (those extra bits under the long keycaps) are pre-lubed, so if you stick with the Asus switches, you won&rsquo;t need to mess with any of this for six months to a year.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Azoth disassembled switch" class="wp-image-1915756" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC02061.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>And you won&rsquo;t <em>need </em>to do so after that either, because lubing switches is something that only the most obsessive keyboard nerds do. But seen as an inclusion for a set that&rsquo;s meant as an entry point for ultimate customization, it&rsquo;s a nice bonus. Perhaps not so nice that I would have paid extra for it, but I really doubt that&rsquo;s the case here&mdash;if anything&rsquo;s pushing the price up it&rsquo;s that screen.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="how-is-the-asus-azoth-software">How is the Asus Azoth software?</h2>



<p>So we&rsquo;ve established that the Azoth is impressive as a boutique-grade mechanical board. How is it for gaming? Again, pretty darn good. The tactile switches that came with our review unit aren&rsquo;t ideal for fast-paced gameplay, but they&rsquo;re so smooth that I really didn&rsquo;t mind. The 2.4GHz connection and 1,000Hz polling rate are ideal for a wireless board, the battery lasts a week with the lights on and about a U.S. election cycle with the lights off. All pretty great.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is one huge downside for the Azoth, and it applies to both typing enthusiasts and gamers. It&rsquo;s Asus Armoury Crate, the management and driver program. Normally I find even the worst of these are at least easy to ignore once you&rsquo;ve set up your settings the first time, but that OLED screen required a bit more testing and tweaking. And incidentally, it&rsquo;s probably why it was impossible to use something universal like VIA or QMK, as less gamer-focused boards do.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Armoury Crate keyboard settings" class="wp-image-1915789" height="649" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/crate-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>And Armoury Crate is, in no uncertain terms, crap. I never managed to open the damn program without at least a minute of waiting. Whenever I did, it wanted to update my motherboard (also from Asus, and you wonder why I haven&rsquo;t installed its Windows driver program?).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just finding the part of the program that actually manages the keyboard is a pain, because this thing is also trying to serve up ads for different Asus hardware, create system-wide app-based performance profiles, set Asus-brand desktop wallpaper, launch games from different PC game stores (in multiple tabs, for some reason), and <em>sell me games in those stores!&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Asus, what the absolute hell?<em> </em>You know you&rsquo;re making devices for PC gamers, right? PC gamers who hate software bloat that slows down their systems? Who do you think is going to a <em>driver program </em>looking to <em>buy new PC games?!&nbsp;</em></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Armoury Crate game store" class="wp-image-1915791" height="649" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/crate-game-store.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Once I managed to actually get into the part of this program that&rsquo;s designed to manage the keyboard itself, it&rsquo;s serviceable. Extremely slow and annoying, but serviceable, and it&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;re going to customize that screen and control knob. But good grief, this is the worst software I&rsquo;ve ever had to deal with for a PC peripheral, and it&rsquo;s actively discouraging me from trying other Asus hardware.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus Armoury Crate screen settings" class="wp-image-1915790" height="649" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/crate-oled.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Asus, strip all the unnecessary crap out of Armoury Crate at the earliest opportunity. Failing that, release a version that <em>only manages your hardware, </em>and doesn&rsquo;t try to do anything else to Windows. Or sell me stuff. Good freakin&rsquo; grief.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="is-the-asus-azoth-worth-it">Is the Asus Azoth worth it?</h2>



<p>Asus positions the ROG Azoth as both an entry point for those who want to get into the premium, customizable mechanical keyboard world, and an &ldquo;endgame&rdquo; for the same people, an end-all, be-all of mechanical keyboards.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Azoth keycap legends" class="wp-image-1915764" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC01941.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>It isn&rsquo;t that. Frankly, anyone who&rsquo;s that obsessed with keyboards is going to go to a group buy or build their own. And if you&rsquo;re just curious about this market, you&rsquo;re not ready to drop triple digits on a keyboard anyway&mdash;check out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801607/g-skill-km250-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the excellent and frugal G.Skill KM250</a>, and use the difference to buy some fun games. Or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YNYPX97/?th=1&amp;xcust=2-2-1915729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">maybe a lubing station</a> and some extra switches, if you&rsquo;re really all-in on the customization. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Asus Armoury Crate is actively hurting the hardware it&rsquo;s supposed to be enhancing.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>But as a $250 alternative to other super-premium keyboards that offer a lot less functionality, like Corsair&rsquo;s K100 Air, the Azoth is pretty good. Premium materials, a good layout, and nice extras like the lubing kit make this a decent middle ground between a premium keyboard for gamers and for obsessive tweakers. I could take or leave the fancy screen, and I&rsquo;d much rather have a regular dial &mdash; maybe a cheaper &ldquo;Azoth Lite&rdquo; model without the OLED and a more conventional dial would be a good idea.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Azoth and all included hardware" class="wp-image-1915759" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC02101.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s just a shame that an otherwise decent experience is ruined by such terrible software. And because of the nature of the screen and knob, you&rsquo;ll have no choice but to engage with them at least some of the time. Asus needs to fix Armoury Crate, or do away with it entirely and replace it with something smaller and less scatterbrained. It&rsquo;s actively hurting the hardware it&rsquo;s supposed to be enhancing.</p>

## How many websites are on the Internet?

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>The Internet is an ever-expanding virtual universe. With each passing second, millions of users across the globe interact, share, and create content on an astonishing number of websites. But have you ever stopped to wonder just how many websites exist?</p>



<p>The internet has come a long way since the days of <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techtarget.com%2Fsearchnetworking%2Fdefinition%2FARPANET&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=2-1-1804213-1-0-0" rel="nofollow">ARPANET</a> and the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://info.cern.ch/&amp;xcust=2-1-1804213-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">first website ever created</a>. Today, we rely on it for everything from communication and entertainment to education and commerce. This insatiable appetite for connectivity has led to an explosion in the number of websites worldwide.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-a-website">What is a website?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448961/build-your-first-website-without-coding-in-just-15-minutes.html">A website</a> is a collection of related web pages, multimedia content, and other digital assets hosted on a web server and can be accessed through the Internet. It&rsquo;s like a virtual book, where each web page is a separate page within that book.</p>



<p>Websites have unique addresses called URLs, which help users find and visit them. These websites are stored on computers called web servers, which deliver the content to a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) when someone requests it. Websites often serve a specific purpose, such as providing information, entertainment, or a platform for communication, and can be created using various web technologies.</p>



<h2 id="active-vs-inactive-websites">Active vs. inactive websites</h2>



<p>The distinction between active and inactive websites provides a clearer understanding of the actual size and scope of the online landscape. So when you consider how large the Internet actually is, also consider how many of those websites are just standing idly by.</p>



<p>Active websites are those that are regularly updated and maintained by their owners or administrators. These can be blogs, news sites, online stores, social media platforms, educational resources, and more. Active websites often see frequent user engagement, like visits, clicks, comments, and shares. They also tend to rank higher in search engine results due to their updated content, better SEO, and regular user activity.</p>



<p>Inactive websites are those that haven&rsquo;t been updated or maintained for an extended period. These websites may have outdated or irrelevant content, broken links, or limited user interaction. In some cases, the website owner may have abandoned the site, or the domain registration may have expired, meaning that you can&rsquo;t even access the website. Inactive websites can also include parked domains, which is like buying a piece of property and not doing anything with it.</p>



<p>When you think of the total number of websites on the Internet, you should consider the number of active websites as a more meaningful metric. Active websites provide a better representation of the current state of the Internet and its dynamic landscape. Inactive websites contribute to the overall count but aren&rsquo;t usually relevant or useful to users.</p>



<h2 id="the-challenges-in-counting-websites-accurately">The challenges in counting websites accurately</h2>



<p>Counting the number of websites accurately presents several challenges due to how rapidly changing the Internet is by nature. One of the many difficulties lies in defining what a website is to begin with. Are subdomains considered websites? What about single-page sites? What&rsquo;s the criteria?</p>



<p>Another challenge is the constant flux of websites being created and deleted. New websites are launched every day, while others become inactive, are taken down, or have their domain registrations expire. This constant churn makes it difficult to keep an up-to-date count of websites at any given moment.</p>



<p>To make things even more complicated, there&rsquo;s also the presence of the deep web and the dark web to consider. The deep web consists of content not indexed by standard search engines, such as private databases and intranets. The dark web, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/447091/meet-darknet-the-hidden-anonymous-underbelly-of-the-searchable-web.html">a subset of the deep web</a>, contains websites and content that require specific software or authorization to access. These hidden portions of the Internet make it challenging to account for all existing websites.</p>



<p>The prevalence of parked domains and inactive websites also adds complexity to counting websites. Differentiating between active and inactive websites and determining their relevance to the total website isn&rsquo;t easy.</p>



<p>Given these challenges, the total number of websites on the internet can only be estimated, and these estimates are subject to continuous change.</p>



<h2 id="so-how-many-websites-are-there">So, how many websites are there?</h2>



<p>The number of websites on the Internet is constantly changing as new websites are created and old ones become inactive. The best we can do is guess, and that number can change in an instant.</p>



<p>Most publications that try to answer this question cite Siteefy as an authoritative source. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://siteefy.com/how-many-websites-are-there/&amp;xcust=2-1-1804213-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">According to Siteefy</a>, there are 1.13 billion websites on the Internet, 18% of which are active. That means there are roughly 200 million active websites at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Keep in mind though that if we were to have an exact number of websites that are on the Internet as we write this piece, that number would be wrong by the time it gets published. It&rsquo;s estimated that 10,500 new websites are created every hour, and there&rsquo;s no telling how many become inactive.</p>



<p>The digital landscape is in a constant state of flux.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best charger is the one that shipped with your laptop&rdquo; is old advice that needs updating because there are often superior options available either as your principal laptop charger, as a spare, or as a flexible travel charger.</p>



<p>You know that the charger that came with your laptop will work, but it won&rsquo;t do much else and there are third-party USB-C chargers available that do much more.</p>



<p>Some laptops still ship with their own cumbersome AC power brick and barrel-shaped DC connector, but most premium laptops today also or solely charge via USB-C&mdash;including all the models in our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">the best laptops</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Laptop chargers Power Brick vs USB-C charger" class="wp-image-1915490" height="550" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Laptop-Power-brick-vs-USB-C-charger.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<p>USB-C chargers are smaller and more convenient than proprietary chargers, and will work with multiple and varied devices, making them a more flexible, more portable solution.</p>



<p>Thunderbolt ports on laptops are compatible with&mdash;and look identical to&mdash;USB-C, the reversible connector that is fast replacing the rectangular USB-A standard. </p>



<p>Of course, not every laptop with a USB-C port can be charged with a USB-C charger. The determining factor is support for USB Power Delivery. Assuming that your laptop supports charging via USB-C, the following are the best USB-C PD chargers you can pair with your device. </p>



<p>You can learn more about what to look for in a USB-C charger and how we test them below our recommendations.</p>

<p>If you are used to a standard laptop charger with proprietary power brick, plug, and cable, or even an older USB charger, you&rsquo;ll be stunned at the ultra-compact size and super-light weight of most GaN USB-C chargers&mdash;and this GaN 2 charger is the smallest we have tested.</p>

<p>You can use it to charge your phone or tablet, too&mdash;at 45W it supports Samsung Super Fast Charging and Apple Fast Charge&mdash;but not at the same time as your laptop, as it has just the one port and only 45W to share.</p>

<p>The only problem you might have is losing it&mdash;it&rsquo;s that small.</p>

<p>The U.S./CA model of the Anker 713 Nano II features foldable plug prongs for extra portability. The UK model is therefore a little larger, but still almost unbelievably tiny. UK buyers instead might prefer the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://uk.ugreen.com/collections/charger/products/90399&amp;xcust=2-2-1915376-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ugreen Foldable 45W Nexode GaN Dual USB C Charger</a> that does have foldable plug pins and boasts two ports.</p>

<p>This 65W charger is a little larger than its 45W sibling above, but the GaN 2 Anker 715 is still pocket-sized and can power up larger laptops or fast-charge compatible phones.</p>

<p>Its plug prongs fold back, making it ultra-portable for a 65W charger.</p>

<p>If, however, you want to charge more than one device at the same time, look for a charger with more than one USB port.</p>

<p><strong>Dimensions (W,H,D):</strong>&nbsp; 1.22 x 1.57 x 2.6in (3.1 x 4 x 6.6cm)</p>

<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 4.6oz (130g)</p>

<p>Ports: 2x USB-C (65W PD), 1x USB-C (18W PD), and 1x USB-A (22.5W)</p>

<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Gray/Black</p>

<p><strong>Cable included:</strong> No</p>

<p>Ugreen&rsquo;s Nexode 65W is larger than the Anker 715 Nano II but boasts three ports so you can charge multiple devices at the same time, using just one compact charger.</p>

<p>The two USB-C ports each support 65W, and the lower USB-A port can charge at up to 22.5W&mdash;powerful enough to fast-charge most phones&mdash;but note that maximum simultaneous output is 65W.</p>

<p>Other same-time charging options include 45W for a laptop and 20W for a second device, or 45W plus two 8.5W outputs.</p>

<p>The Nexode 65W is not available in the UK, where we instead recommend the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09VZKPX1X&amp;xcust=2-2-1915376-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Anker 735 Nano II</a> in the 65W three-port wall charger category. The two chargers are very similar in terms of charging functionality.</p>

<p>If you want one more port, the four-port <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Charging-MacBook-Nintendo/dp/B088FHJLR1&amp;xcust=2-2-1915376-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">UGreen 65W 3C1A</a> is bigger at 1.3 x 2.56 x 2.56in (3.3 x 6.5 x 6.5cm) but that extra port might be just right for your needs: two of the USB-C ports support 65W, and one is curiously low at 18W, but that&rsquo;s enough for most phones and mid-sized tablets. The USB-A port can Quick Charge and handle up to 22.5W.</p>

<p>Larger laptops usually require more power than 65W and ship with a 100W charger. For a spare, the single-port Nekteck 100W Charger is a budget winner&mdash;especially as it ships with a 2m 100W USB-C cable.</p>

<p>But we think multiple ports are worth spending that extra cash on.</p>

<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 8.3oz (235g)</p>

<p><strong>Ports:</strong> 2x USB-C (100W PD), 1x USB-C (22.5W), and 1x USB-A (22.5W)</p>

<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Gray</p>

<p><strong>Cable included:</strong> No</p>

<p>It might be larger and twice as heavy as the single-port chargers, but you can&rsquo;t argue with four ports with multiple charging options, such as simultaneous 65W for laptop charging and 30W PD for light-laptop powering, plus lower outputs for phones and other devices.</p>

<p>Using three ports you could charge at 45W, 30W, and 22.5W at the same time. Using all four, it can support laptop power delivery at 45W and 30W plus two devices each at 10.5W.</p>

<p>The inclusion of an old-style USB-A port will please owners of that type of cable&mdash;probably for older phones or other gadgets.</p>

<p>And its foldable prongs (North American model) win extra portability points on a larger charger. The barrel-shaped UK model looks quite different, but offers the same ports. </p>

<p>For larger laptops with higher battery capacity, a USB PD 3.1 charger is essential if you want to charge or fast-charge at 140W or higher.</p>

<p>While it has just the one port, the Anker 717 goes further at 140W than most wall chargers. Pair it with Anker&rsquo;s own <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-MacBook-Samsung-Galaxy/dp/B09R49W6R7?th=1&amp;xcust=2-2-1915376-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">765 140W USB-C to USB-C Cable</a> in either 3-foot or 6-foot lengths.</p>

<p>Again, we applaud the foldable prongs for added portability.</p>

<p><strong>Dimensions (W,H,D):</strong>&nbsp; 1.37 x 2.99 x 2.99in (3.5 x 7.6 x 7.6cm)</p>

<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 10.4oz (295g)</p>

<p><strong>Ports:</strong> 1x USB-C (140W PD 3.1), 1x USB-C (100W), 1x USB-A (22.5W)</p>

<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Gray</p>

<p><strong>Cable included:</strong> 1.5m 240W USB-C cable</p>

<p>This is the first multiport 140W charger (PD 3.1) we&rsquo;ve tested, and it is barely larger than the single-port Anker 717 charger.</p>

<p>The bottom USB-C port is rated at 140W, and above it is another 100W USB-C port, with a 22.5W USB-A port at the top.</p>

<p>There are multiple charging options: Any one of the above-mentioned ports, two 65W laptops simultaneously, or 45W+65W+22.5W charging at the same time.</p>

<p>The Nexode 140W Charger ships with a 1.5m USB-C cable, although this is rated at 100W rather than 140W. It has foldable plug prongs in the North American version&mdash;UK users will have to put up with the plug always extended.</p>

<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Gray</p>

<p><strong>Cable included:</strong> 1.5m AC power cable</p>

<p>Boasting six USB-C ports, this desktop charger plugs into a power socket via cable rather than directly as a USB-C wall charger does.</p>

<p>Its total output is 200W across the six USB-C ports, but its special bonus are the two 140W PD 3.1 ports for fast-charging larger laptops.</p>

<p>Each of the remaining 100W ports is USB-C so you&rsquo;ll need an adapter to use a USB-A charging cable if your device demands it.</p>

<p>With all ports in action it follows a port hierarchy of 65W/45W/20W/20W/20W/20W.</p>

<p>As a desktop charger, it comes with a power cable but you&rsquo;ll need to add your own USB-C cables&mdash;and remember you&rsquo;ll need a PD 3.1 charging cable to take advantage of the 140W port.</p>

<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Gray</p>

<p><strong>Cable included:</strong> 2m AC power cable and 1m 100W USB-C cable</p>

<p>This desktop charger lacks the PD 3.1 support that is essential for higher-than-100W charging, so if you&rsquo;re looking for 140W large-laptop fast-charging you&rsquo;d do better choosing the Satechi 200W USB-C 6-port PD GaN Charger, reviewed above.</p>

<p>That said, the GaN 2 Ugreen Nexode 200W 6-Port desktop charger includes two USB-A ports for devices that require the older USB connector.</p>

<p>With all six ports in action, you could charge one laptop at 65W, two at 45W, fast-charge a phone at 20W, and have the two USB-A ports share 20W of power&mdash;enough for most busy working desks.</p>

<p>This compact dual-100W USB-C PD port wall charger also includes two 15W USB-A ports, but its special sauce is its 7A AC universal power outlet that fits plugs used in over 200 countries&mdash;the same way its extendable US/UK/AU/EU plug prongs fit foreign power sockets. This AC power outlet isn&rsquo;t found on other portable wall chargers. It&rsquo;s a great mix of laptop- and device-charging ports plus travel plug adapter in one compact GaN unit that should keep your airplane carry-on luggage light.</p>

<p>You can charge your laptop on the move while in your car, using a dedicated charger that comes with a jack compatible with the car cigarette socket. In time, this seemingly antiquated in-car tool might be better known as the charger socket.</p>

<p>We like this car laptop charger from Ugreen as it has 100W and 30W USB-C ports that mean you can charge a laptop and fast-charge a phone at the same time. Plus, there&rsquo;s a USB-A port with decent power potential (22.5W). </p>

<p>Remember that when the car&rsquo;s engine isn&rsquo;t running, all electrical systems receive power from the battery, which will drain if you charge a laptop overnight&mdash;just as it will if you leave the headlights on. Charging your laptop when the car is in motion doesn&rsquo;t drain the vehicle battery.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-usb-c-pd-charger">What to look for in a USB-C PD charger</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, the primary requirement is that your laptop includes a USB-C port that can carry power as well as data. Older laptops that came with their own power brick might have data-only USB-C but not power-supporting USB-C.</p>



<p>USB-C laptop chargers use a certified technology called USB Power Delivery (USB PD), a specification that enables power delivery along with data over a single cable.</p>



<p>All the chargers tested here are certified by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), and are from reliable, trusted brands&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find cheaper, less-well-known brands online but for safety&rsquo;s sake we recommend you chose a proven brand, such as Anker, Ugreen, Satechi, Belkin, Plugable or Aukey, as well as big brands such as HP, Dell, Google and Samsung that follow the latest safety standards.</p>



<p>Chargers can get hot, so you want to trust that yours won&rsquo;t catch fire or otherwise damage your laptop. That&rsquo;s why we avoid cheaper brands that we haven&rsquo;t heard of or tested.</p>



<p><strong>USB PD 3.0</strong> supports up to 100W of power to the laptop. <strong>USB PD 3.1</strong> can reach 240W, which is useful for larger laptops that require over 100W for charging at full speed while in use, and for fast-charging compatible laptops.</p>



<h3 id="wattage">Wattage</h3>



<p>Once you know that your laptop supports USB PD charging, the most important specification to look for when choosing a laptop charger is the amount of power it can supply to your laptop&mdash;measured in watts (W).</p>



<p>The wattage you should look for will depend on the maximum power draw of your laptop&mdash;that is, the draw when you are using a bunch of apps at the same time or pushing the graphics functions, not when you&rsquo;re just browsing the web or sending emails. This level of maximum power is what the manufacturer considers when it decides on the wattage of the charger it includes with the laptop.</p>



<p>When idle or doing mundane jobs that draw only a small amount of power from the charger, laptops can recharge fully on a lower-wattage charger&mdash;so a 45W charger can top up an idle 65W laptop but much slower than a 65W charger.</p>



<p>That said, when buying a new USB-C charger, buy at least the same wattage as the charger that shipped with your laptop.</p>



<p>Smaller laptops may require just a 30W or 45W charger, while medium laptops usually need 65W, and 100W is required for larger 15-inch and larger notebooks.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if your laptop requires just 45W and you fancy that 100W charger&mdash;using a higher-power charger won&rsquo;t harm your lower-powered laptop as it will regulate the power from the charger.</p>



<p>Using a higher-wattage charger than your laptop requires is recommended when choosing a charger with multiple ports, as the stated wattage is the maximum output, and charging other devices at the same time will start lowering the power going to the laptop.</p>



<p>For more charging questions answered, see our laptop charging FAQ at the end of this article.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="USB-C wall charger charging multiple devices" class="wp-image-1915541" height="927" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Charging-multiple-devices-USB-C.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>A charger with multiple ports can charge several gadgets at the same time, although remember that your laptop will be the hungriest for power and the charger will have a maximum output</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Ugreen</p></div>



<h3 id="multiple-ports-for-more-devices">Multiple ports for more devices</h3>



<p>Standard laptop chargers have just one USB-C port or connector, but many third-party USB-C chargers boast multiple ports&mdash;sometimes both USB-C and older USB-A.</p>



<p>These are useful if you want to charge more than just your laptop&mdash;with multiple ports on your charger, you can power up your phone, tablet, or headphones at the same time as your laptop.</p>



<p>If you want to use more than one charging port, consider your maximum requirement&mdash;say, 65W for the laptop and another 15W for a phone and maybe 5W for a smartwatch or headphones. A charger with a higher wattage can distribute the excess power to other connected devices at the same time as you power your laptop.</p>



<p>Multi-port chargers will have a variety of charging options between ports and devices.</p>



<h3 id="go-for-gan">Go for GaN</h3>



<p>Look for chargers built with modern Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology that runs cooler than older silicon tech, meaning that devices built with it can charge devices faster and with less heat dissipation than traditional chargers and are noticeably smaller, too.</p>



<p>Newer GaN 2 can operate at even higher voltages and temperatures.</p>



<p>Dimensions given in our reviews are for the U.S. models, which are also pictured for each product, but UK models are mostly also available. Due to their sturdy three-pin Type G plug, UK models are usually wider than their U.S. Type A and B plug counterparts.</p>



<h3 id="fast-charging">Fast charging&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Modern laptops support fast charging, where the battery can be pumped up to at least 50 percent capacity&mdash;sometimes greater&mdash;in around 30 minutes.</p>



<p>A laptop with fast-charging support is easier to keep close to a full charge. If the battery is fully drained, fast charging helps you get back to work fast, and you can quickly top up the battery when required&mdash;even just a few minutes of charging can save you when you don&rsquo;t have much time near a power socket.</p>

<h3 id="choose-the-right-charging-cable">Choose the right charging cable</h3>



<p>Some USB-C laptop chargers ship with a cable, but most don&rsquo;t. Make sure the cable you use supports power delivery, as some are for data-transfer only.</p>



<p>The wisest choices for USB PD cables are based on the latest Thunderbolt 4 or USB4 standards, which are both backwards compatible with Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C, and supports both charging and up to 40Gbps data transfer. But Thunderbolt/USB4 is more expensive and often available in shorter lengths than USB-C cables.</p>



<p>Look for a USB-C PD or Thunderbolt cable. If you want to charge at over 100W, this should support USB PD 3.1. Not all cables are marked as supporting 240W so make sure you check the PD rating before your purchase.</p>



<p>Plugable sells 240W-supporting PD 3.1 charging cables that it labels Extended Power Range (EPR) in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQ1Y4KQZ&amp;xcust=2-2-1915376-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">USB4 EPR</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPZYYMDC&amp;xcust=2-2-1915376-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Thunderbolt 4 EPR</a>&mdash;both are backwards compatible with USB-C. <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa8866%3Fvariant%3D41974289072278&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=2-2-1915376-1-0-0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Anker&rsquo;s 765 USB-C to USB-C Cable</a> also supports PD 3.1.</p>

<h3 id="wall-charger-or-desktop-charger">Wall charger or desktop charger</h3>



<p>A <strong>wall charger</strong> features plug prongs and connects directly into the wall power socket. Straight-to-socket wall chargers are small and portable&mdash;most will fit in your pocket. They might not have as many ports as a desktop charger but can still have several ports to choose from.</p>



<p>If you carry your charger around with you a lot, look for a wall charger that has foldable plug prongs, which makes it more comfortable and smaller. These are more common with U.S. Type A plugs than UK Type G plugs.</p>



<p>A <strong>desktop charger</strong> is separated from the socket by a power cable (usually detachable), with the charger instead sitting on your desk. Desktop chargers always feature multiple ports, and sometimes a separate power supply that will hide under the desk.</p>



<p>They are great for keeping your device-charging organized and in one neat package but are usually less portable than wall chargers.</p>



<p>There are also handy <strong>power strips</strong> with USB PD ports as well as extra sockets&mdash;useful in a home or office environment with few power sockets.</p>



<p>Another laptop-charging solution is to use a <strong>docking station</strong> or <strong>hub</strong>. These boast even more ports than a desktop charger, such as HDMI/DisplayPort, ethernet, and card readers.

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Probably. If your laptop supports USB PD (Power Delivery), you can charge it using a USB-C PD charger.</p>



<p>It has to be USB PD for charging, as some USB-C ports are data only.</p>



<p>If your laptop came with a USB-C port on its power adapter, then the answer is almost certainly yes, but you might want to check the product documentation or ask the manufacturer for clarification.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes. Power regulation means that it is safe to charge a 45W laptop with a 100W charger, for example. Laptops are designed to draw up to only a certain level of power when running at full speed.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Possibly. A more powerful charger&mdash;with a higher wattage than the charger that shipped with your laptop&mdash;might charge your laptop a little faster, but this is certainly not guaranteed.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes, but you should try not to. You can charge a 100W laptop with a 65W charger, for example, but it&rsquo;s not advisable as the laptop battery could drain faster than it is being charged, especially if in use at the time.</p>



<p>Charging an idle laptop should mean that its battery will be fully charged with a lower-wattage charger, but it will take much longer than with the correctly rated charger. As a one-off it should be fine, but we do not recommend it in the long term. Using a lower-rated charger could result in overheating, which is never a good thing with electronics.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes. When your laptop is idle or you are using only light apps such as email, it will be draining only a small amount of power from its battery, so it will charge faster. If you are using performance-hungry apps at the same time as charging, the charger will take longer to catch up as the laptop&rsquo;s battery is constantly draining while in use. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, you can use a laptop charger to charge your phone. Some chargers feature more than one port, and the lower wattage ports are perfect for phone charging&mdash;but you can also charge a phone with a 140W charging port if you want to, although it&rsquo;s safer for the phone if you use a lower-wattage port.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes. Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, and USB4 are backwards compatible with USB-C for data and charging.</p>



<p>Thunderbolt and USB4 also have higher data-transfer bandwidth&mdash;up to 40Gbps&mdash;than USB-C, which is rated between 5Gbps and 20Gbps.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes. Thunderbolt is backwards compatible with USB-C so a Thunderbolt cable can be used with a USB-C laptop or USB-C charger.</p>



<p>You still need to ensure that the Thunderbolt cable can handle the right amount of power you require. All Thunderbolt 3 or 4 and USB4 cables can handle 100W of power, but some support up to 240W.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-charge-my-laptop-to-100">Should I charge my laptop to 100%?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Only if you need to. If you are going on a road trip and need all the juice your laptop battery can supply, then by all means charge it to 100 percent before heading out.</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s easier on the battery if you keep it charged between 40 and 80 percent&mdash;no lower and no higher if you can.</p>



<p>Batteries charged to the full 100 percent might have only 300-500 discharge cycles, but batteries charged only up to 80 percent could get to nearly 4x that number of recharging cycles.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-fully-drain-my-laptop-battery-to-0">Should I fully drain my laptop battery to 0%?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>No. As with our advice not to fully charge a lithium-ion laptop battery too often, it&rsquo;s better for long-term battery life if you keep it charged between 40 and 80 percent.</p>
