The lasting influence of Diablo 2 created a subgenre of similar action-RPGs that all aim to recreate its satisfying gameplay loop with dungeon crawling, loot, and multiplayer features. However, it's definitely fair to say that some Diablo-likes are better than others.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now, with <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/diablo-4-preorder-guide/2900-4535/\">Diablo 4's launch on the horizon</a>, we've taken a stab at crowning the nine best games that offer that same gratifying experience in the Diablo-like action-RPG genre. From well-known contenders like the Torchlight series to lesser-known fare like Victor Vran, we've covered nearly all the games in this style that you'd ever want to play. While the excitement for Diablo 4\u2019s launch is high, the next time you feel that urge to grind, give one of these a try. You might be surprised how much you like it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Titan Quest</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4138609-titanquest.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>One of the oldest games on our list, Titan Quest doesn't quite belong to the first generation of Diablo-likes, but it's certainly not far behind them. It's an action-RPG with the familiar isometric perspective, though it trades Diablo's demonic milieu for an Ancient Greek setting. First conceptualized during the development of Age of Empires, Titan Quest has a throwback charm that will appeal to those who grew up with 2000s gaming, and its Anniversary Edition re-release from 2016 sands off some of its rough edges while keeping the experience authentic to the original. It's definitely not the best game on this list, but as far as solid ARPGs go, this is one worth considering.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/titan-quest-anniversary-edition\">See at Fanatical</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Torchlight series (especially Torchlight 2)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4138610-torchlight2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Torchlight games are some of the most renowned games in the Diablo-like genre, and that's for good reason. They combined the satisfying mob-killing action that made the series so enjoyable with a simpler approach that appeals to those who were scared away by the relatively complex builds and strategies required for the Diablo games. Torchlight 2 improved on every aspect of the original and is generally considered the peak of the series, though the new Torchlight Infinite is worth a look if you're interested in a version with a gacha system. Torchlight 2 also has a successful mod scene if you don't mind doing some research.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/store/search?sort=bestselling&amp;search=torchlight\">See at Humble</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Path of Exile</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4138611-pathofexile.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Sometimes described by fans as the true successor to Diablo 2, Path Of Exile is a free-to-play ARPG that presents itself as a hardcore alternative to others in the market. Developed by a team of Diablo fans who were frustrated by the lack of new games in the genre in the early 2010s, Path Of Exile appeals the most to players who value depth of content over all else, as the game has received ten years of regular updates from developer Grinding Gear Games. Currently, Path Of Exile 2 is in its beta stages, so if you're interested in trying out the original, it's a good time to take the plunge.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/\">Play on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Grim Dawn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4138617-grimdark3.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Created as a spiritual follow-up to Titan Quest, Grim Dawn is a cult ARPG that combines complex mechanics with deep build customization. Unlike most games in the genre, Grim Dawn doesn't have randomized enemy camps and dungeons, instead opting for a hand-designed approach. Players praise it for its replayability and variety of builds, while also noting substantial support from developer Crate Entertainment and a vibrant mod scene that continues to this day. If you missed it on its original release in 2016, it's worth a look.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-14555742?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.humblebundle.com/store/grim-dawn\">See at Humble</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Minecraft Dungeons</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4138612-minecraftdungeons.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>One of the newest games on our list, Minecraft Dungeons is a simple and fun take on the usual Diablo-like genre that can appeal to a wider audience. There's no complex build diagrams or multi-phase bosses requiring in-depth strategies here, just a lot of hacking, slashing, and watching the numbers go up. It's certainly one of the better-looking games on this list, as the voxel aesthetic of Minecraft stands out in the field, and its lighting is especially impressive. It's not a hardcore experience, but if you're looking for a grindfest that you can play with anybody, Minecraft Dungeons is very much in that ballpark.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1808562171629977682?u1=subid_value\">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Victor Vran</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4138613-victorvran.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>One of the more obscure ARPGs to come out in the 2010s, Victor Vran is a different kind of Diablo-like. Like Minecraft Dungeons, it doesn't require a build guide or hundreds of hours of grinding to reach the end, though it does have a substantial endgame with fancy loot. The game is also surprisingly hard on the higher difficulties, but not so much that it requires you to look up a guide online. If you're looking for a forever ARPG like the Diablo series or Path of Exile, Victor Vran isn't for you, but it's a great game to play with a friend over a weekend if you want to relax.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100770772-15232592?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.gog.com/en/game/victor_vran\">See at GOG</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Darksider Genesis</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4138614-darksidergenesis.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>A lesser-known spin-off of the Darksiders franchise, Genesis is an isometric hack-and-slash game with co-op support and tons of enemies to slay. It's less of an RPG than other games on this list, with fewer mechanics to explore, and not much in the way of proper builds. However, a lot of players feel that it's one of the best games in the franchise, perhaps even better than some of the mainline entries. Like Victor Vran, this is definitely an ARPG that is best picked up on sale for a weekend play with a friend, and it excels in that situation.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/darksiders-genesis\">See at Fanatical</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Warhammer: Chaosbane</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4138615-warhammerchaosbane.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Initially dismissed at launch by APRG fans due to a lack of content, Warhammer: Chaosbane has improved in the years since its 2019 launch into a pretty decent budget ARPG. Players praise its beautiful environments and simple but fun combat as major highlights, while also noting that its DLCs have added much more content to the game. As a whole, it's definitely worth picking up on a deep sale rather than its usual asking price of $30. If you have three friends who have squeezed everything out of Vermintide and have a hankering for a Diablo-like, give Chaosbane a try.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/warhammer-chaosbane\">See at Fanatical</a> </div></div><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1596/15969599/4138616-diablo2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Okay, yeah, perhaps you might consider this cheating. However, it would be silly to make a list of the best ARPG games without the game that popularized the genre to begin with. Even today, Diablo 2 is a really fun experience with deep builds, engaging combat, and a unique retro aesthetic that appeals even to new players. It's definitely not as newbie-friendly as some of the other games on this list, but the modernized Resurrected edition remasters all of the game's environments while letting you swap to the original visuals with a button press.

In terms of performance, it'll be similar to Revision Zero's Heavy Rounds two-burst mode, and damage output is being adjusted. The RPM is increasing from 257 to 300, and the first shot will do double the damage if it lands on the body or a critical spot. The second shot, which was where the bulk of Graviton Lance's base damage was focused, will now do around 30% less damage on body and critical spots. The gun is worth obtaining, especially for its Exotic perk and catalyst, which is excellent for crowd control.</p><p>Another legacy weapon in the spotlight is Sweet Business, which is getting a fun factor upgrade. From Season 21, it'll fire an explosive round on every 20th shot. Skyburner's Oath is being buffed to apply more scorch stacks to a target, and The Manticore is being tweaked to be more rewarding, mobile, and sustainable.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-cool-dubstep-gun-and-several-other-exotics-are-getting-an-upgrade-next-season/1100-6514292/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-cool-dubstep-gun-and-several-other-exotics-are-getting-an-upgrade-next-season/1100-6514292/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-17 19:28:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "At Long Last, Destiny 2 Will Let You Get A Better Look At Weapons And Ships", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Bungie seems to be on a roll with adding long-asked-for features to Destiny 2, with <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-way-you-get-destiny-2-exotic-armor-is-changing-for-the-better/1100-6512999/\">Exotic weapon focusing</a> coming soon, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fall-damage-will-no-longer-kill-you-in-destiny-2/1100-6513419/\">deaths from fall damage being removed</a> recently, and an in-game loadout system finally being introduced.

These days, you can find a great Resident Evil game on just about any modern platform, as well as on several virtual reality systems. VR naturally intensifies the terror of Resident Evil games, but it does have some limitations that can have an impact on Capcom's popular zombie-slaying franchise.</p><p>So is it worthwhile to play Resident Evil in VR? That's the question that GameSpot's Jean-Luc Seipke aims to answer in this week's episode of No HUD. By examing how these games handle VR, what makes them great, and what drawbacks they have, No HUD looks at how these mainline Resident Evil games can provide a more visceral experience, and how VR can elevate the experience.</p><p>Resident Evil VII: Biohazard is easily one of the more important games in the history of the franchise, as it helped usher in the Resident Evil renaissance. Made for VR first, it's a more intimate Resident Evil in which you explore the Baker Mansion, gaze upon some incredibly impressive--and gross--visual effects, and feel a new level of terror. It's just a pity that it's anchored to the original PlayStation VR, which isn't exactly the best system to play the game and robs it of some of its magic. Fortunately, the PC modding community has come to the rescue, which you can see more of in the video.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-is-worth-playing-in-vr-depending-on-how-far-youre-willing-to-go/1100-6514289/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-is-worth-playing-in-vr-depending-on-how-far-youre-willing-to-go/1100-6514289/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-17 18:32:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Amazon Reveals 4 New Echo Devices, And You Can Preorder Them Now", "description": "<p>Amazon has unveiled its upcoming slate of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b?&amp;node=9818047011&amp;ref=MARS_NAV_desktop_plswitcher_echo?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">new Echo devices</a> that it'll launch at the end of this month, and it runs the full gamut of Amazon's Alexa-focused brand.

Warzone introduced its second-chance system, the Gulag, Apex Legends has always starred hero characters with unique abilities, and Fortnite, well, you know Fortnite--it's the one with lightsabers and web-slinging.</p><p>For a long time, PUBG stayed true to itself as a gritty, slow-and-steady survival shooter that, I argue, boasts unrivaled tension even today. But more recently, PUBG has gotten more experimental and a bit looser with its realism in an apparent effort to bring popular mechanics from other battle royales into the genre's progenitor. Some maps now use a Gulag-like system to win back your right to carry on in a round, a particular backpack can protect you from Blue Zone damage for a limited time, and in the new <a href=\"https://pubg.com/en-na/news/6292?category=patch_notes\">23.2 patch</a>, players can now respawn allies at designated zones akin to Fortnite's Reboot Vans, Warzone's Buy Stations, or Apex Legends' Respawn Beacons.</p><p>Using the new Recall system, players can retrieve their fallen allies' Blue Chips, then bring them to one of several Blue Chip Towers around the map to revive them and get them back into action. Enemies can even steal the Blue Chips of other teams, but may then drop them once more if or when they're eliminated. Players can also find and use Blue Chip Transmitters, allowing them to revive teammates on the fly rather than needing to trek to a nearby tower. Like the game's Comeback system, the Blue Chip mechanics are limited to only some maps, meaning they haven't changed the meta of <em>all</em> of PUBG's many maps, just some of them.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-team-respawn-blue-chip-tower-transmitter/1100-6514284/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-team-respawn-blue-chip-tower-transmitter/1100-6514284/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-17 18:16:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Wall Tapestries Available For Cheap At Amazon", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">One of our favorite things about The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild is the game\u2019s incredible art for both games.
