Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they\u2019ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who\u2019s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything\u2014and everyone\u2014that Dom loves, forever. \n\nIn 2011\u2019s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn\u2019t know was that Reyes\u2019 son, Dante (Aquaman\u2019s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n\nDante\u2019s plot will scatter Dom\u2019s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante\u2019s vengeance. \n\nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum, and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M.
