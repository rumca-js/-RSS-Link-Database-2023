[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google will reportedly release Pixel Watch 2 this fall", "description": "<p>Google may have taken years to ship <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-review-battery-life-fitbit-heart-rate-sensing-015412121.html\">the first Pixel Watch</a>, but it might not take nearly so long to introduce a sequel. A <em>9to5Google</em><a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/05/05/google-pixel-watch-2-2/\">source</a> claims the company will release the Pixel Watch 2 this fall alongside the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-8-may-look-like-a-rounded-pixel-7-194230413.html\">Pixel 8 phone family</a> this fall. Details are scarce, but Google has historically delivered new flagship Pixels in October. It teased the first smartwatch at I/O last year, and we wouldn't be shocked if there was a repeat at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-at-google-io-2023-120024438.html\">this year's event</a>.</p><p>There's plenty of room for improvement, at least. The current Pixel Watch is based on a 2018-era Exynos 9110 system-on-chip that leaves it lagging in efficiency compared to the Apple Watch and numerous Wear OS watches. A newer SoC could wring more battery life out of the design, not to mention more performance. Google could borrow health sensors from newer Fitbit devices like the Sense 2. There's also just one 41mm case, so it won't be surprising if there's a larger model for those who prefer big timepieces.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Software could also play an important role as well. Pre-release Android 14 code <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/02/09/wear-os-material-you-dynamic-colors/\">hints</a> Wear OS may use the adaptable Material You color theming seen since Android 12. Google also has yet to enable key health metrics like oxygen saturation (SpO2) and overnight skin temperature for the existing Pixel Watch, although those might not require new hardware.</p><p>Whether or not the rumor is accurate, expectations are high if and when the Pixel Watch 2 arrives. Google's wristwear is supposed to be a showcase that raises interest in Wear OS as a whole. A successful follow-up could not only fix the Pixel Watch's flaws, but push other smartwatch makers to step up their efforts.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-will-reportedly-release-pixel-watch-2-this-fall-213015367.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-will-reportedly-release-pixel-watch-2-this-fall-213015367.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-05 21:30:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sony is shutting down PixelOpus, the studio behind \u2018Concrete Genie\u2019", "description": "<p>PixelOpus, a small in-house studio within PlayStation Studios, is closing down next month.

That's $40 below Apple's list price and about $15 below the iPad stylus' average street price on Amazon in recent months. We recommend the latest Pencil in our guide to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html#applepencil\">the best iPad accessories</a>. It's a consistently accurate tool for digital artists and heavy note-takers, and it's the only stylus to offer pressure sensitivity across iPadOS.

While this isn't the absolute lowest price we've seen, it's $12 below the pair's typical going rate. The Life Q30's active noise cancellation isn't as comprehensive as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html\">our favorite wireless headphones</a>, but for a fraction of the price, it's strong enough to be useful. The whole thing is comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and it can last a superb 40 to 50 hours on a charge. Be warned that the pair is extremely bass-heavy by default, but it's possible to even out its sound through Anker's companion app. Call quality and the included transparency mode are just so-so, however.</p><h2>Samsung Evo Select</h2><p></p><p>The 256GB model of <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUIxR1hNMTY_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby13by0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjIwNmM2NWMtNjA0Yy00YjQ4LTk4ODAtMjNhZjVlN2VmNjE3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZDZ88UoM-ethWUwJFBp7nfuuAYqXk8BUrWEd9ufASO5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09B1GXM16%3Fth%3D1\">Samsung's Evo Select</a> microSD card is down to $18, which is an all-time low and roughly $6 below its typical street price.

Attorney General Letitia James has <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-proposes-nation-leading-regulations-cryptocurrency\">proposed</a> a law, the CRPTO Act (Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency and Oversight), that's meant to thwart cryptocurrency fraud and protect investors. Whether or not it's the &quot;strongest and most comprehensive&quot; set of crypto regulations that James touts, it would theoretically prevent repeats of some high-profile incidents.</p><p>The CRPTO Act would bar conflicts of interest, such as owning multiple practices or marketplaces that trade for their own accounts. Companies would have to publicly report financial statements, including risk disclosures. There would be a host of investor safeguards, such as &quot;know-your-customer&quot; requirements, compensation for fraud victims and a ban on stablecoins (crypto coins whose value is tied to a safe asset) that aren't pegged directly to US currency or &quot;high-quality&quot; liquid assets.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The bill would let the Attorney General's office shut down lawbreakers and fine $10,000 per violation for individuals, and $100,000 per violation for companies. The office would also have the power to issue subpoenas and demand damages, penalties and restitution. The Department of Financial Services, meanwhile, would be ensured authority to license various crypto service providers.</p><p>James pointed to multiple real-world examples of alleged abuse the CRPTO act would potentially stop. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sec-charges-terraform-and-ceo-with-fraud-145347680.html\">Terraform Labs</a>, for instance, promised a very high 20 percent interest rate to investors in one token on its marketplace if they bought the company's other token, supposedly hiding the assets' real value. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/new-york-celsius-ceo-crypto-fraud-lawsuit-171421110.html\">Celsius</a>, meanwhile, bought up its own token and created an artificial appearance of demand. That left investors &quot;caught by surprise&quot; when Celsius <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/crypto-lending-giant-celsius-files-for-bankruptcy-065843977.html\">declared bankruptcy</a>, according to the Attorney General.</p><p>The federal government is already cracking down on crypto fraud.

And then do it again, and again, and again \u2014 back and forth, left and right, like a putz, until you reach your destination: hopefully, somewhere to sit.</p><p>Even worse, walking requires real physical effort. For our distant ancestors migrating into colder climates, slogging through mud and snow and across ice, on foot, quickly ate into their already tight caloric budgets, limiting the distances they could hunt and travel. Sure, the advent of wheels in the fourth millennia BC drastically improved our transportation options but it would be nearly another 6,000 years before we\u2019d think to strap them to our feet.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"1d2e16979c354d10a7401565e4ff7f49\"></div><p><a href=\"https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/210/10/1825/9485/Human-locomotion-on-ice-the-evolution-of-ice\">A 2007 study</a> by a team out of Oxford University and published in <em>Biological Journal of the Linnean Society of London</em> suggests that the practice of ice skating potentially emerged in Finland based on evidence from a set of bone \u201cskates\u201d dated to around 1800 BC.  The team argued that the region\u2019s large number of interconnected waterways, which froze over every winter, was the only place in the ancient world cold enough and flat enough to make strapping horse shins to the bottoms of our feet make caloric sense. In fact, the research team found that these skates  \u2014 even if they were only a quarter as efficient and quick as modern models \u2014 offered a ten percent energy savings versus traveling the same route by foot, which added an extra 20 km total distance to travel each day.</p><p>\u201cIce skates were probably the first human powered locomotion tools to take the maximum advantage from the biomechanical properties of the muscular system: even when traveling at relatively high speeds,\u201d the team argued. \u201cThe skating movement pattern required muscles to shorten slowly so that they could also develop a considerable amount of force.\u201d</p><p>The practice also appears in western China. In March, archaeologists discovered <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/bronze-age-ice-skates-with-bone-blades-discovered-in-china\">3,500-year-old skates made from oxen and horse bone</a> in the  country's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The dig team, led by archaeologist Ruan Qiurong of the Xinjiang Institute of Cultural Relics and Archeology, <a href=\"http://kaogu.cssn.cn/zwb/xsdt/xsdt_3347/xsdt_3348/202302/t20230227_5599571.shtml\">argued that</a> their skates bear striking similarities to those found previously in Europe, suggesting a potential knowledge exchange between the two Bronze Age civilizations.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be until the mid-1700s that the wheeled variety made their first appearance. Those early bespoke prototypes served in London stage shows as props to simulate ice skating winter scenes, though the identity of their creators has been lost to history. 18th century Belgian clock- and instrument-maker, John Joseph &quot;The Ingenious Mechanic&quot; Merlin, is credited with devising the first inline roller skate, a two-wheeled contraption he dubbed \u201cskaites\u201d and unveiled in the 1760s.</p><p>&quot;One of his ingenious novelties was a pair of skaites contrived to run on wheels.\u201d  Thomas Busby's <em>Concert Room and Orchestra Anecdotes</em> mentioned in 1805, \u201cwhen not having provided the means of retarding his velocity, or commanding its direction, he impelled himself against a mirror of more than five hundred pounds value, dashed it to atoms, broke his instrument to pieces and wounded himself most severely.&quot;</p><p>By the middle of the 19th century, roller skating had migrated out of the art house scene and into the public consciousness. London\u2019s first public roller rink, The Strand, opened in 1857 and set off a decades-long love affair with the English populace. As the burgeoning sport grew in popularity, the skates themselves quickly evolved to flatten the learning curve in taking up the activity.</p><p>Merlin\u2019s early two-wheel inline design gave way to the classic four-wheel side-by-side (aka \u201cquad\u201d) build we all remember from the Disco Era.

Not only did Plimpton\u2019s skates offer a more stable rolling platform, they were the first to incorporate \u201ctrucks,\u201d the cushioned, pivoting axles that virtually all modern skates and skateboards use.</p><p>A dozen years later, someone finally got around to inventing proper wheel bearings. That someone being William Brown of Birmingham, England. He patented the first modern ball bearing design in 1876 and quickly followed that with a larger design for bicycles in 1877. These patents directly led to today\u2019s ball bearing technology which we can find in everything from skateboards to semi-tractor trailers.</p><p>On modern skates, the rotating wheel and the stationary axel are separated by two hollow-disc shaped devices called bearings. These bearings are designed so that the inner and outer surfaces, which each sit in contact with the wheel and axle, can spin freely. They can do this because of a ring of small spherical metal balls sandwiched between the two plates, which roll and rotate without generating significant amounts of friction or heat (thanks to inventor Levant M. Richardson who patented the use of harder steel bearings in 1884), allowing the spinning wheels to do the same. The advent of this tech meant we no longer had to smear our axles with animal grease so that in and of itself right there is a win for humanity, saving us from a future where every indoor roller derby meet would smell of cooked pork fat.</p><p>With bearings in your wheels, it's far easier to pick up velocity and achieve a higher top speed, so rather than let the public go \u201cfull Merlin\u201d at the local rink, the toe stop was invented in 1876. It remains a common fixture on modern quad skates as well as a select number of inlines - though those more commonly rely on heel stops instead. Despite their origins in the 18th century, The Peck &amp; Snyder Company holds the patent for inline skates, two-wheeled ones at that, from 1900.</p><div id=\"9c5293fbf8564f5289c7e6534278ef2b\"></div><p>From the dawn of the 20th century, roller skating has been an intractable part of American culture despite generational swings in the pastime\u2019s popularity. The sport rolled right over from the UK in the early 1900s and experienced an initial surge in popularity until the Great Depression hit in the 1930s.</p><p>To keep the interest of an economically stricken public, <a href=\"https://history.denverlibrary.org/news/how-dancing-till-you-drop-denver-led-invention-roller-derby\">Chicago-based sports promoter Leo Selzer</a> invented roller derby in 1935. Selzer had originally owned a string of movie theaters in Oregon but got into live event promotions when they became losing propositions during the economic downturn, which coincided with a national endurance competition fad (think <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_marathon\">marathon dancing</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_sitting\">pole sitting competitions</a>).</p><p>Derby as we know it today, grew out of Selzer\u2019s early roller marathon idea. His inaugural Transcontinental Roller Derby in 1935 lasted several days and drew a crowd of more than 20,000 spectators. In 1937, Selzer tweaked the competition\u2019s format to allow for more physicality between contestants and modern roller derby was born.</p><p>Derby, and skating in general, fell off during WWII, though many derby stars served abroad as USO entertainers for the troops. It saw a massive resurgence in the Post-War \u201840s and \u201850s when \u2014 just like with Rock &amp; Roll and the Blues \u2014 <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/the-history-behind-the-roller-skating-trend/\">white folks helped themselves to the already-established Black skating culture</a>. Skating fell off a bit in the \u201860s but reemerged stronger than ever <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/z344d8/queer-history-of-roller-skating\">in the Disco Era when white folks came back around and did the same to queer culture</a>.</p><p>At the tail end of the 1970\u2019s the industry once again reinvented itself with the introduction  of inline skates. In 1979, Scott and Brennan Olsen happened upon an old pair of inline prototypes in Minneapolis that had been developed a decade earlier by the Chicago Roller Skate Company. Competitive ice hockey players themselves, the two immediately saw its potential as an off-season training aid. By this point, inline skate designs had been patented for decades. The tech itself was known, but nobody had managed to make the wheeled boots commercially viable \u2014 until the brothers Olsen founded the Rollerblade company in 1980.</p><p>You\u2019d think that we\u2019d have learned from Icarus but no, in 1999, Roger Adams had the bright idea for Heelys: skates that were actually shoes but with small wheels mounted in the heels. Not to be outdone, Razor debuted the Jetts Heel Wheels \u2014 imaging just the back half of a set of quad skates but they\u2019re driven by an electric motor that hits 10 mph for up to 30 minutes \u2014 in 2018.</p><div id=\"358ffbcd3f3e412981d5667af7d0c634\"></div><p>And in 2022, our wheeled footwear aspirations came full circle with the release of Moonwalkers: quad skates that are worn like skates but are powered like Jetts and are designed for stepping, not pushing and gliding. Designed \u201cto make you feel like you\u2019re on a moving walkway,\u201d these devices can reportedly accelerate your strides up to 250 percent and adapt to your gait as you use them.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/human-historical-fascination-wearable-wheels-rollerskates-transportation-154332171.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/human-historical-fascination-wearable-wheels-rollerskates-transportation-154332171.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-05 15:43:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "This is your last chance to claim games like 'God of War' from the PS Plus Collection", "description": "<p>If you have a PlayStation Plus subscription and the ability to log in to a PlayStation 5 (a console that's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-over-384-million-ps5s-following-a-record-breaking-year-080509020.html\"><ins>far easier to come by these days</ins></a>), it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that Sony is offering access to a bunch of great PS4 games at no extra cost.

Today, the Writers\u2019 Guild of America faces a similar threat from those in control of a new transformative technology, generative AI, and it\u2019s part of the reason they\u2019re currently on strike for better working conditions.</p><p>On March 7, 2023, WGA members voted to approve <a href=\"https://www.wgacontract2023.org/the-campaign/pattern-of-demands\">the 2023 Pattern of Demands</a> by a count of 5,553 voting yes to 90 no\u2019s.

No such deal could ever be contemplated by this membership.\u201d</p><p>As such, the guild is demanding significant increases to the industry\u2019s minimum compensation \u201cto address the devaluation of writing in all areas of television, new media and features\u201d as well as standardize the amount writers are paid writing for streaming or theatrically released features, among a host of other long-deferred needs.

Robert Cargill told Engadget regarding generative AI systems. \u201cWhat we have asked of the studios is that they do not generate any material themselves that they have not been handed by writers.\u201d</p><p>This is because writing contracts in Hollywood are very specific about the circumstances of how credit is attributed <a href=\"https://www.sagaftra.org/show-me-money-%E2%80%93-residuals-101#:~:text=Residuals%20are%20based%20on%20formulas,basic%20cable%2C%20new%20media)\">because residual payments are paid out based on them</a>, Cargill explains.

Then what they do is they hand it over to a writer and say, \u2018we're going to pay you your rewrite wage to go ahead and make it sound more like a human wrote it and to fix any of the problems.\u201d</p><p>This would essentially preclude human \u2014 more importantly, unionized \u2014 writers from earring the highest pay rate while forcing them to still perform the highest pay grade work. \u201cWhat Hollywood can be doing is cutting us out of that very lucrative first step of generating the initial script and story ideas,\u201d he said.</p><p>The guild is also, rightfully, concerned with the potential for their existing writing content be used to train future iterations of generative AIs. \u201cI had a fan reach out to me because he was playing around with [ChatGPT] a few weeks ago and wanted to get a couple ideas to a horror story,\u201d Cargill recalled. \u201cHe says, \u2018Give me some horror prompts based on, I want to write a horror movie that is a mystery thriller, I want it to be creepy and kind of like <em>Sinister</em>.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat it spit back out was the plot to <em>Sinister</em>,\u201d Cargill, who wrote <em>Sinister.</em> \u201cA family moves into a house and finds a videotape of the  murder of the family that previously lived there, and the only thing that was changed from my movie is ours happened on film and not video \u2014 and that's how it changed it.\u201d</p><p>Cargill\u2019s concern is that \u201cby using our previous scripts, what the studios will be doing is essentially getting lines of our dialogue and our jokes sent back into the industry \u2014 but without our attribution, without our credit, without our pay.\u201d</p><p>He elaborates that the guild is not seeking a full ban on generative AI\u2019s use and that screen are welcome to use it if they want. In the same way that \u201cyou don't have to use a computer with spellcheck. You can write your script on yellow line paper by hand if you want \u2014 Quentin Tarantino still does that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't you don't have to use the technology,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut if you want to you can but what we want is to make sure studios aren't using that to replace that and then pay us lower rates just to rewrite what a computer sent back.\u201d</p><p>The WGA did not respond to multiple written requests for comment. The AMPTP issued the following response:</p><blockquote><p>We\u2019re creative companies and we value the work of creatives. The best stories are original, insightful and often come from people's own experiences. AI raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone. For example, writers want to be able to use this technology as part of their creative process, without changing how credits are determined, which is complicated given AI material can't be copyrighted. So it's something that requires a lot more discussion, which we've committed to doing. Also, it\u2019s important to note that the current WGA Agreement already defines a \u201cwriter\u201d to exclude any \u201ccorporate or impersonal purveyor\u201d of literary material, meaning that only a \u201cperson\u201d can be considered a writer and enjoy the terms and conditions of the Basic Agreement.

I like how BOTM does the hard work of figuring out what\u2019s new and good in fiction so all I have to do is read. The club selects seven or so books each month for members to pick from, and the selection is diverse enough that most readers will find something to meet their tastes. And if nothing looks good, they can always pick something from the back catalog or skip the month altogether. At first I thought it would be too much pressure to contend with a new book every month, but the option to skip effectively just extends their subscription, so there\u2019s no pressure. You can gift a three, six or twelve month membership for $60, $100 or $200, respectively. <em>\u2013 A.S.</em></p><h2>Belkin BoostCharge Pro with MagSafe</h2><p></p><p>A pick from our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html\">best wireless chargers</a>, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVdEMTVaUTMvP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8td2EtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY0NzljZjc3LWExZTYtNDdjMi05NzU4LWJmNWRjZTAxZmZiMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaSazTDNL-7adffrUGwxMYttTjavkoek8EnmhxAEEN2_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09WD15ZQ3%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Belkin\u2019s BoostCharge Pro</a> is a compact charging pad that should be a useful addition for any iPhone-owning teacher\u2019s desk.

It doesn\u2019t have the same deluge of content as a Netflix or Prime Video, but it also has a lot less trash.</p><p>The service bundles many films into helpful <a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/recent-collections\">collections</a>, from <a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/afrofuturism\">Afrofuturism</a> to <a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/foreign-language-oscar-winners\">Foreign-Language Oscar Winners</a> to <a href=\"https://www.criterionchannel.com/short-films-by-david-lynch\">Short Films by David Lynch</a>. Various titles come with bonus features like cast interviews as well. Unfortunately, not every film in the Collection is available on the Channel at any given time. (There are <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/shop/collection/328-gift-cards\">gift cards</a> that can go toward films that are only available in physical form.) Nevertheless, for movie-loving teachers who feel like they\u2019ve watched everything on the usual suspects, the service should still provide hours of stimulating works. Gift subscriptions are available in one- to 12-month increments. <em>\u2014 J.D.</em></p><h2>The Sill plant gifts</h2><p></p><p>You can\u2019t go wrong with a gift of greenery to show your appreciation for a beloved teacher.

The Tour Pro 2 fits in that middle category with a design akin to Apple\u2019s AirPods. These certainly have a more refined look, though, with a mix of matte and gloss black plastic. The shape of the inner part of the earbud is ovular, which is, again similar to the AirPods Pro.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p></p><p>The curves here combine with lower weight to make for a comfy fit. The Tour Pro 2 are one of the few sets of true wireless earbuds I can wear for hours at a time without it becoming a chore. There\u2019s a touch panel on the outside of both buds that can accept single, double and triple taps, in addition to long presses, for a variety of on-board controls. Plus, you can reconfigure those to your liking inside the JBL Headphones app.</p><p>The headline feature though, is undoubtedly the case. Most earbuds come with a charging case, the feature list basically ends at charging. Some companies have added wireless transmission for use on planes, but nothing too crazy. The Tour Pro 2 comes with a \u201csmart case,\u201d complete with a touch screen on the outside. As you might expect, it\u2019s larger than what we typically see, but it\u2019s not huge by any means. It\u2019s equipped for wireless charging and there\u2019s a USB-C port on the button for wired top ups.</p><h2>Software and features</h2><figure><img alt=\"JBL Tour Pro 2 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/6122b3f0-ea9e-11ed-b7bf-e8242844462b\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Tour Pro 2 offers a ton of features for audio setup, convenience and customization. All of which are accessible inside the JBL Headphones app and some are available via the charging case display. When you pair the earbuds to the app for the first time, the software will prompt you to complete a few steps for initial setup. Those include an ear tip fit and ear canal tests for ANC performance, voice assistant setup and a quick feature tour. The main section of the app displays battery status for both earbuds individually and the case right up top.</p><p>Everything else is situated on that main screen, accessible with a simple scroll. Ambient Sound Control is up top, giving you the ability to choose between active noise cancellation, Ambient Aware (transparency mode), TalkThru for IRL conversations and off. There\u2019s the option to further tweak ANC by opting for Adaptive, automatic adjustments or by enabling leakage and/or ear canal compensation. Ambient Aware allows you to adjust the level of environmental sound the earbuds pick up with a slider.</p><p>Next on the list is Personi-Fi. This is JBL\u2019s take on personal audio profiles. After completing a hearing test, the app creates a sound profile that also takes into account your listening preferences. Personi-Fi considers gender, age and more to build its custom preset. Before completing the process, the audio on the Tour Pro 2 was\u2026 fine. After the five-minute bout with tones at various volumes and frequencies, my sound profile produced improved bass response from the earbuds and what felt like a slightly wider soundstage. However, the tailored setting did lose some detail in things like softer background vocals, guitar distortion and subtle noise.</p><p>Sound options follow Personi-Fi. Here, JBL gives you a collection of audio presets as well as the ability to manually adjust the EQ curve. Any tuning you create can be saved for future use. You also have the option of enabling Spatial Sound on the Tour Pro 2, JBL\u2019s take on spatial audio. Once you turn it on, the company offers three options based on what you\u2019re listening to: movie, music and game.</p><p>The app gives you the ability to change the gestures for the on-board controls from this menu too. There\u2019s a limit to the fine-tuning here as JBL has grouped all the options under Ambient Sound Control, Volume Control or Playback &amp; Voice Assistant Control. Those are self-explanatory and you can choose to put one on the left and a different one on the right. The only consistent behavior is that a long press will summon your voice assistant on all three gesture options.</p><p>Three of the most useful features on the Tour Pro 2 are VoiceAware, SilentNow and Personal Sound Amplification. VoiceAware is an adjustable tool that allows you to tweak how much of your voice you hear during calls. JBL describes SlientNow as a quiet bubble, a feature that disconnects Bluetooth and turns on ANC. The company goes a step further by allowing you to schedule when the mode will turn on, how long it will be active and if you want an alarm when it ends (in case you\u2019re planning to nap). Personal Sound Amplification is designed for hearing assistance, boosting environmental sound by 15-20dB and helping with conversations. When it\u2019s enabled, you can adjust left/right balance and gain to fit your needs.</p><h2>The smart case</h2><figure><img alt=\"JBL Tour Pro 2 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/61228ce3-ea9e-11ed-b8ff-3f019a88b5b2\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>While the main purpose of the smart case is to give you easy access to the Tour Pro 2\u2019s features. I\u2019m happy to debate the utility of putting everything on the charging accessory instead of leaving it in an app \u2013 software that takes only a couple more taps to open. But, if you find the entire concept convenient, I\u2019m happy to report that the touch screen works well. You swipe from side to side to scroll through the myriad options available on the case and that panel is receptive to taps without issue. Plus, JBL decided to put battery levels, a clock and handy icons on the top edge, giving you crucial info at a glance. What\u2019s more, when you\u2019re on a call, those controls pop-up on case too.</p><p>The JBL Headphones app includes a section for customizing the smart case. Here, you can adjust the display brightness, select a screensaver, enable message notifications/previews and choose which features will be accessible on the touch screen. By default, the case shows Ambient Sound Control, Spatial Sound, EQ presets, VoiceAware and auto play/pause (when you remove the buds from your ears). That\u2019s in addition to the lock screen wallpaper selector, screen brightness, timer, volume, playback controls, flashlight and Find My Buds that can\u2019t be removed. The only additional feature that isn\u2019t enabled by default that you can add to the case is SilentNow.</p><h2>Sound quality and noise cancellation</h2><p>The default tuning on the Tour Pro 2 is pretty average. There\u2019s some decent clarity and detail, but the soundstage feels compressed despite a good amount of bass and a smidge of punch in the treble. Overall, things converge on the midrange, leaving the extra oomph on the table with tracks like Better Lovers\u2019 \u201c30 Under 13\u201d and boygenius\u2019 \u201c$20.\u201d Personi-fi helps open things up a bit, but as I mentioned, it comes at the cost of lost detail. You lose some of the texture of the vocals and guitars in that boygenius song, for example.</p><p>Another prime example of the lack of space in the sound profile is on Nickel Creek\u2019s <em>Celebrants. </em>That album was recorded in a way that sounds like you\u2019re in the room getting a private performance. Guitar, fiddle, mandolin and bass surround you with vocals sprinkled around to complete the vibe. On the Tour Pro 2, you lose the sense of the virtual room, so the songs just become music in your earbuds instead of capturing the atmosphere and energy of the tracking session. Personi-fi makes no noticeable difference here.</p><p>While there are a number of audio customization options in JBL\u2019s app, they don\u2019t do much to improve things. In fact, some make the sound worse. Spatial Sound\u2019s effectiveness can vary depending on the genre. Sometimes there\u2019s a noticeable improvement in the immersive nature of the audio. But with some content, like that Nickel Creek album, it seems like positioning is just moved up slightly, like it's trying to simulate up-firing drivers in a soundbar. In those cases, the sound is just relocated, not improved. I found it best to leave Spatial Sound off.</p><p>In terms of ANC performance, the Tour Pro 2 does a solid job in most circumstances. They\u2019re very good at blocking the constant roar of a dishwasher, clothes dryer or white noise machine \u2013 things that conspire for the daily droning at my house. However, the earbuds struggle with human voices, especially if the person is closeby. Listen to anything relatively quiet and you\u2019re sure to hear the chatty person behind you.</p><p>One note on noise isolation that\u2019s worth pointing out. Despite the ear tip fit test determining that all was well with the Tour Pro 2, there was a lot of sound leakage so the people around me could clearly hear what I was listening to. My wife was the first to notice, and while she says it happens occasionally while I\u2019m testing, it has never been this bad. Sure enough, when she popped in the earbuds, I could clearly hear the tunes at volumes above 60 percent or so. It\u2019s something to consider if you like to blast heavy metal in the office.</p><p>For calls, the Tour Pro 2 is a mixed bag. Confusingly, the TalkThru option in the Ambient Sound Control menu can\u2019t be activated here. You can enable ambient sound mode, but that doesn\u2019t pick up a considerable amount of your chatter. Instead, there\u2019s that separate VoiceAware feature and it <em>only</em> works during calls. Again, it\u2019s adjustable, so you can select the amount of your speech you want sent back through the earbuds. It works okay, but it\u2019s nowhere near as natural sounding as what you get on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html\"><ins>the AirPods Pro</ins></a>. While TalkThru is meant for in-person conversations, it doesn\u2019t pipe in much more of your voice than the transparency mode Ambient Aware. So, even if you could use it for calls, it\u2019s not a great option for them. In the end, it just feels like different features here do variations of the same thing. Overall, call quality is just okay here, despite JBL\u2019s promise of \u201cperfect calls\u201d via six on-board mics.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><figure><img alt=\"JBL Tour Pro 2 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/61228ce0-ea9e-11ed-9ddf-c43707643d41\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>JBL says you can expect up to eight hours on a charge with ANC on, plus another three full charges in the case. Turn noise cancellation off and you could muster two additional hours on both the buds and per charge in the case. During tests consisting of \u201cnormal\u201d use \u2013 a mix of ANC, transparency mode, calls and leaving the buds to power off automatically \u2013 I got seven hours before having to dock the Tour Pro 2 in the case.</p><p>Oddly, I started getting low battery notifications when the case was still showing 25 percent left on both earbuds. Power plummeted quickly from there and after less than 30 minutes the pair was dead. I mention this to point out that the battery estimates on the case don\u2019t seem to be entirely accurate, especially when you hit 25 percent. If you unexpectedly encounter a faster-than-expected drain, there is a 15-minute quick-charge tool that will give you up to four hours of use.</p><h2>The competition</h2><p>When it comes to premium true wireless earbuds, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html\"><ins>Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM4</ins></a> are the best you can buy right now. The company includes just as many features as JBL, if not more. You won\u2019t find a smart case, but you will find handy tools like Speak-to-Chat automatic pausing when you start talking and the ability to automatically change sound settings based on location or activity. Plus, the M4s offer better sound quality and more effective noise cancellation on top of all the conveniences. They\u2019re starting to get some age on them as they debuted in mid-2021, but that means you\u2019re currently privy to a discount: they\u2019re currently going for $200.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>JBL threw every feature it could at the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9KQkwtVG91ci1Qcm8tQmxhY2stQ2FuY2VsbGluZy9kcC9CMEMzTlY0MkdKP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8td2ctMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijg4NjY2Mzg5LWFlMmItNGI1My05MzVhLWE2YzQwN2ZjMTE1YiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdtiRxkNMt1c4RtwHprbKzD5ekVKE74iNczcEk4atNDe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJBL-Tour-Pro-Black-Cancelling%2Fdp%2FB0C3NV42GJ%3Fth%3D1\"><ins>Tour Pro 2</ins></a>. And that\u2019s without even considering the smart case. That touch-screen-enabled accessory is the main draw but I\u2019m not sold on the concept just yet. Sure, there\u2019s something to be said for easy access to settings, but that only works if you leave the case sitting out on your desk. Otherwise, you can probably get your phone out just as quickly. JBL <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/polys-voyager-free-60-might-be-the-coolest-earbuds-for-work-yet-130016200.html\"><ins>isn\u2019t the only company</ins></a> putting a display on a charging case, so who knows, maybe it will become standard. Tour Pro 2 do offer handy tools like VoiceAware, SilentNow and Personal Sound Amplification. But overall they\u2019re an average set of earbuds with okay sound, decent ANC and so many features you might not use some of them more than once.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/jbl-tour-pro-2-review-130009659.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/jbl-tour-pro-2-review-130009659.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-05 13:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget Podcast: What happened to 'Redfall' and 'Star Wars: Jedi Survivor?'", "description": "<p>This week, Senior Editor Jessica Conditt joins to discuss what went wrong with <em>Redfall</em>, Microsoft\u2019s latest Xbox exclusive that launched to middling reviews.

The company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-reveals-the-pixel-fold-174726500.html\">has confirmed</a> it will introduce a Pixel Fold that, similar to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold series, unfolds like a book. Rumors suggest it will have a 5.8-inch 120Hz external screen for quick interactions, and a 7.6-inch 120Hz internal display when you want more visual real estate. It has thicker bezels than the Z Fold, but it\u2019s supposed to feature a durable, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/leaked-google-pixel-fold-images-show-a-sleek-nearly-gapless-hinge-160537647.html\">almost-gapless hinge</a> and a battery that lasts 24 hours in normal use.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"741536cee2944984bb20a4a4782b32c1\"></div><p>Unlike past Pixels, the Fold might not offer tremendous value for the money. The foldable is reportedly shipping in June for around $1,700, and it may come with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html\">Pixel 7\u2019s</a> Tensor G2 chip using 12GB of RAM.

Add a possible Tensor G2 chip with 8GB of RAM and you might not be in any rush to get a pricier phone, especially if you prefer a 6-inch screen over the Pixel 7\u2019s larger panel.</p><p>Unfortunately, all those additions might come at a cost.

Test versions have been available <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/android-14-developer-preview-180004938.html\">since February</a>, and Google plans to release the finished operating system in late summer.

There haven\u2019t been any major upgrades so far, but that\u2019s not surprising. Android developer previews and early betas are usually meant to help creators prepare their apps \u2014 it\u2019s not until I/O that Google typically shares interface changes or other significant public-facing improvements.</p><p>There are a few hints of extra changes thanks to sleuthing by Esper\u2019s Mishaal Rahman. Health Connect, the hub for data from fitness apps, <a href=\"https://blog.esper.io/health-connect-in-android-14/\">may come</a> with Android 14. A previously optional predictive back gesture, which shows where you\u2019ll go when you swipe, might be standard. Neither of these are earth-shaking, but they imply that Google is making numerous small refinements on top of any more noticeable changes.</p><h2>Pixel 8 preview</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"Google Pixel 8 Pro leak\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/96594870-c296-11ed-b95b-3dbc9414885c\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by OnLeaks/Smartprix</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Google used I/O 2022 to offer a brief glimpse of the Pixel 7. While there\u2019s no guarantee of a repeat, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a Pixel 8 preview at the 2023 gathering. Provided OnLeaks <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-8-may-look-like-a-rounded-pixel-7-194230413.html\">renders</a> are true to the finished product, this will be a subtle evolution with more rounded corners and a slightly different camera cutout.</p><p>After that, details are murky. <em>WinFuture</em><a href=\"https://winfuture.de/news,132895.html\">claims</a> the Pixel 8 series will use a next-generation Tensor chip (presumably the Tensor G3) with 8GB of RAM in the standard model and 12GB in the Pro. The camera array might not change much, but code indicates Google could bring its unblur tool to videos for the first time.</p><p>If there is a Pixel 8 preview, you\u2019ll probably be waiting a while to get a device in your hands. Google usually waits until the fall to deliver flagship Pixel phones, and we expect that to be the case here. You may not have to wait as long to hear more, though. Given Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-prototype-ebay-184828773.html\">historically poor track record for preventing leaks</a>, there could be a flurry of scoops in the next few months.</p><h2>Wildcards: Pixel Watch 2 and experimental tech</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"Google Pixel Watch\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/81e9b8b0-e9d4-11ed-8799-addd81f09d17\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Cherlynn Low/Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>It seemingly wouldn\u2019t be I/O without a seemingly leftfield hardware announcement. Google teased <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-ar-glasses-190114468.html\">next-generation augmented reality glasses</a> in 2022, for instance. As such, we can\u2019t rule out surprises this year.</p><p>A sequel to the Pixel Watch is one option. Google hasn\u2019t said how often it will refresh its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-review-battery-life-fitbit-heart-rate-sensing-015412121.html\">first in-house smartwatch</a>, but the current model has ample room for improvement. There\u2019s only one case size, and the circa-2018 Samsung Exynos processor does no favors to the battery life or performance. There aren\u2019t any substantive leaks as of this writing, though, so we wouldn\u2019t bet on a preview.</p><p>The more plausible possibility is an update on those previously mentioned AR glasses. Google only showed a rough prototype last time and could easily have more to say if work has progressed well in the months since. That\u2019s a big \u201cif,\u201d mind you. Even Meta isn\u2019t believed to be releasing its first true AR eyewear <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-first-true-ar-glasses-2027-060946419.html\">until 2027</a>, and there\u2019s no certainty Google has solved technical challenges following <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-prototype-ar-glasses-testing-public-191041392.html\">initial field tests</a>. If the glasses appear, they may only be slightly further along.</p><p>Don\u2019t be surprised if there are genuine surprises, too. Google caught more than a few people off guard with its pandemic-friendly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-project-starline-191228699.html\">Project Starline video chat booth</a> at I/O 2021, and the decision to preview the Pixel Tablet a year early was more than a little unusual.
