Prior to his breakout performance in 21 Jump Street, Channing Tatum was seen by most as just "generic handsome guy".  Teaming up with Jonah Hill, Christoper Miller, and Phil Lord, finally gave audiences a chance to see Channing Tatum's as more than a rom com hear throb.  21 Jump Street let Tatum show off his acting chops, and even landed him future roles with some of hollywoods biggest directors. Without 21 Jump Street we may have never seen what Channing Tatum could do.
