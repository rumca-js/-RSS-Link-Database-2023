<p>Physically, Nexar&rsquo;s $450 One Pro is a work of art. It&rsquo;s pricey to be sure, but luxurious styling, clever design, and pretty much every feature found in a modern dash cam would likely ward off any buyer&rsquo;s remorse. </p>



<p>I said <em>would</em>, because in practice, transferring video online proved problematic and tediously slow, with what turned out to be an incompatible phone. Also, the app&rsquo;s insistence on notifying users of mundane inanities proved intrusive and annoying. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/428348/best-dash-cam-reviews.html">best dash cams</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="nexar-one-pro-design-and-features">Nexar One Pro design and features</h2>



<p>The Nexar One Pro has fixed internal storage, available at purchase time in 64GB (standard), 128GB (+$50), 256GB (+$100), and 512GB (+$180) flavors. How much you need depends on how much you drive, how much video you want saved, and how many years you want to use the camera. NAND has a finite lifespan.</p>



<p>Of course, with the One Pro, you can always offload videos to your phone, and there&rsquo;s the accompanying LTE service and online storage. Alas the latter proved problematic. More on that later.</p>



<p>The Nexar One Pro, while exceedingly handsome in appearance, is a hefty deal at 7.4 ounces, with the magnetically/Type-C coupled &ldquo;Connectivity LTE&rdquo; module and interior camera module contributing another 1.76 ounces apiece. The main unit measures 3.5-inches wide by 2.75-inches tall, by 1.2 inches thick. Both the connectivity module and the interior camera module add around 1.6-inches of width, for a rather conspicuous 6.7-inch width when assembled.</p>



<p>The front camera is 4K UHD (3840&times;2160) with a 140 degree field of view, while the interior camera is 720p with a 160 degree FOV, and rotates vertically for optimal cabin coverage.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nexar One Pro interior module" class="wp-image-1791807" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nexar-one-pro-interior.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Nexar One Pro interior module</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>



<p>Despite the large size, I was less hesitant about placing the One Pro on my windshield than i&rsquo;ve been with most other dash cams&mdash;it&rsquo;s <em>that</em> classy looking. The entire deal is affixed to the windshield using a semi-permanent adhesive mount (with an integrated Type-C power connector), which in turn magnetically connects with the camera. </p>



<p>I found the magnetic coupling just right&mdash;reassuringly secure, but still easy to remove. Also, when you get it anywhere near the mount, it almost jumps out of your hand to mate with the mount. That may sound odd or disturbing, but it&rsquo;s actually kind of cool. Especially as the communication and interior-camera modules do the same. Fun, fun, fun.</p>



<p>Easily removed is also cool, as I wouldn&rsquo;t want to leave such an attractive piece of tech in the car except in known secure locations&mdash;most especially my pathetically easy to open convertible (knife slash) that I deliberately leave unlocked.</p>



<p>While the Nexar One Pro comes with an auxiliary/USB charger in the box, it also ships with a OBDII power unit/cable or hardwiring kit. I was happy about the OBDII I received as it&rsquo;s by far the easiest way (no wire tapping) to provide constant juice to a dash cam for surveillance while you&rsquo;re parked. </p>



<p>Note that OBDII is the standard diagnostic connector on all cars for the last several decades. You have one, most likely under the driver&rsquo;s side dash to the far left of the cabin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen a physical design as nice as the Nexar One Pro. It&rsquo;s just elegant all the way.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nexar One Pro OBDII cable" class="wp-image-1791808" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nexar-obdii.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Nexar One Pro OBDII cable</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>



<p>That said, the cable features an inline transformer puck that you&rsquo;ll need to tuck away somewhere. Overall, however, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen a physical design as nice as the Nexar One Pro. It&rsquo;s just elegant all the way.  </p>



<p>Using the One Pro requires signing up with Nexar as you need to store videos online. If you want advertised features such as live streaming, live alerts broadcast for incidents, and remote vehicle locating, you&rsquo;ll need a Nexar Connect subscription for $10 a month. Factor that in when you are comparison shopping. </p>



<p>Other features include a parking mode, GPS, bad driving alerts, sharing of files, voice feedback, as well as Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) 5. There&rsquo;s also a mounting alignment helper in the phone app, which also features the ability to play back video while showing your route and destination on a map. Nice.</p>



<h2 id="nexar-one-pro-app-and-offloading">Nexar One Pro app and offloading</h2>



<p>I was having unbridled fun and feeling stark admiration for the Nexar One Pro right up until installing the app and trying to access captures. I now must note that I first used my personal Google Pixel 4 for testing as I usually do. If not bleeding-edge, it&rsquo;s still a relatively modern and capable phone. </p>



<p>Alas, the Nexar app isn&rsquo;t fully compatible with it. I&rsquo;m going to describe my experiences with the Pixel 4, as that was used for the majority of the testing and screen captures, but ultimately using an iPhone resolved the issues. Check the rather obscure <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://getnexar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021182873-Device-Compatibility&amp;xcust=2-3-1529994-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">list at Nexar&rsquo;s site</a> to make sure your phone is supported. This should be front and center on the product page and the app should be smart enough to tell you.</p>



<p>First off, it took several reboots of both the app and the camera to connect, though after initial connection, mating was reliable and quick. This is not uncommon with phone-centric dash cams.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1787536" height="842" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Nexr-One-Pro-app-6-app-setup.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>I was extremely annoyed at the constant nag to turn on notifications, just some of which are shown to the far right</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I saw much praise for the app among the reader (maybe) reviews at Nexar&rsquo;s site, but personally, I was hardly enamored with it badgering me incessantly about things it wanted such as location data. And when I turned off notifications (there are literally dozens), it started bugging me about turning them on. I know how I want to use the product. Chill, Nexar! </p>



<p>On the other hand, I did enjoy the live view, being able to replay rides and see the GPS info used to scribe my route on a map.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1787537" height="842" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Nexr-One-Pro-app-15-live-issues.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This shows the live view in the app, as well as screens showing  stalled uploads. Not allowing computer access to the internal storage is silly and proved problematic.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With the Pixel 4, only a few of the dozens of videos were seemingly saved online automatically, and when I tried to manually upload videos from the app, the process stalled every time. There was also seemingly no way to abort (there&rsquo;s an X on uploading videos, but it didn&rsquo;t respond).</p>



<p>To its credit, Nexar support was friendly and quick to get back to me, however, I&rsquo;d already taken all the steps (uninstall, re-install, power cycle everything, etc.) they suggested to ameliorate the issue. I was eventually informed by my company PR contact that the Pixel 4 (and several others) was not compatible, but email support never proffered this information. </p>



<p>Long story short, the only way I was able to reliably retrieve videos from the Pixel 4 was by browsing to Android/Data/mobi.nexar/dashcam/files/user/(a very long alphanumeric)/videos where they&rsquo;d been streamed. Not something all users will know how to do, or even consider.</p>



<p>What Nexar One Pro should do is function as USB mass storage, as most display-less dash cams do when connected to a computing device. Whether my phone was the issue or not, the lack of this facility in a dash cam with non-removable storage is an issue. A big issue. </p>



<p>I eventually got everything to work using the aforementioned iPhone, but geez Louise.</p>



<h2 id="how-is-the-nexar-ones-video">How is the Nexar One&rsquo;s video?</h2>



<p>Once the captures were finally off the phone, the results were generally good, though not nearly of the quality of those featured on the website. Color was fine, but the camera reacted poorly to the gray day here in San Francisco, making it appear darker than it was.</p>



<p>Notice that details in the following shot are fine on the car to the right that&rsquo;s within 20 feet, but muddy straight ahead at a distance of only 100 feet. There&rsquo;s also a fair amount of fish-eye, though bumps and other motion were handled well&mdash;no tearing, jiggling, or other artifacts. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1787333" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Nexr-One-Pro-3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>It was a gray day here in San Francisco, but this capture makes it appear darker than it actually was. Near-field detail is good, far-field isn&rsquo;t.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Nexar obviously opts for smoothness over sharpness at a distance, and for your incidents that&rsquo;s fine. But it does limit usefulness in terms of cataloging your travels or documenting other people&rsquo;s incidents.</p>



<p>The interior capture below was taken on a brighter day, and again, the Nexar One Pro doesn&rsquo;t compensate for the lighting conditions particularly well. The image is usable but overexposed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1787540" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Nexr-One-Pro-13.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Me and the mutts testing the Nexar One Pro.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It seems the One Pro handles night and low-light captures better than full-light and day. The following night capture shows good detail despite a wet windshield. Much, much better. Go figure.</p>



<p></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1787332" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Nexr-One-Pro-6.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Nexar One Pro takes good video at night. Headlight flare is handled decently as well.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The night interior capture also opts for smooth over sharp, but you can see the interior and exterior quite well. I don&rsquo;t particularly love the lines in my face, but a good dash cam would capture them better.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1787538" height="665" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Nexr-One-Pro-14.png?w=1200" width="1183" /><figcaption>The infrared lighting makes sure you can see large objects, but fine detail is missing in this night interior capture.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Overall, I&rsquo;d call the Nexar One Pro&rsquo;s captures serviceable, though dash cams such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1676421/70mai-dash-cam-omni-dash-cam-review.html">70mai Omni</a> do better on all fronts with less space-hungry 1080p. You can switch the One Pro to 1080 to save space, but 4K is the default.</p>



<h2 id="is-the-nexar-one-pro-worth-it">Is the Nexar One Pro worth it?</h2>



<p>As a piece of clever, attractive hardware, the Nexar One Pro is the dash cam I&rsquo;d most like in my car. I was ready to fall in love. For the price, I was expecting top-quality captures and a painless, polite experience. Instead, captures were so-so, the app was annoying, and it didn&rsquo;t work properly with my phone for initially unexplained reasons. </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re using a compatible phone, you&rsquo;ll probably like the One Pro. But the camera needs to allow direct offloading via USB, and the company needs to work harder to make sure Pixel 4 users don&rsquo;t fall into the same trap.</p>

## Windows 11 is getting a Facebook widget and other modern features
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1809574/facebook-is-testing-a-widget-for-windows-11.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1809574/facebook-is-testing-a-widget-for-windows-11.html)

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Microsoft recently unveiled the latest Windows 11 Insider Dev Channel Build 23451. This new build includes three key features, including the new Facebook widget, a revamped File Explorer&rsquo;s details pane, and an improved Windows Spotlight with support for 4K images and more information. Dev Channel builds don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the code will eventually be released, but we can hope so.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try out the new Facebook widget for yourself, you can&mdash;though you&rsquo;ll need the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ2WL&amp;xcust=2-2-1809574-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Facebook app</a> to do so. To add the Facebook widget to your ongoing collection, open the Widgets board and click the small &ldquo;+&rdquo; sign on the upper right. You&rsquo;ll see a snapshot of the activity on your Facebook page, which will then open the app itself. Microsoft is also adding a new widget &ldquo;picker,&rdquo; which allows you to preview what the widget will look like before you add it. You&rsquo;ll also see animated Widget icons on the Taskbar, too.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 Insider Dev File Explorer" class="wp-image-1809584" height="1024" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Windows-11-File-Explorer-details.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="400" /><figcaption>The new Details pane in Windows 11&rsquo;s File Explorer.</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/05/04/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23451/&amp;xcust=2-2-1809574-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft</a></div>



<p>Another feature of interest is the new Details pane of File Explorer. For information about a specific file like permissions and resolution, you&rsquo;d typically need to right-click the file to open it. This new pane will allow you to see those details without navigating through the Windows 11&rsquo;s complex right-click menu.</p>



<p>Finally, Windows Spotlight is getting some much-needed improvements, including support for 4K images on 4K displays. Microsoft is trying out different &ldquo;treatments&rdquo; of Windows Spotlight, providing slightly different information and orientation.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 Insider Dev Windows Spotlight" class="wp-image-1809586" height="684" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Windows-11-Windows-Spotlight.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>Windows Spotlight has always been one of the prettiest parts of Windows. Now the feature is adding support for 4K.</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/05/04/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23451/&amp;xcust=2-2-1809574-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft</a></div>



<h2 id="additional-updates">Additional updates</h2>



<p>Microsoft also said that it&rsquo;s expanding the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1668041/ads-in-the-windows-11-start-menu-are-definitely-coming.html">Start menu ad/ notifications</a> to more users. &ldquo;With this feature, we&rsquo;re giving customers quick access to important account-related notifications,&rdquo; Microsoft said. At least they can be somewhat managed by going to <em>Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Start</em>.</p>



<p>The Start menu&rsquo;s Recommended section typically includes the last documents you&rsquo;ve worked on. Microsoft has been working to smarten this up and it&rsquo;s expanding the categories of &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; files to include websites.</p>



<p>Narrator also works more closely with Excel, describing the contents of cells based upon the Narrator assistive technology, Microsoft said.</p>

## Steam now allows you to copy games over your local network. Here’s how to do it

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>What can I say? I&rsquo;m a bandwidth cheapskate. Always have been, always will be. So, when I have the opportunity to download something locally and not from the Internet, I do. And Valve&rsquo;s Steam service has finally delivered on a promise Microsoft has failed to keep for years.</p>



<p>Steam now allows you to &ldquo;download&rdquo; a game hosted on the Steam service from another PC. This is an increasingly valuable feature as users cycle out old PCs, buy <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/617378/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-steam-deck.html">Steam Decks</a>, or simply live in households where more than one PC owns a given game.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Are you a fan of the Steam Deck? If so, you should check out the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1796614/hands-on-the-rog-ally-is-the-steam-deck-for-gamers-who-want-more-power-and-options.html">ROG Ally, a competitor with more power and options</a>.</p></blockquote>



<p>For years, Comcast has driven me insane with increasing prices as well as an arbitrary data cap that only more competition can do away with. As a West Coast customer, our household of four has a 1.2TB data cap per month while several Northeast states, where Comcast competes with uncapped Verizon&rsquo;s FiOS, get a free pass. To me, this is simple price gouging and don&rsquo;t try to change my mind.</p>



<p>Games can sometimes consume well over 100GB worth of data, meaning that &ldquo;buying&rdquo; a game on Steam can also be accompanied with a potential overage tax. If I exceed the Comcast data cap, I pay $10 for each additional 50GB of data consumed. (Other ISPs have different pricing plans and overage policies). Managing my data cap is one end-of-month task I despise.</p>



<p>Steam, though, now helps out in a big way.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-copy-steam-games-over-your-local-network">How to copy Steam games over your local network</h2>



<p>Steam makes this all exceedingly simple. Navigate to the settings menu (accessible from the small &ldquo;gear&rdquo; icon on the main page or on the Downloads page) and go to the <em>Downloads</em> entry if you&rsquo;re not already there. At the bottom of the many menu options is &ldquo;Game File Transfer over Local Network&rdquo;&mdash;this is the option you&rsquo;re looking for. (This is a bit different than simply creating another Steam folder and library, which can be done using <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1912418281#:~:text=Step-by-step%20walk-through%3A%201%20Navigate%20to%20your%20Steam%20Library.,update%20the%20game%20in%20your%20Steam%20library.%20&amp;xcust=2-2-1798397-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">this guide</a>).</p>



<p>Ideally, the option to &ldquo;allow transfers to/from my own devices&rdquo; should be enabled and it should work. It requires both PCs to be logged into Steam and to be on the same network. On my machine, though, this option didn&rsquo;t work and the more permissible &ldquo;Allow transfers to/from any user&rdquo; was the only option that did anything. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Steam download 2" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1504" id="1798470" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/steam-download.png" width="2380" /><img alt="Steam local download 1" class="image-compare__image-after" height="1690" id="1798468" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Steam-download-1.png" width="2880" /></div><figcaption>What the host (left) and the client PC will see when transferring a game over Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That option is a bit risky since any devices with access to your wireless or wired network could download Steam games, but chances are it won&rsquo;t be a big deal. You can also limit it to Steam friends. If you&rsquo;re concerned, you can always tweak the option once the transfer completes or simply turn off transfers entirely.</p>



<p>Once you begin downloading a file from another PC, you should see a banner on both machines, indicating that the file is being downloaded from another PC rather than the Steam servers. How fast the file transfers depends on a number of factors such as the speed of both PCs, the drive, the network, and so on. Steam originally pegged 100MB/s (800Mbits/s) as about the fastest maximum speed. Personally, I saw about half that with a test run in my home office.</p>



<p>For me, that&rsquo;s just fine. I love this feature because of what it saves me in dollars, not what it saves me in time. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Steam download option" class="wp-image-1798469" height="767" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Steam-local-transfer-control.png" width="1024" /><figcaption>Yiu can configure Steam&rsquo;s Game File Transfer from this options menu.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The only catch is that while Steam will transfer the game files, it won&rsquo;t transfer saved games. You&rsquo;ll have to download those from the Steam Cloud as well as any assets or props from the Steam Workshop. Finally, you can transfer games from PC to PC as you wish, but you can only transfer games <em>to</em> a Steam Deck and not back.</p>



<h2 id="why-cant-windows-do-this">Why can&rsquo;t Windows do this?!</h2>



<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve been hoping that Microsoft would do this. And, for years, Windows has promised that it will&mdash;except that it never has. Inside the Windows 10 and 11 Settings menu, there is a control called Delivery Optimization (<em>Windows Update &gt; Advanced options &gt; Delivery optimization)</em> that supposedly does the exact same thing. If you own more than one PC, Delivery Optimization should look first at other Windows PCs that you&rsquo;re logged into for any updates. It should then pull them from those PCs before downloading them from Microsoft&rsquo;s servers.</p>



<p>With all of the PCs that have come through my office, I have never seen this happen once. Not a single time, ever. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose"><img alt="Windows 11 delivery optimization 2" class="image-compare__image-before" height="1459" id="1798478" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Windows-11-Delivery-Optimization-2.png" width="2100" /><img alt="Windows 11 Delivery Optimization" class="image-compare__image-after" height="1477" id="1798475" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Delivery-optimization-Windows-11.png" width="2158" /></div><figcaption>Delivery Optimization within Windows 11. </figcaption></figure>



<p>It&rsquo;s possible that there&rsquo;s some hidden control that I haven&rsquo;t enabled. It&rsquo;s also possible that Delivery Optimization&rsquo;s time has passed&mdash;perhaps the code Microsoft is offering one PC differs slightly than another, so that it can&rsquo;t be reproduced. I&rsquo;m doubtful, though. Occam&rsquo;s Razor suggests its developers got sidetracked and hoped we&rsquo;d all just forget about it.</p>



<p>I don&rsquo;t want to forget about it, though. Delivery Optimization is a great feature and I want it to work on Windows. Steam just beat it to the punch.</p>

<p>Rest in peace, Microsoft PC peripherals. Goodnight forever, Microsoft SideWinder. Farewell, SPOT Watch.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398555/five-major-google-products-that-might-not-live-to-see-2030.html">Google Graveyard</a>, the collection of apps, services and products that Google shut down before their time. But like any big company, Microsoft also tried and failed to make certain products work. In light of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1803581/microsoft-pc-peripherals-are-now-a-collectors-item.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s decision to discontinue PC peripherals</a> like the Microsoft Sculpt Desktop Keyboard, let&rsquo;s look at some of the products that litter the Microsoft hardware graveyard.</p>



<h2 id="microsoft-ramcard-softcard-systemcard">Microsoft RAMCard/SoftCard/SystemCard</h2>



<p>Microsoft made RAMCards, one of the first solid-state disks, for both the Apple II as well as the IBM PC in the early 1980s. Instead of non-volatile memory like today&rsquo;s SSDs, however, these were simply more like memory expansion cards, adding 16KB of RAM to an Apple II with 48KB already in place. (The version for the PC added up to 256KB, in 64KB blocks, and shipped with RAMDrive software which accessed the RAM as a disk.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft RamCard" class="wp-image-1807623" height="723" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Microsoft-RAMCard-from-Infoworld.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>RAM on a card: that was essentially the Microsoft RAMCard.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Google Books / InfoWorld</p></div>



<p>Microsoft also made the SoftCard, which was also interesting. It was a self-contained card with a Z80 microprocessor on it. Combining the RAMCard and SoftCard created a dual-microprocessor system for Apple with a whopping 56KB of RAM. PCs also got the SystemCard, which added the 256KB of RAM as well as a print spooler and parallel printer interface.</p>



<h2 id="microsoft-mach-10-mach-20">Microsoft Mach 10 / Mach 20</h2>



<p>On paper, the Microsoft Mach 10 and Mach 20 sound pretty cool. Instead of being forced to live with a IBM PC / PC XT&rsquo;s 4.77MHz 8088 CPU, you could swap it out and replace it with a Mach 10 card that essentially upgraded it to a 9.54MHz 8088 CPU. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>The Microsoft Mach 20 card.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Mach 20 released in 1988 went a big step further. It gave you an 8MHz 80286 CPU instead: a slower chip, but two generations ahead! And with a mouse port! A socket for an 80287 math coprocessor! Run Windows 2.0 in standard mode! There was even a Memory Plus daughterboard allowing up to 3.5 megabytes of RAM, and another Disk Plus daughterboard which allowed you to connect a 5.25- or 3.5-inch floppy drive. As Microsoft&rsquo;s Raymond Chen <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20221226-00/?p=107615&amp;xcust=2-1-1803823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">points out</a>, the Mach 20 cost $495, but upgrading to a full-fledged IBM PC AT cost $4,000 &mdash; a great deal by comparison.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it flopped. InfoWorld&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT16&amp;lpg=PT16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&amp;xcust=2-1-1803823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">in-depth review of the Mach 20 card</a> was decidedly lukewarm. To boost sales, Microsoft even made a version of OS/2 specifically for the Mach 20. According to Chen, Microsoft sold a grand total of 11 copies. Eight of them were returned. </p>



<h2 id="microsoft-timex-datalink">Microsoft / Timex Datalink</h2>



<p>In 1994, Timex teamed up with Microsoft to launch the Timex Datalink watch, a waterproof (even spaceproof!) digital watch that was worn by actual astronauts&hellip; in space! The Datalink was one of the first smartwatches, with data optically transferred via a blinking CRT computer monitor to the watch via an sensor. The process was slow, though (about 70 entries per minute, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Datalink&amp;xcust=2-1-1803823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia reports</a>) and couldn&rsquo;t be dynamically updated without line-of-sight to the monitor.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Timex Datalink" class="wp-image-1807649" height="1176" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Microsoft-Timex-Datalink.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Timex Datalink communicated via the bubble-like optical sensor at the top.</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/295564588256?hash=item44d105b4e0:g:QaEAAOSwg5ZkDva2&amp;amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAAwGl%2BVmU67N5%2Fzzw%2FWxGJY7SMZkcC3ScXgFxHVtZamaRGf5idqOetft7TI6EaAdNO9BPa%2FS4cxYOO9XOPEZ%2B7GBuQMWw29m5W%2FmCvjXCYvPgvDeFjPmIJY9KjU5NkOQoQ9ev01dOpTJC%2FU8TgYJnS3kT4LSjakdUNNL6wlBA5U1EERXNfVqErHRZCDhCEKssG8tmf%2BJTt0LrxGdGSwSRA69eY4ynXKe47LKznfkklXePTO8Hx1pzogvaM3VXHXYz3%2BQ%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR8a6kMD8YQ&amp;xcust=2-1-1803823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">eBay</a></div>



<p>As you might imagine, a scrolling line of text across a digital watch wasn&rsquo;t that effective, but fans nevertheless kept the line going for years. Probably one of the things that killed them was a shift to LCD displays, which means that you had to buy a special transmitter, too. While the Datalink made <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/535838/worst_products_ever.html">our list of the worst tech products eve</a>r, they predated Microsoft&rsquo;s SPOT Watches.</p>



<h2 id="microsoft-sidewinder">Microsoft SideWinder</h2>



<p>The SideWinder PC peripherals of the 1990s (including joysticks, steering wheels, pedals, and more) coincided with arguably the height of the PC gaming era. You could play just about any PC game, affordably, including flight and space simulators like <em>Wing Commander</em> and racing games using the SideWinder Force Feedback wheel and other peripherals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Let&rsquo;s not undersell this &mdash; these peripherals were <em>awesome</em>. Unfortunately, Microsoft exited the market in 2003, ceding the market to other manufacturers. Not to knock any of them down, but they never had quite the cachet of the SideWinder brand.</p>



<h2 id="microsoft-easyball">Microsoft EasyBall</h2>



<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, tech companies went through one of their weird phases, investing in kid&rsquo;s hardware for some reason. (Remember the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/448376/report-verizon-could-rescue-intels-odd-set-top-business.html">Intel Play QX3 microscope</a>?)</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s EasyBall debuted in 1997 as a gigantic trackball for kids, bundled with <em>Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds</em> CD-ROM game for $54.95. Ninety-seven Computer City stores offered hands-on demonstrations of the software at the &ldquo;The EasyBall Adventure Zone with Freddi Fish.&rdquo; The trackball even had a dual-input port for both a Microsoft Mouse and an EasyBall to be connected simultaneously, so that kids and adults could work together.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft EasyBall" class="wp-image-1807630" height="518" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EasyBall.png" width="777" /><figcaption>The Microsoft EasyBall. Look at the size of that thing!</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/buxtoncollection/detail.aspx?id=225&amp;xcust=2-1-1803823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft / Bill Buxton</a></div>



<p>Even though the EasyBall won a number of awards, Microsoft had essentially pulled out of the trackball market by the mid-2000s. Today, Logitech and Kensington keep the trackball alive.</p>



<h2 id="microsoft-spot-watches">Microsoft SPOT Watches</h2>



<p>Who could possibly need a connected smartwatch that could receive weather forecasts, personalized news, and Outlook calendar reminders? In 2003, this was a real question. Today, the Smart Personal Objects Technology (SPOT) service was way ahead of its time.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img alt="Microsoft SPOT Watches" class="wp-image-1807663" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/spot-watches-CMS-primary.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1200" /><figcaption>Weirdly, Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t archived any good images of a SPOT Watch. Wonder why?</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Technically, SPOT watches were manufactured by Fossil and Suunto, not Microsoft, but they were heavily promoted by Microsoft as the next big thing in consumer electronics. They used RF communication to transmit data, but the real killer is that Microsoft wanted to charge a subscription for the MSN Direct service that powered the watches with live data. That helped kill whatever demand there was for SPOT Watches, as did a better wireless medium: Wi-Fi.</p>



<h2 id="microsoft-kin">Microsoft Kin</h2>



<p>The 2010 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/512149/the_curious_thing_about_microsoft_kin.html">Microsoft Kin was doomed</a> from the start. It was a connected smartphone for social media that lacked social media connections, and that would only &ldquo;connect&rdquo; every fifteen minutes or so.  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/512574/microsoft_kin_phone_reviews.html">The Kin&rsquo;s first reviews</a> found all sorts of problems, from laggy typing to poor hardware to an egregious Verizon smartphone plan that was a necessity to use the phone properly.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft Kin" class="wp-image-1807639" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Microsoft-Kin-CMS-primary.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>Microsoft&rsquo;s Kin smartphones looked cool enough, but they didn&rsquo;t deliver.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>Those reviews landed in May. By June, Microsoft had killed the Kin, after reportedly <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/507570/microsoft_kin_is_dead.html">selling just 500 of them</a>. </p>



<h2 id="microsoft-lumia-windows-phone">Microsoft Lumia / Windows Phone</h2>



<p>In September 2013, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/447470/microsoft-to-acquire-nokias-devices-business-for-7-17-billion.html">Microsoft bought Nokia&rsquo;s device business</a>, launching Microsoft into supporting yet another (ultimately doomed) smartphone business. After former Microsoft executive and then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop passed on using Android, Nokia adopted the Windows Mobile operating system instead. Phones like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/443918/nokia-lumia-icon-review-the-best-windows-phone-so-far.html">Nokia Lumia Icon</a> gave way to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/427520/microsoft-lumia-640-review-its-the-practical-windows-phone-most-people-can-afford.html">Microsoft Lumia 640</a> and others. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Lumia" class="wp-image-1807661" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Microsoft-Lumia.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>If you liked bright, beautiful mobile phone OSes, Microsoft &lsquo;s Lumia and its Windows Mobile OS was for you.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>There are still a legion of devoted fans (including me) who loved the Lumia line for its fantastic image sensors, whose color fidelity outperformed competing phones for several product generations. But Microsoft was unable to maintain momentum for either Lumia or a small ecosystem of failed Windows Mobile business phones. By 2019, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398482/windows-10-mobile-is-finally-dead-how-to-take-your-data-and-move-on.html">Windows Phone platform was officially dead</a>.</p>



<h2 id="microsoft-zune">Microsoft Zune</h2>



<p>The short-lived Microsoft Zune digital music player began in 2006 and finally ended in 2009, when Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/241059/microsoft_officially_kills_zune.html">stopped producing new devices</a>.&nbsp;Zune never made much headway against the Apple iPod. Microsoft, though, gave the Zune&rsquo;s services a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/424406/microsoft-turns-off-the-lights-on-zune-services.html">generous seven years</a> more before finally pulling the plug&hellip;for the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407443/what-groove-users-need-to-do-now-that-microsoft-is-killing-groove-music-pass.html">now defunct Groove Music</a>. Oh well.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft Zune" class="wp-image-1807633" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Microsoft-Zune-CMS-primary.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>Microsoft Zune: it&rsquo;s the latest thing on Earth!</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>The Zune, however, became so ironically iconic that it even features in Microsoft&rsquo;s third <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> movie, where Star-Lord&rsquo;s stored music has moved from tape to digital. Microsoft embraced the trend by redesigning <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.zune.net/&amp;xcust=2-1-1803823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Zune.net</a>, which includes a movie clip to show that yes, the Zune is still cool. </p>



<h2 id="microsoft-band">Microsoft Band</h2>



<p>Another product that feels now like it was ahead of its time, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436251/living-with-the-microsoft-band-the-smartwatch-that-tries-to-do-everything.html">the Microsoft Band smartwatch</a> did many of the things modern fitness bands now do, but back in 2015: GPS, UV sensing, sleep sensing, tracking, stair tracking via a barometer, and more. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Band" class="wp-image-1807634" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Microsoft-Band-2-big.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Clunky, yes, but the Microsoft Band offered many of the features today&rsquo;s smartwatches do.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>But the Microsoft Band and Band 2 never really had the backing of Microsoft, and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/424174/microsoft-band-2-review-microsofts-designed-a-zune-smartwatch.html">solid Microsoft Band 2</a> was killed just a year after launch. At least Microsoft offered refunds for anyone who had bought one.</p>



<h2 id="microsoft-wireless-hardware">Microsoft Wireless hardware</h2>



<p>Microsoft eked out a small lineup of wireless hardware between 2002 and 2004, including the Wireless Base Station (MN-500) as part of its Microsoft Broadband Networking lineup. Wikipedia <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Broadband_Networking&amp;xcust=2-1-1803823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">reports</a> that Microsoft was actually second in the U.S. consumer router market during that time, but couldn&rsquo;t make the switch from 802.11b to 802.11g fast enough. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Wireless" class="wp-image-1807637" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Microsoft-wireless.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Microsoft routers had a reputation for being simple, but they couldn&rsquo;t keep up with competitors.</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/175653908987?_trkparms=amclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D1110006%26algo%3DHOMESPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D248861%26meid%3D06cdd3f3c8d74704b76679a0612fb309%26pid%3D101224%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D5%26sd%3D284302280557%26itm%3D175653908987%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2047675%26algv%3DDefaultOrganicWebV9BertRefreshRanker%26brand%3DMicrosoft&amp;_trksid=p2047675.c101224.m-1&amp;xcust=2-1-1803823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">eBay</a></div>



<p>That&rsquo;s a quick hook for a top product, but Microsoft has never had a great commitment to hardware unless it can be a prolonged, profitable success.</p>



<h2 id="microsoft-kinect">Microsoft Kinect</h2>



<p>Microsoft launched the Microsoft Kinect for the Xbox 360 in 2010, competing with Nintendo&rsquo;s Wii with a peripheral that simply recognized user actions through image recognition. Kinect proved to be a success until the launch of the Xbox One, when Microsoft made the peripheral mandatory. Users suddenly revolted, and Microsoft relented. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft Kinect" class="wp-image-1803874" height="768" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Microsoft-Kinect-large.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>The ability for your game console to just&hellip;<em>recognize</em> you was amazing. That was the Microsoft Kinect!</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>Still, by then the damage was done, and users didn&rsquo;t want to buy an expensive console <em>and</em> a peripheral. Kinect support was then <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/428068/microsoft-kills-kinect-support-in-xbox-ones-backward-compatibility-push.html">dumped as a backwards-compatibility feature</a>, too, until Kinect was finally killed in 2017. </p>



<p>Even though there were some odd charges levied against it (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/504514/is_microsoft_kinect_racist.html">was the Kinect racist</a>?) the Kinect should be recognized for what it eventually gave rise to: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/422745/hands-on-with-windows-10s-windows-hello-it-just-works.html">Windows Hello</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394379/windows-hello-webcams-you-can-buy-right-now.html">Windows Hello biometric webcams</a>. (The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/478506/microsoft_building_kinect_device_for_windows_pcs.html">Kinect also failed as a PC peripheral</a>, too.) Facial recognition is now part of our daily life, and Kinect helped bring it about. </p>



<h2 id="microsoft-hololens">Microsoft HoloLens (?)</h2>



<p>In January 2015, Microsoft invited the press to Redmond to launch the HoloLens, the best consumer demonstration I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Participants rewired live light switches with a remote assistant connected via a Skype overlay, &ldquo;walked&rdquo; on Mars, and played <em>Minecraft</em> on a coffee table. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/431414/hands-on-with-microsofts-hololens-the-3d-augmented-reality-future-is-now.html">It was mindblowing</a>. And PCWorld was the first to get an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/420304/hololens-uncensored-a-candid-hands-on-with-hololens-development-edition.html">uncensored hands-on with the HoloLens</a>, too.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft HoloLens" class="wp-image-611422" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hololens-Hachman.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Microsoft&rsquo;s HoloLens changed the world&hellip;and then it vanished.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>Unfortunately, the HoloLens never went anywhere. It was with a feeling of sadness that I wrote our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/403327/microsoft-hololens-what-made-it-great-and-what-a-new-hololens-needs.html">HoloLens retro review</a> in 2019, playing <em>RoboRaid</em> in a deserted office after hours. </p>

<p>Gaming monitors are expensive. The best models, like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html">Alienware AW3423DWF</a>, routinely sell above $1,000, and even midrange favorites like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/701844/acer-nitro-xv272-review-top-tier-gaming-on-a-1080p-monitor.html">Acer Nitro XV272</a> are often around $300. The Viewsonic Omni VX2716 undercuts most competitors at $150 and offers a good gaming experience despite cuts to build quality.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html">best gaming monitors</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="viewsonic-omni-vx2716-specs-and-features">Viewsonic Omni VX2716 specs and features</h2>



<p>The Viewsonic Omni VX2716 is a typical 27-inch 1080p budget monitor. It uses an IPS LCD display with an edge-lit LED backlight and offers few noteworthy features.</p>



<ul><li>Display size: 27-inch widescreen</li><li>Native resolution: 1920&times;1080</li><li>Panel type: IPS LCD</li><li>Refresh rate: 100Hz</li><li>Adaptive-Sync: AMD FreeSync</li><li>HDR: None</li><li>Ports: 1x HDMI 1.4, 1x DisplayPort 1.2, 1x 3.5mm audio-out</li><li>Stand adjustment: Tilt</li><li>VESA mount: Yes, 100x100mm</li><li>Speakers: Yes, 2x two-watt</li><li>Price: $149.99 MSRP</li></ul>



<p>Just one specification stands out: the refresh rate, which can reach 100Hz. That&rsquo;s not as high as other entry-level gaming monitors, which more often target 120Hz or 144Hz&mdash;but the VX2716 is less expensive, with an MSRP just under $150.</p>



<h2 id="viewsonic-omni-vx2716-design">Viewsonic Omni VX2716 design</h2>



<p>The Viewsonic Omni VX2716&rsquo;s tight budget is obvious the moment it&rsquo;s unboxed. The monitor&rsquo;s design is bland, with inexpensive plastics across the display bezel and stand. It lacks any distinct design features, striking an unremarkable look that fails to stand out. This, to be fair, is common for budget monitors, but I feel <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631916/acer-k242hyl-review.html">competitors like Acer </a>and Dell tend to look better in the sub-$200 arena.</p>

<p>The monitor also has a light, inexpensive stand that tends to wobble. It&rsquo;s easy to accidentally tilt or tip the monitor when it&rsquo;s bumped, or even when using the on-screen menu. The stand also requires installation of two screws (which are provided) to keep it secured. It&rsquo;s a minor annoyance not common on more expensive monitors, which often snap into place.</p>



<p>The stand is short, too, and lacks essential ergonomic adjustments like height and swivel, offering only a limited tilt function. Taller users will need to place the stand on a shelf, book, or box for a comfortable viewing angle. Viewsonic at least includes a 100x100mm VESA mount, offering support for third-party monitor stands and arms.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Viewsonic Omni VX2716 back" class="wp-image-1803867" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/viewsonic-vx2716-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Viewsonic Omni VX2716 is nothing to look at, but that&rsquo;s what you expect from a budget monitor.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<h2 id="viewsonic-omni-vx2716-features-and-menus">Viewsonic Omni VX2716 features and menus</h2>



<p>The VX2716 has one HDMI 1.4 and one DisplayPort 1.2 video input. That&rsquo;s acceptable, though not outstanding, connectivity for a monitor sold under $200. The monitor also has a 3.5mm audio output for audio connectivity with speakers or wired headphones. USB is completely lacking, so the monitor won&rsquo;t be useful as a USB hub.</p>



<p>Monitor options are controlled using an on-screen menu similar to other Viewsonic displays, though the range of options is limited. The monitor includes a number of vague preset modes (such as RTS and MOBA game modes). These are joined by a few more precise adjustments, such as color temperature and three-axis color adjustment. The monitor lacks gamma adjustment. Gamers gain access to a black stabilizer, which lifts shadows in dark scenes to make enemies visible.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The VX2716 offers a color gamut that spans 98 percent of sRGB and 85 percent of DCI-P3. That&rsquo;s a good result for the monitor&rsquo;s price range.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The menu relies on forward-facing buttons instead of a joystick or rear-facing buttons. This makes the controls easy to locate but proves a bit cumbersome, as the lightweight stand barely resets the force required to activate the buttons. I took to holding the monitor with my left hand while navigating the menus with my right.</p>



<p>Viewsonic throws in a pair of two-watt speakers. They&rsquo;re extremely weak, however, and only suitable for basic Windows systems sounds or <em>maybe</em> a podcast. Games, music, and movies are muddy and mashed, so external speakers or headphones are highly recommended. This, to be fair, is true of all budget monitors: No monitor in this price range offers a passable audio experience.</p>



<h2 id="viewsonic-omni-vx2716-sdr-image-quality">Viewsonic Omni VX2716 SDR image quality</h2>



<p>Image quality is just as important for budget monitors as more expensive alternatives&mdash;perhaps even more so, as the gap between the best and worst budget monitors is large. Fortunately, the Viewsonic Omni VX2716 offers strong SDR image quality for the price.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Viewsonic Omni VX2716 SDR brightness chart" class="wp-image-1803859" height="850" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/viewsonic-vx2716-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Brightness is certainly in the VX2716&rsquo;s favor with a maximum brightness of 354 nits, the second-highest in this comparison and beaten only by the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1063316/dell-g2723h-monitor-review.html">Dell G2723H</a>, which is typically $50 more expensive. The VX2716 is usable in a wide variety of situations and holds up well alongside bright sun-lit windows and intense overhead lighting. You&rsquo;ll be hard pressed to find any monitor in this price bracket with significantly superior brightness.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Viewsonic Omni VX2716 contrast ratio chart" class="wp-image-1803860" height="850" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/viewsonic-vx2716-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Contrast is decent with a maximum contrast ratio of 900:1. That&rsquo;s not an amazing result but, as the graph shows, it holds up nicely when compared to similarly priced monitors. The VX2716 offers modest depth and dimensionality and holds up well when viewed in a bright room. Its contrast limitations become obvious in dark content, as the display can look hazy and gray when it should appear dark.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Viewsonic Omni VX2716 color gamut" class="wp-image-1803862" height="830" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/viewsonic-vx2716-color-gamut.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The VX2716 offers a color gamut that spans 98 percent of sRGB and 85 percent of DCI-P3. That&rsquo;s a good result for the monitor&rsquo;s price range, matching or beating monitors such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1777291/benq-gw2785tc-review.html">BenQ GW2785TC</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631916/acer-k242hyl-review.html">Acer K242HYL</a>. However, the monitor&rsquo;s color may seem subdued when compared to alternatives towards the more expensive end of the budget monitor market, such as the Dell G2723H.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Viewsonic Omni VX2716 color accuracy" class="wp-image-1803861" height="902" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/viewsonic-vx2716-color-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Color accuracy is weak even when compared to other budget monitors. The VX2716 doesn&rsquo;t stand out as inaccurate or unrealistic when viewed on its own, but there&rsquo;s a slight shift in blue and yellow hues. Still, I think this is an acceptable result for a budget monitor and it&rsquo;s unlikely to stand out when compared to similarly priced displays.</p>



<p>The VX2716&rsquo;s lackluster accuracy may be linked to its default color temperature of 7100K, which is noticeably off the desired target of 6500K. This provides a cool, sterile, and clinical look. It can be fixed by setting the monitor&rsquo;s color temperature to Warm, but this pushes the color temperature to 6100K, which is a bit too warm.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Viewsonic Omni VX2716 menu" class="wp-image-1803868" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/viewsonic-vx2716-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Sharpness is acceptable. This is a 27-inch, 1080p monitor with a pixel density of roughly 81 pixels per inch. That&rsquo;s towards the low end of what&rsquo;s available on modern monitors, and it shows. Small text can appear pixelated and indistinct. On the plus side, however, the monitor uses a conventional subpixel and doesn&rsquo;t display a large gap between pixels, traits that make the most of the available pixel count. The VX2716&rsquo;s image may look soft, but it gets the job done.</p>



<p>The Viewsonic Omni VX2716&rsquo;s is a strong budget monitor but has clear limitations. I don&rsquo;t recommend this monitor to creators who need good color performance, and the lack of pixel density can cause games to look pixelated or soft. These problems are offset by an acceptable contrast ratio, high maximum brightness, and a color gamut that&rsquo;s a bit wider than typical for the monitor&rsquo;s price range. The monitor&rsquo;s SDR image quality isn&rsquo;t amazing but it&rsquo;s good for the price.</p>



<h2 id="viewsonic-omni-vx2716-hdr-image-quality">Viewsonic Omni VX2716 HDR image quality</h2>



<p>The Viewsonic Omni VX2716 lacks support for HDR. This isn&rsquo;t a surprise given the monitor&rsquo;s maximum SDR brightness of 350 nits and modest contrast. While a few budget displays claim HDR support, no display in this price range can deliver adequate HDR performance. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-FreeSync-Response-Adjustment/dp/B0B45GPTM3?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1803853-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Cooler Master Tempest GP27Q</a>, priced at $530, is the bare minimum for good HDR&mdash;and truly great HDR monitors are usually $1,000 or more.</p>



<h2 id="how-does-the-viewsonic-omni-vx2716-motion-perform">How does the Viewsonic Omni VX2716 Motion perform?</h2>



<p>Viewsonic advertises the Omni VX2716 as a gaming monitor and backs that up with a 100Hz refresh rate. This is an uncommon refresh rate (120Hz or 144Hz is more typical), and it&rsquo;s a bit disappointing that Viewsonic was unable to spring for 144Hz. The monitor also supports AMD FreeSync for smooth framing pacing with AMD video cards.</p>



<p>Motion clarity is adequate with some detail preserved in fast-moving objects. It&rsquo;s enough to make out the outlines of objects, but smaller details will be obscured. Scrolling test images of <em>League of Legends</em> showed that character silhouettes, map details, and hitpoint bars were visible, but character names and tick marks within hitpoint bars were unreadable in motion. Spell effects and fine map details, like the exact outlines of trees or brush, can prove difficult to see.</p>



<p>The VX2716 delivers an overall improvement over a 60Hz productivity or office monitor, but I would&rsquo;ve liked a higher refresh rate. Alternatives with a 120Hz, 144Hz, or 165Hz refresh rate are more expensive but often only by $20 or $30.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-viewsonic-omni-vx2716">Should you buy the Viewsonic Omni VX2716?</h2>



<p>Gamers looking to pick up a monitor for around $150 should give the Viewsonic Omni VX2716 a chance. It delivers good image quality and decent motion clarity for the price. Achieving these results on a tight budget means sacrificing build quality, however, and the 100Hz refresh rate is low for a gaming monitor.</p>
