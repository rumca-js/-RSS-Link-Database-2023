Our live album is </span>

<a href="https://kingfisherband.bandcamp.com/album/kingfisher-recorded-live">out
today</a>!  We'll have physical CDs around the end of May, and it
should be on streaming services at some point.  If you backed the
Kickstarter and haven't heard from us about your rewards, let me know!



<p>

Some background on the album if you're interested:

</p>

<p>

In late January I wrote to <a href="https://www.ceciliavacanti.com/">Cecilia</a> to ask what she'd
think of making a live album.  I'd been making good quality
multi-track recordings at most of our gigs, and we had a lot to work
with.  I sent her the first email at 5:38pm and by 8:06pm we had not
only agreed we wanted to do this but also agreed we both wanted <a href="https://danabillings.com/">Dana Billings</a> for editing and
mixing.  I wrote to Dana, he liked the idea, and we told him we'd get
back to him once we'd listened back over our tracks to figure out which
ones were our favorites.

</p>

<p>

This was a long and painful process: we had recordings from 146 sets
across 11 gigs, for a total of ~20hr of music.  I went through and
made scratch mixes of everything, and made a giant spreadsheet for
collecting ratings.  The initial idea was that we'd both rate each
track, but since I had more time (I could listen while watching kids
[1]) for many of them I did an initial rating and Cecilia only rated
the ones I'd marked as potentially good enough.

</p>

<p>

By early March we were pretty far along and I <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/live-kingfisher-album">wrote something
up</a> to gauge interest and ask how people usually funded albums
these days.  Several people recommended Kickstarter, so we decided
we'd probably do that.  A few days later we had agreement on three
tracks, <a href="https://kingfisherband.bandcamp.com/track/griffin-road">Griffin
Road</a>, <a href="https://kingfisherband.bandcamp.com/track/trip-to-moscow">Trip
to Moscow</a>, and <a href="https://kingfisherband.bandcamp.com/track/salt-river">Salt
River</a>, and we sent Dana what he needed to get started with mixing.
This included both the raw multitrack recordings, and edit notes.  For
example, on Griffin Road the initial edit notes were:

</p>

<p>

<i>
<ul>
<li>cut the second time through since the fiddle delay didn't work
</li>
<li>could cut the fourth time through for length
</li>
<li>the timing is off going into the eighth time through; could cut this
  time through or fix?
</li>
<li>the timing is off eight beats into what I think is the beginning
    of the 13th time through (~6:45) -- fix or cut?
</li>
<li>probably find 2-4 other times through to cut for length and interest?
</li>
</ul>
</i>

</p>

<p>

A week later Dana got back to us with the first mix, for Griffin Road,
and we were really happy.  Even having listened to the scratch mix
repeatedly I couldn't tell where the edits were: it just sounded
good.  Over the next few days he got back to use with additional
mixes, and we kept sending him additional tracks as we got agreement
on which ones we wanted to include.

</p>

<p>

In late March we started a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jefftk/kingfisher-recorded-live/">Kickstarter</a>
(<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/kingfisher-album-kickstarter">blog post</a>) to raise
funds to cover the mixing and editing, and a few days later Dana
finished his rough mixes.  We had been accumulating a big doc of
touchups, things like "fiddle is very slightly too quiet when things
come up around 3:45" or "drums could be slightly quieter around 5:03
when things come down and ramp back up during the build around 5:30",
and by the end of the month he had incorporated these and made
versions we were happy with.

</p>

<p>

We could have gone right to mastering at this stage, but instead we
wanted to run mixes by friends first.  A lot of people thought they'd
have time to review but didn't end up being able to, but <a href="https://soundcloud.com/christopherjacoby">Chris</a> and <a href="https://nathanbishopviolin.wixsite.com/music">Nathan</a> ended
up giving us detailed feedback.  One more round of touchups and we went
into mastering in mid-April, finishing around the end of
April.

In mid-March, sick with covid, Cecilia had painted the cover picture:

I was going to put together the CD jacket, but we wanted to include
photos, which meant waiting for good weather.  We were lucky with the
weather on the afternoon of May Day, and <a href="https://mirawhiting.com/">Mira Whiting</a> took some great
pictures of us at <a href="https://www.carverhillorchard.com/">Carver
Hill</a>.  After that things came together quickly, we sent the CD to
manufacturing on the 3rd.  Here are the CD proofs:

There was a little more messing around with getting the digital
distribution set up, including a lot of iteration where CD Baby has
very confusing handling of traditional tunes, and the digital version
is <a href="https://kingfisherband.bandcamp.com/album/kingfisher-recorded-live">out
today</a>!

</p>

<p>

Very excited and relieved to have this finished, and I hope you enjoy
it!

started another one.
