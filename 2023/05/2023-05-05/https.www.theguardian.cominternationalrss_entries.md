<p>Return to St James’ Park a year on from damaging defeat offers Arsenal chance to show they can now handle the pressure</p><p>There was a very strange moment for Arsenal just after the hour against Chelsea at the Emirates on Tuesday night, when those in red appeared intent on giving their opponents a helping hand, when it felt as though we were watching a computer game glitch.</p><p>Chelsea broke with four on two, a posse of additional Arsenal players straining to get back, only for N’Golo Kanté to make a poor attempt at the killer pass. No matter. The ball ricocheted off a couple of Arsenal players, nobody able to take charge of the situation and there was Noni Madueke, the Chelsea winger, close to the byline.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/05/artetas-road-to-redemption-marked-out-in-newcastle-black-and-white">Continue reading...</a>

## Steve Smith’s first Ashes warm-up with Sussex undone by sharp Tongue

<ul><li>Australian out for 30 but Cheteshwar Pujara makes 136</li><li>Rain may deny Smith second innings against Glamorgan</li></ul><p>Brexit benefits may seem few and far between but one upshot, cricket-wise, has been the decision to allow a second overseas player in the County Championship. At New Road on Friday this meant a chance to watch two modern day greats batting together and though one fell for a middling 30, the other peeled off a classical century.</p><p>Steve Smith was the former, his first outing with the bat for Sussex in this short pre-Ashes stint lasting 80 minutes before he was adjudged lbw to Worcestershire’s Josh Tongue. It looked to be a bail-trimmer at best, Smith struck above the knee roll by the right-armer. But without DRS at his disposal, Australia’s best-since-Bradman could only wrinkle his nose before clanking back up the metal steps of the Graeme Hick pavilion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/05/steve-smith-first-ashes-warm-up-with-sussex-undone-by-josh-tongue-glamorgan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Featherstone have won their first nine games of the season in the Championship. Next up they face local rivals Sheffield</p><p>By <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gavin-willacy">Gavin Willacy</a> for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook">No Helmets Required</a></p><p>Warrington got off to a flier in Super League, winning their first eight games, but Featherstone have gone one better in the Championship. Surely it’s finally their year? Both clubs are in great shape to top their divisions in September, although that alone will not satisfy their annual ambitions: for Warrington to be crowned champions for the first time since 1955, and for Featherstone to earn promotion back to the big league for the first time since 1995.</p><p>The question of who would stop Featherstone has had an obvious answer in recent seasons, be it Toronto, Toulouse or Leigh. This time any answer is more speculative. Recently relegated Toulouse are the obvious candidates given they have a similar budget and a mix of full-time and part-time players. They are second in the table, above Sheffield Eagles on points difference, with both clubs winning seven and losing two of their opening nine games.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2023/may/05/featherstone-super-league-promotion-sheffield-sunday">Continue reading...</a>

<p>China’s new world champion became the first since 1886 to lead the title match only in the final game, while the Norwegian implied he will play fewer classical tournaments</p><p>Ding Liren began his reign as the 17th world chess champion by setting a new record for the 49 title matches in the historic competition dating back to 1886. The modest 30-year-old was the first player ever to win the crown leading only in the final game, defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi in their fourth rapid tie-breaker following their 7-7 score in the regular classical series.</p><p>Ding also did it with a defining move. His 46…Rg6!, boldly playing for the win by self-pinning his rook, his second most powerful piece, against his own king, shocked the grandmaster commentators as well as his Russian opponent. It was also the right decision in the context of the match, which was about to go into five-minute blitz, a format where Ding only had an inactive over-the-board rating, and where his few online competitive games had been marred by disconnections and the need to start play in the middle of the night to match his European and US opponents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/05/chess-ding-sets-world-title-landmark-and-is-ready-to-take-on-carlsen">Continue reading...</a>
