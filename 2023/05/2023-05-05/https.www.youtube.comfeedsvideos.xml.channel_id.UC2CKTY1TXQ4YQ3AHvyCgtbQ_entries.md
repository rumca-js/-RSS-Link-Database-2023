Games Workshop has a great opportunity with the new Combat Patrol and 10th edition Warhammer 40,000 - and I think I know what they should do.

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Space Station Zero at http://www.spacestationzerogame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
