## Black Ops review – can you really make a hilarious comedy about police racism? Yes you can!

<p>This series about feckless community support officers infiltrating a drug gang is a pitch-perfect, star-packed joy. It spotlights racism while being a brilliantly fresh farce</p><p>Between the institutional racism, the institutional misogyny and the institutional homophobia, the Metropolitan police isn’t exactly steeped in hilarity. Can a new sitcom really mine some primetime BBC One belly laughs from the beleaguered institution?</p><p>It’s a big ask, but the answer – pretty miraculously – is yes. Black Ops follows two community support officers: the clever but unambitious Dom (Gbemisola Ikumelo) and the naive, uber-religious Kay (Hammed Animashaun). Their jobs are predictable, low-risk and questionnaire-centric – until they’re convinced to infiltrate a local gang as part of an “off the books” undercover operation. From there, Black Ops merges broad comedy with bent copper crime drama to hilarious and nail-biting effect. I won’t give away any of the myriad plot twists, but suffice to say there are some malevolent forces at play in the force itself. Or as Dom economically puts it: “This is some Line of Duty shit!”</p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0ff7v49">Black Ops is on BBC One and iPlayer</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/05/black-ops-review-met-police-comedy-race">Continue reading...</a>

## Osasuna’s Chimy Ávila: ‘In Argentina, it’s easier to pick up a gun than a ball’

<p>The bruising striker who grew up playing for money in tough Rosario neighbourhoods faces Real Madrid in Saturday’s cup final</p><p>“I wouldn’t call it pressure now: I love it.” Chimy Ávila, the Osasuna striker and human wrecking ball whose astonishing story is written all over his body, unfiltered and funny despite the sacrifice and suffering, pictures himself on the penalty spot. He sees Seville, the Copa del Rey final against Real Madrid, one shot to deliver his club’s first ever trophy. And, inevitably, he sees Empalme Graneros in Argentina, where he took so many, already playing for a living long before becoming pro. “It’s harder in the hood,” he says. On Saturday night Thibaut Courtois won’t be carrying a gun, for a start.</p><p>One of nine children, Ávila grew up in north-east Rosario in a neighbourhood where, he says, you never knew when the bullets would fly, gangs fought and he, too, went armed. His home had a tin roof that leaked when it rained and flew when it was windy, but also had a pitch just outside the door. “I would do anything for my daughter to go and play barefooted where I did, to come back with a muddy face, walk those dirty streets,” he says, and yet if there’s fondness there was a fear that forged him, too. You want pressure? Out there, where clandestine games were staged, scoring was survival. “This is different,” Ávila says. “This is a challenge, a nice one against the world’s best goalkeeper. Back then it could be against a goalkeeper with a gun around his neck.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/05/osasunas-chimy-avila-interview-copa-del-rey-final-real-madrid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rishi Sunak’s team had deliberately set expectations low, but not low enough</p><p>The opposition parties in England have good reason to be gleeful. Results from the local elections in 230 English councils show the Tories being <a href="https://twitter.com/drjennings/status/1654349653742108675" title="">squeezed </a>on both sides of the Brexit vote.

<p>The people are essential to monarchy; the power of performance lies in the response of the audience</p><p>Crowds will line the streets to take part in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/03/what-to-expect-at-the-kings-coronation-key-events-and-timings" title="">coronation</a>. But many present will later struggle to explain exactly why they were there. Witnessing a historic event might be the best answer. Though the spectacle may appeal to viewers, it is the monarchy that depends on it. It is not the people who need the king, but the king who needs the people: the power of performance lies in the response of the audience. The coronation of Charles III is theatre held to convey divine approval to the person of the monarch. It is a cruel irony that while the public are told to get used to being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/25/britons-need-to-accept-theyre-poorer-says-bank-of-england-economist" title="">poorer</a>, they are also the crucial props to the lavish excesses of royal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/how-coronation-of-king-charles-revive-oldest-british-rituals-westminster-abbey" title="">pomp</a> and circumstance.</p><p>Charles is a very different character from his mother. But the image projected of the monarch owes more to show and glamour than individual nature. That is why the paying public is expected to offer adulation, lest we disrupt the display with disturbing questions about the monarchy’s value and relevance. Such a thought ought to offend any modern sense Britain has of itself. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/25/prince-william-murdoch-phone-hacking-claims-court-filings-prince-harry" title="">scandals</a> of recent years have revealed the Windsors to be rather more <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/13/prince-andrew-epstein-sexual-abuse-investigation" title="">dysfunctional</a> than the average British household.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-coronation-crowds-the-public-are-crucial-for-royalty">Continue reading...</a>

## Society exposes us all to anti-Jewish tropes and attitudes. The first step is to notice them | Jonathan Freedland

<p>The Richard Sharp cartoon caused deep distress because it heightened the feeling that others don’t understand<strong> </strong>or care about antisemitism. That<strong> </strong>must change</p><p>For a week now, I’ve been bombarded with variations on the same question: “So what do you think about that cartoon?” The cartoon in question being the depiction of the outgoing BBC chair, Richard Sharp, which appeared on these pages last Saturday in a drawing swiftly denounced as loaded with age-old antisemitic tropes and then removed from the Guardian website later that same day. I didn’t want to sound off about the work of my colleagues on Twitter or on the radio, but I also thought it was a fair question to ask. After all, when other progressive institutions have committed similar offences I have not exactly held back. So here, on the pages of the Guardian itself, is what I think.<br /></p><p>When Labour was grappling with antisemitism in its ranks, I was careful to refer to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/18/labour-antisemitism-jews-jeremy-corbyn">not only the party</a> but also “the wider left”. Few British Jews kidded ourselves that this was a problem confined to one political group. Rather, I and others argued that what had surfaced, admittedly in vivid form in Labour, was a cast of mind, a way of seeing Jews, that had long existed in corners of the left, with roots that went decades – if not centuries – deep, and which stretched far beyond these shores. That view of Jews drew, in turn, on cultural ideas almost as old as civilisation itself, embedded in the core texts and artworks of Christianity, as well as in the words of our canonical writers: Chaucer, Shakespeare and Dickens.<br /><br />All this stuff informs how people see Jews, including even some of those who pride themselves on loathing racist prejudice. Which is why, although there was disappointment and hurt, there was no great surprise when, to pick just one example, the Royal Court theatre announced in 2021 a new play about a predatory, manipulative billionaire <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/06/antisemitism-row-forces-royal-court-theatre-to-change-name-of-character">named … Hershel Fink</a>. (We’ll come back to him later.) So long established are these lines of thought, no institution is immune. Not even the country’s finest liberal publications.<br /><br />Nearly a fortnight ago, the Observer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/success-for-women-not-same-as-for-men-letters">published a letter</a> from the veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott. In it she rejected the view that Jewish, Irish or Traveller people suffered racism. “Prejudice”, of the kind endured by white people with red hair, sure. But actual racism? No, the only people who faced that were people of colour, whether in the Jim Crow American south or apartheid South Africa.</p><p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the big cities that elect a third of their councillors at a time, one seat will represent more than 10,000 people, while in the smaller rural districts there may only be 1,000 people for every councillor. Labour making solid progress in urban marginals does less for the seat count. Correspondingly, there is more room for the other anti-Conservative parties with better prospects in rural England to gain impressive numbers of seats.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/05/labour-gains-give-party-hope-but-general-election-win-not-yet-certain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the woman who soundtracked Lesbian Vampire Killers to the daughter of a Polish refugee, the king has chosen an eclectic bunch. So what are we likely to hear?</p><p>Nobody thought that King Charles would sit back and let someone else choose all the <a href="https://www.royal.uk/coronation-music-commissions">music for his big day</a>. The list of 12 composers he has commissioned to write new pieces – chosen himself, we are told – does indeed bear a personal stamp. Nor will anyone be surprised that he has played things safe, leaning on composers who have written for royal occasions before, and with the central new anthem assigned to Andrew Lloyd Webber.</p><p>What those choices do suggest is that he understands the importance of representation. For one thing, nearly half the composers who have written new music for Saturday’s service are women – contrast this with his mother’s coronation in 1953, when all the commissions went to men. That’s quite a sea change in itself, one that you could argue was put in motion by the royal appointment nearly a decade ago of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/03/judith-weir-master-of-the-queens-music-candidate">Judith Weir, now the Master of the King’s Music</a>. Weir’s short overture Brighter Visions Shine Afar aims, she says, to set a tone of optimism and renewal – which is about as much as she or anyone else involved has been allowed to reveal in advance.

## ‘We’ve discovered the secret of immortality. The bad news is it’s not for us’: why the godfather of AI fears for humanity

<p>Geoffrey Hinton recently quit Google warning of the dangers of artificial intelligence. Is AI really going to destroy us? And how long do we have to prevent it?</p><p>The first thing Geoffrey Hinton says when we start talking, and the last thing he repeats before I turn off my recorder, is that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/02/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-quits-google-warns-dangers-of-machine-learning">he left Google, his employer of the past decade</a>, on good terms. “I have no objection to what Google has done or is doing, but obviously the media would love to spin me as ‘a disgruntled Google employee’. It’s not like that.”</p><p>It’s an important clarification to make, because it’s easy to conclude the opposite. After all, when most people calmly describe their former employer as being one of a small group of companies charting a course that is alarmingly likely to wipe out humanity itself, they do so with a sense of opprobrium. But to listen to Hinton, we’re about to sleepwalk towards an existential threat to civilisation without anyone involved acting maliciously at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/05/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-fears-for-humanity">Continue reading...</a>

## Love Again review – Céline Dion is the high note of sappy romcom

<p>A film about love after grief starring Priyanka Chopra Jonas works better as a vehicle for the singer than as a romance</p><p>There is something about Céline Dion that melts the stoniest of hearts. The French-Canadian singer, arguably the queen of the power ballad, is over the top, completely unsubtle, soaring against the boundaries of taste. She is also cheekily sincere, a true weirdo and so committed to the bit that she makes extreme cheesiness fun.</p><p>Such is the primary draw of Love Again, the big-screen adaptation of the German novel Text For You by Sofie Cramer, which packages a throwback romcom starring Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Outlander’s Sam Heughan as a Céline tribute vehicle. And it is, unsurprisingly, the main payoff of actually watching the movie, which marks the 55-year-old singer’s first feature film role (as herself, of course). Dion, also an executive producer, is responsible for a conservative 80% of the film’s comedy and the bulk of its charm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/05/love-again-review-celine-dion-priyanka-chopra-jonas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What could be more fitting for the coronation than a bowl (or vol-au-vent) you can eat with one hand while holding a glass of bubbly in the other?</p><p>Despite its regal branding, chicken à la king reminds me of school dinners. How the mighty have fallen: the boozy, truffle-laced treat of the early 20th century reduced to rubbery chicken in a floury white sauce by its close. But, though the dish seems to have been created in the restaurants of the US rather than the royal palaces of Europe (the legendary New York Times food editor Craig Claiborne <a href="https://app.ckbk.com/recipe/crai15990c05s001r015/chicken-a-la-king">remembered it as “standard party fare”</a> during his 1920s Southern childhood), it’s still a sound choice for coronation celebrations.</p><p>First, because the name fits, second, because both chicken and cream are perennial crowdpleasers, and third, because it’s perfect buffet fare – as the <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780199734962.001.0001/acref-9780199734962;jsessionid=EE83957E4E79C416EEDC063BF6235A1D">Oxford Encyclopaedia of Food and Drink in America</a> notes, in its heyday, the dish was particularly popular in tearooms, because it “could be eaten in a most ladylike way without picking up a knife”. Which also makes it ideal for consumption around the television set, or at a street party, should either of those figure in your plans. And if you’re ignoring the whole affair, you can, as Colman Andrews suggests in <a href="https://app.ckbk.com/recipe/ever90215c22s001ss001r001/chicken-a-la-king">his book Everything on the Table</a>, call it “diced chicken in egg-thickened white-pepper sherry-cream sauce with pimentos and mushrooms on toast, if it makes you feel more contemporary”.

<p>It’s time to ditch the cross body satchel for a more chic shoulder bag – but you’ll have to pack light</p><p>The last time we bought a family car, a decade ago now, we got an automatic one instead of a manual one. So much easier to drive. A no-brainer, really. But I completely failed to anticipate, somehow, that by switching to an automatic I would forget how to use gears. I deskilled myself by accident.</p><p>And now I’ve gone and done the same thing all over again, except my error this time is in a much more serious field. This time it’s about handbags, which are obviously much more important than the trifling matter of cars. Sometime around the end of the noughties, you see, Mulberry brought out the <a href="https://www.mulberry.com/gb/shop/women/bags?cat_family=Alexa" title="">Alexa</a> satchel, and the cross-body bag was suddenly everywhere. After years of hooking a strap over my shoulder and clamping a handbag to my side under my arm, I switched to a cross-body with a strap long enough that you could sling your bag across your body like a sash, so that it bumped merrily against your hip as you walked along without you having to hold on to it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/may/05/im-happy-the-shoulder-bag-is-back-now-i-need-to-relearn-how-to-wear-one">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Booze for the big day, whether you want to raise a toast to the new king with a red or dodge the pomp altogether with a nutty ale</p><p>Recommending drinks for coronation weekend in the Guardian is a tricky business that’s almost certain to bring the wrath of 50% of commenters down on my head. There are those who feel – and quite fairly – that this is a unique occasion, the like of which you may not see again in your lifetime, while others will simply use it to take advantage of the long weekend and bury themselves in the depths of the country, far from a broadband connection, where they can try to forget the whole thing is happening at all. While I’m personally tempted by the latter strategy, I recognise that the needs of the former camp are particularly relevant this week, so I have come up with a few practical solutions.</p><p>Let’s run through some possible scenarios. Maybe you’ve been dragooned into a family get-together with Daily Mail-reading relatives who are taking the event <em>very</em> seriously and feel it should be celebrated in style? In which case, I’d recommend one of the special coronation cuvées that have recently hit the shelves. Not that they come cheap: <a href="https://nyetimber.com/product/kings-coronation-classic-cuvee-multi-vintage-wine/">Nyetimber’s</a>, for example, is all of £39.50, whereas you can get M&amp;S’s Balfour Coronation Cuvée in store (and <a href="https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-coronation-balfour-classic-cuvee-english-sparkling-wine-606954011">from Ocado</a>) for £23. If you’re near a branch of Laithwaites, meanwhile, you might want to lay in a few bottles of Long Live the King Cabernet Sauvignon (see today’s pick) and/or a bottle of Windsor Great Park Gin (<a href="https://www.laithwaites.co.uk/product/4154622">£35.95 Laithwaites</a>, 40%), which would be a good bottle to take to a coronation party. Or, if beer’s more your thing, Sainsbury’s has a cracking 7% <a href="https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/sainsburys-coronation-ale-taste-the-difference-500ml">Coronation ale in its Taste the Difference range</a> at £2.50 for 500ml.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/05/what-to-drink-to-celebrate-or-hide-from-the-coronation-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

In the first half of Mufaro Makubika’s smart dramatisation, the reporting happens through the collective act of dancing and game-playing, through which the children innocently re-enact the lynchings and robberies they have witnessed, as well as trying to administer their own cures (a game of doctors over Chipo’s rounded belly involves some excruciating business with a coat hanger). This keeps the tone lively and funny at the cost of some of the novel’s political horror.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/05/we-need-new-names-review-brixton-house-london-noviolet-bulawayo">Continue reading...</a>

## So Britain is world-beating at something after all: batshit royal pageantry | Marina Hyde

<p>Our living standards may be slipping behind those of far less wealthy countries, but do they have a holy spoon to anoint their leaders?</p><p>Are you all set for the coronation? Whether you plan to pay the “people’s homage” – swearing aloud the newly proposed oath of allegiance to the king while watching it at home – is, of course, a private matter between you and your television set. This morning, Charles’s friend Jonathan Dimbleby suggested that this faintly controversial innovation was some ghastly evangelical idea of the archbishop of Canterbury’s (I paraphrase), and that Charles himself would find it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/charles-would-find-oath-of-loyalty-abhorrent-says-jonathan-dimbleby?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_medium&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1683271708">“abhorrent”</a>. Which feels fairly definitive.</p><p>Even if the archbish hasn’t made a bish, it must be said that the full-spectrum reverence of the run-up to the coronation can leave one always on the point of collapsing into giggles. I hugely enjoyed <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/how-the-coronation-spoon-was-saved/">a Spectator article</a> this week about the spoon used to anoint the sovereign with holy oil, which was described as a “very special one” (agreed), “one of the most beautiful examples of that humble genus” (OK), and “doubtless the world’s most important spoon” (sorry, I’ve gone).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/05/britain-world-beating-royal-pageantry-coronation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A first look at the forthcoming Dune sequel pulls us back into the strange sandpit. But how much farther into Frank Herbert’s psychedelic universe is Denis Villeneuve likely to venture?</p><p>• <strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> this article includes plot details from several of Herbert’s Dune novels, including the ending of the first</p><p>It has often been noted that George Lucas’s 1977 film Star Wars was greatly influenced by Frank Herbert’s Dune. The desert-covered central planet; the blending of religion and magic to the point where they are virtually indistinguishable; the depiction of a galaxy where democracy has failed and gilded nobles battle for control of solar systems: all are present in both works of sci-fi-fantasy. And yet Dune is not Star Wars, even if Part Two, the first trailer for which dropped this week, will without doubt provide audiences with the burgeoning saga’s most Star Wars-like moment so far.</p><p>In 2021, the first part of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune adaptation managed the remarkable feat of keeping us interested despite focusing almost entirely on the horrifying fall of House Atreides at the hands of the putrid and relentless Harkonnens, and leaving any sense of hope and future glory seemingly buried deep beneath the sand dunes. In the book, there is always a sense that the Atreides’ forebears as rulers of Arrakis are going to get their comeuppance, because scion Paul is clearly going to end up as the Bene Gesserit’s predicted messiah and probably take over the known universe. In the film there are fewer hints but it matters less, because the sci-fi eye candy on display is like nothing we’d seen before on the big screen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/05/dune-part-2-denis-villeneuve">Continue reading...</a>

## Cupid’s arrow: how Fifty Fifty became the rare K-pop band to pierce the UK Top 40

<p>The product of meticulous planning by an independent record label, the girl band’s success represents a new hunger in K-pop for global audiences</p><p>K-pop often appears to be thriving in the UK: prior to their hiatus, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/bts">BTS</a> had back-to-back No 1 albums and acts such as boyband Ateez fill arenas, while girl group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/02/blackpink-review-o2-arena-london">Blackpink</a> are gearing up to headline a vast outdoor show in Hyde Park this summer. But the reality is hit K-pop songs are rare here, seldom breaking the singles chart – which makes the current Top 20 success of Fifty Fifty all the more unusual.</p><p>With their song Cupid set to climb from No 18 to break the Top 10 this week, the quartet are only the second K-pop girl group after Blackpink to break into the Top 40, despite debuting just six months ago. Cupid eschews the genre-clashing chaos of many K-pop hits to focus on a nostalgic sound – sweet but sardonic pop reminiscent of hits by Ariana Grande and Doja Cat, buoyed by the band’s harmonies, a rap by member Keena and, naturally, a massive key change. “Being in a K-pop group with a K-pop song charting in the UK charts is very hard, that’s what we’ve heard,” says Fifty Fifty member Aran. “So it’s a great honour for us.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/05/fifty-fifty-k-pop-uk-top-40">Continue reading...</a>

By 2000 most had become republics, with the exceptions being Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the UK and Spain.

The pair go way back, to 2010 and Fred again..’s mid-teens, when a mutual friend invited the boy who was then just Fred Gibson to join a singing group of Eno’s. Eno is not his godfather, as has been widely rumoured, but he quickly became a mentor, bringing him on to co-production projects. Gibson also went to a very posh boarding school and descends from an aristocratic family line: making an album with an axis of his already considerable privilege has already riled many in the dance underground.</p><p>’Twas ever thus in a scene that is, sometimes for worse but mostly for better, always patrolling the nebulous boundaries of the genre’s mainstream and suspicious of interlopers, particularly monied ones. But there’s a much larger audience on the other side of that wall: Gibson’s fanbase of young ravers who adore his garage-adjacent tracks and dextrous live drum programming, his most successful solo phase after years of also-very-successful pop and rap production for others including Ed Sheeran. With intensity and density maxed out, his work can be brilliant, as on tracks such as Delilah, Jungle and Baxter, which seem to fishtail through their respective raves. And even if his guest vocalists can let him down – such as the colossally annoying Blessed Madonna speeches on his big Covid hit Marea (We’ve Lost Dancing) – he often writes bright, insidious melodies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/05/fred-again-and-brian-eno-secret-life-review-ambient">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s apathy over the king, frustration in the football, and Great Expectations disappoints</p><p>For one of the jubilees – I can’t remember which one as there have been so many of them and we have lived in the same house for nearly 30 years – it seemed as if you couldn’t move for street parties in our patch of south-west London.

<p>Excitement is building for next week’s song contest in Liverpool – but Britain hasn’t won since 1997. Artists from Blue and Bonnie Tyler to Scooch and SuRie reveal what disastrous scores meant for their careers</p><p>Duncan James was feeling quietly confident, and perhaps with good reason. “All the bookies were behind us,” he says. “Paddy Power had us as favourites to win.” It was 2011, and Blue – one of those rare British boybands whose career was stretching on into adulthood – had been tempted out of semi-retirement to represent the UK at Eurovision. The band had taken a break back in 2005, James says, “to pursue different areas of the entertainment business”. But the BBC, which screens the singing competition each year and helps oversee the UK’s choice of entry, had come calling because it found itself in a tight spot. After several years of poor (and sometimes catastrophic) results, they urgently required a safe pair of hands. Blue were already established, and enduringly popular. They’d excel, surely?</p><p>“Well, that was the hope,” James says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/05/british-eurovision-flops-on-25-years-of-hurt">Continue reading...</a>

It’s possibly less likely that you’ve actually <em>heard</em> them: they have released just the one track so far. Despite this, in the last fortnight the band have received breathless write-ups everywhere from <a href="https://www.rollingstone.co.uk/music/features/meet-the-last-dinner-party-who-might-just-be-your-favourite-new-band-28599/">Rolling Stone</a> to <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/a-phenomenally-exciting-new-band-the-last-dinner-party-at-camden-assembly-reviewed/">the Spectator</a>, for their raucous live performances and baroque-inflected pop.</p><p>That sudden rush of hype has sparked a backlash: eyebrows raised on social media over the band’s big-name management and major label status; whispers about them being “industry plants” or – even worse – nepo babies. Which in turn has prompted a pointed rebuttal from the band (Not nepo babies! Not manufactured!) and their supporters. All of this, in the best part of a fortnight. The discourse is already in runaway train mode, and if you’ve been following it all you may have already had your fill. But I do think there’s something fascinating about the whole affair – a mix of old-school buzz band hype, and very modern concerns about the music industry and who rises and falls within it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/05/the-guide-the-last-dinner-party-music">Continue reading...</a>

## Jordan Neely, a vulnerable young man, was killed – and not by his medical history | Moustafa Bayoumi

<p>Much of the talk has been about Neely’s mental health –  in large part so we don’t have to talk about our larger societal health</p><p>Jordan Neely was choked to death in the middle of the day on a New York City subway car on Monday, and since then people from New York City’s leaders to media commentators have put the focus on the 30-year-old Black man’s mental health. The New York governor Kathy Hochul <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/transit/2023/05/03/manhattan-da-investigating-death-of-man-choked-on-subway">stated</a> that “some of the factors” in Neely’s death were “people who are homeless in our subways, many of them in the throes of mental health episodes”. Mayor Eric Adams <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/04/jordan-neely-eric-adams-nypd-subway-killing-response">spoke</a> about “serious mental health issues in play here”. John Macari, a retired New York police lieutenant and podcaster <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-subway-chokehold-death-jordan-neely-probed-senior-prosecutors-protesters-clash-police">told</a> Fox News: “You have people commuting on a train who have to deal with mentally ill people who are a danger to themselves and others.”</p><p>But Jordan Neely didn’t kill himself. He was killed, and not by his medical history. A 24-year-old white ex-marine put him in a chokehold for “some 15 minutes,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/05/02/shocking-video-shows-vagrant-being-choked-to-death-on-nyc-subway/">according</a> to Juan Alberto Vazquez, a witness at the scene, and the medical examiner has ruled Neely’s death a homicide. So instead of focusing on Neely’s past, maybe we should be asking what kind of kind of state of mind does it take to strangle a man to death in public.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/05/jordan-neely-subway-death-new-york-society">Continue reading...</a>

## Abbott Elementary’s Lisa Ann Walter: ‘To play a teacher and honour them is really important’

<p>Still recognised for The Parent Trap, the actor was quietly planning her retirement until a role with a connection to her educator mum turned things around</p><p>From the moment she joins our Zoom call from her Los Angeles kitchen, Lisa Ann Walter is beaming. “This is supposed to be our hiatus from filming Abbott Elementary,” she starts, “but I’m busier than ever, and won’t have any downtime until we’re back on set again. Honestly? It’s exhausting.” Usually, when promo interviews start like this, it’s a sign that what follows might be terse and testing. Walter’s ear-to-ear grin, however, makes it clear she has no complaints about the newly hectic nature of her professional life. “You don’t stop when you’re lucky enough to be on a hit,” she reckons. “You’ve got to take advantage of it.”</p><p>Since Abbott Elementary first hit US screens in late 2021, it has become a TV juggernaut. The heartwarming Philadelphia-set mockumentary school sitcom – in which Walter co-stars as no-nonsense teacher Melissa Schemmenti in an under-resourced but much-loved primary school – is a network show bucking trends and breaking records. It’s already bagged three Golden Globes, three Emmys and too many other awards to mention. It has proved a standout success with critics and audiences alike. The 22-episode second season is now available to view; a third is already in development.

<p>At Westminster Abbey this weekend, ancient coronation bling such as the stone of destiny and St Edward’s staff is set to wow onlookers</p><p>When King Charles enters Westminster Abbey for the coronation ceremony on Saturday, he will be preceded, among many other items of royal bling, by a short gold rod topped with a small cross, known as <a href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/31717/st-edwards-staff">St Edward’s staff</a>. Unlike the stone of destiny, the sword of mercy or the bracelets of sincerity and wisdom – all real items of regalia that will play symbolic roles in the ceremony – the staff has no role whatsoever. It is carried in at the start of the service, set on the altar, and then carried out again at the end.</p><p>In fact, no one has any idea what St Edward’s staff is meant to represent. When Charles II, restored to the throne in 1660 after the English Civil War, ordered his goldsmiths to remake the crown jewels that had been sold or melted down by parliamentarians, the inventory of items that had been lost included a staff of Saint Edward. And so one was made to replace it – an important symbol of <em>something</em>, even if no one could remember what.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/how-coronation-of-king-charles-revive-oldest-british-rituals-westminster-abbey">Continue reading...</a>

## Short on space? How to grow healthy veg in pots and bags

<p>Beware of terracotta, embrace grow bags – and don’t forget to fertilise</p><p>When May comes around, I have to face the sowing choices I made in February. I always sow more plants than I have space for in case of germination failures or seedling losses. But if all the seeds sprout and all the young plants survive, I start summer with more plants than I have room for in my veg patch. And judging by all the tomato plants appearing by my neighbours’ garden gates for 50p each, I’m not the only one.</p><p>When I wrote my first book – <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-grow-your-dinner-9781786277145?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article" title="">How to Grow Your Dinner Without Leaving the House</a> – I wanted to encourage aspiring gardeners to make the most of small growing spaces, so I decided to write about planting crops in containers. As long as you have access to a space that gets a good amount of sunlight, it’s a great entry point for new gardeners, more accessible for those with limited mobility (put your pots on a table!) and a way for those who are renting or have modest, paved gardens to grow edible plants.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/05/how-to-grow-healthy-veg-in-pots-and-bags">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As Eastwind Books of Berkeley shutters in California, local residents mourn the loss of a community</p><p>The author Hua Hsu remembers going to Eastwind Books of Berkeley as a kid. His parents would drive 50 miles north from their home in Cupertino to the small shop near the Berkeley campus. There, his parents, Taiwanese immigrants, would buy books and newspapers from Asia that they couldn’t find elsewhere in the Bay Area.</p><p>Later, when Hsu – now a staff writer at the New Yorker and author of the National Book Critics Circle award-winning memoir Stay True – was in college at the University of California, Berkeley, he developed his own relationship with the store, mostly as a place where ethnic studies and Asian American studies professors had students buy their books for class.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/05/eastwind-books-berkeley-california-closes-asian-american-bookstore">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He has worked with Miles Davis, been sampled by Jay-Z, and has now made his first album in 25 years. He explains how going on TikTok helped him rediscover his cosmic keyboard sound</p><p>Over the last 60 years, keyboardist Lonnie Liston Smith has made an artform out of countering some of jazz music’s loudest heavyweights with a soft, sensuous sound. His is the gently radiating electric piano or undulating organ backing bandmates including Miles Davis, as well as the the hard-blowing free-jazz saxophonist Pharoah Sanders and energetic multi-instrumentalist Rahsaan Roland Kirk.</p><p>As a bandleader since the 1970s, Smith has explored spiritual themes with dancefloor grooves and free-flowing improvisations, popularising what would come to be known as jazz-funk fusion. “People have called me the godfather of fusion, or the creator of the cosmic sound,” Smith says. “I was just trying to play a universal music – something that would speak to everyone.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/05/jazz-lonnie-liston-smith-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Perfect party or picnic fare: salty-sour watermelon, ginger and avocado rice paper wraps; halloumi, feta and herb filo cigars; and boozy, prawn-cocktail brioche rolls in a bloody mary-flavoured mayonnaise</p><p>Rice paper, filo and bread rolls are excellent vehicles for transporting tasty things straight into your mouth without the need for a knife and fork. Here, a little filling goes a long way, but the aim is to cram as much into them to create bold, loaded parcels that smack with flavour. Their success depends on balance, textural contrast, lots of herbs and the freshest ingredients. They are ideal for feeding a hungry crowd and are especially good for picnics and summer entertaining. Salty, sharp, tangy, juicy – these rolls are wholly satisfying.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/05/sandwich-picnic-rolls-recipes-triple-cheese-avocado-bloody-mary-stuffed-rolls-ravinder-bhogal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Stories of women supporting one another in the community are heartening, but more volunteer birth partners are needed</p><p>It feels trite to say that pregnancy and birth can be the most vulnerable experiences in a woman’s life, and yet there is a need to say it, still, because so much of that physical experience feels untranslatable.

What saved me was my husband, my birth partner.</p><p>The role of the birth partner has increased in importance in recent decades; we are far removed from the days when our grandfathers were told to stay outside the birthing room because of the old belief that men would faint.

Squadrons offers a decent facsimile of X-Wing’s granular space battles, from its carefully crafted missions to its hallmark power-shunting mechanic, which lets you divert your ship’s power to different systems for a tactical advantage. What earns Squadrons a place on this list, however, is its VR functionality. Plugging a VR headset into this game transforms it from a glossy throwback into an essential experience, bringing Star Wars’ space dogfighting to life like nothing else.

## August in England review – Lenny Henry’s remarkable one-man show about the Windrush scandal

<p><strong>Bush theatre, London<br /></strong>The actor makes his debut as a playwright with a richly detailed character study, performing with warm humour and outrage at injustice</p><p>‘Have you seen Theresa May dance? Now <em>that’s</em> a hostile environment.” When the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/dancing-queen-theresa-may-steps-out-again">former UK prime minister</a> is introduced halfway through Lenny Henry’s one-man show about the Windrush scandal, she is swiftly dismissed. It’s one more punchline as Henry holds court with a bountiful supply of jokes, accompanied by near constant reggae. Upon taking the stage as August Henderson he is equal parts standup working the club and party host keeping guests lubricated. Drinks are handed out to the audience from a trolley.</p><p>We join August at home, Jesus and Bob Marley side by side on the wall of Natalie Pryce’s snug set, as he recounts his 52 years in England since arriving from Jamaica on his mother’s passport aged eight. Before May pops up, there are sparing flash-forwards to the devastating impact of her government’s immigration policy on the Windrush generation. August flinches as CCTV footage of his eventual wrongful detention briefly plays on the back wall. But this story is lighter and more linear than Roy Williams’ powerful contribution to the BBC’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0002sqv">Soon Gone</a> series of Windrush monologues, in which Henry’s character Cyrus was introduced in the grip of confusion, his past and present entwined in a tragic spiral.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/05/august-in-england-review-bush-theatre-london-lenny-henry">Continue reading...</a>

## Silo review – this rich dystopian drama is absolutely thrilling

<p>Apple TV+’s adaptation of a novel about a post-apocalyptic, bunker-dwelling civilisation provides an utterly fantastic story. It builds its world meticulously  – and packs plenty of punch</p><p>Silo, Apple TV+’s 10-part adaptation of the first book in Hugh Howey’s bestselling trilogy of the same name, is not for the claustrophobic. The world-building is meticulous, and that world is almost entirely underground. The last few thousand people left alive on Earth at some unspecified (but we suspect not too distant) time in the future have been confined in a multilevel, self-sustaining, subterranean silo while they wait for the planet to recover from whatever toxic event rendered it uninhabitable. No one knows when this will be, just as they don’t know who built the silo, since a rebellion in the past erased their history. The set designers and CGI wizards have had a field day crafting an environment whose futuristic bones are now only just visible beneath shrouds of grime and the kind of Heath Robinsonesque clutter that is bound to accumulate in a sealed human vault over time. It’s Soviet architecture meets steampunk medieval and the rendering of the silo’s different sections, from hydroponic farms to medical centres, make the place almost a character in its own right.</p><p>The story is equally thrilling and, as the plot thickens with almost every scene and does not stop even at the very last moment (a second series has already been commissioned, as well it should), equally oppressive.</p><p>Silo is on Apple TV+ now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/05/silo-review-this-rich-dystopian-drama-is-absolutely-thrilling">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Diatribe Records)</strong><br />Free jazz, opera, hymns, punk and newscasts intermingle in an oddly compelling sonic collage addressing issues of asylum and migration</p><p>Anyone who has heard the Beatles’ Revolution No 9 will be familiar with <em>musique concrète</em>: a compositional style based around the manipulation of existing recordings and found sounds, one pioneered by the likes of Pierre Schaeffer, Edgard Varèse and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Sovereign Bodies/Ritual Taxonomy is very much a sound collage in this vein: a jarring sonic montage assembled by Belfast-based composer Jamie Thompson featuring snatches of free jazz, opera, hip-hop, electronica, spoken word and broadcast news. It sounds like someone maniacally dialling between multiple stations on multiple radios.</p><p>Crucially, however, these disparate snippets of music have been specifically recorded for this project. And, as the album progresses, you realise that it is not random or formless, but a virtual audio drama themed around asylum and migration, displacement and assimilation, detention centres and perilous boat journeys. The few male voices here represent bureaucratic authority; the rest are female voices of resistance. The spoken-word poet Felicia Olusanya serves as a kind of narrator; the voice of operatic soprano Amy Ní Fhearraigh is put on to dubplates and manipulated by turntablist Mariam Rezaei; saxophonist Catherine Sikora Mingus howls over a doomy gothic chorale.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/05/adjunct-ensemble-sovereign-bodies-ritual-taxonomy-review">Continue reading...</a>

As he was recovering he was told he’d need to avoid stress. Which, as a political columnist for the Guardian, given the state of things, was no easy task. This book is pitched as an attempt to find a path back to engaging with current affairs without ending up in an ambulance again.</p><p>The good news is that Behr has avoided any further trips to the hospital. The bad news is that he still seems pretty annoyed.

<p>What’s it like to share a carriage with Charles and Camilla? Still waiting for my invitation to the coronation, I grabbed a ride with a pair of lookalikes – and even made it into Buckingham Palace</p><p>This Saturday at 10.20am, all eyes will be on King Charles and Camilla as they travel the 1.3 miles from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey in their £1.5m Diamond jubilee state coach. That’s roughly a £10 ride in an Uber. At 1pm, they will return to Buckingham Palace in their £3.5m gold state coach, again drawn by six Windsor Grey horses. There they will appear on the balcony for a ceremonial flypast. Or, if you prefer, <a href="https://www.channel4.com/tv-guide/2023/05/06">Channel 4</a> is showing Frasier, Johnny English Strikes Again and Formula E.</p><p>What does it feel like knowing half of the world will be settling down with their prosecco and Pringles to gawp at you?

But I <em>can</em> find out what it’s like to be part of the royal fuss.

The contest is notorious for thrusting the cheesiest, most bombastic pop it can find into 180 million people’s living rooms every May, and most of the artists playing 2023’s edition in Liverpool on 13 May will cleave to one of two formulas: Europop bangers, or earnest ballads delivered with beseeching, outstretched arms.</p><p>Yet since the turn of the century, Eurovision’s love for singalong anthems and OTT theatre has unintentionally made it perfect for a genre that positions itself as pop’s polar opposite: heavy metal. The genre has employed larger-than-life drama ever since Iron Maiden started taking a 10ft-tall zombie on tour; even the most satanic black metal heretics often take to the stage in facepaint. And so nearly every Eurovision throws up a ferocious metal curveball, the most famous being the orc-cosplaying Lordi who won for Finland in 2006 with Hard Rock Hallelujah. Other memorable performances include those by Icelandic electro-goth BDSM troupe Hatari in 2019, bare-chested Finns Teräsbetoni in 2008, and Eldrine, an Evanescence-esque Georgian band in 2011.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/05/metal-at-eurovision-lordi-maneskin-voyager-lord-of-the-lost">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former amateurs have risen from obscurity and hired Owen Coyle but there are questions over the Glasgow club’s funding and sustainability</p><p>Depending on one’s outlook, Friday evening in the unlikely surroundings of Ochilview Park could either see a Scottish football fairytale come to life or the latest temporary vindication of the boom-or-bust culture that has scarred the game in the past. Queen’s Park, who were amateurs for more than a century and proud of it, will earn a place in the top flight as a professional team if they defeat Dundee. But for an Arsenal-esque stumble – Queen’s have won one of their past six games – promotion would already have been secured.</p><p>Sixty-five years have passed since Queen’s, formed in 1867 and Scotland’s oldest league club, played top-division football. In those more simple times of 1957-58, Hearts secured the title at a canter from the Old Firm as The Spiders won four matches out of 34. In the intervening decades Queen’s have generally floated around the nether regions of Scotland’s league structure. They were a cuddly club, untouched by the corporate classes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/05/queens-park-close-to-scottish-top-flight-return-but-there-is-sting-to-this-fairytale">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Blume’s groundbreaking books shepherded me and millions of others through the trials of adolescence – and they’re still as relevant as ever</p><p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that being a teenage girl sucks.

## Erling Haaland has broken a Premier League record but not Dixie Dean’s

<p>Haaland has overtaken Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, but is still some way short of Dean’s tally of 60 goals in the 1927-28 season</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/paulmcparlan">Paul McParlan</a> for <a href="https://thesefootballtimes.co/">These Football Times</a></p><p>There is a statue on the perimeter of Goodison Park that commemorates the most prolific goalscorer England has ever produced. He scored 60 league goals in one season and, more than 40 years after his death, is still the yardstick against which all strikers are judged. That man is Dixie Dean.</p><p>William Ralph Dean was born in Birkenhead in January 1907. Although the nickname “Dixie” persisted throughout his career, he detested it and anybody careless enough to address him as Dixie was reminded his name was Bill. As a kid he was known as “Digsy” due to a street game of tag, which involved digging your fist into the back of somebody you had tagged. When he started playing for the Wirral railway company’s football team as a teenager, establishing a reputation as a goalscoring prodigy, local press reports referred to him as “Dixie” rather than “Digsy” and the name stuck.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2023/may/05/dixie-dean-premier-league-record-alan-shearer-andy-cole">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Captured Tracks)<br /></strong>With their classic late-60s songwriting and beautiful harmonies, the New York duo have never mined the past more effectively than on this fourth album </p><p>Musical pastiche can be dangerous. When you go beyond having influences to embodying those<em> </em>influences, artists can easily slip into self-parody. You need spectacularly good songs to pull it off. The Lemon Twigs, a US duo who have often been dangerously close to mere cosplay – perpetually caught in a time vortex where they get sent back to 1967 every time they reach 1976 – have managed it with historic aplomb on their fourth album.</p><p>The biggest touchstone is the beautifully harmonised existential dread of the Beach Boys post-Pet Sounds flop era: rarely has stark despair (one song is called Every Day Is the Worst Day of My Life) sounded so lovely. There’s also pre-disco Bee Gees, Byrds psych-pop, Simon &amp; Garfunkel and James Taylor’s sturdy craft, and a touch of classic rock on What You Were Doing (which also recalls Teenage Fanclub, and their own harking back).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/05/the-lemon-twigs-everything-harmony-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Suede bassist’s alternative-history romp through the theatres and over the rooftops of Elizabethan London is full of charm and vigour</p><p>The Ghost Theatre begins with a London rooftop chase worthy of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/mission-impossible">Mission: Impossible</a>. Our young heroine, Shay, hurtles above Eastcheap and St Peter’s Hill, St Paul’s Church a landmark in the near distance. “She came down with a crash, sending a flock of pigeons skywards in a soft explosion of feathers. They spread like a fountain and she repeated the catechism under her breath: <em>The gods are birds and the birds are gods</em>. She let its cadence guide her feet. <em>The gods</em> – step – <em>are birds</em> – step – <em>and the birds</em> – step – <em>are gods</em> – leap.”</p><p>In his debut, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-ruins-9781912248674">2020’s The Ruins</a>, Mat Osman proved himself to be a vivid and imaginative writer. That was the story of two brothers, a 21st-century tale of murder and mystery that embraced the fantastical as it moved through London, Los Angeles, Las Vegas. It was published just before the first Covid lockdown, when our collective attention was understandably elsewhere. But Osman, bassist and founding member of the British band Suede, knows something about perseverance. His second novel is another wild ride, a vigorous adventure that reinforces the sense of an author with energy and wit to spare.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/05/the-ghost-theatre-by-mat-osman-review-a-pacy-elizabethan-adventure">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Elizabeth’s crowning seemed like a new dawn. But the reign of Charles begins in a kingdom under a cloud</p><p>No one under the age of 75 can have anything but the haziest memory of the last time we did this. Britain has not witnessed a coronation since 1953, and even those who remember the crowning of Elizabeth II will have little to guide them. We are a different country now, and Charles a very different prospective monarch – if only because of one simple, unavoidable fact: he is an old king.</p><p>Start not with him, but with us. The Britain of 1953 would scarcely recognise itself in the Britain of 2023. Obviously the entire world has transformed. Ask someone who recalls the last coronation and they’ll soon tell you about the novel thrill of seeing the ceremony on live television, perhaps at the home of a neighbour who was the one person on the street lucky enough to own a “set”.

## The coronation offered a chance to reform and modernise the monarchy. It has been squandered | Martin Kettle

<p>Despite gestures towards inclusivity, the ceremony remains rooted in outdated religious and feudal ideals</p><p>At the heart of the coronation of Charles III on Saturday is a very deliberate national deception about religion. In some ways, the deception hides in plain sight, not attracting attention. Pre-coronation speculation has focused instead on more trivial things – Camilla, Harry, Meghan – or on monarchy’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/03/can-a-monarchy-sit-easy-in-modern-britain">general popularity</a> in the post-Elizabeth era. But when you watch and listen to the coronation itself, the religious deception will be hard to miss – and harder to believe.</p><p>Many will instinctively want to be generous about the coronation and will not want to spoil the party. In that spirit, they might call this weekend’s ritual a historical pretence that pleases many and does no particular harm. If they were being stronger-minded, as they ought to be about an event that inevitably says so much about this country to itself and the world, they could instead call the ritual what it is: a lie at the heart of the British state.</p><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/05/coronation-king-charles-reform-modernise-monarchy-religious">Continue reading...</a>
