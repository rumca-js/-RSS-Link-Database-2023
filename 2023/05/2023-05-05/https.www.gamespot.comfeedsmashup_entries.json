Although this is a timely discussion because of the launch of Redfall, many games over the last few years have also chased the same trend, for better and for worse. </p><div>          </div><p>GameSpot has a number of new shows on YouTube for you to check out.

The skin that comes in this season's pack is called Captain Hypatia--she's a starship captain. Like all the skins in the Level Up Packs, Hypatia's got an alternate \"Armored\" style that is very different from its main style. This alt style takes this pretty standard lady here and turns her into an extremely dope cyborg, with arms and legs that are not physically attached to her torso but are held on by some kind of red energy. See below.</p><figure style=\"width: 2123px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4134711-fortnitecaptainhypatiaarmscutoff.jpg\"><img alt=\"Captain Hypatia's alternate 'Armored' style\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4134711-fortnitecaptainhypatiaarmscutoff.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>Captain Hypatia's alternate 'Armored' style</figcaption></figure><p>That arms-and-legs thing is <em>particularly </em>interesting when you take it in conjunction with her name. There's only been one truly notable person with the name Hypatia in all of history: a Greek philosopher and astronomer who lived in Alexandria, Egypt in the late 4th and early 5th Centuries, and the first female mathematician that we have significant historical records about. That's the main reason she's famous-- but the second biggest reason for her fame is the way she was brutally murdered and literally torn limb from limb by a mob of Christians.</p><p>There have been other things called Hypatia in the 1600 years since Hypatia of Alexandria was alive. Pretty much all of them are named after this woman, though, and the ones that aren't are almost certainly named after things that <em>were</em> named for Hypatia of Alexandria. This fact has probably helped maintain her legacy, because there just haven't been any other Hypatias who were famous and could have stolen her name's thunder.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-level-up-pack-is-a-reference-to-a-brutal-real-life-ancient-murder/1100-6513892/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-level-up-pack-is-a-reference-to-a-brutal-real-life-ancient-murder/1100-6513892/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-05 21:15:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Aliens: Dark Descent Preorders Are Discounted For PC", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aliens-dark-descent-launches-june-20-on-console-and-pc/1100-6512533/\">Aliens: Dark Descent</a> launches on June 20, and if you're looking for a deal on preorders--Fanatical is offering 18% off the game's PC edition.

The Chinese manufacturer has quietly made a name for itself since 2021 with high-performing handheld Windows PCs. In that short window, Aya Neo has released a <em>bunch </em>of different handhelds (with several more on the way), which could be considered both a good and bad thing. On the negative side, it means that customers who buy an Aya Neo may feel like their handheld is outdated in a few months. But on the positive side, Aya Neo's handhelds just keep getting better. The latest example of this is the <a href=\"https://www.ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-AIR-Plus.html\">Aya Neo Air Plus</a>, which takes the impressive internals of the flagship Aya Neo 2 and squeezes them into a compact form factor. The Aya Neo Air Plus is a superb machine with great performance and a premium build that feels and looks fantastic.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As with all other Aya Neo models, the Air Plus comes in several configurations that vary widely in price and specs. Prices range from $600 to $1,400, and there are three different colors to choose from: Glacier Blue, Starlight Black, and Classic Gray. On the low end of the scale, you're getting an AMD Ryzen 3 7320U processor or an Intel Alder Lake i3 1215U. To get the type of performance you're probably looking for, the AMD Ryzen 7 6800U configuration is the marquee Air Plus. Though I didn't test the lower-end models, their specs suggest they wouldn't perform favorably compared to the Steam Deck despite costing more. The Ryzen 7 6800U units start at $980 and can outperform the Steam Deck. I tested the model with the 6800U, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. If you really want to go all out, the Air Plus tops out at 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. That said, the Air Plus has a microSD card slot to expand your storage, which I found to be a convenient way to increase the storage space while maintaining solid performance.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Air Plus falls between the Aya Neo 2 and last year's Air/Air Pro with its size and form factor. It's larger than the original Air models and has a 6-inch touchscreen display instead of the 5.5-inch, but it's noticeably smaller than Aya Neo's 7-inch handhelds. And placing the Air Plus next to the Steam Deck makes the latter appear comically large and clunky. Fortunately, the compact size doesn't stop the Air Plus from being ergonomically friendly: It feels natural to hold, and the rounded back handles keep the experience comfy for hours.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-aya-neo-air-plus-is-a-powerful-smaller-and-pricier-steam-deck-alternative/1100-6513890/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-aya-neo-air-plus-is-a-powerful-smaller-and-pricier-steam-deck-alternative/1100-6513890/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-05 19:06:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Preloading Has Begun", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-everything-we-know/1100-6492308/\">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> is now available to preload on Nintendo Switch.

Weapons purchased from a raid vendor are not eligible (though, as always, there are specific steps you can take in a raid to guarantee you obtain a Deepsight weapon anyway), but ones bought from Xur or the Gunsmith can go through this Deepsight activation process. Additionally, you won't be able to complete this process if you've already unlocked the pattern for that specific weapon, given that there would be no reason to do.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-making-it-easier-to-get-those-craftable-weapons-you-really-want/1100-6513864/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-making-it-easier-to-get-those-craftable-weapons-you-really-want/1100-6513864/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-05 13:18:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Collector Finds GameCube Apparently Used For SpaceWorld 2000 Reveal", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the original GameCubes first shown off at the console's reveal at Space World 2000 apparently has been found.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Console reveals tend to be a little bit more lowkey compared to what they used to be, especially if you're looking at the GameCube's slightly infamous reveal at an event a lot of you probably don't remember: Space World.
