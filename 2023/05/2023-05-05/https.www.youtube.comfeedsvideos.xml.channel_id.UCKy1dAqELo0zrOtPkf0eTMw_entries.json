This is the last time we'll see this incarnation of the Guardians onscreen. It\u2019s also probably the last time we\u2019ll see director James Gunn working in the MCU. As such, many fan-favorite characters are given a proper sendoff in this sequel. But this is still a Marvel movie, and there\u2019s always another story to be told. In this case, a new Guardians of the Galaxy team rises from the ashes of the old.\n\nWhile we wait to learn what the future holds in store for the Legendary Star-Lord and the new Guardians, let\u2019s break down the ending to Vol. 3, the post-credits scenes and the big introduction of the MCU\u2019s newest cosmic hero.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is directed by James Gunn and stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter, Elizabeth Debicki, Maria Bakalova and Sylvester Stallone. The film is in theaters now.\n\n#IGN #GotG #Marvel", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sZZHNYFcac", "date_published": "2023-05-05 20:30:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Fast X - Official \"Father and Son\" Behind the Scenes Clip (2023) Vin Diesel, Leo Abelo Perry", "description": "Join Vin Diesel (who plays Dom Toretto), Leo Abelo Perry (who plays Little B), and director Louis Leterrier for a behind-the-scenes look at Fast X, including a discussion about fatherhood and the father and son relationship in the upcoming movie. Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious saga, also stars Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \u201cLudacris\u201d Bridges, Jason Momoa, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Sung Kang, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior, Scott Eastwood, with Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, and Rita Moreno.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they\u2019ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who\u2019s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything\u2014and everyone\u2014that Dom loves, forever. \n\nIn 2011\u2019s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn\u2019t know was that Reyes\u2019 son, Dante (Aquaman\u2019s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n\nDante\u2019s plot will scatter Dom\u2019s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante\u2019s vengeance. \n\nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum, and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M.
