<p>Carol Martin corroborates E Jean Carroll’s account of aftermath of alleged rape, and judge keeps door open to Trump appearance.

She described Carroll as “clearly agitated, anxious”. Asked what she made of Carroll’s claim that Trump attacked her, Martin said: “I believed it then and I believe it today.”</p><p><strong>What would it mean if he is elected?</strong> The risk Robinson would pose if elected in November 2024 is real – polling is scarce at this stage but experts believe the race between Robinson and Josh Stein, his expected Democratic opponent, is tight. Republicans control the state house and senate, and the GOP expanded its lead in last year’s elections.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/05/first-thing-final-witness-testifies-in-trump-civil-trial">Continue reading...</a>
