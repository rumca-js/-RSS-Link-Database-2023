Eeyore is a depressed donkey who thought he would be alone on his birthday, only to be met with a surprise party thrown by all his friends in the 100 Acre Wood. For the last 58 years, the city of Austin has held a celebration for this special Donkey's birthday in a park by the woods. This year I went to join in on the festivities to see what all the celebration was about, and along the way I ran into other creators on a similar quest.
