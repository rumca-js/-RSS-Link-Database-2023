That<strong> </strong>must change</p><p>For a week now, I\u2019ve been bombarded with variations on the same question: \u201cSo what do you think about that cartoon?\u201d The cartoon in question being the depiction of the outgoing BBC chair, Richard Sharp, which appeared on these pages last Saturday in a drawing swiftly denounced as loaded with age-old antisemitic tropes and then removed from the Guardian website later that same day. I didn\u2019t want to sound off about the work of my colleagues on Twitter or on the radio, but I also thought it was a fair question to ask. After all, when other progressive institutions have committed similar offences I have not exactly held back. So here, on the pages of the Guardian itself, is what I think.<br /></p><p>When Labour was grappling with antisemitism in its ranks, I was careful to refer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/18/labour-antisemitism-jews-jeremy-corbyn\">not only the party</a> but also \u201cthe wider left\u201d. Few British Jews kidded ourselves that this was a problem confined to one political group. Rather, I and others argued that what had surfaced, admittedly in vivid form in Labour, was a cast of mind, a way of seeing Jews, that had long existed in corners of the left, with roots that went decades \u2013 if not centuries \u2013 deep, and which stretched far beyond these shores. That view of Jews drew, in turn, on cultural ideas almost as old as civilisation itself, embedded in the core texts and artworks of Christianity, as well as in the words of our canonical writers: Chaucer, Shakespeare and Dickens.<br /><br />All this stuff informs how people see Jews, including even some of those who pride themselves on loathing racist prejudice. Which is why, although there was disappointment and hurt, there was no great surprise when, to pick just one example, the Royal Court theatre announced in 2021 a new play about a predatory, manipulative billionaire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/06/antisemitism-row-forces-royal-court-theatre-to-change-name-of-character\">named \u2026 Hershel Fink</a>. (We\u2019ll come back to him later.) So long established are these lines of thought, no institution is immune. Not even the country\u2019s finest liberal publications.<br /><br />Nearly a fortnight ago, the Observer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/success-for-women-not-same-as-for-men-letters\">published a letter</a> from the veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott. In it she rejected the view that Jewish, Irish or Traveller people suffered racism. \u201cPrejudice\u201d, of the kind endured by white people with red hair, sure. But actual racism? No, the only people who faced that were people of colour, whether in the Jim Crow American south or apartheid South Africa.</p><p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Which also makes it ideal for consumption around the television set, or at a street party, should either of those figure in your plans.

You could easily mistake it for some form of Eurovision content, featuring an all-male dance troupe, with Dannii performing for a minnow competitor like San Marino.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/05/no-talking-just-kissing-inside-the-uks-first-ever-gay-dating-show\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/05/no-talking-just-kissing-inside-the-uks-first-ever-gay-dating-show", "date_published": "2023-05-05 12:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Control the PR, lose the hangers-on: lessons for Charles from Europe\u2019s royals", "description": "<p>Five lessons the king may want to consider, based on what has gone right \u2013 and wrong \u2013 for Europe\u2019s surviving monarchies</p><p>In 1900 every country in Europe was a monarchy, save for three: France, Switzerland and San Marino.

Eno is not his godfather, as has been widely rumoured, but he quickly became a mentor, bringing him on to co-production projects.

With intensity and density maxed out, his work can be brilliant, as on tracks such as Delilah, Jungle and Baxter, which seem to fishtail through their respective raves. And even if his guest vocalists can let him down \u2013 such as the colossally annoying Blessed Madonna speeches on his big Covid hit Marea (We\u2019ve Lost Dancing) \u2013 he often writes bright, insidious melodies.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/05/fred-again-and-brian-eno-secret-life-review-ambient\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/05/fred-again-and-brian-eno-secret-life-review-ambient", "date_published": "2023-05-05 11:35:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Scottish police officers challenge \u2018clean-shaven\u2019 policy at tribunal", "description": "<p>Police Scotland has told officers to shave off facial hair by end of May so they can use FFP3 face masks</p><p>At least four officers are pursuing discrimination claims after Police Scotland announced plans for a \u201cclean-shaven\u201d policy without adequate consultation, according to their professional body.</p><p>Officers are being told to shave off their beards and moustaches so they can use a particular type of protective face mask, which is face-fitted and requires the wearer to be clean-shaven.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/scottish-police-officers-challenge-clean-shaven-policy-at-tribunal\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/05/scottish-police-officers-challenge-clean-shaven-policy-at-tribunal", "date_published": "2023-05-05 11:33:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Filipino activists appeal to British banks over region devastated by oil spill", "description": "<p>Environmentalists from the Philippines urge investors to avoid LNG projects which they say threaten the Verde Island Passage</p><p>Campaigners from the Philippines have urged British banks not to fund the expansion of fossil fuel use in their country.

It\u2019s possibly less likely that you\u2019ve actually <em>heard</em> them: they have released just the one track so far. Despite this, in the last fortnight the band have received breathless write-ups everywhere from <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.co.uk/music/features/meet-the-last-dinner-party-who-might-just-be-your-favourite-new-band-28599/\">Rolling Stone</a> to <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/a-phenomenally-exciting-new-band-the-last-dinner-party-at-camden-assembly-reviewed/\">the Spectator</a>, for their raucous live performances and baroque-inflected pop.</p><p>That sudden rush of hype has sparked a backlash: eyebrows raised on social media over the band\u2019s big-name management and major label status; whispers about them being \u201cindustry plants\u201d or \u2013 even worse \u2013 nepo babies. Which in turn has prompted a pointed rebuttal from the band (Not nepo babies! Not manufactured!) and their supporters. All of this, in the best part of a fortnight. The discourse is already in runaway train mode, and if you\u2019ve been following it all you may have already had your fill. But I do think there\u2019s something fascinating about the whole affair \u2013 a mix of old-school buzz band hype, and very modern concerns about the music industry and who rises and falls within it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/05/the-guide-the-last-dinner-party-music\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/05/the-guide-the-last-dinner-party-music", "date_published": "2023-05-05 10:57:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "US banking crisis risks becoming \u2018self-fulfilling prophecy\u2019, analysts say", "description": "<p>Shares in US regional banks pummelled this week amid fears of more collapses in sector</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/may/05/pound-dollar-us-banking-turmoil-jobs-report-inflation-recession-business-live\">Business live: latest updates</a></li></ul><p>The crisis engulfing regional US banks risks becoming a \u201cself-fulfilling prophecy\u201d as investors take flight from lenders seen as increasingly risky bets, triggering even deeper losses, analysts have warned.</p><p>Shares in US banks were pummelled this week amid investor concerns that there will be more collapses, after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/30/time-running-out-for-us-financial-firms-to-bid-for-ailing-bank-first-republic\">string of failures</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/05/us-banking-crisis-risks-becoming-self-fulfilling-prophecy-analysts-say\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/05/us-banking-crisis-risks-becoming-self-fulfilling-prophecy-analysts-say", "date_published": "2023-05-05 10:55:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronation build-up live: King Charles and Camilla at Westminster Abbey for final rehearsal", "description": "<p>Dignitaries arriving in London ahead of tomorrow\u2019s ceremony as people already gather to line procession route</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/03/what-to-expect-at-the-kings-coronation-key-events-and-timings\">What to expect: key events and timings</a></li></ul><p><strong>A children\u2019s biography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-charles\">King Charles III</a> has topped the UK book chart before the coronation on 6 May.</strong></p><p>Maria Isabel S\u00e1nchez Vegara\u2019s King Charles is part of the Little People, Big Dreams series, which includes illustrated biographies of notable figures such as Stephen Hawking and Michelle Obama.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2023/may/05/coronation-build-up-live-king-charles-queen-consort-camilla-westminster-abbey\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2023/may/05/coronation-build-up-live-king-charles-queen-consort-camilla-westminster-abbey", "date_published": "2023-05-05 10:38:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018That one I\u2019ve never heard of\u2019: Africans unimpressed with Charles celebrations", "description": "<p>The distant familiarity and affection many in the Commonwealth had with the Queen does not extend to her son</p><p>On the streets of Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, questions about the coronation are met with a blank stare. \u201cThat one, I\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d says David Ouma, a 36-year-old taxi driver.</p><p>There is no buzz or chatter about the coronation of Charles III among the market traders or in the pubs \u2013 although it\u2019s likely to make the front page of newspapers at the weekend.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/05/that-one-ive-never-heard-of-africans-unimpressed-with-charles-celebrations\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/05/that-one-ive-never-heard-of-africans-unimpressed-with-charles-celebrations", "date_published": "2023-05-05 10:38:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Vortex review \u2013 No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s swirling jazz age psychodrama", "description": "<p><strong>Chichester Festival theatre<br /></strong>Lia Williams and her son Joshua James make a scintillating double act in a resonant revival of the 1924 hit</p><p>There\u2019s a tableau in this production of The Vortex where the characters, in gorgeous party clothes, pose like an Annie Leibovitz cover for Vanity Fair.

The last few thousand people left alive on Earth at some unspecified (but we suspect not too distant) time in the future have been confined in a multilevel, self-sustaining, subterranean silo while they wait for the planet to recover from whatever toxic event rendered it uninhabitable. No one knows when this will be, just as they don\u2019t know who built the silo, since a rebellion in the past erased their history. The set designers and CGI wizards have had a field day crafting an environment whose futuristic bones are now only just visible beneath shrouds of grime and the kind of Heath Robinsonesque clutter that is bound to accumulate in a sealed human vault over time. It\u2019s Soviet architecture meets steampunk medieval and the rendering of the silo\u2019s different sections, from hydroponic farms to medical centres, make the place almost a character in its own right.</p><p>The story is equally thrilling and, as the plot thickens with almost every scene and does not stop even at the very last moment (a second series has already been commissioned, as well it should), equally oppressive.</p><p>Silo is on Apple TV+ now.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/05/silo-review-this-rich-dystopian-drama-is-absolutely-thrilling\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/05/silo-review-this-rich-dystopian-drama-is-absolutely-thrilling", "date_published": "2023-05-05 08:20:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Students occupy schools and universities across Europe in climate protest", "description": "<p>Twenty-two institutions have been shut down as part of proposed month-long campaign</p><p>A wave of student occupations has shut down schools and universities across Europe as part of a renewed youth protest campaign against inaction on climate breakdown.

Pre-coronation speculation has focused instead on more trivial things \u2013 Camilla, Harry, Meghan \u2013 or on monarchy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/03/can-a-monarchy-sit-easy-in-modern-britain\">general popularity</a> in the post-Elizabeth era. But when you watch and listen to the coronation itself, the religious deception will be hard to miss \u2013 and harder to believe.</p><p>Many will instinctively want to be generous about the coronation and will not want to spoil the party. In that spirit, they might call this weekend\u2019s ritual a historical pretence that pleases many and does no particular harm. If they were being stronger-minded, as they ought to be about an event that inevitably says so much about this country to itself and the world, they could instead call the ritual what it is: a lie at the heart of the British state.</p><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/05/coronation-king-charles-reform-modernise-monarchy-religious\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/05/coronation-king-charles-reform-modernise-monarchy-religious", "date_published": "2023-05-05 05:00:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "E-fuels: how big a niche can they carve out for cars?", "description": "<p>Sections of industry back synthetic alternatives to fossil fuels, but case is much stronger for aviation</p><p>Most bright red sports cars do not make much of their green credentials.
