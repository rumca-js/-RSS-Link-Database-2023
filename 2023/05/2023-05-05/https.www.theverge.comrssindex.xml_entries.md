And I think Netflix was $4 billion and Hulu was at $1.3 billion at the time. And either of those, with hindsight being 20/20, would have been a better acquisition.”</p>

  <p id="0QWG92">The pricey Seagate Expansion Cards for Xbox Series X / S have finally received a much-needed price cut. The official <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1654486241109311492">Xbox Twitter account announced</a> that the current selection of 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB memory cards from Seagate are <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fhard-drives%2Fseagate-expansion-card%231tb&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F5%2F5%2F23712516%2Fxbox-expansion-cards-seagate-price-cut-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">now available at a lower price</a> of $89.99, $149.99, and $279.99, respectively. This effectively takes the recent discounted sale prices of the cards and turns them into actual price cuts, which should be soon reflected at all retailers carrying them.</p>
<p id="yHZkjv">The recent frequency of discounts on the Seagate cards and now this price cut happen to come after a leak indicated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/2/23666795/western-digital-xbox-storage-expansion-card">cheaper storage is on its way from Western Digital</a>.

  <p id="YkTskP">This week, lawmakers and regulators made a fresh push to strengthen privacy and safety protections for children online, introducing a flood of bills and enforcement proposals with varying amounts of support from their colleagues, civil liberties groups, and tech trade associations alike. The burst of action comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/health/mental-health-crisis-teens.html">an ongoing youth mental health crisis</a> that seemingly all stakeholders want to resolve, but many fear these proposals could create new problems for children and members of marginalized communities online. </p>
