<p>Ukraine says it neutralised Russian hypersonic weapon; Six African leaders to travel to Russia and Ukraine</p><p><strong>Ukraine said it had neutralised the Kremlin’s most potent hypersonic weapon,</strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/16/ukraine-russia-targets-kyiv-with-massive-overnight-airstrike"> shooting down six out of six Kinzhal missiles</a> launched at Kyiv during a sweeping and “exceptionally intense” night-time attack. It is the first time Ukraine has claimed to have struck an entire volley of Kinzhals, and if confirmed would demonstrate the effectiveness of Kyiv’s newly deployed western-supplied air defences.</p><p><strong>The attack on Kyiv was one of the biggest since the 2022 invasion and followed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/16/zelenskiy-europe-tour-was-a-success-but-wests-latest-gifts-may-not-be-enough">Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s three-day trip to Europe</a>.</strong> During meetings in London, Berlin, Paris and Rome, Ukraine’s president secured promises of more military assistance, including long-range attack drones from the UK.</p><p>European leaders convening in Iceland for two days pledged to<strong> hold Russia to account for its war against Ukraine </strong>and unveiled a mechanism to <strong>track the losses and damage inflicted by Moscow’s forces</strong>.</p><p>The British and Dutch prime ministers, Rishi Sunak and Mark Rutte, have agreed to<strong> build an “international coalition” to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/16/uk-and-netherlands-agree-international-coalition-to-help-ukraine-with-f-16-jets">help procure F-16 fighter jets</a> for Ukraine,</strong> the British government has announced.</p><p>The assembly in a<strong> pro-Russian region of Moldova </strong>has endorsed the<strong> election of a local leader intent on improving ties with Moscow,</strong> setting up a clash with the pro-European national government.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian forces have taken back about 20 sq km (7.5 sq miles) of territory from Russian forces around the eastern city of Bakhmut</strong> in recent days, the Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. She said <a href="https://t.me/s/annamaliar">on the Telegram messaging app</a> that Russian forces had advanced “somewhat” in the city of Bakhmut itself, and that heavy fighting continued.</p><p><strong>The head of Ukraine’s supreme court, Vsevolod Kniaziev, has been arrested as part of the biggest bribery investigation in Ukraine’s history. </strong>Police detained Knaiziev as part of a $2.7m bribery inquiry, as Kyiv pursues anti-graft measures required for closer integration with the EU.</p><p><strong>Six African leaders plan to travel to Russia and Ukraine “as soon as is possible” to help find a resolution to the war, </strong>the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had “agreed to receive the mission and the African heads of state, in both Moscow and Kyiv”, Ramaphosa said.</p><p>A bill<strong> banning Russian uranium imports to the US </strong>gained momentum on Tuesday by passing a committee in the US House of Representatives. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the US banned imports of its oil and imposed a price cap with other western countries on sea-borne exports of its crude and oil products, but not uranium.</p><p><strong>About 2,000 people who had helped defend the Azovstal plant who were captured and became prisoners of war are still in the hands of the Russians,</strong> according to a charity set up to support families and those connected to the factory.</p><p><strong>Six people have been killed in Kharkiv and Donetsk over the last 24 hours,</strong> according to the regions’ governors. Oleh Syniehubov and Pavlo Kyrylenko confirmed the figures on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>Russia said it was still undecided on the extension of a Black Sea grain deal with Ukraine,</strong> brokered by the UN and Turkey and due to expire on 18 May. “There are a lot of unanswered questions regarding our part of the deal … now we have to make a decision,” the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/17/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-448-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

## Lautaro Martínez finishes off Milan to put Inter in Champions League final

<p>For Internazionale, the road to Istanbul was paved with bad intentions. The exuberance and colour of their first-leg victory gave way to something darker and grittier here: not so much a semi-final as a turf war, the sort of game that is to be endured rather than enjoyed. Here their great city rivals were snuffed out, dismantled piece by piece, and finally picked off via a goal by Lautaro Martínez. Milan is theirs. But the greatest prize of all remains tantalisingly within reach.</p><p>Simone Inzaghi’s side will probably go into the final on June 3 as one of the least fancied Champions League contenders in recent history. And from the English perspective there is perhaps a tendency to gaze upon their wrought and wizened collection of Premier League jetsam and wonder just how they got this far. But there is also real conviction and real quality here: men of skill and steel, who over 180 minutes simply stood taller, made the braver decisions, produced the decisive moments when they were required. Milan, by contrast, were a crashing disappointment: a team with 57% possession but not the slightest idea of what to do with it, a team of too many makeweights and too few leaders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/16/internazionale-milan-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Louis XV’s infatuation with a sexy, smart courtesan played by Maïwenn – who also writes and directs – is an entertaining spectacle but preening Depp’s king overshadows her story</p><p>The rosebud lips of Johnny Depp in this film are pursed in a strange expression of irony, stupefied entitlement and droll, martyred awareness of the absurdity of which his royal person is the centre: a human candle starting to melt. He plays Louis XV in the decadent court of pre-revolutionary Versailles, purring his lines in French and playing him as the ageing, slow-moving dandy – though Rip Torn was sexier in the same role in Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette.</p><p>Depp might actually have been better cast as the lead: Madame Jeanne du Barry, the low-born and entrancingly sensual mistress and royal favourite with whom the king was scandalously infatuated at court, permitting her all manner of familiarities and intimacies.

It shows a glimpse of a possible future, the image that of a grand white stadium with a sweeping concourse and fans chatting before the match. Underneath there is a line that reads “making Southend proud” and above, the slogan “Bring it on!” Once perhaps an exclamation of joy, it now reads like desperation.</p><p>On Wednesday Southend United face a winding-up petition in the high court, the result of unpaid taxes to HM Revenue &amp; Customs. It marks the 18th such petition in the 25 years that the chairman, Ron Martin, has owned the club and it is hardly their only problem. Staff have gone unpaid, fans have lent money that remains unreturned, the club is up for sale and in 2021 the Shrimpers were relegated from the Football League for the first time in 100 years. They remain in the fifth tier.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/16/hearts-and-minds-campaign-looking-to-usher-new-era-to-southend-united">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rather than placing all bets on growth, the party should focus on the public goods and services that sustain our daily lives</p><p>The sharp fall in disposable income among UK households has been blamed on the war in Ukraine, supply chain problems and Conservative policies. It is a product of <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/cost-living-crisis#:~:text=Cost%20pressures%20have%20been%20apparent,supply%20chains%20also%20increased%20prices." title="">all these things</a>. But it is also a symptom of a longer decline in living standards that predates them. In response, both the Conservatives and Labour have proposed variations on the same programme of <a href="https://labour.org.uk/members/campaignresources/campaignmaterials/costoflivingcrisis/" title="">growth and jobs</a>. Yet what if this emphasis is neglecting another essential area: the everyday goods and services that we all depend upon?</p><p>This is the argument advanced by academics in a new book, <a href="https://manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9781526173713/" title="">When Nothing Works</a>. Living standards aren’t just determined by income or wage growth – they also depend upon people’s access to essential infrastructure and services, such as housing, transport and energy. Rather than ensuring that these goods are available and affordable to everyone, the government has instead fixated on work as the main route for lifting people out of poverty. Its punitive benefits system has pushed more people into <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/inequality/chapter/briefing-note/" title="">low-paid work</a> but has not protected them from falling below the minimum needed to survive. Meanwhile, because many essential services have been outsourced to the market, their costs have escalated – and households are struggling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-cost-of-living-crisis-labour-needs-creative-solutions">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Opposition parties thrashed the ruling military at the polls. That doesn’t mean the vote will be respected</p><p>Careful what you wish for. The Thai royalist-military establishment has spent years attempting to suppress the political forces that swelled around the billionaire businessman Thaksin Shinawatra. Instead of addressing the social roots of his populist appeal to rural Thais and the urban poor, it has used two coups, court cases and ruthless <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/15/thai-death-toll-redshirts-troops" title="">suppression of dissent</a> to see off the tycoon and his proxies. The military has remained in power since removing his sister as prime minister in 2014. Yet in Sunday’s election, Pheu Thai, the latest party associated with him, was eclipsed only by a new progressive party demanding military- and monarchy-related reform.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/15/thailand-election-2023-national-elections-opposition-parties-crushing-blow-military-rule-junta" title="">results</a> are not even a landslide, says one political analyst, but a skyfall. The poll ruptured the division of Thailand into establishment “red shirt” and Thaksin “yellow shirt” supporters. The new Move Forward party took 14m votes and 151 seats by winning over young urbanites who would recoil from the former prime minister, a polarising figure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/26/thaksin-shinawatra-abuse-power-ruling" title="">convicted of corruption</a> in absentia and with a dismal human rights record in office. It also picked up some support from Pheu Thai, now fronted by his daughter, which still took 9m votes and 141 seats. Together, the opposition have trounced the political establishment and agreed to form a coalition government.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/16/the-guardian-view-on-thailands-elections-can-the-country-move-forward">Continue reading...</a>

Just 10 minutes after the England squad was announced, confirming Jonny Bairstow’s return behind the stumps for Ireland and thus the start of the Ashes summer, and with Ben Foakes missing from the list of 15 players, the club’s Twitter feed fired up in solidarity with the fall guy.</p><p>“The best keeper in the world was at it again last week,” read the pointed post, accompanied by a lightning emoji and a video of his silken glove work during the win against Middlesex.

The challenge is to connect it with a younger, post-pandemic audience that prefers to gorge its entertainment online.</p><p>“If you look at today’s world, you see that cinema is unique for the simple reason that it offers a room where we can all watch films together,” he said. “All the other content, we’re accessing it on our devices, in our little bubbles, consuming culture like zombies and not reflecting what we’re looking at. So going to the cinema is almost a political stance. We come together and have a conversation about the world. We find out who we are and where we’re going. That is cinema’s strongest selling point.

For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/stream-team">click here</a></em></li></ul><p>Let’s face it: remakes are often unnecessary at best and inferior at worst.

Unless you count Mariah Carey’s Glitter, which is ostensibly the Black and Gold knock-off of A Star Is Born – it’s been remade four times. By comparison there are five Little Women adaptations. The latest and in my humble opinion, the best of which was made by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/04/greta-gerwig-films-ranked">Greta Gerwig</a>.</p><p>Little Women is a coming-of-age story about the March sisters, namely Jo, a tomboy and writer; Amy, an artist with a penchant for pretty things; Meg, the dutiful and protective eldest sister; and Beth, the sweet, albeit one-dimensional and doomed one. I love the original novel (or novel<em>s</em>, if you consider it was originally published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869) with all my heart. You would think that my esteem for the original text would leave me leery of film adaptations but no.

<p>The sunshine state’s healthcare professionals will soon be able to deny treatment on religious or moral grounds. Thanks a bunch, governor</p><p>You know what I love about living in the US? Freedom! You can choose between multiple overpriced insurance companies to provide you with healthcare, for example. The healthcare companies, in turn, can seemingly charge you whatever they like for their services. If they want to charge you <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/bill-of-the-month-for-toenail-fungus-a-1500-prescription/">$1,500 (£1,200) for some toenail fungus cream</a>, that is their prerogative. That’s freedom, baby.</p><p>As if this wasn’t glorious enough, the healthcare system in Florida has just had a new layer of freedom added to it. On 1 July, a <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/breaking-gov-desantis-signs-extreme-license-to-discriminate-healthcare-bill">new law goes into effect</a> that means a doctor can look a potential patient up and down, decide they are giving off homosexual vibes and refuse to treat them because interacting with gay people goes against their personal beliefs. The doctor will not face any repercussions for denying care and has no obligation to refer the patient elsewhere.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/16/florida-ron-desantis-bigotry-doctors-gay-people">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Glasgow Women’s Library has been collecting examples of the stark graphic brilliance of homemade banners since 1991. We go behind the scenes as they gather their latest: abortion rights placards</p><p>Last month, more than 100 anti-abortion protesters arrived at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow to be met with a formidable opposition: just behind their usual gathering spot the railings had been converted into a huge, multi-coloured mural made up of banners peppered with irreverent messages such as “No womb for your opinion”, “Keep your rosaries off my ovaries” and “Yer da protests abortion”. There were recurring visual motifs, many used in abortion rights campaigns for decades, such as a cartoon uterus giving the finger, wearing a sombrero (“Nacho uterus, nacho business”), or gleefully booting a foetus. Within a day, images of the protest and its flamboyant backdrop were splashed across Scottish newspapers.</p><p>The creative counter-protest caught the attention of Glasgow Women’s Library, which collects banners, badges and other ephemera from across the women’s liberation movement, many predating the organisation’s founding in 1991. You’ll find beautiful placards and pins there, from the original <a href="https://ehive.com/objects?accountId=8664&amp;query=cat_type%3Ahistory&amp;sort=name&amp;order=asc&amp;facet=account_name_facet%3AGlasgow+Women%27s+Library&amp;facet=object_type_facet%3ABadge&amp;facet=association_keyword_facet%3AAbortion+rights+-+pro-choice">abortion rights movement</a> of the 1970s to the <a href="https://ehive.com/objects?query=tag%3A%22repeal+the+8th%22&amp;size=12">Repeal the 8th</a> campaign to lift the abortion ban in Ireland. When they saw the colourful displays from the recent Glasgow protests, they agreed to archive many of the protest materials as important social-historical documents and artworks in their own right.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/16/rosaries-ovaries-glasgow-womens-library-explosive-protest-art-abortion-banners-placards">Continue reading...</a>

That said, green peppers have always featured in his family’s cooking, so Gonzalez-Castro has “learned to appreciate them” – and you can, too, Mel! The road to recovery might start with <em>aji relleno</em>, a favourite of Gonzalez-Castro’s father: “He cuts the tops off a few peppers, gently coats in olive oil, then fills with picadillo [a mix of mince, herbs, raisins and olives].” Into the oven they go and, “oddly, the results are astounding. The peppers soften in the steam and, together with the sweetness of the raisins and saltiness of the olives, the bitterness evaporates.”</p><p>Another who suggests that Mel should, er, get stuffed is <a href="https://maunikagowardhan.co.uk/">Maunika Gowardhan</a>, pepper enthusiast and author of recently published <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/tandoori-home-cooking-9781784885786">Tandoori Home Cooking</a>: “My mother would do this with spicy, crushed potatoes, and it’s <em>so</em> good,” she says. First heat some oil in a pan, “stir in asafoetida, cumin seeds, green chillies, ground coriander, chilli powder, and turmeric, then add [boiled and] crushed potatoes and season.” You’ll also want some mango powder “for tang” and chopped coriander, before piling the lot into halved green peppers brushed with oil and grilling them. “They still have some bite when you cut into them, but you get this lovely, charred flavour.”</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

## Little Bone Lodge review – Joely Richardson is scarily fierce in tense thriller

<p>Secrets are revealed as Richardson’s matriarch turns out not to be just a simple farmer’s wife when protecting her family</p><p>This story is set in a farmhouse in present-day Britain, but its occupants – hypercompetent Mama (Joely Richardson), ailing Pa (Roger Ajogbe) and teenage daughter Maisy (Sadie Soverall) – live like they’re in the 1950s, with no mobile phones or landline, no TV and certainly no internet. Nevertheless, they seem content enough even if Mama is a bit overprotective of Maisy. Perhaps that’s due to the fact that Pa wouldn’t be much help in a crisis, given he uses a wheelchair and is nearly mute, heavily medicated with the painkillers that Mama dispenses on a strict schedule. It’s understandable that she would be hesitant to admit the strangers who come hammering on the front door in the middle of a ferocious storm, pleading desperately for help after they’ve been in a car accident. Maisy, who clearly doesn’t get out much, begs Mama to help them and soon the matriarch is performing surgery on the kitchen table, suggesting she’s not just the simple farmer’s wife she claims to be.</p><p>Of course, the visitors aren’t the hapless travellers they claim to be either. Jack (Neil Linpow, also the film’s screenwriter) and Matty (Harry Cadby) are brothers who were involved in some kind of robbery, but the escape has gone wrong now that the car has crashed. Older brother Jack is the one who Mama operated on, and soon he’s unfeasibly mobile and ready to roll on after the removal of what looks like a significant length of rebar from his gut. When he and Mama go to the crash site to retrieve some vitally needed bags, highly strung and emotional Matty grows closer to Maisy; his recent confinement to a psychiatric institution comes out when they tune into Maisy’s secret radio and learn Matty is wanted for the murder of a nurse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/16/little-bone-lodge-review-joely-richardson-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A collaboration between famed designer Yugo Nakamura and gaming auteur Tetsuya Mizuguchi has yielded one of the strangest, most compelling puzzle games of recent years</p><p>Humanity was inspired by a throng of bodies. Specifically, the mass of people queueing for Comiket, the longstanding comic and pop culture convention in Tokyo. As its director Yugo Nakamura explains over a video call from the city, he was intrigued by the “orderly manner” in which these people were milling about. “We have our soul and mind,” he says, “but it was almost like they were moving without thinking.” The challenge the designer set himself and his colleagues at the award-winning Japanese studio <a href="https://tha.jp/works">tha ltd.</a> was to simulate this gently surging crowd, the ebb and flow of the collective.</p><p>The resulting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62Yjl5rTXSY&amp;pp=ygUQaHVtYW5pdHkgdHJhaWxlcg%3D%3D">puzzle game</a> does something unusual for the genre. Yes, it stretches your grey matter in ways that will make you feel like an idiot and then a genius, but its hundreds, sometimes thousands of people moving in unison are capable of stirring up surprising emotions: delight, awe, even fear. The setup is simple: direct an endlessly spawning mass of people towards the light in a series of self-contained levels. The execution is anything but: a luminous shiba inu dog is the pack’s leader, scampering about brutalist architecture suspended high in the clouds. You are given the ability to manipulate the group in different ways with commands such as turn, jump, and branch, which siphons the roving mob into two.

<p>Playing in the vast ancient amphitheatre, imaginative new productions of Euripides and Aeschylus find fresh nuance even in this huge space</p><p>How best to stage the great Greek classics? The fashion in Britain is for intimacy. But there are other alternatives, as I found on a visit to the ancient Greek theatre in Sicily’s Syracuse where everything is on a massive scale. The auditorium, carved out of a hillside, seats 5,000. The stage is 27 metres wide and 44 deep; acting, direction and design are correspondingly epic. Yet I discovered, in the two productions I saw, that psychological detail is still achievable even in this vast arena.</p><p>Seasons of the Greek classics began in Syracuse in 1914, continued spasmodically but only became annual events in this century. Scanning the records, you find that many famous directors, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/feb/15/theatre.germany">Peter Stein</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/01/luca-ronconi">Luca Ronconi</a>, <a href="http://www.stagedoor.it/en/artist/yannis%20kokkos/director/w/biography/">Yannis Kokkos</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/14/irene-papas-obituary">Irene Papas</a>, have worked there. Among the translators, the name of Pier Paolo Pasolini stands out. Each eight-week season blends a well-known title with others less familiar. This year Medea and Aeschylus’s Prometheus Bound kicked off the programme, with Peace by Aristophanes and a multi-media spectacle about Ulysses still to come. After July, selected productions will go on tour around Italy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/16/medea-syracuse-greek-theatre-keeps-classic-drama-alive-prometheus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Republicans seem gleeful at the possibility of ‘chaos’ and ‘disaster’ – and their policies make the humanitarian crisis worse</p><p>Last week saw the end of Title 42, the Trump-era border restriction which was technically introduced as a health measure during the coronavirus pandemic. The policy allowed the Trump, and then Biden administrations, to expel without due process the vast majority of people seeking asylum at the United States-Mexico border. Given that the acute phase of the pandemic has passed, the end of the policy – which has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/13/title-42-migration-biden-new-policy-tougher#:~:text=By%20the%20time%20it%20ended,border%2C%20according%20to%20government%20statistics.">used</a> about 2.7m times – was inevitable.</p><p>But the end of Title 42 has also reignited the political firestorm over the US immigration and refugee system. Republicans have seemed to gleefully anticipate “<a href="https://stefanik.house.gov/2023/5/house-gop-leadership-statement-on-passage-of-the-secure-the-border-act">chaos</a>” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/11/us/politics/house-republicans-immigration-bill.html">disaster</a>” at the border after the policy is lifted. Less biased observers are also concerned that the US refugee processing system will be overwhelmed by the sheer scale of people now expected to seek asylum. The Biden administration has come under fierce criticism from the left for a tough <a href="https://time.com/6278812/border-title-42-aclu-lawsuit-asylum/">new policy</a> of questionable legality which requires most refugees to seek asylum from abroad using a glitchy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/06/us-mexico-border-cbp-one-app-migrants">cellphone app</a> called CBP One.</p><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University and the creator of America Explained, a newsletter and podcast</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/16/republicans-migrant-border-policy-crisis-worse">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a shame because wading through the almost four-and-a-half hours here reveals a rich, ambitious work with frequently ravishing animation that, better paced, might have insinuated, not hectored, its way into our affections.</p><p>Teenager Himari (voiced by Miho Arakawa) collapses and dies on an aquarium visit, and she is revived thanks to the magical penguin hat she bought in the souvenir shop – it links her lifeforce to a rubber-clad dominatrix spirit in another dimension. In return for keeping her alive, it demands that Himari’s brothers, Shoma (Ryōhei Kimura) and Kanba (Subaru Kimura), retrieve a powerful totem, the Penguindrum; they assume it to be the secret diary hoarded by schoolgirl Ringo, whose entries appear to predict people’s destinies. As she is planning to use it to seduce her teacher Tabuki, however, Ringo isn’t about to hand it over.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/16/recycle-of-the-penguindrum-review-tombola-of-characters-and-timelines">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The young NBA star has been suspended after a second incident with a firearm. He did nothing illegal but he is treading a dangerous path</p><p>I will get to the messy tale of Ja Morant shortly. But first, a personal history. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/23/new-york-knicks-saved-my-life">I grew up in South Dallas</a>. Our house was repeatedly broken into. Drive-bys were a regular occurrence. I was jumped often, walking to and from school. Escaping that level of purgatory for the creature comforts of middle-America capitalism was no small feat. Many of my friends were involved in gangs. I never joined in – I was too scared. My pops kept me off the streets as best he could, while protecting himself and his family from the terrors outside our door. He had multiple guns. A Glock rested inside his bedside dresser. A shotgun sat on top of a stack of Maxim magazines at the top of the closet.</p><p>Most people in my neighborhood had firearms: many on the left act like the only people who are pro-gun in the US are backwoods rednecks preparing for a race war. But Black and brown communities have plenty of gun rights advocates too. They aren’t members of the NRA and don’t march in Maga hats to defend gun laws after school shootings but they exist. As an adult still living in the ‘hood in Texas, albeit a gentrified one, I still keep a shotgun in my closet. Growing up in poverty is a disease that you never quite cure. I have only touched my gun once – when I moved home. I hope that remains the case. I do not take my gun out. And if I did, it wouldn’t be on Instagram Live, something Morant, a fabulously talented young NBA player, has done … twice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/16/ja-morant-memphis-grizzlies-gun-video-suspension-nba-basketball">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The perpetual strugglers have a mission beyond simply shaking people down and offer a reminder of what sport can be</p><p>The fourth morning at Grace Road dawns brightly and the game is moving at a frightening pace. Leicestershire, following on, are 16 without loss. The Sussex fielders are bounding and skipping across the turf in short, jerky movements. The seamer Brad Currie walks back to his mark in a droll, Charlie Chaplin-style double-step. The commentators are talking in weird electronic blips. At this point you realise the live stream is not working.</p><p>Which is obviously something that could happen to anybody. Certainly it would be premature to draw any link between Leicestershire’s apparent inability to operate a simple two-camera feed and the fact that the club have finished bottom of the County Championship in eight of the past 14 seasons, and failed to win a single red-ball game in 2022. Eventually the technical gremlins are sorted, in which time the home team have lost one of their openers and are sliding towards a meek defeat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/16/leicestershire-offer-parable-for-english-cricket-teams-should-serve-not-just-sell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new book celebrates Jim Ede, the patron whose museum-home is a chapel to 20th-century British art – in particular that generation who were driven to search for meaning after the first world war</p><p>What drives art collectors? They often seem obsessive, driven to fill a mysterious lack, from Charles I, who amassed a hoard of Renaissance art that helped provoke his subjects to civil war, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jul/10/charles-saatchi-british-art-yba">Charles Saatchi</a>, who had so many contemporary artworks he had to store them in a warehouse which caught fire. But there is also a mysterious category of collectors, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/16/sir-john-soane-private-apartments-obsessive-eccentric-brilliance-architect-morbid-passions">John Soane</a> and Rudolf II of Prague, who turn their collections into cabinets of curiosities haunted by their presence. Another of them was the 20th-century British collector Jim Ede.</p><p>The place Ede created is Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge, an open, spacious home formed by joining four ruinous cottages which he filled with his collection of modern art by the likes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/jan/03/1">Brâncuși</a>, Gaudier-Brzeska and the Anglo-Welsh artist and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/10/soldier-poet-painter-david-jones-britains-outsider">poet David Jones</a>.

<p>The Lincolnshire Wolds are marking their 5oth anniversary as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty with events from hedge-laying to star gazing</p><p>Lincolnshire, I am told, has a location problem. Despite being England’s second-biggest county, it remains somehow tucked away, hidden between the Humber and the Wash. “So there’s no reason to pass through,” Helen Gamble laments as she leads me from Bag Enderby’s church into freshly spring-sprung hills. As Lincolnshire Wolds Countryside Service project officer, one part of Helen’s role is raising awareness of this overlooked landscape. “It’s as good as Yorkshire,” she claims, “but without the tourists.”</p><p>When most people think of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, if they think of it at all, they think: flat. And true, the southern fenlands are steadfastly non-undulating. But the northerly Wolds are the highest ground in eastern England between Kent and Yorkshire itself. Here, farmland, woods, chalk streams, rock seams and pretty little villages fold, rise and ripple. Recognised as nationally important, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/mar/25/lincolnshire-wolds-ramblers-paradise">the Lincolnshire Wolds</a> were designated an area of outstanding natural beauty in 1973, so this year celebrates the 50th anniversary.
