Prior to the pandemic, Robyn Hitchcock had never spent a protracted time off the road. While at home in Nashville, Hitchcock and his wife, singer-songwriter Emma Swift, started a record label (Tiny Ghost Records), and for a time, Hitchcock immersed himself in painting. But soon, he found he couldn’t stop writing songs. 

One of the results of those efforts is the new album, "Shufflemania!," released in late 2022. Hitchcock, touring once again, visited The Current studio to play songs from that album and to chat with The Current’s Bill DeVille about all he’s been up to — as well as his exquisite taste in shirts.

Watch and listen to the full session above.
