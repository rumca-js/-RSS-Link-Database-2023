## ‘It seems so corny!’ How Jennifer Hosten became the first Black Miss World

<p>An audience of 100 million watched as Hosten was crowned in 1970. It was just the start of a remarkable career that took in tea with Joan Crawford, a tour with Bob Hope and a violent coup in her home country of Grenada</p><p>Jennifer Hosten was 23 years old when she made history, as the first Black woman to be crowned Miss World. Footage of that evening, on 20 November 1970, was broadcast live from the Royal Albert Hall in London to about 100 million viewers worldwide, and shows Hosten, representing Grenada, looking radiantly beautiful and endearingly stunned, as host Bob Hope places the winner’s crown on her head.</p><p>Her moment in the spotlight had already been overshadowed, however. Approximately 40 minutes earlier, the proceedings were interrupted when a group of women’s liberation activists began sounding football rattles and throwing flour-bombs in protest at what they saw as an egregious display of sexism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/16/jennifer-hosten-first-black-miss-world-grenada">Continue reading...</a>

<p>All the passengers on a luxury liner have disappeared, an author is riled by a one-star review and a new offering from Catriona Ward is eerie and disturbing</p><p>Wilder Harlow is a weird, lonely teenager when his warring parents bring him to a New England seaside town for the summer. There, he meets the best friends he will ever have, Harper and Nat; they spend their days swimming and boating, and talking about the mysterious Dagger Man who haunts the bedrooms of the town’s children at night. But as they swim, and fall in love, and dare one another, they discover a horror far worse than the Dagger Man’s shadowy presence – a murder that will follow Wilder for decades. “There’s a look in her eye like she knows, somewhere deep down, that her time will be cut short,” he says later. “It’s strangely common, I have found, with photographs of the dead. It’s there in their faces – what’s to come. But of course that can’t be true. It’s us who are left behind who see it. Who put it there.”</p><p><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/looking-glass-sound-9781800810976">Looking Glass Sound</a></strong> (Viper), the latest thriller from <em>The Last House on Needless Street</em> author Catriona Ward, opens as a coming-of-age story told through Wilder’s unpublished memoir of his childhood. But it becomes something much deeper and stranger when we meet Wilder in adulthood and learn about stories layered on top of stories, horrors piled on horrors. Eerie and disturbing, it is another darkly atmospheric slice of the literary horror/thriller genre that Ward is making her own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/16/the-best-recent-crime-thriller-writing-review-roundup-looking-glass-sound-catriona-ward-the-last-passenger-will-dean-end-of-the-game-holly-watt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Largely improvised, Erige Sehiri’s film packs argument, gossip, romance and social criticism into a busy day of fruit picking</p><p>French-Tunisian documentary maker Erige Sehiri makes a watchable fiction feature with this shrewd, sympathetic ensemble study, which takes place as promised in the title: over a single working day in a fig tree orchard in Kesra, north-western Tunisia. Every day a truck comes to pick up a crowd of people doing cash-in-hand work picking the fruit: largely women, young and old, and some men. The long working day unfolds as the shadows shorten, then lengthen and friendships, enmities, generational and political disputes and embryonic and failed love affairs are revealed to us.</p><p>The movie is largely improvised and Sehiri appears often to have set up specific situations for two or three characters to work around, so there are some slightly protracted, shapeless, acting-class improv conversations and arguments, and even some improv fighting; sometimes the film loses its narrative traction. But the loose style gives the film an easy and attractive swing and there are times when it looks very real: the moment when the dilapidated tailgate falls off the back of the truck was surely authentic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/16/under-the-fig-trees-review-beguiling-battle-of-the-sexes-in-tunisian-fields">Continue reading...</a>

<p>That was almost 20 years ago and we now have separate bedrooms. Is there any way back?</p><p><strong>I’ve been with my wife for 20 years. </strong><strong>For the first few years we had a fairly active sex</strong><strong> life</strong><strong>, but suddenly, </strong><strong>during an argument, she announced that sex with her former husband was better than with me. </strong><strong>Since then we have not had sex. I guess this is because I subconsciously believe that </strong><strong>if we </strong><strong>do, I will be competing to be better than her ex. I have attempted to discuss this with her but she has closed the door on that possibility. She has also </strong><strong>moved into her own bedroom because of my snoring. </strong><strong>Is there any way back (or forward maybe)?</strong></p><p>A statement made in anger by one’s partner that is designed to hurt and humiliate is rarely fully accurate. Try not to take this as the truth. What is most relevant is that your wife has pushed you away and withdrawn … and it’s not really about your snoring. As a couple, you have some vital repair work that needs to be done. I would start by seeking some help for your self-esteem, and learn how to best open the conversation. It is likely that you would greatly benefit from couples counselling. Many people reach an impasse in their relationship, then simply retreat and live in misery from then on. Don’t let this happen to you. Remind your wife that you both enjoyed being together once, and implore her to join you in doing your very best to get that back.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>Lyra was at the genre’s 1950s birth in Rio beachside jams, bringing sensuality to Brazil’s serious music scene. He explains how he shaped bossa’s stunning melodies – and gave it a social conscience</p><p>In 1959, Carlos Lyra’s musical partner and lyricist Ronaldo Bôscoli said that bossa nova is a state of mind. Lyra thought he was talking nonsense. “Today, I’m actually agreeing with him,” he reflects more than six decades later, while vividly narrating a flashback of the genre’s early days in 1950s Rio de Janeiro. “With our guitars and bottles of homemade drinks, we used to go to the beach at sunset and stay singing through the night. The next day, we would do it all over again. It was a joyous, carefree atmosphere.”</p><p>Lyra, who conjured that state of mind like few others with classics such as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1HelEYnBkNyyd6PDSkx7sQ?si=65c03f279595455f">Você e Eu</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7c36LTHSIifm1BGzsAhUKa?si=fde92c5531904407">Coisa Mais Linda</a>, turned 90 last week and is one of the only musicians who helped birth the Brazilian genre still alive today.

<p>Comedians will say anything for a laugh – and I’ve given her years of material</p><p>Two years ago, my sister was about to turn 50 and I called her spouse to see what he was getting her. He rattled off a number of ideas so catastrophically bad that I was silenced, unable to find the words for how badly he’d erred. He’d booked her a number of short courses, and got her flute repaired so that she could start playing again, having given up in the late 80s. There are two things that my sister absolutely hates, to the point of phobia: one is slugs, and the other is self-improvement. I genuinely thought she might leave him, but figured 50 was young enough for a second act.</p><p>It turned out he was right and I was wrong: she is now a member of an orchestra. Running the numbers, he’s lived with her for almost twice as long as I did (they were teenage sweethearts), so I should have considered the possibility that he knew a thing or two. A standup comedy course was even more successful than the flute. She really liked it. She still does it. She’s very funny and, more to the point, incredibly agile. All her material is savage about people she knows well, so if, for instance, she looks out and sees her Mr in the audience, she has to ditch that set immediately and revert to the one in which she destroys her own children.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/16/i-am-an-inspiration-to-my-sister-unfortunately-what-ive-inspired-is-a-standup-routine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The political journalist argues that enduring values rather than reinvention is key to the Conservatives’ dominance. But he underplays the party’s current volatility</p><p>In the early 1900s, the Conservative and Unionist party’s mounting panic about defeat by the Liberals led it into a familiar place: the gutter, from where it repeatedly warned of the danger posed by people entering the UK from abroad. “The whole scum of Europe may come to this country,” said one particularly charming pamphlet, “by merely concocting stories about being political or religious ‘refugees’, however improbable their stories.”</p><p>A century on, this particular song remains much the same. As opinion polls and local election results highlight the Tories’ vertiginous slide from their landslide win in 2019, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, speciously connects people who cross the Channel in so-called small boats with crime, and says they “possess values which are at odds with our country”. Her ministerial colleague Robert Jenrick echoes those poisonous arguments, and insists that “the number of people who are willing and able to reach the UK today is astronomical, and vastly outnumbers what we are capable or willing to take as a country”. Whatever the past worries voiced by Conservatives about their reputation as the nasty party, the Tories have seemingly relapsed – tilting towards the far right, but also tapping into a nasty element of their own enduring political soul.</p><p><em>Tory Nation: How One Party Took Over</em> by Samuel Earle is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (£16.99).

<p>The climate crisis and farmers opting to grow more lucrative timber is putting many bat-makers in Kashmir out of business</p><p>For more than 100 years they have been making cricket bats from Kashmir’s willow trees. Along the highway leading to the town of Sangam in the Indian-administered region, dozens of little workshops display neat stacks of the roughly hewn pale wood outside. Inside, the willow is painstakingly fashioned into cricket bats, which are then shipped across India and to other cricketing countries around the world.</p><p>The humid environment and fertile soil make the area ideal for willows, which traditionally provide the material for cricket bats. Kashmiri willow bats have a reputation for quality and skilled bat-makers here have refined their craft since the 19th century.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/16/climate-crisis-kashmir-willow-wood-shortage-threat-cricket-bat-industry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After the Lib Dems’ triumph in the local elections, their leader talks about his ‘mission’ to get rid of the Tories, the tragedies that blighted his childhood, and how caring for his disabled son has shaped his politics</p><p>I meet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ed-davey" title="">Ed Davey</a> at his house in his Kingston and Surbiton constituency, a sprawling Edwardian semi. In the hands of a banker or, for that matter, a regular politician, it would be full of black and white tiles and plantation blinds, but in the hands of the Daveys it looks like an 80s novel, full of elegant chaos, every surface covered in papers, cellos and vests.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat leader, 57, is unusually open and approachable, guileless; I start bombarding him with the kind of questions you’d ask a friend you hadn’t seen in 20 years. Why have you got a high chair, when your youngest is nine? How come you’ve got so many cars? Two of the cars are theirs, a little electric one and a mobility vehicle for their 15-year-old son, John, who’s disabled; one car is John’s carer’s, and she has a toddler, hence the high chair. One is John’s teacher’s – “he’s taught from home. We tried two special schools, but they didn’t work out. When we started home education, he was non-verbal. He’s now verbal. Which is brilliant,” he beams. We head out to the garden, where I congratulate him on the local election results.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/16/we-didnt-show-we-cared-enough-we-wont-make-that-mistake-twice-ed-davey-on-love-loss-and-the-lib-dems">Continue reading...</a>

## The war on Japanese knotweed

<p>Once hailed as a ‘handsome’ import, this most rampant of plants has come to be seen as a sinister, ruinous enemy. Can it be stopped?</p><p>When Paul Ryb found himself a new home, in 2014, no one told him about the danger lurking in the garden. The flat, in the north London neighbourhood of Highgate, occupied the ground floor of a two-storey, brown-brick building. It had two bedrooms and a modest extension, but its truly splendid feature was a big, corner-plot garden. Ryb, a former investment banker, bought the flat for almost £1.3m and moved in mid-autumn 2014. His eyesight is severely impaired, so even more than most homebuyers, he had trusted his surveyor’s report, which testified to the “excellent condition” and “very few defects” of the house. The next spring, though, when planting season began, his gardener took one look at the garden and gave him the bad news. He’d found three clumps of Japanese knotweed out there, which portended ruin for the garden. Refusing even to touch them, the gardener packed up his tools and left.</p><p>Knotweed spreads slowly but adamantly, and it can take over a patch of land until no other plants survive. Given time, the three stands of knotweed may have consumed Ryb’s garden, so he had little choice but to hire workmen who dug out and carted away the knotweed and the soil beneath, at a cost of more than £10,000. Then he sued his surveyor. In 2019, a court awarded Ryb £50,000 in damages, citing not just the expense he had borne, but also his investment in the house and knotweed’s aesthetic interference with his “ability fully to use and enjoy the land”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/16/the-war-on-japanese-knotweed">Continue reading...</a>
