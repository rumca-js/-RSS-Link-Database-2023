While at home in Nashville, Hitchcock and his wife, singer-songwriter Emma Swift, started a record label (Tiny Ghost Records), and for a time, Hitchcock immersed himself in painting. But soon, he found he couldn\u2019t stop writing songs. \n\nOne of the results of those efforts is the new album, \"Shufflemania!,\" released in late 2022. Hitchcock, touring once again, visited The Current studio to play songs from that album and to chat with The Current\u2019s Bill DeVille about all he\u2019s been up to \u2014\u00a0as well as his exquisite taste in shirts.\n\nWatch and listen to the full session above.\n\nVideo Segments\n00:00:00 The Inner Life of Scorpio\n00:04:12 The Man Who Loves The Rain\n00:08:39 One Day (It\u2019s Being Scheduled)\n00:12:28 Interview with host Bill DeVille\n\nCredits\nGuest \u2013 @robynhitchcockweb \nHost \u2013 Bill DeVille\nProducer \u2013 Derrick Stevens\nVideo Director \u2013 Evan Clark\nCamera Operator \u2013 Peter Ecklund, Evan Clark\nAudio \u2013 Eric Xu Romani\nGraphics \u2013 Natalia Toledo\nDigital Producer \u2013 Luke Taylor\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
