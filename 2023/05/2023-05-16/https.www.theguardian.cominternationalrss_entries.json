Can it be stopped?</p><p>When Paul Ryb found himself a new home, in 2014, no one told him about the danger lurking in the garden. The flat, in the north London neighbourhood of Highgate, occupied the ground floor of a two-storey, brown-brick building. It had two bedrooms and a modest extension, but its truly splendid feature was a big, corner-plot garden. Ryb, a former investment banker, bought the flat for almost \u00a31.3m and moved in mid-autumn 2014. His eyesight is severely impaired, so even more than most homebuyers, he had trusted his surveyor\u2019s report, which testified to the \u201cexcellent condition\u201d and \u201cvery few defects\u201d of the house. The next spring, though, when planting season began, his gardener took one look at the garden and gave him the bad news. He\u2019d found three clumps of Japanese knotweed out there, which portended ruin for the garden. Refusing even to touch them, the gardener packed up his tools and left.</p><p>Knotweed spreads slowly but adamantly, and it can take over a patch of land until no other plants survive. Given time, the three stands of knotweed may have consumed Ryb\u2019s garden, so he had little choice but to hire workmen who dug out and carted away the knotweed and the soil beneath, at a cost of more than \u00a310,000. Then he sued his surveyor. In 2019, a court awarded Ryb \u00a350,000 in damages, citing not just the expense he had borne, but also his investment in the house and knotweed\u2019s aesthetic interference with his \u201cability fully to use and enjoy the land\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/16/the-war-on-japanese-knotweed\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/16/the-war-on-japanese-knotweed", "date_published": "2023-05-16 05:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Australian government threatens Twitter regulation as eSafety commissioner decries  Sewer rats", "description": "<p>Exclusive: Australian contacts for dealing with law enforcement issues, such as takedown notices for abuse or bullying, have disappeared from the platform</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/may/16/australia-news-live-24m-boost-for-fight-against-human-trafficking-rba-to-explain-latest-rate-hike\">Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates</a></li><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p></p><p>The Australian government would consider a tougher crackdown on Twitter if the company fails to comply with online safety laws and takedown notices, the communications minister has said.</p><p>In February, Michelle Rowland wrote to Twitter\u2019s vice-president for trust and safety, Ella Irwin, expressing concern over the axing of the company\u2019s Australian presence after billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of the platform.
