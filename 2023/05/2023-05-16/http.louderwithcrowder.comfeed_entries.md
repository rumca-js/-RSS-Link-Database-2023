Then one too many illegals make their way to Manhattan and their leftist NIMBYism (not in my backyard) gets signaled almost as bright as their virtue. Today's protests in Brooklyn will burn your retinas.</p><p>Let's recap how we got here. Joe Biden gets elected president <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-border-crisis" target="_blank">and causes a crisis at the border</a> by undoing <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ted-cruz-border-reporter" target="_blank">every common-sense illegal immigration reform by his predecessor</a>. Democrats were okay with it because it affected rural, Republican-voting towns. Sure, they sing the praises <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rnc-lawsuit-nyc-voting-law" target="_blank">of <em>THEIR</em> sanctuary cities</a>. They also know how few migrants can make the trip from Texas to Manhattan.</p><p>Then Texas started shipping migrants to NYC, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-marthas-vinyard" target="_blank">and various leftists started to sound like Pat Buchanan</a>. Mayor Eric Adams no longer wants NYC to be a sanctuary city anymore.</p><p>This brings us to today's protests outside of a Brooklyn public school, where the city is using school gyms -- while school is in session -- to house the unhoused illegals. Unhoused adult male illegals. In a building. With your children.</p><p>A woman I'm assuming with no children doesn't get why parents are mad. After all, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-border-thank-you" target="_blank">THESE PEOPLE ARE FLEEING WAR!!!11!!11!</a></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Marzena Wolert (right) is walking by protest and says she’s “disgusted” “they’re fleeing war and they don’t have a home and you’re not gonna have your gym?” She’s confronted by another woman leaving the protest as she walks by. <a href="https://t.co/qWcdoiqMwB">pic.twitter.com/qWcdoiqMwB</a><br />— Gwynne Hogan (@GwynneFitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/GwynneFitz/status/1658460535246012417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The woman thought parents shouldn't complain about adult migrants taking over their kid's gym because there is no way of knowing for a fact that the migrants are criminals or present a risk. She did not appear as enthusiastic about the prospect of them moving into her apartment.</p><p>The students are saying, quote, “We support asylum seekers but not on school grounds.” It's Brooklyn. As you watch this video, take a guess who a majority of their parents voted for last November.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Outside PS 17 in Williamsburg, kids chant, “we support asylum seekers but not on school grounds.” <a href="https://t.co/35iFNRuxIw">pic.twitter.com/35iFNRuxIw</a><br />— Gwynne Hogan (@GwynneFitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/GwynneFitz/status/1658443721535307778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>If you guessed Governor Kathy Hochul, the pro-illegal immigration Hochul defeated the anti-illegal immigration Lee Zeldin in Brooklyn 72% to 28%. I'm going to guess the parents outside PS 17 in Williamsburg would be okay with asylum seekers on school grounds in El Paso where they belong.</p><p>Hochul, on her part, is considering housing the <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/05/09/nyc-asks-flatiron-building-owner-to-shelter-migrants-report/" target="_blank">unhoused illegals in Central Park</a> and is telling New Yorkers to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/kathy-hochul-complains-new-york-bursting-seams-illegal-immigrants" target="_blank">deal with migrants living in tents on the street throughout the state</a>. Throughout the state everywhere...except I'm guessing outside the Governor's Mansion. </p><p>In conclusion, to Democrats who no longer view illegal immigration as a virtue now that they need to deal with it, this is what you idiots wanted. You voted for it and have been voting for it for decades. Now deal with it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Not all that notable, other than it being his first time winning the award. He's an incredible songwriter who puts on one of the best live shows in ALL of music. If anything, it's notable this was only his first time winning. However, what a photographer caught him doing after the awards show is what's catching people's attention.</p><p>Reuters photographer John Shearer caught the singer, still in his suit, helping the cleaning crew after everyone had left.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="instagram-media"><div style="padding: 16px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CsIOqiwNeDv/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div> <div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"> <div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CsIOqiwNeDv/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by John Shearer (@johnshearer)</a><br /></div></blockquote> </div><p><a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/country/chris-stapleton-cleans-after-2023-acm-awards-1235328600/" target="_blank">According to Billboard</a>, Stapelton and his crew were leaving the now-empty Ford Center in Frisco, Texas.  The singer saw a leaf blower not being used and, still in his shirt and tie, started to help the clean-up crew by blowing some of the confetti into a pile.<br /></p><p>Stapleton shared the photo on his own Instagram page, adding "If you’re gonna be a dreamer, you better be a doer." It was a quote shared by that evening's Female Artist of the Year, Lainey Wilson.</p><p>2023 has been a great year for the songwriter so far, which started when Stapleton sang <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/darius-rucker-super-bowl-anthem" target="_blank">the National Anthem at this year's Super Bowl</a>. With all the controversy over our National Anthem over the years, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-stapleton-national-anthem" target="_blank">seeing it performed in a way that drove grown men to tears</a> was refreshing.</p><p>And apropos of nothing, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhnMSVb0oYA" target="_blank">What Are You Listening To</a>" is his best song. I'll accept no arguments on this matter.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

What the FBI did was a hundred times worse than January 6th. </p><p>3. The intelligence agencies worked for three years to unseat a duly elected president. </p><p>Let me ask: do you trust our institutions?</p><p>Crowder and the crew had A LOT more to say on the show, including what's going to happen if there aren't immediate congressional hearings, on today's show.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

## Jiujitsu black belt takes down dude who attacked 7-11 employee, livestreams entire ordeal for our amusement

It works. Exhibit Q is Idriz Redzovic. He's the guy in top position. The guy twisted like a Bavarian pretzel is the guy who swung on a 7-11 employee. And praise be to the gods of content, Idriz went live on Facebook until the cops showed up. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/idriz.redzovic/videos/739240953872088" target="_blank">The full play-by-play is on Facebook</a>. I'll give you the tl;dr. Idriz was buying Slurpee's for his kids. Bottom dude was in the parking lot being drunk and high, yelling at a woman and banging on her car. Then bottom dude tried to flex on Indriz, before going into 7-11 to be drunk and high there. He swung on the 7-11 employee, which is where Idriz took him down and went live on Facebook.<em> "I went live to make sure nothing went on and I had witnesses to have my back.

## John Cleese destroys the argument of trans-activists by pointing out the inherent flaw in their logic

That's okay, because for me "comedy legend" comes first. I don't need someone to agree with my every worldview to enjoy <em>Monty Python</em>, <em>A Fish Called Wanda</em>, <em>The Great Muppet Caper</em>, etc. As Cleese has learned, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/john-cleese-just-asked-question" target="_blank">trans-activists</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/john-cleese-bbc" target="_blank">other radical leftists</a> aren't as open-minded and tolerant as you and I. And he finds their logic flawed.</p><p>Our story begins with author Ben Appel. He is a gay man who is surprised to find out he was a homophobic bigot for not supporting every thought and idea that transgender people have. Trans remains ranked #1 on the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings. Gay men rank somewhere between drag queens and lesbians.</p><p>An article he wrote was shared by JK Rowling -- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-haters-tweet" target="_blank">who knows where Cleese is coming from</a> -- focusing on this quote: <em>"For voicing my concerns about gender-affirming care for minors, I have been called a transphobic bigot. If that’s what speaking out against the medicalisation of homosexuality makes me, then so be it."</em></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">"For voicing my concerns about gender-affirming care for minors, I have been called a transphobic bigot. If that’s what speaking out against the medicalisation of homosexuality makes me, then so be it." <a href="https://twitter.com/benappel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@benappel</a>, on the new homophobia. <a href="https://t.co/AsM4qMPoZK">https://t.co/AsM4qMPoZK</a><br />— J.K.

Or does the hate only go in one direction?</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I've asked this question before...<br /><br />If I do not agree with some of the Transgender<br />arguments, this apparently makes me transphobic<br /><br />So...if they do not agree with some of my opinions, does that make them Cleesephobic ?<br /><br />Or does the hatred only flow in one direction ? <a href="https://t.co/ZCeWs4I8Qb">https://t.co/ZCeWs4I8Qb</a><br />— John Cleese (@JohnCleese) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnCleese/status/1658014529458958336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The answer is that hate only goes in one direction. Look no further than Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider, someone else who disagrees with conservatives on everything other than maaaaaaaybe trans activism has been allowed to go too far. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dee-snider-doubles-down" target="_blank">He got yeeted from being an LGBTQAIIP+EIEIO ally just for sharing a tweet.</a></p><p>But Cleese's logic is solid. If now you are -phobic (or -ist) for not agreeing with every thought someone on the spectrum has, the opposite should be true. The activists are, using their own logic, sciencephobic, biologyphobic, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-addresses-netflix-controversy" target="_blank">laughterphobic</a>, not <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/volleyball-player-north-carolina" target="_blank">robbing opportunities from biological girls -phobic</a>, and so on.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Turns out the executive behind Miller Lite's "s#!tty" woke ad is a raging leftist. Go figure.

<p>DC reporter Hendry Rogers did not uncover anything with the Ukraine flag on it. Yet. There might be a part two to his reporting.</p><p>Coors issued a statement claiming it's not controversial to say "women shouldn’t be forced to mud wrestle in order to sell beer." Odd, because... no one was saying women should be forced to mud wrestle in order to sell beer. </p><p>Granted, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/194144/beer-reigns-americans-preferred-alcoholic-beverage.aspx" target="_blank">men outdrink women in the beer department</a> 54% to 23%. And if there is one thing I know about men as someone who identifies as male, show us a hot chick hocking your product and we'll buy it. But no one, in 2023, is saying women should be forced to mud wrestle to sell beer. Just like no one is saying men shouldn't be forced to wear a speedo and keep their body fat under 10% to sell Zinfandel or White Claws.</p><p>Miller created an issue that didn't exist. Then created a campaign to solve the issue they made up. Then they acted all shocked and surprised their campaign didn't appeal to anyone. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-burr-wnba-netflix" target="_blank">Not unlike the WNBA</a>.</p><p>The moral of this story? Anywhere you live has a ton of local brewers that don't release commercials. Drink their beer.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

There is no way -- NO WAY -- your date could be wearing a wire and have James on speed dial.

Though there is a bit about Dominion no one has put together yet, and Mike LaRosa -- Jill Biden's former press secretary -- might want to call his office.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">OMG EXCLUSIVE FOX INSIDER TELL ALL; Says Tucker Termination was Part of Dominion Settlement<br /><br />Discusses "shady" work of "friend," former Biden operative Mike LaRosa now working for Dominion <br /> <br />“When it’s corporate media you’re beholden to advertisers...<br />we take money from Pfizer" <a href="https://t.co/6Gpj2Qqj97">pic.twitter.com/6Gpj2Qqj97</a><br />— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1658292827304992768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>LaRosa WAS Jill's press secretary. He now works for a PR company whose big client... is Dominion Voting. LaRosa also WAS friends with Langille, but he might not be after this.</p><blockquote>"You look at those little connections and you're like... someone who worked for the Biden White House was literally crafting the message for Dominion. So you're like, of course. [LaRosa] left working for Jill Biden to start this PR firm or work this firm whose sole client was Domninion, doing their comms. It's like right from the White House to go defend Dominion. So it's like when you know those little moving parts, you're like... everyone's shady.

<p>Tucker Carlson announced that he is bringing a version of his show to Twitter and that he'll be seeing us soon. I wonder if tonight is soon enough? I doubt he'd touch on anything Fox News-specific. It wouldn't be worth risking hundreds of millions of dollars. But Tucker's a smart cat. I'm sure he can find a way to address this without "addressing" it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
