Instead, he was introduced to the complicated world of retro game prices and the curious case of how much cheaper they are in Japan.\n\nHave you ever noticed how much cheaper retro games are in Japan than America? Kurt Indovina had to learn the hard way after developing an infatuation with the game D2 and its designer Kenji Eno. When Kurt set out to obtain a physical copy of the Dreamcast cult-classic, it was to his dismay when he learned how expensive it was to purchase. Well, the American version that is. Because, by comparison, its Japan release cost only a few mere dollars. What\u2019s the deal with that?
