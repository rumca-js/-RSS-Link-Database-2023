Just over fifteen years later, the WGA is on strike again, and we're already seeing its effects as the big networks look toward Fall. Disney's ABC network <a href=\"https://www.dgepress.com/abc/pressrelease/abc-extends-winning-streak-as-no-1-in-entertainment-for-fourth-consecutive-season/\">published a Fall lineup</a> entirely free of new scripted shows.</p><p>ABC's Fall lineup features one new show, The Golden Bachelor, a variant of its popular Bachelor show focused on older participants. The rest of the lineup includes shows like Celebrity Jeopardy, Bachelor in Paradise, Judge Steve Harvey, the Shark Tank, and reruns of Abbott Elementary.</p><p>When writers went on strike in 2007, the WGA was concerned about general pay, but also details like DVD residuals and Guild involvement in the then-new world of streaming video content. Netflix as we know it now was barely six months old at that point and hadn't yet developed (and arguably lost) its reputation for killer streaming television. Previous contracts didn't account for newer forms of media, and the studios liked it that way--a whole new world of streaming without a pesky union to cut into their profits.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/abc-wont-have-any-scripted-shows-this-fall/1100-6514252/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/abc-wont-have-any-scripted-shows-this-fall/1100-6514252/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-16 22:57:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Loki Season 2 Hits Disney Plus This October, Echo To Premiere Full Season In November", "description": "<p>Marvel's Disney+ shows have, to this point, mostly been one-off affairs.

dir=\"ltr\">Overwatch is a game that rose from the ashes of Titan, an ambitious MMO that Blizzard pulled the plug on. In the wake of this decision, developers at the studio reworked ideas they had for Titan into what would become Overwatch, a hero-based multiplayer shooter that was critically acclaimed and hugely successful. Blizzard's Team 4 is no stranger to picking up the pieces of a shattered project, but this process has been kept behind closed doors. The Blizzard way was to keep games out of public view until they were ready to be seen and to release them only when they were as close to the ideal vision as they could possibly be. That isn't the way anymore--not for Overwatch 2 anyway.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When the sequel to Overwatch was announced at BlizzCon 2019--where the game was also playable--it was with the promise of a PvE component that would allow players to gather their squads and play through a narrative-driven multiplayer experience. On top of that, each of the heroes that they'd come to know and love would be reworked for PvE and given progression systems that would allow players to unlock new talents. It was an ambitious new mode that, in many ways, was used to justify the \"2\" at the end of the title.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now, however, Blizzard has confirmed that the promised PvE component will not be released at all. In a video, game director Aaron Keller and executive producer Jared Neuss said that the team had made the decision to take the PvE elements of Overwatch 2 in a different direction and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-update-roadmap-features-new-characters-story-missions-and-reworks/1100-6514243/\">detailed a roadmap</a> for upcoming seasons that reveal a new hero, maps, rebalances, and a number of story-focused additions.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-pve-mode-is-being-scrapped-blizzard-explains-what-happened-and-why/1100-6514242/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-pve-mode-is-being-scrapped-blizzard-explains-what-happened-and-why/1100-6514242/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-16 18:50:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Overwatch 2's Update Roadmap Features New Characters, Story Missions, And Reworks", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Following Blizzard's announcement that <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-pve-mode-is-being-scrapped-blizzard-explains-what-happened-and-why/1100-6514242/\">Overwatch 2's highly-anticipated PvE mode has been scrapped</a>, the studio has revealed a first look at the game's 2023 roadmap. While not particularly descriptive, the image offers players a glimpse at Overwatch 2's upcoming game modes, cinematics, themes, and seasonal events, as well as two new Heroes.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Based on the details provided, it appears as if Overwatch Season 5 will have a medieval-fantasy setting, perhaps titled Mischief and Magic. The highlight of this theme is the season's limited-time event, Questwatch. No additional information about this event has been revealed, but its image on the banner depicts a fantasy map with a castle, mountains, towering evil lair, and more. Season 5 will also feature a new cinematic starring one cute-looking canine companion, the return of Overwatch's Summer Games, a 5v5 mini Competitive season, a Creator Workshop, and content celebrating Overwatch 2's one-year anniversary.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For those still reeling over Blizzard's decision to cut the game's story mode, it appears that at least some narrative is coming to the game in the form of Story Missions in Season 6. In addition, both a Hero Mastery section and Player Progression system are listed as coming to the game. While it's unclear if these will function similarly to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-overwatch-2-maps-mechanics-abilities-revealed/1100-6487847/\">the versions shown back in 2021</a>, the names of these features make it sound as if there will be some similarity.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-update-roadmap-features-new-characters-story-missions-and-reworks/1100-6514243/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-update-roadmap-features-new-characters-story-missions-and-reworks/1100-6514243/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-16 18:50:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom - South Lomei Labyrinth And Shrines Guide", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/\">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> South Lomei Labyrinth is a set of massive mazes in the Gerudo region.

If you're lamenting the return of durability, though, don't worry. For Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo also sneaked a secret equipment repair method into the game. Here's how you can easily repair your melee weapons, bows, and shields in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><h2>How to repair weapons in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p>The key is to find an Octorok, the squid-like enemies that are known for chewing up and then spitting out flaming rocks. These creatures are particularly common in the dry Eldin region near Death Mountain, where the Gorons live. The region is in the northeast portion of your map.</p><p>Octoroks have a few different attack patterns. If you get too close they'll hide, while if you keep their distance they'll alternate between a sucking vortex and spitting out objects at you. If you simply drop a piece of damaged gear in front of one of these hungry, hungry octos, they'll suck it into their mouth, make an audible chewing sound, and then sparkles will appear above them to indicate that the effect worked. You can reclaim your gear by either defeating the Octorok, or waiting for it to spit it back out at you. GameSpot has confirmed this works with all three breakable gear types: melee weapons, bows, and shields.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-how-to-repair-weapons/1100-6514188/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-how-to-repair-weapons/1100-6514188/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-16 17:22:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "WWE's Seth Rollins Has Apparently Been Cast In Captain America 4", "description": "<p>Captain America: New World Order recently started filming and already some new surprises have been reached the internet.

Like in Breath of the Wild, you can scan all Zelda-related Amiibo and get anything ranging from a horse and unique equipment to rare gems--or maybe just some apples. Amiibo rewards are almost always randomized to an extent. Scanning the Ganondorf Amiibo, for example, could get you some meat, precious gems, or even Gerudo-themed weapons.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Your Amiibo loot drops in a treasure chest at your location, so unlike Breath of the Wild\u2019s EX treasure, you don\u2019t have to go hunt it down.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You can scan each Amiibo once per day, and there\u2019s no limit to how many different Amiibo you can scan. If you own the entire range, you can scan them all once each day. To scan an Amiibo:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">Turn airplane mode off. The Switch uses near-field technology for Amiibo scans, so you don\u2019t need an internet connection</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Once you gain control of Link, hold the \u201cL\u201d button to open the ability menu</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Move the right stick so the cursor highlights the Amiibo icon</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Press \u201cA\u201d to clear the tutorial screen, and aim the cursor at a clear patch of ground</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Hold the Amiibo over the right stick</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">You\u2019ll hear a confirmation sound, and your items will appear.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Just bear in mind that, while the Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo unlocks are useful and include nods to previous games in the series, they aren\u2019t essential. You can find other gear in the game with similar stats or effects--without having to pay $100 or more from a third-party seller just to get a small plastic figurine. Here's a complete guide to every Amiibo that works with Tears of the Kingdom and the rewards you may earn for using each of them.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138053-tears-of-the-kingdom-link-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo has a chance of giving you the Champion's Leather fabric for your paraglider. The more common options are mushrooms of different varieties and Knight-series weapons. It's a handy way to stock up on important <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-recipes-list-and-cookbook/1100-6514134/\">cooking ingredients</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Breath of the Wild Archer Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138054-botw-link-archer-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The archer Link Amiibo may drop the Tunic of Memories fabric for your paraglider. If you don't get that one, you'll get a Soldier's bow and some fish instead. Catching fish is a bit of a pain, so even the runner-up prize is actually quite good this time.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Breath of the Wild Rider Link amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138056-botw-rider-link-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Rider Link Amiibo's big draw is the Soldier's Broadsword. The weapon is common enough, but this one has a special attribute that lets it charge spin attacks more quickly. You'll also get some extra mushrooms, and if you're really lucky, you may wind up with the Hylian Fabric for your glider.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Breath of the Wild Zelda Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138061-botw-zelda-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Zelda Amiibo may drop herbs and vegetables for cooking, with a slightly lower chance of throwing a precious stone into the mix. The type of stone or veggie is random, though. You might get lucky and wind up with Princess Fabric for your paraglider as well</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Breath of the Wild Bokoblin Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138064-bokoblin-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This cranky little fella is surprisingly versatile, despite being at the bottom of the enemy food chain. You can get any of the Bokoblin weapons or shields by scanning this Amiibo or the Bokoblin Fabric. They aren't great on their own, but fuse some strong components together, and you've got a free arsenal on hand.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Breath of the Wild Guardian Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138065-guardian-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Guardian Amiibo has quite a bit to offer. Its common drop is a set of metal objects for construction or smacking enemies around. You might get the Ancient Shiekah Fabric for your paraglider, and if you're very lucky, you could get an Ancient Blade. This is a fuse material that adds a hefty attack boost to weapons and arrows alike.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Breath of the Wild Urbosa Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138071-urbosa-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Scanning Urbosa will probably cause a shower of meat to come tumbling down. A Gerudo Scimitar or the Vah Naboris Divine Helm may show up among the meat as well. Urbosa even has her own paraglider material, the Gerudo Champion Fabric.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Breath of the Wild Mipha Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138072-mipha-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Mipha amiibo showers you with fish of various kinds, as you might expect. The Zora warriors' signature Zora Spear might be in the mix. Like Urbosa, Mipha has her own helmet and fabric--the Vah Ruta Divine Helm and the Zora Champion Fabric.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Breath of the Wild series Daruk Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138073-daruk-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Goron champion bestows rock salt and flint on you when you scan his Amiibo. Better still is the chance of getting a Cobble Crusher two-handed sword, and Daruk has his own signature items too. His helm is the Vah Rudania Divine Helm, and he may give you Goron Champion Fabric.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Breath of the Wild series amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138074-revali-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Revali Amiibo is a handy one if you're frequently short of arrows. Scanning his figure gives you several arrow bundles along with a selection of fruit. There's a lesser chance that you'll get the Vah Medoh Divine Helm and Rito Champion Fabric.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Smash Bros. Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138076-smash-series-link-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Epona the horse appears by your side when you scan this Amiibo. You also have a chance of getting the unique Twilight equipment set and a chest full of ingredients. After you get the full gear set, you'll still get ingredients after scanning.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Smash Bros. Zelda Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138078-smash-series-zelda-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Like her BotW counterpart, this Zelda Amiibo gives you a wide range of items. You have a chance to get flowers, herbs, bows, and some precious stones after scanning the Smash series Zelda figure. There's a small chance you'll get the Dusk Bow as well, a strong bow that lets arrows fly farther.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Smash Bros. Sheik Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138080-smash-series-sheik-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Sheik Amiibo fittingly rewards you with a bundle of weapons. You could get the Shield of the Mind's Eye, an Eightfold Blade, or a Phrenic Bow. There's also a low chance that you'll get Sheik's Mask, which increases your stealth.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Smash Bros. Toon Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138081-smash-series-toon-link-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Toon Link Amiibo's big draw is getting the Wind Waker armor set so you can look just like, well, Toon Link. You may also end up with fish or a few different weapon types. Boomerangs seem to be the most common so far with this one.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Smash Bros. Young Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138082-smash-series-young-link-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Young Link Amiibo might gift you with the Biggoron Sword. That's very convenient seeing as you normally get that weapon in the Depths. Uncooked meat also has a tendency to come sprinkling down from the sky after scanning this one, and you might get a less exciting Solider's Claymore as well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Smash Bros. Ganondorf amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138090-smash-series-ganondorf-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>There's a rare chance the Ganondorf Amiibo will give you the Demon Prince Fabric for your paraglider. If not, you might get some Gerudo weapons, and if not <em>that</em>, then you'll definitely get some raw meat. A few precious stones might be in the mix as well.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Twilight Princess Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138163-twilight-princess-link-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This Amiibo gives you Epona as well, and some players have reported being able to register her at a stable alongside the Epona from the Smash Bros. series Link. You have a chance of getting the Twilight armor with this one as well. If nothing else, you'll get some fruits and Knight-series weapons.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Majora's Mask Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138164-majoras-mask-link.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Fierce Deity armor set is back in Tears of the Kingdom, and this Amiibo is the way to get it. If you're lucky, that is. If not, you get swords of different varieties and mushrooms instead.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Twilight Princess Wolf Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138166-wolf-link-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Wolf Link Amiibo's reward range is actually rather sparse. Meat is the main thing it gives you, but it does have a low chance of rewarding you with the Mirror of Twilight Fabric for your paraglider. It seems like a very low chance, though.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Skyward Sword Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138169-skyward-sword-link-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Skyward Sword Link Amiibo has one of the better reward sets. Arrows are the most common drop, but you might also get some Soldier weapons and the unique White Sword of the Sky sword. There's also a shot at getting the Sky-themed equipment set.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Skyward Sword Zelda and Loftwing Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138171-zelda-loftwing-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This Zelda Amiibo has a similar reward set as the princess' other figures. Precious stones, vegetables, and herbs are the most common drops, and there's a special paraglider fabric if you're lucky. It's the Goddess Fabric with a Skyward Sword motif.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ocarina of Time Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138173-ocarina-of-time-link-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This Anniversary Edition Amiibo showers you with meat and Soldier's swords, especially the broadsword. If you're lucky, you might get the Time equipment set. This one brings back Link's iconic look from the 1996 Nintendo 64 game.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Wind Waker Zelda Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138174-wind-waker-zelda-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>This is one of the princess' better Amiibo. Toon Zelda can give you herbs, rare stones, and vegetables as usual, but the rare stones might include valuable Luminous Stones this time. You also have a chance of getting the highly durable Sea Breeze Shield and the Bygone Royal Fabric for your glider.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Wind Waker Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138175-wind-waker-link-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Wind Waker Link Amiibo is basically the same as the Toon Link figure. You have a high chance of getting boomerangs and fish, along with a random selection of swords. A rarer drop is the King of Red Lions Fabric for the paraglider, which is themed after Link's eponymous talking boat.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8-bit Link Amiibo</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1727/17277836/4138176-8-bit-link-amiibo.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Finally is the 8-bit Amiibo. Scanning this Link will reward you with a shower of weapons, mainly Knight series swords. However, there's also a rare chance that you'll get the Hero-themed equipment set.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-all-amiibo-rewards/2900-4749/", "date_published": "2023-05-16 16:35:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "New Steam Deck Game Bundle Includes 5 Highly Rated Games For $15", "description": "<p>Fanatical's latest iteration of Bundlefest is in full swing, and new game bundles are going live all week.

For the fiscal year that ends on March 31, 2024, EA predicts that it'll pull in between $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion in revenue.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-now-owns-almost-10-of-ea/1100-6514221/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-now-owns-almost-10-of-ea/1100-6514221/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-16 14:04:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "New SteelSeries Arctis Nova 4 Headset For PS5, Xbox, And PC Launches Soon", "description": "<p>SteelSeries is set to launch a new line of wireless gaming headsets for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC: The Arctis Nova 4.
