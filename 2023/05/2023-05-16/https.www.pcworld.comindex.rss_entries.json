[{"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Bing\u2019s AI features aggressively march into mobile, multimedia", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft said that it&rsquo;s rolling out more visual features to its Bing Chat AI chatbot this week&mdash;including mobile, where Microsoft&rsquo;s AI vision is now becoming more cohesive. It&rsquo;s a quiet effort to essentially phase out the traditional search box and make search more conversational.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways, the evolution of AI has been like the evolution of the internet: largely text-based, with later additions of graphics and then video. So, too, is Bing: Microsoft originally planned to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1506016/hands-on-with-bings-ai-chat-and-search.html\">add visual cards, ads, and graphics</a>, but scaled them down after launch&mdash;possibly because users didn&rsquo;t like them. Microsoft also took a similar approach with the more creative elements of its Bing chatbot: It leaned strongly into the creative elements at launch, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1515160/microsoft-is-making-bing-chat-less-weird.html\">dialed them down significantly</a> after long, weird conversations, than slowly turned them up again. Now, it appears that Bing is slowly going to become more visual again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, Microsoft is promising to add both graphs and &ldquo;cards&rdquo; of topics to Bing&rsquo;s AI chatbot, as the company promised earlier this month. Specifically, you&rsquo;ll be able to ask for a video in chat and watch the video within the chatbot, on various services. Perhaps more usefully, you&rsquo;ll be able to see summaries of information around a given topic, known as a &ldquo;Knowledge Card.&rdquo;  For that matter, you&rsquo;ll be able to use Edge for summaries of longer documents, too. Many of these features may not appear in Chrome, however&mdash;just in Edge, where Microsoft has more sway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s promised plugins, however, aren&rsquo;t quite here yet. When completed, you&rsquo;ll be able to ask Bing Chat to book you a table at your favorite restaurant on OpenTable, and complete complex math equations on Wolfram Alpha. Today, Bing will recommend restaurants, but it can&rsquo;t negotiate the reservation.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Bing Swiftkey AI\" class=\"wp-image-1919255\" height=\"692\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-16-092426.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing icon is your entry into Bing Chat, its AI chatbot.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft is migrating Bing&rsquo;s chat features wholesale to mobile. You can add a Bing widget to your home screen, including the ability to simply tap a microphone icon to ask a question. (&ldquo;Hey Bing&rdquo; is unfortunately not an option.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft is also placing a small &ldquo;b&rdquo; icon on SwiftKey mobile keyboards. Tapping it will allow you to use AI to write whatever it is you wish to write. The same key will automatically translate content to and from foreign languages. You&rsquo;ll see that same &ldquo;b&rdquo; icon when selecting a word in the mobile version of Edge, allowing you to query Bing Chat for follow-up information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps just as importantly, Microsoft is now broadening queries and your chat history across the desktop and mobile. Between all of these small, incremental improvements, Microsoft&rsquo;s message is clear: Bing Chat is Microsoft&rsquo;s opportunity to wrest back some of the attention that users have given to Google for decades, and it&rsquo;s moving quickly to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nInternet, Mobile Apps</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1919182/bings-ai-features-start-coming-together-across-edge-and-mobile.html", "date_published": "2023-05-16 16:58:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Asus expands AM5 warranty after burning motherboard controversy", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Those fantastic new Ryzen 7000X3D chips and their accompanying AM5 motherboards have <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1796033/amd-motherboards-add-bios-restrictions-after-reports-of-x3d-chips-burning-out.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">had some teething troubles</a> with burning hardware, as Gamers Nexus covered in a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiTngvvD5dI&amp;xcust=2-2-1918643-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">series</a> of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbGfc-JBxlY&amp;xcust=2-2-1918643-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">scathing investigations</a>. Not enough to trigger a full recall, but enough for Asus and other manufacturers to issue firmware placing further restrictions on overclocking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way Asus handled the issue earned particular ire, with PC enthusiasts taking the company to task after Gamers Nexus published a video titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbGfc-JBxlY&amp;xcust=2-2-1918643-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scumbag Asus: Overvolting CPUs &amp; Screwing the Customer</a>.&rdquo; The GN report also prompted high-profile YouTuber JayzTwoCents to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ-QVOKGVyM&amp;xcust=2-2-1918643-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">publicly end his Asus sponsorship deal</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the company is doing damage control. To ease the minds of potential customers, Asus now says its AM5 motherboard warranty coverage now extends to all beta BIOS updates (which are needed to fix the underlying issues with burning chips) and all user-accessible memory overclocking configurations, like Intel XMP and AMD Expo. Previously in the saga, Asus indicated that using those crucial beta BIOSes or activating memory overclocking would void your warranty, as covered in the long, but thorough Gamers Nexus video above. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday Asus posted an update to its <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.asus.com/us/news/ihctikmgahafyrib/?tduid=c46dfe453c3814b4d74a00f671811bdc&amp;utm_source=tradedoubler&amp;utm_campaign=affiliate&amp;utm_medium=Future%20Publishing%20FI&amp;xcust=2-2-1918643-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">official news site</a> (spotted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/asus-extends-am5-motherboard-warranty-to-cover-beta-bioses-and-memory-overclocking-presets/&amp;xcust=2-2-1918643-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PC Gamer</a>) with the following message: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We would like to reassure our customers that both beta and fully validated BIOS updates for ASUS AM5 motherboards are covered by the original manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty.

All recent BIOS updates follow the latest AMD voltage guidelines for AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Translation: as long as you&rsquo;re not trying to load custom motherboard firmware (which should be <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1812981/alert-msi-and-intel-software-keys-are-in-the-wild.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">all but impossible</a>) or break the BIOS/UEFI configuration tool to access voltage settings beyond what&rsquo;s available to users, your warranty is still valid. Which means Asus will replace your pricey AM5 board (though not necessarily your processor) if it, just for an example, catches fire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, if you have an Asus AM5 motherboard, and especially if you have a new 7000X3D processor, get your updates in. </p>\n\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1918643/asus-says-am5-motherboard-warranties-cover-beta-firmware.html", "date_published": "2023-05-16 15:02:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Razer Atlas glass mousepad review: Maximum excess", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you need a $100 mousepad?

(Seriously, my more business-like, &ldquo;grown-up&rdquo; desk mat is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reviewgeek.com/93122/i-bought-a-felt-desk-pad-and-now-i-feel-like-a-fancy-boy/&amp;xcust=2-1-1915728-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">barely any more restrained</a> in purely economic terms.) And compared to the very small field of competition, the titanic price tag of the Atlas is, if not reasonable, at least competitive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"whats-different-about-a-glass-mouse-pad\">What&rsquo;s different about a glass mouse pad?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever sat your laptop and travel mouse down on a hotel glass desk, only to find the latter useless, you&rsquo;re probably wondering what the deal is. In short, yes, the Atlas really is made of glass, and yes, it really works as a mousepad. And not just for super-fancy gamer mice, or something with the advanced, multi-surface laser tracking of a $100 &ldquo;work&rdquo; mouse. I tried it with a Logitech Pebble, about as basic as they come, and it worked fine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"hero image\" class=\"wp-image-1915730\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC01615.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s the secret? Well, there&rsquo;s glass and there&rsquo;s glass. In addition to the rubber backing that keeps the heavy Atlas in place on your desk, there&rsquo;s a slight color to the glass and a sort of frosting on the surface that keeps it from being transparent. This comes from a tiny .0002-millimeter etching pattern designed specifically for optical sensors. So yes, in short, it&rsquo;ll work just as well as any cloth mousepad, for any mouse you&rsquo;d care to throw at it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only don&rsquo;t actually throw a mouse at it. As the insert in the packaging is quick to point out, it <em>is </em>glass. So even though it&rsquo;s tempered, and should be at least as durable as the window of a car, you still want to exercise a little caution. Razer says never to place the Atlas on surfaces where it may stick out or protrude, don&rsquo;t place it on an uneven surface where any corner isn&rsquo;t touching, don&rsquo;t place unusually heavy things on its surface (like, say, that 128-oz Yeti thermos?), and don&rsquo;t stick anything too hot or cold on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Atlas bottom rubber \" class=\"wp-image-1915738\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC02153.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s a little more care than a normal mousepad needs. And because it&rsquo;s so solid, it&rsquo;ll occasionally need to be cleaned with a damp cloth (no soap or cleaning agents) to take care of dust and skin oils.&nbsp;I found myself cleaning it often after a long day of using my desktop for work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and this might be kind of obvious, but don&rsquo;t strike the Atlas with anything.

It&rsquo;s a simple concept, but the realities of its use are enormously complicated. If you need a quick 101 on what encryption is and how it&rsquo;s used on modern devices, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. But first, we have to start at the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394001/5-easy-tasks-supercharge-your-security.html\">5 easy tasks that supercharge your security</a></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-basics-of-cryptography\">The basics of cryptography</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the most simple, basic level, encryption is a way to mask information so that it can&rsquo;t be immediately accessed. Encryption has been used for thousands of years, long before the rise of the information age, to protect sensitive or valuable knowledge. The use and study of encryption, codes, and other means of protecting or hiding information is called <em>cryptography.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most simple version of encryption is a basic replacement cipher. If you use numbers to indicate letters in the Latin alphabet, A=1, B=2, et cetera, you can send a message as that code. It isn&rsquo;t immediately recognizable, but anyone who knows the code can quickly decipher the message. So, a seemingly random string of numbers:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>20 8 5 16 1 19 19 23 15 18 4 9 19 19 23 15 18 4 6 9 19 8</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&hellip;can become vital information, to someone who knows how to read it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>t he p a s s w o r d i s s w o r d f i s h</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s an incredibly basic example, the kind of thing you might find in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_decoder_ring&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">the</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_decoder_ring&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_decoder_ring&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">classic</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_decoder_ring&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"> &ldquo;</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_decoder_ring&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">decoder</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_decoder_ring&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_decoder_ring&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">ring</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_decoder_ring&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">&rdquo; </a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_decoder_ring&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">toy</a>. Archaeologists have found examples of people encrypting written information that are thousands of years old: Mesopotamian potters sent each other coded messages in clay, telling their friends how to make a new glaze without letting their competitors know. A set of Greek substitutions called the Polybus square is another example, requiring a key to unlock the message. It was still being used in the Middle Ages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"cryptography-in-wartime\">Cryptography in wartime</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptography is used to protect information, and there&rsquo;s no more vital application than warfare. Militaries have encrypted their messages to make sure that enemies won&rsquo;t know their plans if communication is intercepted. Likewise, militaries also try to <em>break </em>encryption, discover the pattern to a code without having the original key. Both have greatly advanced the field of cryptography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at World War II for two illustrative examples of practical encryption. The German military used a physical electronic device called an <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enigma machine</a> which could encode and decode messages with incredible complexity, allowing for fast and secret communication. But through a combination of finding rotating daily codes and advanced analysis, the Allies were able to break the encryption of the Enigma machines. They gained a decisive military advantage, listening to encrypted German radio messages and accessing their true contents.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"encryption laptop\" class=\"wp-image-344210\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/encryption-stock-image.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://unsplash.com/photos/uPXs5Vx5bIg&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Markus Spiske/Unsplash</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But an encryption code doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be based on complex mathematics.

Speaking to each other in these languages, both in plain speech and in basic word-to-letter cipher codes, the code talkers could communicate orders and other information via radio. The German, Italian, and Japanese militaries could easily intercept these transmissions, but having no access to any Native American speakers, this relatively simple method of encryption was &ldquo;unbreakable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"modern-electronic-encryption\">Modern electronic encryption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the modern world, encryption is done almost exclusively via computers. Instead of encrypting each word or letter with another, or even following a pattern to do so, electronic encryption &ldquo;scrambles&rdquo; individual bits of data in a randomized fashion and scrambles the key as well. Decrypting just a tiny bit of this information by hand, even if you had the correct key, would take more than a lifetime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the rapid computation available in the electronic world, data encrypted digitally is more or less impossible to &ldquo;crack&rdquo; by conventional means. For example, the ones and zeros (bits) that make up the digital contents of a file encoded on the common 128-bit <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Advanced</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Encryption</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard&amp;xcust=2-1-540005-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Standard</a> are scrambled around ten different times in a semi-random pattern.

In computer security, these are referred to as &ldquo;something you know,&rdquo; (a password or PIN), &ldquo;something you have,&rdquo; (a physical encryption key like Yubico), and &ldquo;something you are&rdquo; (biometric authentication, like a fingerprint or face scan).&nbsp;The latter two methods are at the heart of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1806627/rip-passwords-google-accounts-now-support-passkeys.html\">Google&rsquo;s new passwordless &ldquo;passkey&rdquo; authentication</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encrypting the storage of your devices protects them in purely electronic terms: without one of those unlock methods, it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult &mdash; bordering on impossible &mdash; for anyone to access your data. The extra processing it takes to encrypt and decrypt data can make computer storage perform more slowly, but modern software can help minimize this speed reduction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course if your password, or your physical key, or your fingerprint can be accessed by someone else, they can get to that data. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a good idea to use extra security methods. A common <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3225913/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-which-2fa-apps-are-best.html\">two-factor authentication system (2FA)</a> uses both a password (something you know) and a text message sent to your phone (something you have) to log in. That gives an extra layer of security to any information stored in that system. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html\">Using a password manager</a> to create unique passwords for each site or service you use adds even more protection, preventing hackers from reusing your login information if they do manage to pilfer your credentials for a given service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encrypting data doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s absolutely impossible to access improperly. There are always weaknesses and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3005182/bitlocker-encryption-can-be-defeated-with-trivial-windows-authentication-bypass.html\">ways</a><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3005182/bitlocker-encryption-can-be-defeated-with-trivial-windows-authentication-bypass.html\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3005182/bitlocker-encryption-can-be-defeated-with-trivial-windows-authentication-bypass.html\">around</a><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3005182/bitlocker-encryption-can-be-defeated-with-trivial-windows-authentication-bypass.html\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3005182/bitlocker-encryption-can-be-defeated-with-trivial-windows-authentication-bypass.html\">security</a>.

It carries itself with a stately, reserved manner, and wouldn&rsquo;t dream of troubling itself with trivialities like a radical new colorway or different badging. 2023&rsquo;s XPS 15 keeps the pomp but delivers one major improvement: It&rsquo;s a lot quicker than before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Looking for more options?

The top-tier GPU is kicked up two rungs<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/798334/dell-xps-15-9520-review-premium-laptop-with-oled-display-and-polished-design.html\"> from the RTX 3050 Ti in the outgoing model</a> to the RTX 4070 in the new XPS 15.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700H</li><li>Memory: 32GB LPDDR5</li><li>Graphics/GPU: Nvidia RTX 4070 (40-watt TGP)</li><li>Display: 15.6-inch 3.5K OLED</li><li>Storage: 1TB PCIe Gen4 SSD</li><li>Webcam: 720p</li><li>Connectivity: 2x Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C with Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode, 1x USB-C with Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode, 1x SDcard reader, 1x 3.5mm combo audio</li><li>Networking: WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3</li><li>Biometrics: Windows Hello fingerprint, facial recognition</li><li>Battery capacity: 86 watt-hours</li><li>Dimensions: 13.57 x 9.06 x 0.71 inches</li><li>Weight: 4.21 pounds</li><li>MSRP: $2,799 as-tested ($1,499 base)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The review configuration, which included the top-tier GPU and upgraded OLED display, rang up at $2,799. Base models are more affordable, however, with an MSRP of just $1,499. That drops the graphics to Intel&rsquo;s Arc A370 and the display to a 1080p IPS screen, but you still receive an Intel Core i7-13700H processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB solid state drive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dell-xps-15-design-and-build-quality\">Dell XPS 15: Design and build quality</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 15 design\" class=\"wp-image-1814608\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-xps-15-2023-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Dell&rsquo;s XPS product line settled on a design language in the middle of the last decade and hasn&rsquo;t changed since. It&rsquo;s a bit dull, to be sure, but shows a hard-won confidence in the fundamentals of the XPS design language. It may look the same as past XPS 15 models, but it&rsquo;s also handsome and feels durable. That&rsquo;s what matters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looks aside, the XPS 15 is rather slim and light for its size. It tips the scales at 4.23 pounds when configured with the OLED display found in my review unit and measures a mere .71 inches thick, as well as roughly 13.5 inches across and nine inches deep. The XPS 15 is a bit smaller than a MacBook Pro 16 or Razer Blade 16 (or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1064746/razer-blade-15-review-2.html\">Blade 15</a>) and weighs less, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The XPS 15 earns top marks in build quality with rigid panels across the top and bottom and plenty of reinforcement through the keyboard. Display flex is a non-issue and even the firmest typing hands will cause only a hint of wobble across the keyboard surface.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dell-xps-15-keyboard-trackpad-pen\">Dell XPS 15: Keyboard, trackpad, pen</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 15 keyboard\" class=\"wp-image-1814610\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-xps-15-2023-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>binary comment</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dell XPS 15 has a spacious keyboard with a centered layout. I found it immediately familiar and had plenty of room to maneuver while typing at high speeds. The centered layout ditches the numpad, however, which may bother those aiming to compete in the Microsoft Excel Championship (really, it&rsquo;s a thing).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key feel is good but unremarkable with reasonable key travel and a timid bottoming action that provides only a hint of tactile feedback. It&rsquo;s similar to an Apple MacBook Pro 16 and a touch improved over Razer&rsquo;s Blade 16, but <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1797659/lenovo-slim-pro-7-review.html\">can&rsquo;t beat Lenovo laptops like the Slim Pro 7</a>. Keyboard backlighting is standard and does the job with little fuss.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dell&rsquo;s spacious touchpad measures about six inches wide and three inches deep. That&rsquo;s large for any laptop and makes maximum use of the spacious interior. The touchpad is responsive and easily handles multitouch gestures but occasionally picks up unintended inputs when typing. Even so, it&rsquo;s a good touchpad and comfortable to use for hours on end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dell-xps-15-display-audio\">Dell XPS 15: Display, audio</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 15 display\" class=\"wp-image-1814611\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-xps-15-2023-2-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The entry-level Dell XPS 15 has a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS non-touch display, but my test laptop enjoyed an upgrade to the 3.5K OLED touchscreen. The display&rsquo;s 3456&times;2160 resolution places it just short of true 4K (which has a resolution of 3840&times;2160) but looks sharp all the same, squeezing an impressive 261 pixels into every inch. Fine fonts look excellent and games appear extremely crisp when run at the display&rsquo;s native resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image quality is otherwise excellent. OLED provides an excellent contrast ratio, wide color gamut, and good color accuracy, all of which adds up to a vibrant, punchy image with a tangible sense of realism and depth. High-quality content, like a 4K movie ripped from a Blu-Ray or purchased from a digital store, seems to leap out from the display in dynamic, high-contrast scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OLED isn&rsquo;t perfect, however, and brightness is a struggle. The laptop quotes a maximum brightness of 400 nits and achieved 403 nits in testing. This, combined with the glossy display coat, can make the display a tad uncomfortable in bright rooms. The lack of brightness spells trouble for HDR, which looks good but lacks brilliance and luminance detail compared to a Mini-LED display, such as those found in the Razer Blade 16 and Apple MacBook Pro 16.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoppers who care more for function than image quality should consider sticking with the less expensive 1,920 x 1,200 IPS screen. Though nowhere near as attractive, it offers a higher maximum brightness of 500 nits and has an anti-glare finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pair of upward-facing speakers are placed alongside the XPS 15&rsquo;s keyboard. They deliver strong, clear audio that won&rsquo;t be muffled or amplified by the surface the laptop is placed on. Distortion is an issue at high volume, however, as the bass crowds into the midrange and highs begin to sound shrill. Music sounds better at lower volumes, thankfully, and this remains loud enough to fill a home office with tunes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dell-xps-15-webcam-microphone-biometrics\">Dell XPS 15: Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A meager 720p webcam squeezes into the XPS 15&rsquo;s tiny top bezel. Sticking with 720p prevents the need for a webcam cut-out or larger bezel but comes at the cost of a fuzzy, ill-defined image. It&rsquo;s ok for video calls but will never help you look your best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dual-array microphone is better, recording clear, clean dialogue that&rsquo;s easy for listeners to understand. Audio quality remains rather tinny, however. Noise cancellation is included and effective, removing repetitive sounds of modest volume with no ill effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fingerprint reader is provided on the power button for quick biometric login. It works as well as any Windows fingerprint reader I&rsquo;ve tried&mdash;which is to say it usually works but can have trouble if your finger is dirty, wet, or placed at an odd angle. Windows Hello facial recognition is also available and much more reliable, as it works in both light and dark conditions and can be set up to recognize you with or without glasses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dell-xps-15-connectivity\">Dell XPS 15: Connectivity</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 15 ports\" class=\"wp-image-1814612\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-xps-15-2023-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>binary comment</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Dell is all-in on modern connectivity, ditching both USB-A and Ethernet in favor of three USB-C ports. Two of these support Thunderbolt 4 and all three support Power Delivery. That means the included 130 watt power adapter, which uses USB-C, can charge the laptop through any of the three USB-C ports.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The XPS 15&rsquo;s flanks also contain a full-sized SDcard reader and 3.5mm audio jack, but that&rsquo;s it. Those who still use older USB-A devices, or need an HDMI or DisplayPort output, will need to use an adapter. Fortunately, XPS 15 ships with an adapter that converts a USB-C port to USB-A and HDMI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That still leaves wired Ethernet in the cold. You&rsquo;ll need to buy an additional adapter or a USB-C hub/dock that supports Ethernet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or perhaps not. The Dell XPS 15 supports the latest Wi-Fi 6E standard as well as Bluetooth 5.3. Wi-Fi performance was strong with download speeds up to 80MB/s from Steam and The Epic Store. That&rsquo;s almost as quick as the speeds I receive from my Gigabit Internet service connected over wired Ethernet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dell-xps-15-performance\">Dell XPS 15: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dell XPS 15 I received was a mid-range model with an Intel Core i7-13700H processor, Nvidia RTX 4070 graphics, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB NVMe solid state drive. Dell offers some upgrades from here including a Core i9-13900H processor and up to 64GB of memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 15 PCMark 10\" class=\"wp-image-1814619\" height=\"769\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-xps-15-pcmark-10.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>PCMark 10, a holistic benchmark, kicks off the tests with a mediocre score of 6,665. This is notably behind some other powerful laptops, though it&rsquo;s also worth mentioning that the Dell XPS 15 is lighter and thinner than the laptops it loses to. The XPS 15 does manage a leap over last year&rsquo;s model, however, scoring six percent better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 15 Cinebench\" class=\"wp-image-1814621\" height=\"759\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-xps-15-cinebench-r15.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I was certainly surprised by the Cinebench R15 test, which shows the older Dell XPS 15 a tad ahead of the new model. The new XPS 15 also falls a tad behind the Lenovo Legion 5i, another laptop with Intel 12th-gen Core hardware. This indicates that the multicore performance of Intel&rsquo;s new Core i7-13700H is not much different from the prior model.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 15 Handbrake\" class=\"wp-image-1814624\" height=\"770\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-xps-15-handbrake.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Handbrake, on the other hand, shows a significant win for the new Dell XPS 15 over the prior model, though it also still more or less ties the Lenovo Legion 5i with the old Intel Core i7-12700H. The most significant takeaway from this test is that design matters. There&rsquo;s clearly significant variance between laptops with the same processor, which may cause results to bend outside of what&rsquo;s expected.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 15 3DMark Time Spy\" class=\"wp-image-1814626\" height=\"764\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-xps-15-3dmark.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>3DMark Time Spy brings us to the graphics benchmarks and, wow, the new Dell XPS 15 delivers. Upgrading from an RTX 3050 Ti to an RTX 4070 increases performance by an amazing 72 percent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, this result also marks a clear difference between the Dell XPS 15, a premium performance laptop, and peers that fall into the gaming laptop category. Competitors that focus on gaming toss in much more powerful GPUs and reap the benefits in 3D benchmarks (though they pay for that in battery life, as I&rsquo;ll show shortly).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 15 Shadow of the Tomb Raider\" class=\"wp-image-1814630\" height=\"822\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-xps-15-rise-of-the-tomb-raider.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> delivers another big improvement but, once again, marks a clear line between the XPS 15 and full-on gaming laptops. I still feel this result is a positive, however, as it means the Dell easily provides a fluid 60 FPS gaming experience. The older model could average 60 FPS, but would sometimes dip below that mark, which can cause stutters or dips in fluidity.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 15 Metro Exodus\" class=\"wp-image-1814633\" height=\"778\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-xps-15-metro-exodus.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Metro Exodus</em> demonstrates another game-changing improvement, improving the average frames per second from an unplayable 16 FPS to a barely tolerable 28 FPS. That may seem a bit disappointing, but the Extreme settings we use are quite extreme, and the Dell XPS 15 is just a few minor detail tweaks from a steady 30 FPS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also ran <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>to judge the laptop&rsquo;s ray-tracing performance. The RTX 4070 in the XPS 15 averaged only 20 FPS at 1080p with Ultra detail settings and Ultra ray-tracing enabled. However, turning on DLSS 3 boosted that to a steady 60 FPS, which means <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>ray-tracing is completely playable on the XPS 15. It even manages 35 FPS in the brand-new &ldquo;Overdrive&rdquo; ray tracing mode, again at 1080p and with Ultra detail and DLSS 3 turned on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Dell XPS 15 clearly benefits from its new hardware. The Intel Core i7-13700H is not a remarkable improvement, but seems a tad quicker on the whole. Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4070, on the other hand, is a gigantic leap over the old model&rsquo;s RTX 3050 Ti. The new model&rsquo;s MSRP is only $200 more, so it&rsquo;s not as if the better GPU completely blows up the price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These improvements change the nature of the Dell XPS 15. The prior model was attractive and offered powerful CPU performance, but it was hard to recommend to anyone who wanted to play modern 3D games after work. Dell&rsquo;s new XPS 15 with RTX 4070 changes that. It&rsquo;s now a fully capable gaming laptop that can play nearly all modern games at 1080p and 30 to 60 FPS, even when high detail settings are used.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dell-xps-15-battery-life\">Dell XPS 15: Battery life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dell crams a large 86 watt-hour battery inside the XPS 15. This isn&rsquo;t the largest battery found in a laptop of this size, as some competitors exceed 90 watt-hours, but it delivered excellent battery life in my testing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dell XPS 15 battery life\" class=\"wp-image-1814637\" height=\"781\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-xps-15-batery-life.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The XPS 15 looped a 4K trailer of the short film <em>Tears of Steel</em> for eight hours and 50 minutes.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not the best available from a Windows laptop, but a solid result for this category and a large improvement over the outgoing XPS 15. Owners will need to monitor the laptop closely to squeeze out a full work day of real-world use, depending on the apps most frequently used, but it&rsquo;s close.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dell-xps-15-conclusion\">Dell XPS 15: Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dell&rsquo;s new XPS 15 is much like the old XPS 15, but faster. <em>Much</em> faster. The one-two punch of new Intel 13th-gen processors and Nvidia RTX 40-series graphics provides real-world upgrades over the prior model.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The old XPS 15 was a respectable workhorse but not always an impressive performer, especially in 3D games. The new model is perfectly capable of handling even the most demanding modern titles at 60 FPS&mdash;when packing the RTX 4070, at least.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is still room for improvement. The touchpad can be overly sensitive and the webcam could use an upgrade. Still, these problems don&rsquo;t detract from the XPS 15&rsquo;s slim design, high build quality, and strong performance, and it remains a go-to pick for those craving a premium laptop with a balance of portability with speed.&nbsp;</p>\n\nLaptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1809123/dell-xps-15-2023-review-a-do-it-all-powerhouse.html", "date_published": "2023-05-16 10:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Best small factor motherboards 2023: Picks for Intel and AMD", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel and AMD&rsquo;s next-generation platforms are both here, with advanced technology like DDR5 and PCIe Gen 5. That means a plethora of motherboard choices, from frugal options, to the most princely. It also means more options for small form-factor PCs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After we picked the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html\">best gaming ATX motherboards in 2023</a> in our last roundup, we&rsquo;ve set our sights on a new goal: finding the best small form-factor motherboards in 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Small form-factor will encompass two main sizes: Mini-ITX, with a diminutive 6.7&times;6.7-inch (170x170mm) size, and Micro-ATX, with a slightly larger size at 9.6x 9.6-inch. (244x244mm) footprint.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After carefully going over each motherboard and using them in real-world scenarios, we&rsquo;ll answer the same questions as we would for standard ATX motherboards:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the features and specs? Is it an aesthetically pleasing design with robust build quality? How is the performance, and are there any compromises due to size? We&rsquo;ll also consider how the smaller form-factor means &ldquo;less space&rdquo; for features and some tradeoffs versus ATX. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"best-small-form-factor-gaming-motherboards-for-intel\">Best small form-factor gaming motherboards for Intel</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"asus-rog-strix-z790-i-gaming-wifi-best-premium-intel-sff-board\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ROG Strix Z790-I Gaming WiFi &ndash; Best premium Intel SFF board\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asus ROG Strix Z790-I Gaming WiFi - Best premium Intel SFF board\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1394\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-at-2.05.57-PM.png\" width=\"2481\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOverall one of the best available Mini-ITX motherboards\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tTwo onboard M.2 slots, Thunderbolt 4, PCIe 16x Gen 5&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSolid networking and great audio options with included Strix Hive\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tEnthusiast-approved ROG aesthetics and functional design elements such as Q-Latch for M.2 drives\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t$469 MSRP will deter some shoppers&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tMini-ITX has some inherent limitations due to its size\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGamers might find some features unnecessary, such as Thunderbolt 4\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHXS6HLH?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-3-1807578-6-1678163-11291&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$432.83 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>You&rsquo;d like to build a small form-factor PC, but you want that &ldquo;big&rdquo; performance? No sweat, the Asus ROG Strix Z790-i Gaming WiFi brings you exactly that. Make no mistake, at $469 MSRP, this is an enthusiast-focused premium offering.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What do you get in exchange? From the moment you open the tiny box, you&rsquo;ll appreciate the included accessories and premium feel of the experience. You&rsquo;ll get your usual fare of SATA cables and stickers, but there&rsquo;s more! You&rsquo;ll also get a neat external sound device, called the &ldquo;ROG Hive,&rdquo; which acts as a little hub. This is great for small builds that can&rsquo;t fit sound cards or more expansion internally. The &ldquo;FPS II&rdquo; card also gives you more SATA ports and headers when connected to the motherboard, a clever way of keeping the important components unaffected while adding more utility in a small package.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The accessories are fun, but you&rsquo;ll be really impressed with the performance. Robust VRMs with 10+1 power stages should easily handle even the mighty Intel i9 13900K. Keep in mind that you&rsquo;ll need some heavy-duty CPU cooling for the i9 CPUs, which may be a challenge in a small form-factor build. (You&rsquo;ll likely want to pair this with a slightly less power-hungry Intel CPU, such as the i7 13700K, if only to save space on cooling.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Adding to its pedigree is the inclusion of next-generation tech. DDR5 RAM is standard, but keep in mind you&rsquo;ll be limited to just 2 DIMM slots and 64GB of RAM. That&rsquo;s one drawback in comparison to larger Micro-ATX or ATX motherboards that typically allow for 4 DIMM slots and 128GB.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The latest PCIe is also here&mdash;with a PCIe Gen 5 16x slot for your GPU. Theoretically you can also get Gen 5 speeds on one of the M.2 slots, with some drawbacks: You&rsquo;ll have to share those PCIe Gen 5 lanes for that to happen, meaning your GPU won&rsquo;t have access to all 16x. The best solution is to keep the GPU at 16x, and just run the M.2 slots both at Gen 4, which is then fine. (Hard to saturate Gen 5 right now since the hardware is so new.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The good news continues with the onboard features. Need USB ports? You&rsquo;ll get a total of nine rear ports! That&rsquo;s a great number that rivals even some ATX motherboards. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, they&rsquo;re mighty fast, too. You&rsquo;ll even get two of the rarified Thunderbolt 4 ports for 40Gb/s goodness. They can even serve as display-out ports for monitors, along with the single HDMI-out available on the rear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For networking, you&rsquo;ll get 2.5Gb LAN along with Wi-Fi 6E. Bluetooth is also standard, allowing for flexible connectivity. This is akin to many ATX motherboards, so there are virtually no compromises on the networking front. With the included Asus &ldquo;ROG Hive&rdquo; external device, you can have a volume dial at arm&rsquo;s length for quick adjustment. </p>\n\n<p>So it&rsquo;s feature-packed and performs great&mdash;but how about the design aesthetics? It&rsquo;s a pure-breed ROG, or Republic of Gamers, high-end enthusiast design from Asus. With gorgeous styling, tasteful RGB implementation, it&rsquo;s one sweet package. While you may not see it much in a small Mini-ITX PC case, the visible parts are sure to impress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Are there any drawbacks to be aware of? First, it&rsquo;s certainly a pricey option at $429 for some. You&rsquo;re also paying for some features that gamers may not always need (such as Thunderbolt 4). It&rsquo;s also restricted somewhat by its size, compared to a Micro-ATX motherboard or ATX. Fewer RAM slots, PCIe slots, and SATA ports, mainly. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a fantastic motherboard for the right user. </p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not cheap, but if you&rsquo;re aiming to build one of the fastest Mini-ITX gaming PCs known to gamers, this is a key component that will help accomplish that task.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1678112/asus-rog-strix-z790-i-gaming-wifi-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ROG Strix Z790-I Gaming WiFi review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"asus-rog-strix-b760-i-gaming-wifi-best-midrange-intel-sff-board\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi &ndash; Best midrange Intel SFF board\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi - Best midrange Intel SFF board\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"2620\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-13-at-4.19.37-PM.png\" width=\"3868\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGreat I/O features for Mini-ITX&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tTwo onboard M.2 slots, 20Gb/s USB, PCIe 16x Gen 5&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGood networking and decent audio&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tColorful ROG Strix design, integrated I/O shield\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tB760 chipset doesn't take full advantage of Intel 13th-gen such as having more PCIe lanes&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNot for CPU tinkerers and overclockers\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BR8TVLPL?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-3-1807578-6-1670028-11291&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$219.10 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>If you&rsquo;re after a small form-factor build and want a good balance of features for the price, The Asus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi is a worthy choice. Coming in at $219, it is significantly cheaper than its Z790 counterpart, but with some notable drawbacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While both boards are Mini-ITX, this motherboard is wrapped in the B760 Intel chipset instead of Z790. That means a lack of real overclocking support&mdash;we&rsquo;d avoid most of the &ldquo;K&rdquo; Intel SKUs such as the 13900K. You&rsquo;re likely to use something like an Intel i5 13600, which will have less power draw and heat. Both are advantageous in a small form-factor build!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>B760 also gives you less VRM cooling in general, to go in line with the more efficient CPUs. You&rsquo;re also more limited with theoretical PCIe lanes, SATA ports, and USB ports. This isn&rsquo;t as much of a factor since Mini-ITX already sets a cap of many of these items due to size.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If some of those drawbacks are acceptable to you, there are many positive features to find here. While the included accessories don&rsquo;t include novelties such as the &ldquo;ROG Hive,&rdquo; they also add to the cost. You&rsquo;re still getting all of what you need here, like a Wi-Fi antenna, SATA cables, etc.&mdash;and nothing that you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, performance with most CPUs will still be stellar, even with the 8+1 power stage VRMs. You&rsquo;re still getting access to DDR5 RAM, albeit the same two-slot limit as on any Mini-ITX motherboard at 64GB.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PCIe Gen 5 is also here but limited to just the 16x GPU slot. That&rsquo;s more than acceptable, as functionally even the more expensive Z790 version offers similar capabilities. While you can never do PCIe Gen 5 on the NVMe slots, Gen 4 is more than sufficient for almost any drive you throw at it. You&rsquo;ll get the same two onboard NVMe slots on the more expensive Z790 version, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The rear I/O is another area of comparison: As expected, you&rsquo;re not getting Thunderbolt 4. That&rsquo;s fine&mdash;many gamers won&rsquo;t take advantage of these speeds. You still get 20Gb/s USB 3, however, which is more than sufficient for most users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll get the same 2.5Gb LAN and Wi-Fi 6E with Bluetooth as with all other offerings. This makes it virtually identical to more expensive varieties. Audio is fine too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This motherboard also has one of the neatest designs we&rsquo;ve seen&mdash;it&rsquo;s very colorful. With high-quality materials, the premium feel is carried throughout. It also incorporates excellent design elements that are very functional, like the integrated I/O shield. You&rsquo;ll find the Asus Q-latch, which lets you pop out your M.2 with a screwless design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Overall, if you&rsquo;re okay with the limitations of B760&mdash;such as the lack of overclocking&mdash;you&rsquo;re getting a great set of features here and saving a large amount of money.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1668403/asus-rog-strix-b760-i-gaming-wifi-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"msi-mag-b760m-mortar-wifi-best-intel-sff-board-under-200\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi &ndash; Best Intel SFF board under $200 \t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi - Best Intel SFF board under $200 \" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"2812\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-31-at-3.39.28-PM.png\" width=\"4694\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGood balance of features for a $199 Micro-ATX motherboard\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tTwo onboard M.2 slots, eight USB ports\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNice networking and decent audio&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tClean design, integrated I/O shield\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tB760 means no CPU overclocking&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tThe four USB 2.0 slots should be at least USB 3.0&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo heat sink on the second NVME slot&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRQSXRB2?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-3-1807578-6-1789015-10595&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$189.99 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>If you want to save some more cash while going Micro-ATX and still pack a punch, the MSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi is just the ticket. With an MSRP of $199, it will have some tradeoffs&mdash;the same B760 chipset limits noted above, such as lack of overclocking, and less VRM grunt as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You do get 12+1+1 duet rail VRMs, so you&rsquo;ll be ready for almost any Intel CPU. We recommend avoiding the overclockable K SKUs here to save some coin&mdash;you&rsquo;ll do great with even the standard i9 13900. With its lower wattage, it can be a boon for small form-factor builds that may lack proper CPU cooling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The increasingly mainstream DDR5 RAM is also supported, with faster and cheaper kits available as time goes on. You no longer have to hold onto DDR4 motherboards to save some cash, DDR5 is the trend going forward. You&rsquo;ll also get 4 DIMM slots with a 128GB limit&mdash;better than Mini-ITX, which offers two slots and 64GB. (A good reason why those who run heavier RAM workloads should consider Micro-ATX for a workstation-style build.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PCIe Gen 5 is mostly a marketing spec, with less real-world viability at this point in time. You&rsquo;ll have the GPU 16x lane as PCIe Gen 5, but everything else is PCIe Gen 4. This includes the two onboard M.2 slots, which are more than adequate for most users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the I/O is fine, with eight rear USB ports. Sure, you&rsquo;re only getting up to 20Gb/s USB 3 speeds, but Thunderbolt 4 performance is much pricier than most would be willing to spend on. You do get four USB 2.0 ports, which is certainly a bit disappointing for those expecting USB 3. Rounding off the features are the networking inclusions, with the standard 2.5Gb LAN and Wi-Fi 6E with Bluetooth. Audio is fine here too, no issues to report for the price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With plenty of PWM fan headers, RGB headers, and SATA ports. You&rsquo;re in good company with more expensive ATX motherboards here at much less the typical cost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Where you do save some money is in the smart design. No, it&rsquo;s not cheap feeling&mdash;quite the contrary. The build quality is great, and form follows function with an aesthetically pleasing approach. You&rsquo;re just not paying for fancy RGB effects or expensive OLED displays&mdash;which is welcomed to keep costs down.</p>\n\n<p>The I/O shield is integrated, too! Not bad for $199. Our only minor design quibble is that the second M.2 slot isn&rsquo;t covered by a thermal cover, something we&rsquo;ve seen in previous generations of the Mortar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the MSI B760M Mortar is a competent motherboard for those looking to stay under $200 and still have a good set of features. Overclockers won&rsquo;t be impressed, but most users will still get usable performance out of this unit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1787647/msi-mag-b760m-mortar-wifi-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMSI MAG B760M Mortar WiFi review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"best-small-form-factor-gaming-motherboards-for-amd\"> Best small form-factor gaming motherboards for AMD</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"asus-rog-x670e-gene-best-premium-amd-sff-board\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ROG X670E Gene &ndash; Best premium AMD SFF board\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asus ROG X670E Gene - Best premium AMD SFF board\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1079\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3K8A1265-copy.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1509\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tStunning design and high build quality&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tIncluded ROG Gen-Z.2 NVMe card&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNext gen features, DDR5, PCIe Gen 5&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tmATX will fit in smaller PC cases\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOnly two DIMM slots and some may find 64GB RAM limiting\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tmATX limits such as one 16x slot, and one onboard NVMe&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t$599 MSRP is bit high considering the specific use-case appeal\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Have you ever wanted to buy a big, beefy motherboard, like from the Asus &ldquo;Extreme&rdquo; lineup, but they were far <em>too</em> big? Fret no more, the Asus ROG X670E Gene brings a lot of that &ldquo;over-the-top&rdquo; goodness to a smaller Micro-ATX form factor. It&rsquo;s also priced for the premium market&mdash;at $599, it&rsquo;s one of the most expensive small form-factor motherboards we&rsquo;ve encountered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you get over the sticker shock, you&rsquo;ll be impressed with every facet of this motherboard. Performance is on par with any other high-end offering, with a 16+2 phase design for the VRMs. Indeed, the Ryzen 9 7950X or any of the X3D CPUs have met their match in this overachiever!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Performance perks continue with support for the fastest DDR5 RAM kits that AM5 offers. (Not as fast as Intel, but blazing speeds regardless.) One thing to keep in mind is that you&rsquo;ll be limited to two DIMM slots, instead of the usual four on Micro-ATX motherboards. Technically, if you&rsquo;re overclocking RAM or pushing the limits, it&rsquo;s better to have fewer DIMM slots for maximum performance. That&rsquo;s exactly what type of user will enjoy this motherboard the most! You&rsquo;ll be able to keep everything cool with seven PWM fan headers, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PCIe Gen 5 is here too&mdash;and since this is the X670E chipset, it won&rsquo;t skimp on PCIe lanes. The GPU 16x slot will give you PCIe Gen 5, plus an onboard M.2 Gen 5 slot. Don&rsquo;t worry,  you will get two additional M.2 slots on the included accessory, the ROG Gen-Z.2 card. One is PCIe Gen 5, and the second Gen 4&mdash;but that&rsquo;s more than enough performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Performance metrics are visible everywhere, even in the I/O, where there&rsquo;s USB4, with speeds up to 40Gb/s. That completes the 10 USB ports on the rear, an impressive number in both quantity and quality of ports. You even get a PS2 port for legacy devices, a feature aimed at overclockers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Networking options are standard, with 2.5Gb LAN and Wi-Fi 6E with Bluetooth. This is just as expected, with cheaper motherboards offering similar. You&rsquo;re not getting 10Gb LAN, however, an option we&rsquo;d like to see on a motherboard of this caliber.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Audio is robust with a SupremeFX 7.1 ALC 4080 codec, enough for most users, save demanding audiophiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Aesthetically, the first thing you&rsquo;ll notice when unboxing this gorgeous motherboard is the heft and sublime build quality. All parts of this motherboard feel extraordinarily premium, from materials to design aesthetics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The design shows &ldquo;ROG&rdquo; DNA (Gene&hellip;) through and through, with beautiful RGB in various areas. If you value high build quality and enthusiast-grade aesthetics, you&rsquo;ll fall in love with the Gene.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If the $599 price is acceptable to you, and Micro-ATX is your PC build/case objective, this is a mighty fine choice. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1522474/asus-rog-x670e-gene-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsus ROG X670E Gene review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"asrock-b650e-pg-itx-best-midrange-amd-sff-board\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsrock B650E PG-ITX &ndash; Best midrange AMD SFF board\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Asrock B650E PG-ITX - Best midrange AMD SFF board\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"2460\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-29-at-4.46.47-PM.png\" width=\"4818\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGood set of features for Mini-ITX&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tTwo onboard M.2 slots, including 1x PCIe Gen 5&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGood networking and audio&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tCapable VRMs\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNoisy M.2 fan may interfere with some builds&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUSB 2.0 ports should be upgraded&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t$289 MSRP still high considering some limitations\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BK5515B9?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-3-1807578-6-1785871-15081&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$318.29 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>If premium AM5 offerings are too spendy for you, we don&rsquo;t blame you. With higher-than-ever platform costs, it&rsquo;s important to save some cash when you can while getting top-notch performance. That&rsquo;s where the Asrock B650E PG-ITX comes in. With an MSRP of $289, it&rsquo;s by no means cheap&mdash;but you get a well-rounded performer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The board is wrapped in the B650E chipset&mdash;the &ldquo;E&rdquo; gives us some PCIe Gen 5 lanes that the standard B650 won&rsquo;t have. This means that one of the two onboard NVMe slots can be Gen 5&mdash;a great option for those who like to be on the bleeding edge. You&rsquo;ll also have the PCIe 16x slot at Gen 5, even though GPUs currently can&rsquo;t saturate that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PCIe Gen 5 means you get to take advantage of everything AM5 has to offer, and it gets better: The beefy 10+2+1 phase-design VRMs have a whopping 10-layer PCB, more than normal. Translation: This little motherboard will handle any Ryzen CPU you throw at it, even the mighty Ryzen 9 7950X. We&rsquo;re sure many gamers will want to pair this with the new 7800X3D, a fine choice for maximum gaming performance. You&rsquo;ll just want to make sure your CPU cooler is up to task, as this chips can get spicy-hot. Thankfully, the clever design of this motherboard leaves some nice room for most CPU coolers to fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Performance perks continue with DDR5, and the usual limit of two DIMM slots on Mini-ITX at 64GB. One area that the specs falter slightly is in the rear I/O. While you do get eight USB ports, four of them are only USB 2.0, which is a bit ancient at this point. You also don&rsquo;t get USB4 like on the pricier Mini-ITX motherboards, so speeds will be closer to 20Gb/s USB 3 instead. That should be fine for most gamers, but at $289, we feel the USB implementation should be a bit better. </p>\n\n<p>The design aesthetics of this motherboard are interesting, starting with the unusual M.2 fan. While it may look more like a VRM heatsink, this is certainly a larger-than-expected fan design, which may be hit-or-miss for some. Aside from that, it looks sharp. Functional design such as the integrated I/O shield and easy-to-use M.2 slots are great to see. </p>\n\n<p>Despite the compromises inherent to a Mini-ITX motherboard, you&rsquo;re still getting a great companion for fast Ryzen CPUs while saving some cash compared to more expensive offerings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1784498/asrock-b650e-pg-itx-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAsrock B650E PG-ITX review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"msi-mag-b650m-mortar-wifi-best-bang-for-buck-amd-sff-board\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi &ndash;

With a Micro-ATX form factor, it&rsquo;s a good mix of performance and features without leaving out anything essential.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s the standard B650 chipset, meaning you won&rsquo;t have PCIe Gen 5, but Gen 4 more than suffices here. Both onboard M.2 slots will be more than snappy, and GPUs can&rsquo;t currently utilize more than PCIe Gen 4. Performance is great, with VRMs packing a 12+2+1 duet rail system. This will make a perfect pairing for one of the standard Ryzen CPUs such as the 7700, or even works well with the zippy 7800X3D. While you&rsquo;re not getting the top-tier performance of X670E VRMs, you should be within a few percentage points. DDR5 completes the package, with fast speeds and an available four DIMM slots. This will be an advantage over Mini-ITX, plus you&rsquo;ll get a higher 128GB limit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You also get multiple PCIe slots, another clear advantage over Mini-ITX. This is useful for those needing to add some extra &ldquo;add-in&rdquo; cards, with an available 4x and 1x slot in combination with the GPU 16x slot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Showcasing the well-rounded nature of this motherboard, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of USB ports on the rear, including 20Gb/s USB 3.2. Networking offers the complete 2.5Gb LAN with Wi-Fi 6E. Audio is also good, with a 7.1 ALC 4080 codec and plenty of inputs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The aesthetics and design are simple, but effective. You&rsquo;re not getting RGB or crazy displays, but the motherboard looks and feels well built. With a classic, straightforward design indicative of other MSI &ldquo;MAG&rdquo; motherboards, it will fit into almost any build theme. Plus, the integrated I/O shield is a great feature that adds to the build experience here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While its $239 price is far from budget, the value is still here for what you&rsquo;re getting. Combine that with a smaller Micro-ATX package, and it has most of the features and performance of ATX motherboards while staying within a reasonable price class.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666878/msi-mag-b650m-mortar-wifi-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMSI MAG B650M Mortar WiFi review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-to-look-for-in-a-small-form-factor-gaming-motherboard\">What to look for in a small form-factor gaming motherboard</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing a small form-factor motherboard often has the same line of questions as the larger offerings, but with a few very special additions that are vital to the experience. We&rsquo;re dealing with smaller units here, meaning they can fit in much smaller PC cases, and generally will have less features than their larger counterparts. The goal is to find the best blend of value, performance, and features for the size you need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"choose-your-platform-intel-or-amd\">Choose your platform: Intel or AMD&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel or AMD will be an important decision. For small form-factor motherboards, you may want to aim at a CPU option that can still perform very well, but perhaps not tax the power and cooling requirements nearly as much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since you&rsquo;re typically dealing with small enclosures that may not be able to handle 360mm radiators, some of the overclockable CPUs such as the Intel i9 13900K or the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X may run a bit hot for most builds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, both brands offer tamer CPUs that have less power output and heat, such as Intel&rsquo;s Core i7-13700 or AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7700.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"plan-the-size-and-hardware-you-want-to-use-in-advance\">Plan the size and hardware you want to use in advance&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Small form factor requires a bit of extra planning, so you&rsquo;ll want to choose the size very early on. Mini-ITX motherboards can fit literally anywhere, as most cases will have the standoff screw alignments for them. Small cases can be a tight fit, so you may even want to consider shorter custom power supply cables to make sure it neatly fits without obstruction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardware choice is also important to consider: Intel will give you a choice of DDR4 or DDR5 RAM, depending on the motherboard you choose, so be aware of this. AMD AM5 is DDR5 only, so you&rsquo;ll need to pick up a new RAM kit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCIe slots and lanes also vary, even with small form-factor motherboards. Mini-ITX will only give you one 16x slot typically, which may be PCIe Gen 5 or Gen 4. PCIe Gen 5 lane distribution can also vary, with X670E usually having the best options. This will typically affect whether the top NVMe slot can be PCIe Gen 5 or Gen 4, but it&rsquo;s not a big deal in most use cases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"know-the-features-you-need-the-most\">Know the features you need the most&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Features can also be very different on some smaller motherboards due to size, combined with certain chipset limitations. You may not want to pay extra for some features that you&rsquo;ll never use, such as Thunderbolt 4. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most small offerings will still have a good set of USB and I/O, and Wi-Fi has been mostly standard. Keep in mind, though, that some cheaper motherboards do omit Wi-Fi, so it&rsquo;s important to go over the specs to make sure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"price-to-performance-matters-even-with-small-motherboards\">Price to performance matters, even with small motherboards&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices for motherboards have increased this generation, and small form factor is no exception. You&rsquo;ll typically pay more for smaller boards with comparable features compared to ATX.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many benefits to a small build, such as saving space. It&rsquo;s also very satisfying fitting powerful hardware in a small enclosure, and having it perform well. Just keep price in mind&mdash;sometimes the most expensive CPUs may not run as well due to the cooling limitations of smaller enclosures, so a cheaper option may be more optimal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-we-evaluate-small-form-factor-gaming-motherboards\">How we evaluate small form-factor gaming motherboards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, there are particular areas you need to be mindful of with a small form-factor gaming motherboard. The following is an overview of our evaluation process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"specs-and-features\">Specs and features </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you getting essential features, such as networking, M.2 support, and ample I/O options for the price? Small motherboards tend to have fewer features than their big ATX counterparts, so we need to find the right balance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, your tiny motherboard may be hidden behind cables in a small enclosure. Does it still have interesting design elements that are aesthetically appealing, and have some function? Items such as quick-release GPU PCIe slots, easy access to M.2 slots, etc.&nbsp;make a big difference to builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"performance\">Performance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because you&rsquo;re going small on size, doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to give up performance. Can this motherboard&rsquo;s VRMs and next-gen tech, such as DDR5, keep pace with ATX motherboards without much compromise?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"value\">Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are some of the restrictions on specs worth the decrease in footprint? Do you get the right features for the price? More importantly, the small size has to provide more value to you then it takes away in performance or features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\nDesktop PCs</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1807578/best-small-form-factor-motherboards.html", "date_published": "2023-05-16 10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Learn a new language before your summer trip with Babbel, only $199.97", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer is practically here, and if you have globetrotting adventures planned, now is the time to start learning the language of your destination.
