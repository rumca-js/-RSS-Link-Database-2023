<p>YouTube‚Äôs recommendations are leading young kids to videos about school shootings and other gun-related content, according to a<a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/youtube-leads-young-gamers-to-videos-of-guns-school]"> new report.</a>  According to the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), a nonprofit watchdog group, YouTube‚Äôs recommendation algorithm is ‚Äúpushing boys interested in video games to scenes of school shootings, instructions on how to use and modify weapons‚Äù and other gun-centric content.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers behind the report set up four new YouTube accounts posing as two 9-year-old boys and two 14-year-old boys. All accounts watched playlists of content about popular video games, like<em> Roblox</em>, <em>Lego Star Wars</em>, <em>Halo</em> and <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. The researchers then tracked the accounts‚Äô recommendations during a 30-day period last November.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>‚ÄúThe study found that YouTube pushed content on shootings and weapons to all of the gamer accounts, but at a much higher volume to the users who clicked on the YouTube-recommended videos,‚Äù the TTP writes. ‚ÄúThese videos included scenes depicting school shootings and other mass shooting events; graphic demonstrations of how much damage guns can inflict on a human body; and how-to guides for converting a handgun to a fully automatic weapon.‚Äù</p><p>As the report notes, several of the recommended videos appeared to violate YouTube‚Äôs own policies. Recommendations included videos of a young girl firing a gun and tutorials on converting handguns into ‚Äúfully automatic‚Äù weapons and other modifications. Some of these videos were also monetized with ads.</p><p>In a statement, a YouTube spokesperson pointed to the YouTube Kids app and its in-app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-parental-controls-tweens-teens-supervised-accounts-160050870.html"><ins>supervision</ins></a> tools,  which ‚Äúcreate a safer experience for tweens and teens‚Äù on its platform.</p><p>‚ÄúWe welcome research on our recommendations, and we‚Äôre exploring more ways to bring in academic researchers to study our systems,‚Äù the spokesperson said. ‚ÄúBut in reviewing this report‚Äôs methodology, it‚Äôs difficult for us to draw strong conclusions. For example, the study doesn‚Äôt provide context of how many overall videos were recommended to the test accounts, and also doesn‚Äôt give insight into how the test accounts were set up, including whether YouTube‚Äôs Supervised Experiences tools were applied.‚Äù</p><p>The TTP report is far from the first time researchers have raised questions about YouTube‚Äôs recommendation algorithm. The company has also spent years working to reduce so-called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-25-youtube-conspiracy-video-recommendation-policy.html"><ins>‚Äúborderline‚Äù</ins></a> content ‚Äî videos that don't break its rules outright but may otherwise be unsuitable for mass distribution ‚Äî from appearing in recommendations. And last year, the company said it was considering <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-could-break-sharing-on-borderline-content-to-fight-misinformation-201819354.html"><ins>disabling</ins></a> sharing altogether on some such content.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/youtubes-recommendations-are-leading-kids-to-gun-videos-report-says-231207580.html?src=rss

<p>At long last, you can respond to posts on Instagram with GIFs. Company head Adam Mosseri announced the feature addition in his recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-bringing-telegram-like-channels-to-instagram-184054107.html"><ins>Instagram Channels</ins></a> chat with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ‚ÄúThis is a bit of ‚Äòfinally feature,‚Äô but we‚Äôre launching GIFs in comments today,‚Äù Mosseri told his boss.</p><p>The feature, as you would expect, allows you to comment on a post, or something someone else said, with a GIF from Giphy. That‚Äôs the same Giphy the UK‚Äôs Competition and Markets Authority <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-to-sell-giphy-after-losing-uk-cma-appeal-132033129.html"><ins>ordered Meta to sell last year</ins></a>. Mosseri said Instagram is also testing lyrics in Reels. The feature appears to build on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-automatic-captions-stories-194326833.html"><ins>auto-caption sticker</ins></a> Meta introduced back in 2021. Judging from the screenshot Mosseri shared, a timeline at the bottom of the interface will make for user to sync the captions properly. So there you have it, you can finally comment on a post with a GIF. Maybe this means Instagram will finally get around to making a dedicated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-ipad-app-adam-mosseri-160717090.html"><ins>iPad app</ins></a> at some point.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/instagram-users-can-finally-comment-on-posts-with-gifs-202625683.html?src=rss

## Overwatch 2's long-awaited co-op story missions will go live in August

<p>Blizzard has revealed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/overwatch-2/"><em><ins>Overwatch 2</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>roadmap for the rest of 2023, including details on when the first story missions are coming to the game. They'll be available in season six, which should start in mid-August.</p><p>Story missions are part of the long-awaited co-op side of the game. When Blizzard released <em>Overwatch 2 </em>last October, the player vs. environment (PvE) aspects of the game that it first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-01-blizzard-overwatch-2-blizzcon-gameplay-trailer.html"><ins>showed off at BlizzCon in 2019</ins></a> were not available. That's because the team <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-pvp-beta-update-pve-175309062.html"><ins>needed more time</ins></a> to work on the PvE modes.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The studio didn't want to keep fans waiting much longer for an overhaul of the traditional, competitive (or PvP) side of <em>Overwatch 2 </em>after what was effectively a two-year content drought. So, Blizzard split development of the two halves so it could get the sequel out faster. There have been PvE experiences in <em>Overwatch 2</em>, but so far they've been constrained to limited-time events.</p><div id="db7f3932b61140e0be0029bca7e2ddde"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overwatch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Overwatch2</a>: A Look Ahead ‚ú® <br /><br />Join us as we share more details about everything we have planned for 2023, including new events, PvE, new Heroes, new maps, &amp; more.<br /><br />üëÄ <a href="https://t.co/FEyTC2p7eL">https://t.co/FEyTC2p7eL</a><a href="https://t.co/lGd1uABbfN">pic.twitter.com/lGd1uABbfN</a></p>‚Äî Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1658532777225060354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>It's worth noting that this won't be the full PvE vision that Blizzard laid out almost four years ago. &quot;Development on the PvE experience really hasn't made the progress that we would have hoped,&quot; <em>Overwatch 2</em> executive producer Jared Neuss said. The team had created &quot;a bunch of amazing content,&quot; including &quot;ridiculous&quot; gameplay augmentations for heroes. &quot;Unfortunately, the effort required to pull all of that together into a Blizzard-quality experience that we can ship to you is huge,&quot; Neuss said. &quot;With everything we've learned about what it takes to operate this game at the level you deserve, it's clear that we can't deliver on that original vision for PvE.&quot;</p><p>Hero missions have been cut in order to not pull too many resources away from the live game, which is the priority for Blizzard. As such, talent trees, an RPG-style feature of hero missions that would have enabled players to customize hero abilities, have been scrapped.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not to say there aren't intriguing PvE features coming. A single-player version of a PvE experience with a leaderboard is in the works. A ton of co-op features are planned and Blizzard will continue to add content on a frequent basis, including more story missions.</p><div id="0427c4373ce346a0ac9b46e6c25207d2"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Before the story missions debut in a few months, there's a whole new season in between. Season five will arrive in June with what appears to be a fantasy theme. Fans can expect a new limited-time event called Questwatch, a new cinematic, the Summer Games event and updates for the Workshop mode, in which players can create custom games. The On Fire system, which lets everyone in a match see when certain players are performing especially well, will return in season five too.</p><p>Story missions aren't the only big change on the docket for season six. The developers say this season will mark the biggest update since launch. Blizzard will add another support hero, a firing range and an overhauled player progression system. The Anniversary event will return as well. Perhaps most intriguingly, there will be a new map type for the PvP modes called Flashpoint, which will debut with two new maps.</p><p>There will be a bigger focus on building out the story of <em>Overwatch 2 </em>as well. For one thing, seasons will be named and, with the help of in-game cinematics, season six will &quot;push the narrative arc of Overwatch forward for the first time since the original game release.&quot;</p><p>Looking ahead to season seven and beyond, Blizzard is promising reworks for Sombra (yes, another one) and Roadhog. Also in the pipeline are another collaboration following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2s-first-crossover-skin-transforms-doomfist-into-one-punch-man-204542726.html">One-Punch Man crossover</a>, a fresh tank hero, a control map, a winter event, a lore database and, most excitingly for me, the return of competitive Mystery Heroes.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2s-long-awaited-co-op-story-missions-will-go-live-in-august-193108073.html?src=rss

## Google will start purging inactive accounts later this year

<p>If you have a Google account you haven‚Äôt used in a while but want to hang onto, you may want to log back in. The company <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/updating-our-inactive-account-policies/">announced</a> today that it will begin deleting accounts that have been inactive for at least two years. Google frames it as a privacy-enhancing move, but it‚Äôs easy to also see it as a cost-cutting measure to free up storage on Google‚Äôs servers.</p><p>Starting later this year, anyone with an account that‚Äôs been inactive for two years will receive an email warning them that it will be deactivated if they don‚Äôt log in within 60 days. After deactivation, you‚Äôll have another 60 days to sign in before the company permanently deletes it. So, in total, that‚Äôs about four months‚Äô worth of notice to recover your account, which sounds reasonable enough. Google says the earliest it will begin deleting accounts is December 2023.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company will send warning emails to both the account in danger of being deleted and any recovery emails you added. The deactivation and deletion will apply to everything you use that account for, including Gmail, Drive, Docs, YouTube, Google Photos, Meet and Calendar. It only applies to personal accounts, so work or school emails will be spared the culling.</p><p>Although the company‚Äôs stated privacy motive may be a convenient way to avoid saying, ‚ÄúWe want to save money,‚Äù there is some substance to that framing. In addition to not having up-to-date passwords, abandoned accounts are ten times less likely to have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-two-factor-authentication-161224608.html">two-factor authentication</a> set up, making them more vulnerable to hijacking.</p><p>Google has a web tool to simplify avoiding account deletion. The company‚Äôs <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/inactive">Inactive Account Manager</a> can warn you more frequently about dormant accounts while letting you decide what happens to your data. There, you can choose trusted contacts to alert or even download your account data if it‚Äôs in danger of deactivation. And in case it ever does get axed, you can plan ahead by using Google‚Äôs age-old <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout">Takeou</a>t feature that lets you view and export all your data.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-will-start-purging-inactive-accounts-later-this-year-191350823.html?src=rss

<p>Skullcandy is refreshing its popular Crusher ANC headphones with a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/skullcandy-unveils-the-crusher-anc-2-headphones-bringing-bass-to-a-whole-new-level-301824953.html"><ins>second-generation model</ins></a> that brings plenty of new features to the table, all at a lower price. Perhaps the biggest improvement with this iteration is the battery life, as these headphones get up to 60 hours of life with active noise cancellation disabled and 50 hours with ANC enabled. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-skullcandy-crusher-anc-headphones-announced.html"><ins>2019 original version of the Crusher ANC headphones</ins></a> maxed out at 24 hours of juice per charge.</p><p>The Crusher line has been widely praised for its bass-heavy audio response and the new ANC headphones continue this tradition. The exterior boasts a rotary dial for adjusting the bass on the fly, with the options to zero in on a specific number or choose from a variety of presets. You can also use the Skull-iQ app to create your own presets that transfer over to the headphones.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These are modern headphones so they ship with modern features like hands-free voice control, multipoint pairing, Bluetooth 5.2 and a dedicated button to launch Spotify. It also sports a quad-microphone design that Skullcandy says increases the efficacy of ANC, in addition to allowing for a transparent ambient mode.</p><div id="1efe2966aa1c4a6eb9cd42555f4ba2fe"></div><p>This is the second version of the Crusher ANC, despite several <a href="https://www.engadget.com/skullcandy-crusher-evo-headphones-151354665.html"><ins>Crusher models without active noise cancellation,</ins></a> so you‚Äôd expect a price increase to accompany the added features. Instead, the opposite is true. The new Crusher ANC 2 headphones cost $230, which is $90 cheaper than the original‚Äôs $320 asking price.</p><p>The new design looks similar to the old one, but the materials appear to be of a slightly higher quality.

## A third former Apple employee has been charged with stealing self-driving car tech

<p>For many years, rumors have been flying around that Apple has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-first-electric-car-full-self-driving-181011414.html">working on a self-driving car</a>, or at least <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-car-no-longer-fully-self-driving-193708593.html">an electric vehicle with some autonomous functionality</a>. Now, a third former employee has been accused of stealing some of that technology for a Chinese self-driving car company.</p><p>A federal court in the Northern District of California has unsealed charges against Weibao Wang, a former Apple software engineer. Wang started working at the company in 2016 as part of a team that developed hardware and software for autonomous systems ‚Äî technology that could conceivably wind up in self-driving cars.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1583881/download">the indictment</a>, in November 2017, Wang accepted a job with a US subsidiary of a Chinese company that was developing self-driving cars but waited more than four months to tell Apple that he was quitting. After Wang left Apple in April 2018, the company found that he &quot;accessed large amounts of sensitive proprietary and confidential information&quot; in the lead up to his departure, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-five-cases-part-recently-launched-disruptive-technology-strike">the Department of Justice said</a>.</p><p>&quot;Large quantities of data taken from Apple&quot; were found during a law enforcement search of Wang's Mountain View residence that June. Wang told agents that he wasn't planning to travel, but he flew back to China that night, according to the indictment.</p><p>Wang has been charged with six counts of stealing or attempting to steal trade secrets. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a fine of $250,000 for each count. However, that depends on officials being able to extradite Wang, who remains in China, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/doj-charges-former-apple-engineer-with-theft-of-autonomous-car-tech-for-china.html"><em>CNBC</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reports.</p><p>This marks the third instance of a former Apple employee being accused of stealing autonomous trade secrets for Chinese entities. Xiaolang Zhang, who worked at Apple at the same time as Wang, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ex-apple-employee-pleads-guilty-stealing-self-driving-car-secrets-064419668.html">pleaded guilty last year</a> to stealing technology from Apple's car division. Zhang was apprehended at San Jose International Airport in 2018 while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-11-ex-apple-employee-self-driving-car-secret-theft.html">trying to board a flight</a> to China.</p><p>In 2019, another former employee <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-30-second-apple-employee-accused-of-stealing-self-driving-tech.html">was arrested</a> before they could flee to China. Jizhong Chen allegedly stole self-driving car tech for a Chinese company. Chen pleaded not guilty and the case is proceeding in federal court.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/doj-charges-a-third-former-apple-employee-with-stealing-self-driving-car-tech-180824584.html?src=rss

<p>The US State Department has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-ransomware-attacks-against-critical-infrastructure">announced</a> a reward of up to $10 million for information that leads to the arrest of a prolific hacker. On Monday, the Department of Justice filed criminal charges against Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev, a Russian national and resident with links to the infamous Hive, LockBit and Babuk ransomware gangs. Starting as early as 2020, Matveev has allegedly targeted US law enforcement and healthcare organizations on multiple occasions.</p><p>In April 2021, for instance, he was linked to a Babuk ransomware attack that saw the computer systems of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington DC locked out. Last May, Matveev, whose online pseudonyms include Wazawaka, Uhodiransomwar, m1x, and Boriselcin, was allegedly involved in a Hive ransomware attack that targeted a healthcare NGO in New Jersey.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Separately, the Treasury Department‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control announced sanctions against Matveev. &quot;Matveev has been vocal about his illegal activities. He has provided insight into his cybercrimes in media interviews, disclosed exploit code to online criminals, and stated that his illicit activities will be tolerated by local authorities provided that he remains loyal to Russia,&quot; the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1486"><ins>Treasury said</ins></a>.</p><p>Of the ransomware gangs Matveev is allegedly affiliated with, LockBit is among the most active and destructive. As of late 2022, the group‚Äôs malware has infected the computer systems of at least 1,400 victims, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intercontinental-hotels-group-cyberattack-151926130.html"><ins>Holiday Inn hotel in Turkey</ins></a>. According to the Justice Department, the gang‚Äôs affiliates have extracted at least $75 million in ransom payments.

## TikTok opens a $6 million fund to pay creators of popular AR effects

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tiktok/"><ins>TikTok</ins></a> creators who whip up popular effects will soon be rewarded as the platform has <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-more-ways-for-creators-to-monetize-their-content-authentically"><ins>set up a new fund</ins></a> for them. Through the Effect Creator Rewards fund, the platform will pay those who create widely-used augmented reality effects using TikTok's <a href="https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/"><ins>Effect House</ins></a> tool.</p><p>At the outset, the fund will only be available in a few countries. TikTok confirmed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/16/tiktok-effect-creator-rewards-fund-pays-creators-popular-effects/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a> that the eligible territories are the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Payouts from the $6 million fund are based on engagement, but at the outset effects will need to meet quite a high threshold before creators are eligible to make money from them. For the time being, creators will earn $700 for each effect that's used in 500,000 unique videos within 90 days of being published.

It‚Äôs (sort of) like modern Twitter blue checks.</p><p>Buying into the feature also gets you ‚Äúproactive impersonation protection‚Äù and direct access to customer support.

For UK residents, it costs ¬£10 per month if you sign up on the web and ¬£12 per month if you sign up on an iOS or Android device. The price disparity is to offset Apple and Google‚Äôs store fees and is another nod to Twitter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unlike Twitter, you need an official government ID to opt into the service.

## After layoffs and an AI scandal, CNET's staff is unionizing

<p><em>CNET</em>, the venerable tech site which began publication nearly 30 years ago, has become the latest digital media company whose staff have chosen to band together and demand more. The <em>CNET</em> Media Worker's Union (CMWU) today sent a letter to Red Ventures, the private equity concern which purchased <em>CNET</em> in 2020, seeking recognition of a bargaining unit of nearly 100 workers including editors, writers, and video producers. According to CMWU, a supermajority of those in the unit signed union authorization cards.</p><p>Like the overwhelming majority of other organized digital publications, the workers who make up CMWU are responding in large part to an increasingly hostile financial climate in the industry. <em>CNET</em> has not been spared the same tumult that has led to the shuttering of <em>Buzzfeed News</em> and <em>VICE</em>'s decision to file for bankruptcy: the company went through three brutal rounds of layoffs over recent months, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/2/23622231/cnet-layoffs-ai-articles-seo-red-ventures">most recent</a> of which stripped approximately a dozen staffers from the masthead. &quot;We lost a lot of really great reporters,&quot; Laura Michelle Davis, an editor with <em>CNET</em> and organizing committee member, told Engadget.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Davis, that sense of uncertainty led to a number of voluntary departures, but also to the surviving staff choosing to organize. Despite those cuts, according to the union's statement sent to management today, staff have continue to be &quot;subjected to ongoing restructuring, cost-cutting austerity measures, shifting job roles and promotion freezes.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>CMWU has also organized around what it feels is a &quot;blurring of editorial and monetization strategies&quot; and a lack of transparency around, among other things, the use of artificial intelligence. While it was apparently not a key factor in beginning the union drive, <em>CNET</em> was the subject of a fairly public scandal recently, when it was <a href="https://futurism.com/cnet-ai-articles-label">revealed</a> by <em>Futurism</em>, both to the public at large and allegedly to the staff itself, that the site had begun publishing content written by AI without any form of authorship disclosure. Over half of those machine-generated stories were eventually appended with corrections for factual errors, and <em>CNET</em> later issued <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/cnet-is-testing-an-ai-engine-heres-what-weve-learned-mistakes-and-all/">something like an apology</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The unit is represented by the Writer's Guild of America, East, which has helped organize sites including <em>Vox</em>, <em>HuffPost</em>, and <em>The Onion</em>. Screenwriters from the union's sister organization, the Writer's Guild of America, have now been on strike for two weeks over a variety of disputes with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, among which also has been <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xMC9hcnRzL3RlbGV2aXNpb24vd3JpdGVycy1zdHJpa2UtYXJ0aWZpY2lhbC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjFiOThlZjItNzU3MC00NmFkLWIzMWItOWIzNjdkODJkZjg5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZu-etDsV9zP0POXnYO5cQ85B8qykqSlQeMgVjZ8Sl7C&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F05%2F10%2Farts%2Ftelevision%2Fwriters-strike-artificial-intelligence.html">the use of AI in content production</a>. (Disclosure: I was a member of the WGA-E and served on the bargaining committee for Gizmodo Media Group during my tenure there.)</p><p>While the contours of whatever contract CMWU may eventually bargain with Red Ventures are still to be decided, the bargaining unit will be looking to substantially similar wins in digital media as a guide. We've reached out to Red Ventures for comment and will update if we hear back. CMWU's organizing statement follows below:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>CNET</em> has been a trusted authority for original reporting, helpful explainers and honest advice for nearly 30 years. We ‚Äì writers, editors, video producers, designers and other content creators ‚Äì are committed to <em>CNET</em>‚Äôs future as a reputable source for tech reviews, news and commerce. That‚Äôs why an overwhelming majority of us have formed the <em>CNET</em> Media Workers Union, affiliated with the Writers Guild of America, East. We are confident that our collective efforts will allow us to better serve our audience and make a more collaborative workplace.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The digital media landscape is transforming rapidly. In this time of instability, our diverse content teams need industry-standard job protections, fair compensation, editorial independence and a voice in the decision-making process, especially as automated technology threatens our jobs and reputations. A union will help us adapt to new business strategies while establishing high journalistic standards and practices.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Since Red Ventures acquired <em>CNET</em> in fall 2020, <em>CNET</em> media workers have been subjected to ongoing restructuring, cost-cutting austerity measures, shifting job roles and promotion freezes. In the past year, three major rounds of layoffs have deeply impacted our reporting and our teams. Red Ventures cut senior editorial positions, eliminated the Roadshow cars section, drastically slashed our video team, gutted our news division and shut down science and culture coverage. These unilateral overhauls created low morale and unease, resulting in a wave of resignations and talent attrition. We face a lack of transparency and accountability from management around performance evaluations, sponsored content and plans for artificial intelligence. We are concerned about the blurring of editorial and monetization strategies.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>By unionizing, we‚Äôre joining our peers at other digital media sites who have won security and benefits through negotiating unit-wide contracts. We feel that a union is the only way to guarantee job protections, defend editorial integrity and ensure standard cost-of-living raises as well as fair severance packages. A union would give us a voice on new AI and marketing initiatives and allow us to safeguard our workloads, bylines and careers. We look forward to bringing together our largely remote and siloed teams in this effort.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are a passionate and loyal community of hard workers, and our rights should be enshrined and respected. We ask Red Ventures to recognize our union in a timely manner so we can begin the contract negotiation process.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>‚Äì <em>CNET</em> Media Workers Union</p></blockquote><p><em>Organizing within tech? I'd like to hear about it.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-11-mozilla-pocket-7-redesign.html">Read-it-later service Pocket</a> has unveiled some new features, including the option to create private lists of saved articles, videos and websites. Pocket Lists are only available in the US on the web for now, but the feature will be available globally starting next month and on mobile later this year.</p><p>You'll be able to create multiple lists with titles and descriptions. In the near future, you'll have the option to add several items to a list at once and attach notes to help you remember why an item is there. Later this year, Pocket will roll out the option to publish lists and share them with other users.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Pocket team suggests that you might set up lists for things like recipes, trip planning or simply stuff that puts a smile on your face for whenever you need it. This is a handy update from Pocket, particularly for those who like to keep things organized. You might think of it as a bit like having bookmark folders in Pocket or a different place to save Pinterest-style collections.</p><p>Elsewhere, Pocket has built a new version of its iOS app with the aim of rolling out features more rapidly ‚Äî the plan is to release updates every two weeks. You'll need to be on at least iOS 16 to use the latest app, which offers personalized recommendations and a more streamlined user interface, Pocket says. The My List tab is now called Saves, and it will offer access to features such as search, tagged items, favorites and a way to listen to audio versions of articles all in one place. One other handy update means that you'll be able to swiftly archive items with a swipe.</p><p>On Android, there's a very welcome update rolling out today. Pocket will now save log-in credentials for websites you've saved stuff from, so you'll no longer need to sign in every time you visit them. While in article view, you'll be able to move between saved items using Previous and Next buttons.</p><p>Pocket, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-27-mozilla-buys-pocket.html">Mozilla bought back in 2017</a>, added that it has removed some features. The team plans to bring back some of those within a few months, such as the option to highlight articles. Other features are gone for good, however, including the ability to recommend items to other users, which has been removed in favor of lists. To that end, here's hoping Pocket rolls out the option to share lists fairly swiftly.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/pocket-users-can-now-create-multiple-collections-of-articles-videos-and-websites-160043227.html?src=rss

## Samsung is reportedly buying OLED TV panels from LG

<p>Lucifer ought to take the temperature of the underworld, because it seems like hell has just frozen over. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/lg-display-supply-oled-tv-panels-samsung-elec-sources-2023-05-16/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/samsung/"><ins>Samsung</ins></a> has inked a deal with LG to buy high-end white OLED (WOLED) TV panels from its long-standing rival. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/lg/"><ins>LG</ins></a> may start supplying the panels as soon as this quarter.</p><p>The plan, according to the report, is for LG Display to supply 2 million panels next year, then 3 million and 5 million respectively in 2025 and 2026. At least at the outset, the company will reportedly be making 77-inch and 83-inch WOLED panels for Samsung.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It's an unexpected partnership that may actually make a lot of sense for both sides. Samsung could use the panels to help it make up ground in the OLED TV market. The company has taken the approach that OLED displays are a better fit for smartphones and tablets than TVs. One reason for that perspective is that OLED panels are expensive ‚Äî they tend to cost nearly five times more than LCD panels. On the TV front, Samsung has focused on making QLED models, which are cheaper than OLEDs.</p><p>Samsung has 6.1 percent of the OLED TV market, according to market research firm Omdia. LG Display's sibling LG Electronics is said to be out in front with a 54.6 percent market share while Sony has 26.1 percent. An LG Display deal could help Samsung overtake Sony in that realm or at least to better compete with Chinese manufacturers that are selling lower-cost LCD televisions.&nbsp;</p><p>The reported deal could help LG Display to turn its business around after four straight quarters of losses. LG Display also makes smartphone screens for Apple, as well as OLED panels for Sony and LG Electronics. However, its OLED manufacturing facility hasn't been running at full capacity. That, according to <em>Reuters</em>, is due to a drop in demand for new TVs and a "limited customer base." Analysts suggest that the Samsung pact could help LG Display max out its manufacturing capacity and account for between 20 and 30 percent of production in the first year. The agreement could add north of $1.5 billion to LG's bottom line next year.</p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vQGhkdHZ0ZXN0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwMjE2N2EwNC1kYjE4LTRkY2EtYjgwMi0zZDQ4NTNlOGJiOTAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc83g65LNjogF6BZjy-MO44zbsrxhLfgvkkRzAwf3j5_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40hdtvtest"><ins>Vincent Teoh of HDTVTest</ins></a> suggested to Engadget that Samsung might have taken this path to resolve volume and screen size availability issues. ‚ÄúQD-OLED panel production from Samsung Display is still limited in quantity at the moment, and the motherglass has to be cut to cater for both monitors (e.g. 34-inch 240Hz QD-OLED gaming monitors which are greater in demand) and TVs (e.g. 55-inch QD-OLED TV).</p><p>"QD-OLED is also only available in 55-, 65- and 77-inch screen sizes at the moment, while the WOLED panels supplied by LG Display can go up to 83 and even 97 inches, or as small as 42 and 48 inches," Teoh said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-is-reportedly-buying-oled-tv-panels-from-lg-143246449.html?src=rss

## Logitech's G Cloud Gaming handheld arrives in Europe

<p>After launching in North America and Taiwan, Logitech's unusual and relatively expensive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-g-cloud-gaming-handheld-preorder-amazon-logi-play-142636818.html">G Cloud Gaming Handheld</a> is coming to Europe, the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230516005092/en/Logitech-G-Expands-G-Cloud-Global-Presence-with-European-Launch">announced</a>. It's now available in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland, with special launch goodies like six months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.&nbsp;</p><p>With a seven-inch 1080p touchscreen and gamepad controls, the Logitech G Cloud resembles handheld gaming devices like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-edge-review-a-new-breed-of-gaming-handheld-170026147.html">Razer Edge</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-air-pro-gaming-handheld-review-180003707.html">Ayaneo Air Pro</a>, or even a smaller version of the Switch or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-portable-pc-gaming-133008285.html">Steam Deck</a>. However, it only packs middling specs like a mid-range Qualcomm 720G SoC, 4GB or RAM and Bluetooth 5.1/WiFi 5. That's because it's specifically designed for cloud gaming from services like Xbox Game Pass and GeForce Now, and can also be used to stream console/PC games remotely.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Given the limited specs, the $350 price <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-streaming-steam-deck-switch-g-cloud-logitech-1849565755">raised some eyebrows</a>, though it normally retails for about $300. Since it shipped in December, Logitech has added a number of new features like virtual button mapping for touch-based mobile games, control customization settings and dead zones, and official support for Shadow PC. The latter service allows you to effectively &quot;rent&quot; a reasonably powerful PC starting at $30 per month and play games on it.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, the G Cloud Gaming Handheld has apparently seen enough success for Logitech to bring it to territories outside North America. As mentioned, Logitech is throwing in up to six months of Xobx Game Pass Ultimate (depending on the country), along with a month of NVIDIA GeForce NOW Priority and a month of Shadow PC. It'll be available starting May 22nd for ‚Ç¨359 / ¬£329.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/logitechs-g-cloud-gaming-handheld-arrives-in-europe-141551128.html?src=rss

<p>Apple wants to go beyond streaming live music to helping you find it in real life. The company has added concert discovery features to both Apple Maps and Apple Music. In Maps, <a href="https://apple.co/MusicVenues">you'll find</a> over 40 curated &quot;Guides&quot; that spotlight hot concert venues in 14 major cities around the world, such as a techno club in Brooklyn and symphony halls in Vienna. This could help you decide where to go when you're new in town, or highlight an unfamiliar scene. You can also browse upcoming shows at those venues through a Shazam discovery module that taps info from Bandsintown.</p><p>Apple Music, meanwhile, also includes the Shazam module to let you browse a musician's upcoming shows. If a favorite artist is playing soon, this could help you land tickets. There's also a <a href="https://apple.co/setlists">Set Lists</a> section where you can listen to tracks played at certain tours (such as Sam Smith's and Kane Brown's) while learning about the productions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both experiences are available today. The additions aren't completely surprising. Apple has long emphasized human curation in Music, such as many of its custom playlists and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-dj-mixes-spatial-audio-150003676.html">DJ mixes</a>. The integrations expand on that strategy to cover in-person gigs. Maps has also had curated Guides for food, shopping and travel. A coordinated push for Maps and Music is relatively unique, though ‚Äî the company is clearly betting that it can raise interest in both services by using concerts as a hook.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-now-helps-you-discover-concerts-in-maps-and-music-140059227.html?src=rss

## After two years of updates, the HomePod mini is actually pretty good

<p>When we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-review-140030652.html"><ins>first reviewed</ins></a> Apple‚Äôs HomePod mini in 2020, we had some reservations. While it was a much better value than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-13-apple-homepod-review.html"><ins>the original</ins></a> HomePod, it still had some of the same limitations of its bigger sibling. Siri wasn‚Äôt as bright as Alexa or Google Assistant, the HomeKit ecosystem was limited and there were no real alternatives to Apple Music for on-demand tunes. You bought a mini for Apple‚Äôs tight integration, and not much else.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2023 and it‚Äôs a different story. Apple has significantly expanded the HomePod mini‚Äôs functionality. It now has active temperature and humidity sensors, smoke and CO2 alarm detection, access to third-party music services (however modest) and support for the Matter smart home standard. With the recent 16.4 software update, the speaker can also make use of a revamped Home architecture that‚Äôs said to be faster and more reliable. The odds are that Apple has addressed at least one of your pet peeves in the past few years.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The market hasn‚Äôt stood still, however. Amazon has improved both Echo speakers and Alexa in the years since, and Google‚Äôs Nest Audio has received upgrades like a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-new-assistant-feature-is-an-incognito-mode-for-smart-speakers-180049342.html"><ins>guest mode</ins></a>. Then there‚Äôs competition from Apple itself ‚Äî now that the company has introduced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-review-2nd-generation-140040630.html"><ins>second-gen HomePod</ins></a>, the smaller model may not be as compelling as before. With that in mind, we‚Äôre revisiting the HomePod mini to see if it‚Äôs still a viable option.</p><h2>Smart home upgrades</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt="Apple HomePod mini in orange" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/d48a1150-f343-11ed-aaaf-219e861b4c05" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jon Fingas/Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Ask HomePod users about their top gripe and they‚Äôll probably point to basic reliability.

The 16.4 software and its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-164-is-out-with-bug-fixes-and-a-ton-of-new-emoji-181331049.html"><ins>overhauled Home architecture</ins></a> appear to have addressed these glitches in my month-long stint with the HomePod mini. Siri is quicker and more reliable, as expected, and there haven‚Äôt been any glitches interacting with other smart home gear (including an Apple TV 4K). While some users say they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePod/comments/128czvk/april_support_megathread/"><ins>still have issues</ins></a>, it seems like Apple has ironed out some kinks.</p><p>The most practical upgrades are the unlocked temperature and humidity sensors, though ‚Äî I‚Äôm getting far more use out of them than I thought I would. My HomePod mini test unit sits in my infant son‚Äôs nursery, and the readings let me check conditions in the room without reaching for the baby monitor. It‚Äôs about as accurate as that monitor, too. You can use the sensors to automatically toggle smart home devices (such as closing blinds when it gets too hot), although I didn‚Äôt have equipment that would benefit from the feature. Before you ask: Amazon‚Äôs Echo already has a temperature sensor, but it‚Äôs good to see this functionality spread to other platforms.</p><p>Other improvements are more subtle, but still welcome. The 16.3 update added the option of setting up recurring automations using Siri. I can turn on my Hue lights every day at dusk, if I‚Äôm so inclined. And while there‚Äôs no Pandora access in Canada, it‚Äôs good to know I can use Deezer as well as radio services like iHeartRadio, Radio.com and TuneIn. Just don‚Äôt expect Amazon Music ‚Äî that was promised in 2020, but hasn‚Äôt materialized. Smoke alarm detection works as promised, although I‚Äôd rather have a connected alarm (such as Google‚Äôs Nest Protect) if I was truly worried about fires breaking out while I‚Äôm away.</p><p>Matter support also makes a difference. I‚Äôve largely relied on Amazon Echo speakers in my home precisely because the range of HomeKit-compatible devices is still small. Matter opens the door to devices that were previously off-limits, including Google‚Äôs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-smart-home-devices-support-matter-standard-140047949.html"><ins>Nest lineup</ins></a>. While the list of Matter-ready hardware is currently modest, it‚Äôs growing quickly enough that I can comfortably recommend a HomePod mini to someone who wants compatibility with major-brand security cameras and thermostats.</p><h2>Does the sound quality hold up?</h2><figure><img alt="HomePod mini in orange" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/d35dff50-f341-11ed-b7ec-7b61bad973c5" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jon Fingas/Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>The HomePod mini design hasn‚Äôt changed since launch apart from a wider choice of colors, like my test unit‚Äôs orange. That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing. As we explained in 2020, the mini punches above its diminutive weight. While it‚Äôs only somewhat larger than the third-generation Echo Dot in my nursery and the Google Home Mini in my office, it blows them away ‚Äî the sound is comparable to the larger, more powerful second-gen standard Echo in my living room. There‚Äôs a surprising (though not awe-inspiring) amount of bass, detailed highs and distinct instrumentation.</p><p>The mini isn‚Äôt the loudest smart speaker in its class, and I typically set the volume to 50 percent or more if I want to listen from another room. However, it also maintains the fullness of its sound across volume levels, even at the 15 percent I use for lullabies in the nursery. While I would rather have the regular HomePod and other louder alternatives for a house party, I‚Äôd be happy to use the mini as an office or bedroom speaker.</p><p>With that said, the HomePod mini fares better with some music genres than others. A jazz tune like Ahmad Jamal‚Äôs live take on ‚ÄúPoinciana‚Äù sounds surprisingly immersive, while a treble-rich  classical work like Ravel‚Äôs ‚ÄúDaphnis et Chlo√©, Suite No. 2‚Äù sparkles. Mid-range rock like Radiohead‚Äôs ‚ÄúParanoid Android‚Äù also plays well. However, the speaker sometimes strains to handle the mids of dance tunes like Above &amp; Beyond‚Äôs ‚ÄúGratitude,‚Äù and sounds a bit hollow with rap like Run the Jewels‚Äô ‚ÄúClose Your Eyes.‚Äù Updates like lossless audio support haven‚Äôt improved matters, either.</p><p>The sound is nonetheless enjoyable, and holds up well next to my standard Echo. While the HomePod isn‚Äôt as loud, it provides more consistent detail. The problem, as you might guess, is that a roughly comparable sound isn‚Äôt a draw by itself. Apple has a size advantage, but that‚Äôs about it. And it‚Äôs safe to say that you‚Äôre better off spending extra for higher-end speakers like the regular HomePod or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-100-review-affordable-multi-room-audio-that-actually-sounds-good-130007717.html"><ins>Sonos Era 100</ins></a> if you care about fidelity or tricks like the HomePod‚Äôs support for spatial audio.</p><h2>Some things are still broken</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt="Apple HomePod mini and Amazon Echo Dot" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/efcb57c0-f344-11ed-bfdf-bd01968ed9e2" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jon Fingas/Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>As much as Apple has improved the HomePod mini over time, certain elements are just as frustrating as they were three years ago. For one, Spotify support is missing. That‚Äôs not under Apple‚Äôs control at this stage, and we wouldn‚Äôt expect Spotify to warm up when it‚Äôs still engaged in an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-spotify-audiobooks-app-store-competition-070210187.html"><ins>antitrust battle</ins></a> over pricing and app integration. Nonetheless, it rules out the most popular streaming music service on the planet unless you‚Äôre willing to use AirPlay.</p><p>And no, Siri isn‚Äôt much brighter than before. Most of the updates since launch have revolved around Apple TV support (such as playing a movie), Find My friend locations and compatibility with the cheaper Apple Music Voice Plan. Siri does a solid job with straightforward tasks like playing music or checking the weather, but it has neither Alexa‚Äôs third-party skills nor Google Assistant‚Äôs talent for answering general knowledge questions.</p><p>For that matter, the HomePod mini isn‚Äôt necessarily the best speaker for a nursery or shared bedroom. You can adjust Siri‚Äôs volume or peg it to that of your voice, but there‚Äôs no Alexa-style whisper mode that responds in hushed tones. If you‚Äôre not careful, you‚Äôll inadvertently startle someone by cuing up a playlist ‚Äî trust me, I know. You can tap your iPhone on the HomePod to silently transfer music (still one of Apple‚Äôs best tricks), but that‚Äôs not much help if you‚Äôre rocking a child to sleep.</p><p>Support for other platforms remains non-existent. You still need an iPhone or iPad just to set up a HomePod mini, while the absences of Bluetooth audio and a line-in jack rule out even basic connectivity with non-Apple devices. While Matter support improves the range of smart home devices you can use, the mini remains a no-go if you use Android.</p><h2>A better value, for the right person</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt="Apple HomePod mini in orange" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/4af3d460-f345-11ed-9eff-d2d4d77573f9" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jon Fingas/Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Even with all those hangups in mind, the HomePod mini is a better value now than it was in 2020. It‚Äôs more useful and reliable in a smart home, and you aren‚Äôt as locked into Apple‚Äôs ecosystem as you were before. You‚Äôll be pleased with the sound quality for the money, especially if you want a smart speaker that doesn‚Äôt occupy much space on an end table.</p><p>Moreover, the HomePod mini may be appealing precisely because it‚Äôs not part of the Amazon and Google ecosystems. My Echo speakers irritate me by peppering Alexa responses and notifications with unwanted pitches ‚Äî no, I don‚Äôt want to subscribe to Amazon Music or rate the power cords I bought last month. Google isn‚Äôt as egregious, but it frequently offers unwanted tips. While the HomePod‚Äôs functionality is more limited, I‚Äôm tempted to switch just to escape the annoyances of its rivals.</p><p>These days, the HomePod mini is also tempting if you‚Äôre particularly privacy-minded. I‚Äôm not too fussed about it myself, but it‚Äôs no secret that Apple‚Äôs rivals generally <a href="https://www.reviews.org/home-security/smart-assistant-privacy-what-data-is-collected-and-how-to-protect-yourself/"><ins>collect more data</ins></a>. Amazon and Google grab personal profiles and contact information Apple doesn‚Äôt, for instance. Both likewise use queries to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23047026/amazon-alexa-voice-data-targeted-ads-research-report"><ins>help target ads</ins></a>, and Amazon defaults to collecting voice recordings for service improvements where it‚Äôs strictly opt-in for Apple and Google. HomePods still have to gather some data, such as IP addresses and device names, but I‚Äôd feel more comfortable with the mini than its alternatives if I wanted to keep info sharing to a minimum.</p><p>Having said this, the mini is still best-suited to Apple devotees. It makes the most sense if you subscribe to Apple Music, and the proposition gets better the more Apple hardware you have. HomePods just aren‚Äôt as alluring in mixed-platform households. You may also want to wait for more Matter-compatible devices if you‚Äôre going to use this speaker as the cornerstone of an elaborate smart home setup.</p><p>This is still a stronger purchase than the high-end HomePod for most people. You‚Äôre getting the same environment sensors and voice assistant features, and the sound is pleasing if you‚Äôre either a casual music listener or tend to listen to spoken-word content like podcasts and news radio. The more expensive model is strictly for buyers who want the best possible audio quality from an Apple speaker, or want to try spatial audio without spending $450 on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-300-review-a-big-bet-on-spatial-audio-130053487.html"><ins>Sonos Era 300</ins></a>.</p><p>Versus Amazon and Google, it‚Äôs more complicated. We noted in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-speakers-151515264.html"><ins>smart speaker buying guide</ins></a> that the fourth-generation Echo and Nest Audio are both louder and punchier than the HomePod mini, although they pay for that with larger enclosures and less consistent sound across frequencies. They aren‚Äôt tied to one mobile platform, however, and they have rich smart home ecosystems even without Matter playing a part. Throw in more flexible voice assistants, wider hardware variety (there‚Äôs no Apple equivalent to an Echo Dot or Nest Mini) and well-established ecosystems and they‚Äôre the safer choices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/after-two-years-of-updates-the-homepod-mini-is-actually-pretty-good-133056756.html?src=rss

<p>If you want to add storage space to a Nintendo Switch, GoPro or Raspberry Pi, you need a microSD card. But while several cards will be fast <em>enough </em>for most use cases, some inexpensive options will perform better than others. To help you find a reliable storage booster, we recently put a dozen microSD cards through a range of benchmark tests.</p><h2>What to look for in a microSD card</h2><h3>Capacity</h3><p>The first thing to figure out when buying a microSD card is how much space you need. Modern cards are usually available in sizes ranging from 32GB to 512GB, while a handful offer 1TB models as well. 2TB cards are theoretically possible but <a href="https://petapixel.com/2022/09/30/kioxia-has-working-prototypes-of-the-worlds-first-2tb-microsd-card/">still in</a> the prototype stage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For most, a 128GB or 256GB model should be the sweet spot between price and capacity. But if you need more room ‚Äì say, for stashing a bunch of games on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html">Steam Deck</a> ‚Äì a 512GB card could make more sense and often provides a better cost-per-GB ratio. These days, you can find a decent 128GB card for around $15 or less, a decent 256GB card for less than $30 and (<a href="https://keepa.com/#!product/1-B09B1HMJ9Z">with sales</a>) a decent 512GB card could be as little as $40 (though most cost closer to $50 or $60). There‚Äôs a starker increase when you go up to 1TB cards, which typically cost around $100.</p><p>Note that a microSD card‚Äôs performance may differ depending on what capacity you buy. SanDisk says its <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=92bbc6e1-f32c-4060-9f86-b3358db79a39&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Western+Digital&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5MmJiYzZlMS1mMzJjLTQwNjAtOWY4Ni1iMzM1OGRiNzlhMzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2VzdGVybmRpZ2l0YWwuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL21lbW9yeS1jYXJkcy9zYW5kaXNrLWV4dHJlbWUtdWhzLWktbWljcm9zZCNTRFNRWEFBLTEyOEctQU42TUEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY0MTFjYWRhLTNmMWUtNDg3ZC04ZDlhLWNiNWQzMGMxOWZiYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVLMWfp-vMvg_C-wQesY1U5IVOs6FMJfDrNv0N00SDEW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fproducts%2Fmemory-cards%2Fsandisk-extreme-uhs-i-microsd%23SDSQXAA-128G-AN6MA">128GB Extreme card</a> delivers sequential write speeds up to 90 MB/s, for example, while the higher-capacity models in the same line offer up to 130 MB/s.</p><p>When we talk about microSD cards today, we usually refer to cards that use the <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/capacity-sd-sdhc-sdxc-sduc/">microSDXC (eXtended Capacity) standard</a>, which have a capacity between 32GB and 2TB. Your device needs to support this for it to work with a microSDXC card. This will almost never be an issue these days, but some older devices (a <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/274/~/what-sd-cards-and-microsd-cards-are-compatible%3F">Nintendo 3DS</a> for instance) are only compatible with microSDHC (High Capacity) cards, which range from 2GB to 32GB.</p><h3>Read and write speeds</h3><p>MicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally speaking, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds. These metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you‚Äôre trying to access or save long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important.</p><p>Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device. Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they‚Äôre important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a>, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations.</p><figure><img alt="A chart from the SD Association explaining how its various speed class ratings work." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/a8a00b60-f034-11ed-bf3c-39241bbedf2b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">SD Association</div></figure><h3>Speed ratings</h3><p>If you look at a microSD card, you‚Äôll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card‚Äôs <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/speed-class/">speed class</a> and performance ratings, which are determined by the <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/">SD Association</a>.</p><p>A card‚Äôs Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost.</p><p>The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card‚Äôs minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s.</p><p>The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It‚Äôs signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a ‚ÄúC10‚Äù logo on some cards.</p><p>The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s.</p><p>Most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It‚Äôs totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap option with a high capacity to hold files, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you‚Äôre serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But generally speaking, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today.</p><p>It‚Äôs important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Many V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren‚Äôt always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster.</p><h3>UHS bus speeds</h3><p>The other spec to note is the card‚Äôs bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which have a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A newer UHS-III standard exists as well but hasn‚Äôt seen wide adoption just yet.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II.</p><p>The absolute fastest microSD cards right now are UHS-II cards, and they‚Äôre usually the ones with V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time.</p><p>But these are much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTU2MDI3My1SRUcvcHJvZ3JhZGVfZGlnaXRhbF9wZ21zZDEyOGdicGJoXzEyOGdiX21pY3Jvc2R4Y191aHNfaWlfbWVtb3J5Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY0MTFjYWRhLTNmMWUtNDg3ZC04ZDlhLWNiNWQzMGMxOWZiYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAafiZn5xPHsbyBblZ1Bd0HcXB9uhTVUO7c7XnS6PL8P-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1560273-REG%2Fprograde_digital_pgmsd128gbpbh_128gb_microsdxc_uhs_ii_memory.html">128GB model</a> from ProGrade Digital, for example, is a relative bargain at $55. You need a device that‚Äôs compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and as we were putting this guide together, stock for UHS-II cards was spotty. For now, the higher speeds aren‚Äôt worth the price premium for the vast majority of people, so we mostly stuck to UHS-I options.</p><figure><img alt="Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch OLED, face down" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5b0bdf80-261b-11ec-93d7-3651390a7516" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><h3>A note on card readers, the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck</h3><p>While the UHS-I spec has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. You need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance, though. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what‚Äôs going on. You can see these limits in action with a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22481/~/microsd-card-faq">Both</a> of <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech">those</a> gaming devices support the UHS-I interface and don‚Äôt go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. The broader takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain.</p><h3>Warranty</h3><p>Many microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime limited warranties, though we‚Äôve noticed that ‚Äúendurance‚Äù cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a much shorter period of time.</p><h3>Avoiding counterfeits</h3><p>The memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&amp;H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper <em>and</em> seller is Amazon.com. (Though a handful of users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/dz3h6z/amazon_still_selling_fake_microsd_cards_even_if/">have reported</a> receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering significantly a lower price than others.</p><p>Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities.

<p>Samsung will start rolling out an update for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review-160057740.html">Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> that will give users more control over how much ambient sound they want to hear. After the software updates goes out, users will find two additional levels on top of the original three for their ambient sound volume settings under the Laboratory menu of the Galaxy Wearable app. And they can customize how much ambient sound to let in for each ear, since it's possible to adjust the volume for each earbud independently.&nbsp;</p><p>The settings page already offers users the capability to customize their ambient tone range, with five stages from soft to clear. But the update will introduce a new section called &quot;adapt ambient sound,&quot; which adds even more clarity to the environmental sounds getting into the earbuds. Samsung says it unveiled an enhancement to ambient sounds on Global Accessibility Awareness Day for people who could benefit from sounds amplification. The update, however, could also be useful for those with no hearing issues and simply just want to hear the world around them better so they could feel safe while they're running or walking outside.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung is releasing its enhanced ambient sound feature and will be rolling out a software update for it over the coming weeks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-updates-its-galaxy-buds-2-pro-with-enhanced-ambient-sound-controls-130029355.html?src=rss

## Apple's Assistive Access simplifies iOS 16 for people with cognitive disabilities

<p>With <a href="https://accessibility.day/">Global Accessibility Awareness Day</a> just days away, Apple is previewing a raft of new iOS features for cognitive accessibility, along with Live Speech, Personal Voice and more. The company said it worked in "deep collaboration" with community groups representing users with disabilities, and drew on "advances in hardware and software, including on-device machine learning" to make them work.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest update is "Assistive Access" designed to support users with cognitive disabilities. Essentially, it provides a custom, simplified experience for the phone, FaceTime, Messages, Camera, Photos, and Music apps. That includes a "distinct interface with high contrast buttons and large text labels" along with tools that can be customized by trusted supporters for each individual.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Apple's Assistive Access is a simplified iOS 16 for people with cognitive disabilities" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/8e899dc0-f3bf-11ed-bf3b-fd4198fc19c6" style="height: 1026px; width: 1681px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>"For example, for users who prefer communicating visually, Messages includes an emoji-only keyboard and the option to record a video message to share with loved ones. Users and trusted supporters can also choose between a more visual, grid-based layout for their Home Screen and apps, or a row-based layout for users who prefer text," Apple wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>The aim is to break down technological barriers for people with cognitive disabilities. "The intellectual and developmental disability community is bursting with creativity, but technology often poses physical, visual, or knowledge barriers for these individuals," said The Arc's Katy Schmid in a statement. "To have a feature that provides a cognitively accessible experience on iPhone or iPad ‚Äî that means more open doors to education, employment, safety, and autonomy. It means broadening worlds and expanding potential."&nbsp;</p><p>Another important new feature is Live Speech and Personal Voice for iPhone, iPad and Mac. Live Speech lets users type what they want to say and have it spoken out loud during phone and FaceTime calls or for in-person conversations. For users who can still speak but are at risk of losing their ability to do so due to a diagnosis of ALS or other conditions, there's the Personal Voice feature.</p><figure><img alt="Apple's Assistive Access simplifies iOS 16 for people with cognitive disabilities" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/49c93f30-f3d6-11ed-bbbe-5ae75d0c981f" style="height: 1758px; width: 2313px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>It lets them create a voice that sounds like their own by reading along with a randomized set of text prompts to record 15 minutes of audio on iPhone or iPad. It then uses on-device machine learning to keep user information private, and works with Live Speech so users can effectively speak with others using a version of their own voices. "If you can tell [your friends and family] you love them, in a voice that sounds like you, it makes all the difference in the world," said Team Gleason board member and ALS advocate Philip Green, who has had his own voice impacted by ALS.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Apple has introduced a Point and Speak function in the Magnifier to help users with vision disabilities interact with physical objects. "For example, while using a household appliance ‚Äî such as a microwave ‚Äî Point and Speak combines input from the Camera app, the LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to announce the text on each button as users move their finger across the keypad," it wrote. The feature is built into the Magnifier app on iPhone and iPad, and can be used with other Magnifier features like People Detection, Door Detection and others.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with the new functions, Apple is introducing new features, curated collections and more for Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Those include a SignTime launch in Germany, Italy, Spain and South Korea to connect Apple Store and Support customers with on-demand sign language interpreters, along with accessibility informative sessions at select Apple Store locations around the world. It's also offering podcasts, movies and more around the impact of accessible tech. The new Assistive Access and other features are set to roll out later this year, Apple said ‚Äî for more, check out its <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzZjYTlmYTItODI2NC00ZTgyLWJkOTEtOWRjNjU5MGExYjEyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAa3_UhhJtEj_4tbBCfJQeV0893nDeThoj-Rj1Px2a5qp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-assistive-access-simplifies-ios-16-for-people-with-cognitive-disabilities-120012723.html?src=rss

<p>Startup Telly is now taking US reservations for free 55-inch 4K TVs that continuously display ads on part of a secondary screen. So long as you're willing to accept those ads (or tune them out) and share data, you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telly-will-give-you-a-free-tv-if-youll-watch-non-stop-ads-164319359.html">won't have to pay for the TV.</a></p><p>As Telly explains, the smaller display also shows news, sports scores and other useful data. You won't have to interrupt a show just to stay in the know. The set has its own camera, microphone array, sensors and voice assistant, enabling video calls and motion-captured fitness apps. According to the image, this secondary screen would be a long, slender display that would live underneath the TV. The reservations cover the first 500,000 TVs, which are expected to ship in the summer. I‚Äôm not sold on the idea ‚Äì I‚Äôm getting stressful flashbacks of struggling to turn off those screens in the back of New York taxis, addled by jetlag.</p><p>‚Äì Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn‚Äôt just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> ‚Äì  it‚Äôs also a daily podcast.

It's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-mini-review-m2-pro-2023-140052205.html">tiny but mighty</a>, with the M2 processor easily powerful enough for productivity chores and multitasking.

The M2 Pro model adds two additional USB-C ports, making it even more useful for creatives with a ton of accessories.</p><p>The Mac Mini M2 won't replace your gaming machine, but it can handle nearly everything else you throw at it.

<p>You may have to get a Peacock subscription if you want to watch every single game in the NFL playoffs. The streaming service will serve as home to the first-ever exclusive livestreamed NFL playoff game, NBCUniversal and the league have <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f5e3d2ac-b2a6-4637-bd59-bf0273d985ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=National+Football+League&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmNWUzZDJhYy1iMmE2LTQ2MzctYmQ1OS1iZjAyNzNkOTg1YWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmZsLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BlYWNvY2stYmVjb21lcy1ob21lLW9mLWZpcnN0LWV2ZXItZXhjbHVzaXZlLWxpdmUtc3RyZWFtZWQtbmZsLXBsYXlvZmYtZ2FtZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWVmZjA1ODctYjZlYy00YjdjLWFlYTUtZTU5OTUxNzY5Y2QzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAU2LIcMKXv-7QqxQ6LFt3rvA7Yy4yYZ15MJ_7dIpHrgm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nfl.com%2Fnews%2Fpeacock-becomes-home-of-first-ever-exclusive-live-streamed-nfl-playoff-game">announced</a>. It's a wild card game that's scheduled to take place on January 13th, 2024, which is the first playoff weekend. And by "exclusive," they meant it will not be aired on national TV or even on cable. Only the local markets for the two competing teams will have access to the game outside Peacock, through a local TV channel that'll most likely be an NBC affiliate.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9wZWFjb2NrLXRvLWNhcnJ5LW9uZS1uZmwtcGxheW9mZi1nYW1lLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZWx5LW5leHQtc2Vhc29uLWZiMzM5MDI3P21vZD1kamVtYWxlcnRORVdTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1ZWZmMDU4Ny1iNmVjLTRiN2MtYWVhNS1lNTk5NTE3NjljZDMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd4pEGWtSc1YcgypVAGotr5XKIZGASRdeQWuiBRSxQps&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fpeacock-to-carry-one-nfl-playoff-game-exclusively-next-season-fb339027%3Fmod%3DdjemalertNEWS"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> notes, the NFL made postseason games <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-09-yahoo-sports-streaming-nfl-playoff-games.html">available for streaming</a> in the past. However, this marks the first time one can only be accessed on a streaming service by most viewers. NFL chief operating officer Hans Schroeder has acknowledged that the decision could upset some fans who'll have to get Peacock to watch that one game, but he believes it "will be transformative for sports on digital."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In fact, Schroeder said the NFL will likely continue making one of its wild card games exclusively accessible via streaming going forward. Whether Peacock will carry the game again in 2025 will probably depend on how the 2024 game performs for the service: Peacock and the NFL only signed a one-year deal, which <em>The Journal</em> says cost around $110 million.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/peacock-will-exclusively-stream-one-nfl-playoff-game-055049555.html?src=rss
