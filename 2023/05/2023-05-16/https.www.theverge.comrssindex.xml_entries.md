Tesla has long been a holdout on traditional advertising, and has found extensive growth over the years through mostly word of mouth. But now Musk has seemingly discovered the importance of the advertising business now that he owns Twitter.</p>
<p id="XhkFSr">“Twitter is highly dependent on advertising, so, here I am, never used advertising really before, and now have a company that’s highly dependent on advertising.

  <p id="iXJyT1">Hey, did you hear? Verizon has incredibly, out of the goodness of its heart, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23723887/verizon-myplan-unlimited-5g-cellular-plans-announcement">revealed new phone plans</a> that <a href="https://youtu.be/bViLZWKRhcc">don’t include “bloated” service bundles</a>. How thoughtful! There’s just one catch: they’re kinda less expensive, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/05/16/verizon-my-plan/">except not really</a>, because things that used to be included are now an extra $10 per month each. Wait, that... kind of sucks? Who exactly comes out ahead with these new plans? </p>
<p id="l5o6mm">You guessed it! It’s Verizon. </p>
<p id="9XYh4r">On the surface, the new plans <em>sound</em> simpler than the current Get More, Play More, etc. There are two options — an expensive one and a bit less expensive one — and you add the extra services you want, like the Disney / Hulu bundle or Apple Music Family a la carte. That’s nice in theory, but if you’re switching from one of...</p>

<p id="NAMQ2E">TikTok’s Effect Creator Rewards program sets aside $6 million to pay the creators of the platform’s most viral effects and filters based on how many videos are shared using their work. Effects that have been used in 500,000 videos within 90 days of being created will earn the artist $700. Within those 90 days, creators earn an additional $140 for every 100,000 videos above the 500,000 baseline. That means that if your filter was used 1 million times in 90 days, you’d walk away with $1,400.

  <p id="169CdN">Mercedes-Benz announced a new modular platform called VAN.EA that will underpin the automaker’s new lineup of commercial and personally owned electric vans. </p>
<p id="gLEM63">VAN.EA is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for both front- and all-wheel drive vehicles. It will also differentiate between commercial fleet-use vehicles and luxury camper vans for personal ownership. A midsize luxury van based on the VAN.EA platform is destined for the US market by 2026, the company said. </p>
<p id="uozsFj">The announcement of the new platform is meant to signal Mercedes’ bullish attitude toward the burgeoning electric van market. The company said it was targeting an EV share of up to 20 percent by 2026 and more than 50 percent by 2030. </p>

The Eve Flare costs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4VS6Y3L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$99.95 / €99.95</a>, as does the <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-shutter-switch">Shutter Switch</a>, which is only available in Europe.</p>
<p id="vrf2Ky">The second-gen Eve Flare has the same specs as the original — an IP65-rated portable indoor / outdoor full-color LED lamp.

Ahead of Global Accessibility Awareness Day this week, the company says its new “enhanced” ambient sound will add two additional levels of passthrough amplification on top of the three that were already present, which will let owners further customize just how much outside audio they want to hear whenever the mode is activated.</p>
<p id="OXaxpQ">“With this improved feature, Galaxy Buds 2 Pro users can also fine tune their ambient sound settings across a variety of needs using the Galaxy Wearable app,” Samsung wrote in a press release. “Users can adjust the volumes on the left and the right respectively, as well as customize...</p>

  <p id="JBkSHm">Today, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-previews-live-speech-personal-voice-and-more-new-accessibility-features/">previewed a bundle of new features</a> designed for cognitive, vision, hearing, and mobility accessibility. That includes a new Personal Voice feature for people who may lose their ability to speak, allowing them to create “a synthesized voice that sounds like them” to talk with friends or family members.</p>
<p id="L3rhyl">According to Apple, users can create a Personal Voice by reading a set of text prompts aloud for a total of 15 minutes of audio on the iPhone or iPad. Since the feature integrates with Live Speech, users can then type what they want to say and have their Personal Voice read it to whomever they want to talk to. Apple says the feature uses “on-device machine learning to keep users’ information private and secure.”</p>

<p id="XZ3k42">This is the first time Samsung has purchased OLED panels from its South Korean rival after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375179/samsung-electronics-lg-display-oled-tv-panels-quantum-dot-qd">years of rumors</a> around similar deals. It’s also a huge admission of defeat after Samsung stopped making OLED TVs in 2015, citing the high costs of the panels in a miscalculation that the market wouldn’t be ready for such high-end TVs. Samsung pushed ahead with its cheaper but inferior QLED TVs — a variation of LED LCD — but OLED models have dominated the premium market.</p>
