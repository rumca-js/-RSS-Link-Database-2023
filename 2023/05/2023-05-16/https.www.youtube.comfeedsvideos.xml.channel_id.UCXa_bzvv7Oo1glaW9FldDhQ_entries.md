It's difficult to predict the success of some titles, especially those which haven't had a chance to show up and strut their stuff. It's even tougher to have blind faith in some developers and publishers, considering the sheer number of high-profile failures over the years. Yet Insomniac, and to an extent Sony (let's not forget those problematic PC releases over the past few months), have defied that trend. It's to a degree that many fans aren't thinking over how many copies the sequel will sell – just that they can see it soon and hopefully play it this year.

From that perspective, they're not too different from your average Zelda fan celebrating Tears of the Kingdom as a triumph and a reward for their years of waiting. There's a good chance that Insomniac could have such a moment with Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and it's well aware of this. There's a lot of pressure to deliver, but at the end of the day, its release will be another industry-defining moment for the PS5.

## EA Is Proving EVERYONE WRONG...

This wasn't a position that any of us would have expected EA to be in until not too long ago. It was the company you'd least expect to be investing in big-budget single player games, so to see it once again beginning to see the value of that side of gaming has been one of the most pleasant surprises in the industry in recent years. 

Sure, live services are still the bulk of EA's business, and obviously, that's always going to be the case- but we're finally at a point where the company has figured out that it doesn't have to be one or the other. As long as the games are well-made, both styles can coexist.

## The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review - Iterative Sequel or Masterpiece?

Breath of the Wild may have been the more influential game (and for many that preferred its simplicity and elegance of design, it will probably remain their preferred one of the pair), but in almost every way, by almost every conceivable metric, Tears of the Kingdom is the better game. 

And delivering a follow up to one of the best games ever made that is, somehow, even better? No words are necessary at this point. This game is a masterpiece, and any fan of the medium will do themselves a disservice if they don’t check it out.
