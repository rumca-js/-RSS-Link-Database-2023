In China, the banking industry was once perceived as a high-paying industry with golden rice bowls, and it was probably the most popular profession, except for civil servants. Those who work in the financial industry can be considered "gold-collar." 
Their monthly salary, which used to range from 3,000 to 4,300 US dollars, has suddenly dropped to more than 860 US dollars. It means that those in the financial industry, whose standard of living has always been relatively high, are going to face great adjustments.
