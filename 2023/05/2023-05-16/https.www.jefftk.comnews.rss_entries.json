[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Lazy Baked Mac and Cheese", "description": "<p><span>\n\nLily's been asking for baked mac and cheese a lot lately, including\nfor breakfast in the morning before school when there's not much\ntime.  Her favorite part is also the top, where the cheese is crispy.\nI've started making what's essentially grilled cheese with a pasta\nbase, under the broiler.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nI put cold leftover pasta from the fridge on a quarter sheet [1], and\nput cheese on top:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/pasta-and-cheese-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"389\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/pasta-and-cheese.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nPut it in the oven, turn on the broiler, set the timer for ~4min.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/broiling-pasta-and-cheese-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/broiling-pasta-and-cheese.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe broiler can turn things from \"not yet\" to \"burnt\" very quickly, so\nafter the timer goes off if it's not done I bump another minute on the\ntimer (in case I forget) but plan to check it after 30s.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHere's how it looks when it's done:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/broiled-pasta-and-cheese-big.jpg\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/broiled-pasta-and-cheese.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf you don't like any browned pasta with crunchy bits (I do) you can put the oven\nrack down a notch.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe broiler is fast enough and the layer of pasta and cheese is thin\nenough that I don't bother with <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/speed-pasta-bake\">microwaving anything first</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n[1] It's a \"quarter\" sheet pan (9x13\") because in a professional\nkitchen full size is 18x26\".  You can't fit that in a home oven,\nthough, and you'll often see either 2/3 sheets (16x22\"), about the\nbiggest you can fit on a rack, or half sheets (13x18\") which are an\neasier to manage size and get better airflow.  I like the quarter\nsheets for cooking smaller amounts because they're small enough to fit\nin our dishwasher and I can put two different things on an oven rack.\nOurs are uncoated aluminum, 16 gauge with a wire-reinforced rim, <a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/bakers-mark-heavy-duty-quarter-size-16-gauge-9-x-13-wire-in-rim-aluminum-bun-sheet-pan/176BUNQTR16.html\">$5/each\nin bulk</a>.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02CCjT31aTvpo15K5E9FfTCgxfMkM2rqVn3UkQi9gFKk8PMgpvR1KghrMuX8B5wnZKl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/kAtLQX2dvsRbJPATB\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110378846353124188\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/lazy-baked-mac-and-cheese", "date_published": "2023-05-16 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
