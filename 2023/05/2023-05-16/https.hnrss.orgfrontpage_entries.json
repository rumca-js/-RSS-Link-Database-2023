is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.\"<p>OK, there are lots of languages that are either or both dynamic and functional, and they can all used to build scalable and maintainable transactions.<p>\"Elixir runs on the Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems.\"<p>Let's skip over \"low-latency\", because virtually all programming languages and VMs are \"low-latency\".<p>\"distributed\" and \"fault-tolerant\" are what's most often touted as \"special\".<p>I'm not sure what \"distributed\" means here? Any app in most languages can be coded to be \"distributed\" both on the scale of within a single machine and at the scale of deploying multiple small instances of it. (eg Kubernetes, running it on multiple EC2s etc etc)<p>As for \"fault tolerant\": \"The unavoidable truth about software in production is that things will go wrong. Even more when we take network, file systems, and other third-party resources into account. To react to failures, Elixir supervisors describe how to restart parts of your system when things go awry, going back to a known initial state that is guaranteed to work\"<p>Don't entirely understand this either. In a run of the mill corporate Java app, if you experience an exception eg calling another service, unless you're doing something very strange, your app will not stop running, it will just keep error logging those exceptions until the problem is resolved. (whether by the target service coming back online or you send out a fix for the call or whatever) Really the only time an app will outright crash and completely stop is if it experiences errors attempting to boot in the first place, and the correct solution there is to not allow instances that don't respond 200 OK on /health to take traffic. You certainly don't want to attempt restart the system as it won't do any good.<p>So I'm left wondering, am I missing something or is there really not much to the claims about Erlang and Elixir? Don't get me wrong, this is not me criticizing Erlang or Elixir or the hype machine around them, every language has to have marketing and that's fine. It's also not me advocating corporate Java (shudder) - I'm just using it as an example of a common technology that also seems to tick all the same boxes as Erlang and Elixir as far as these claims go.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35966890\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35966890</a></p>\n<p>Points: 22</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "link":

updating iOS app that protects your identity while letting you keep in touch with people. I started working on neucards as a side project more than ten years ago, and I decided three years ago to go full-time and try to build a community around it.<p>There are two major problems that neucards addresses. First, most people end up with contact lists that are hopelessly out of date. Over time, people move, change jobs, or add social profiles and unless they tell you, chances are you could lose touch. Second, your contact information ends up in the wrong hands. There has been a huge increase in robocalls, unsolicited emails, data breaches, and online scams that is driven by accessing a person's contact info. Even worse, with AI now being able to imitate a person's voice or other mannerisms, knowledge about the connections you have with others can be used against you.<p>Neucards automatically updates your contact information for anyone who has your digital contact card. You control your contact information and who has access. This is possible because of end-to-end encryption. Neucards brings the same level of protection for your contact information as Signal or WhatsApp does for your chats. Privacy is built it.<p>But, even with these protections, you can share your contact info with anyone. As an example, here is a link to my Social card:<p><a href=\"https://www.neucards.com/of/braddominy?id=M6TC5PLngD&amp;k=4R98iwnoRi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.neucards.com/of/braddominy?id=M6TC5PLngD&amp;k=4R98i...</a><p>I'm excited about how much neucards has grown and what I have planned for the future to do even more to protect people's privacy. If you have any comments, please let me know.<p>Brad\n<a href=\"https://www.neucards.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.neucards.com</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

history with it. I've been making websites since I was a kid, used to write Rails apps for work, lots of JS and jQuery, various CSS frameworks, and even used React for a while when it was initially released. And lots of other frameworks of course. So I'm not new to this stuff.<p>I just had an idea for a side project and I want to make a modern website. I spent the last 20 hours trying to figure out what the best practices are now. Everything should've gotten easier, right? It has been 10 years after all.<p>But I'm totally lost. 4 layers of bundlers. Two layers of language abstractions. CSS frameworks that need to be compiled!? Several more layers of database abstractions and services that I have no idea what they do by looking at their landing pages.<p>My requirements are pretty simple. I want it to work on all devices and look good. I need some user authentication and user state, but nothing complex. The data model is relatively simple, but it needs to be stored somewhere, local storage is not enough.<p>From all my research, my best bet right now seems to be next.js + React + Tailwind because that combination seems to be relatively popular and well-documented with good editor integrations. Not sure what to use for the database/backend though. I also looked at htmx but don't really like the idea of templating html snippets on the server without great editor integration.<p>So, how do I actually make a modern website? Is it really this hard?<p>(I'm aware there have been similar threads the past year, but they're already a year old, which is an eternity in JS world)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35959204\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35959204</a></p>\n<p>Points: 26</p>\n<p># Comments: 28</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35959204", "date_published": "2023-05-16 08:53:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "European bird populations decrease by a quarter, farming to blame", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2216573120\">https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2216573120</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35958876\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35958876</a></p>\n<p>Points: 56</p>\n<p># Comments: 17</p>", "link": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2216573120", "date_published": "2023-05-16 08:02:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Oblivus GPU Cloud \u2013 Affordable and scalable GPU servers from $0.29/hr", "description": "<p>Greetings HN!<p>This is Doruk from Oblivus, and I'm excited to announce the launch of our platform, Oblivus Cloud. After more than a year of beta testing, we're excited to offer you a platform where you can deploy affordable and scalable GPU virtual machines in as little as 30 seconds! <a href=\"https://oblivus.com/cloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://oblivus.com/cloud</a><p>- What sets Oblivus Cloud apart?<p>At the start of our journey, we had two primary goals in mind: to democratize High-Performance Computing and make it as straightforward as possible. We understand that maintaining GPU servers through major cloud service providers can be expensive, with hidden fees adding to the burden of running and maintaining servers. Additionally, the cloud can sometimes be overly complex for individuals who don't have much knowledge but still require powerful computing resources. That's why we decided to create a platform that offers affordable pricing, easy usability, and high-quality performance.<p>- Features<p>1. Fully customizable infrastructure that lets you switch between CPU and GPU configurations to suit your needs.<p>2. Transparent and affordable per-minute-based Pay-As-You-Go pricing with no hidden fees. Plus, free data ingress and egress. (Pricing: <a href=\"https://oblivus.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://oblivus.com/pricing/</a>)<p>3. Optimized cost with storage and IP address-only billing when the virtual machine is shut down.<p>4. Each virtual machine comes with 10Gbps to 40Gbps public network connectivity.<p>5. NVMe ($0.00011/GB/hr) and HDD ($0.00006/GB/hr) storage that is 3x replicated to fulfill your storage needs.<p>6. Choose from a variety of cutting-edge CPUs and 10 state-of-the-art GPU SKUs.

"Show HN: Capillaries: Distributed data processing with Go and Cassandra", "description": "<p>I started thinking about this approach after working on a large-scale project for a major financial company where our group developed a distributed in-house data processing solution. On a regular basis, it ingested a few gigabytes of financial data and, within a tight SLA time limit, produced a lot of enriched/aggregated/validated data for a number of customers. Sometimes, source data had errors, so operators with domain knowledge had to verify data validity at some checkpoints, immediately make corrections, and re-run parts of the workflow manually. The solution involved complex web service orchestration, custom database and was very demanding on the infrastructure availability.<p>Capillaries is a built from scratch, open-source Go solution that does just that: ingests data and applies user-defined transforms - Go one-liner expressions, Python formulas, joins, aggregations, denormalization - using Cassandra for intermediate data storage and RabbitMQ for task scheduling. End users just have to provide:\n- source data in CSV files;\n- Capillaries script (JSON file) that defines the workflow and the transforms;\n- Python code that performs complex calculations (only if needed).<p>The whole data processing pipeline can be split into separate runs that can be started independently and re-run by the user if needed.<p>The goal is to build a platform that is tolerant to database and processing node failures, and allows users to focus on data transform logic and data quality control.<p>\u201cGetting started\u201d Docker-based demo calculates ARK funds performance, using EOD holdings and transactions data acquired from public sources. There are also integration tests that use non-financial data. There is a test deploy tool that uses Openstack API for provisioning in the cloud.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35956287\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35956287</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "link": "https://capillaries.io", "date_published": "2023-05-16 00:13:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
