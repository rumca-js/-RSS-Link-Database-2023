<p>In Disney's recent rent earnings call, CEO Bob Iger said that some Hulu content would be incorporated into Disney+. This combined "one-app" experience will launch before the end of 2023.</p><p>This integration does not mean the end of individual apps. Iger said that, "While we will continue to offer Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ as standalone options, this is a logical progression of our [direct-to-consumer] offerings that will provide greater opportunities for advertisers while giving bundle subscribers access to more robust and streamlined content, resulting in greater audience engagement and ultimately leading to a more unified streaming experience."</p><p>What Hulu content will make its way to Disney+ has yet to be clarified. There is no exact release date for this feature either.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hulu-shows-may-come-to-disney-plus-in-2023/1100-6514020/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Like its predecessor, Diablo IV will have a shop where you can spend real world money to get in-game items. Unlike the devilish three-quel, Diablo IV's shop will only offer cosmetics that confer no gameplay benefits.</p><p>Blizzard announced its plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-1-kicks-off-mid-to-late-july/1100-6514005/">Diablo IV's post-launch content</a> and clarified how the online shop will work. You can buy shop cosmetics to alter or change the aesthetics of the armor you have obtained by playing the game. Cosmetics tie in to class-specific fantasies or aesthetics, so some cosmetics will be locked to a particular class.</p><p>You can only purchase cosmetics with Platinum (the in-game currency purchased with real-life cash). Cosmetics will also rotate out regularly. Any class-specific cosmetics can be used by any character of that class associated with your Battle.net account. Items purchased will be available on any platform, so long as you log in. You can also use a "preview" feature to see how a particular item will look on your character.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-online-store-will-offer-only-cosmetic-items/1100-6514013/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## All 11 Netflix TV Shows Canceled Or Ending In 2023 (So Far)

Some are beloved shows, others just couldn't seem to find the audience they were looking for. Among those that tend to cut a large batch of shows every year is Netflix. Once upon a time, the streaming service took pride in letting shows take the time to find their footing, sometimes over multiple seasons. Those days are in the past, though.</p><p>Each year, a decent portion of the canceled and ending shows comes from Netflix, including some truly surprising entries. Remember the live-action adaptation of Cowboy Bebop or even the botched attempt to bring Resident Evil to life on the streaming giant? Still, while many shows never get past a first season on Netflix, some go on to become massive hits that get to live out their life cycles, like Stranger Things.</p><p>This year, Netflix has already said goodbye to several major titles, including the Karate Kid follow-up series Cobra Kai, which it rescued from YouTube Premium--as well as a number of adult animated series, including the popular Big Mouth. Take a look below at everything Netflix has said goodbye to. And if there are any you haven't watched yet or you're in the mood for a short binge, the good news is you can still go catch up with most of them on the streaming service right now. And while you're at it, check out our look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-tv-shows-canceled-or-ending-in-2023/2900-4618/">every show canceled this year across all networks</a>!</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. 1899</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4136032-1899_s1_e3_00_38_54_03.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Premiered on: November 17, 2022</p><p>Canceled after 1 season.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2.

## Destiny 2's New Weapon-Swap Delay Will Be Dialed Back Soon

<p dir="ltr">As part of the newest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-patch-targets-a-shotgun-exploit-and-fixes-guardian-games-issues/1100-6513945/">Destiny 2 patch</a>, Bungie implemented a limitation on weapon-swapping in order to curb an exploit that allowed players to deal significantly more damage than intended. But the end result for some players, even those not using the exploit, can be a frustrating window in which you can't fire your weapon. Bungie has now provided more details on why it made the change and reassured fans that it will be reducing that delay.</p><p dir="ltr">The shotgun exploit involved attacking a boss, opening your inventory, swapping from a slug shotgun to another shotgun (most notably, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-fourth-horseman-exotic-quest-guide-how-/1100-6474861/">Fourth Horseman</a>), and then unloading it on an enemy. Doing this properly and under the right circumstances could absolutely erase boss enemies in the blink of an eye, rather than being potentially multi-minute encounters. This has been known for at least a couple of weeks, as seen in this video:</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">To prevent this, the 7.0.5.3 patch implemented a delay after swapping a weapon in your inventory: For two seconds after the swap is made, the new weapon can't be fired. This effectively undermines those attempting to utilize the exploit, but it's also annoying to swap a weapon and then have to stand around, not firing a weapon for two full seconds. It's ultimately an issue that will only impact a relatively small group of players, as this type of behavior isn't common for many people, due to the need for both a fast internet connection and a fast PC. But Bungie has now explained more about why the change was made, saying the shotgun exploit wasn't the only such issue that needed to be addressed.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-new-weapon-swap-delay-will-be-dialed-back-soon/1100-6514009/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Disney's Haunted Mansion: Trailer, Release Date, Cast, And Everything We Know About Them Theme Park-Based Movie

<p dir="ltr">The new Disney's Haunted Mansion movie is due out on July 28. Think of it as a redo; Disney made a first attempt at a Haunted Mansion franchise back in 2003, but it was both a critical and a commercial failure. Has the company learned its lesson from this prior misstep?</p><p dir="ltr">Disney has two distinct approaches to its big-budget, tentpole films. The first is to take classic animated films and convert them into live-action spectacles (or, in the case of The Lion King, a photorealistic animated spectacle). The quality of these films is wildly inconsistent and largely depends on whether the original material had room for improvement. That's why The Jungle Book adaptation was fantastic. And it's also why The Lion King adaptation was so bad.</p><p dir="ltr">The second approach is even less reliable than the first; it's to take Disney theme park rides or experiences, and expand them into full-length feature films. The quality of these films is also inconsistent; for every Oscar-nominated blockbuster like Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, we also get a movie like The Country Bears.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disneys-haunted-mansion-trailer-release-date-cast-and-everything-we-know-about-them-theme-park-based-movie/1100-6514008/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The Mystery Mayhem bundle’s store page says you could get anything from “action-packed shooters to immersive role-playing games” by indie and AAA publishers alike, which doesn’t narrow down the possibilities much, but considering the low price of each key, you’re bound to come away with at least a few games you're interested in.</p><p dir="ltr">There is also a chance one of your keys could be a AAA pack that includes codes to redeem Age of Wonders 4 Premium Edition, Dredge Deluxe Edition, Lego 2K Drive, Resident Evil 4 Deluxe Edition, Street Fighter 6, and the new System Shock remake.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV's</a> first season will arrive in mid to late July following the game's launch on June 6, Blizzard has announced. The news came as part of developer livestream dedicated to offering new details related to how Diablo IV's seasons and battle pass will work.</p><p dir="ltr">Seasons in Diablo IV will be quarterly (four a year) and will function similarly to how they did in Diablo III, with players looking to complete objectives as part of a Season Journey. Objectives are broken down into chapters, and players will need to complete most, but not all, of the objectives in one chapter before progressing to the next. Completing objectives as part of the Season Journey will contribute towards leveling up the seasonal battle pass, which will feature 27 free reward tiers. Playing and leveling up seasonal characters will also contribute towards battle pass progress.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The free reward tiers will occasionally include a special currency called Smoldering Ash, which is used to unlock and upgrade seasonal perks (called Season Blessings) that will grant various benefits to seasonal characters, ranging from increased XP earned from monsters to having a higher chance of acquiring rare salvage materials. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-paid-battle-pass-and-shop-will-be-for-cosmetics-only-with-seasons-modeled-after-diablo-3/1100-6506584/">Blizzard re-emphasized that players won't be able to pay for power in Diablo IV</a> by purchasing tier skips for the battle pass to earn Smoldering Ash and immediately make their seasonal characters more powerful, as each Smoldering Ash reward will have level requirements that will need to be met before they can be used.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-1-begins-in-july-blizzard-details-seasonal-bonuses-and-battle-pass-rewards/1100-6514005/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>If you live near a Costco, you have an easy way to save on not just groceries, but also video games, electronics, and other household products. The bulk retailer frequently holds members-only discounts--and back when PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles were scarce, Costco was one of the best places to look. You need to be a member to shop most of the sales, but an ongoing promotion is giving away <b>$30 gift cards</b> when signing up for a <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://deals.gamespot.com/sales/costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card?utm_source=gamespot.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card_020923&amp;utm_term=scsf-565326&amp;utm_content=a0x1P0000058JsWQAU&amp;scsonar=1">Gold Membership,</a> </span> making this a great time to join.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://deals.gamespot.com/sales/costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card?utm_source=gamespot.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card_020923&amp;utm_term=scsf-565326&amp;utm_content=a0x1P0000058JsWQAU&amp;scsonar=1">Sign Up For Costco Gold</a> </div><p>This Costco promotion comes with a few caveats. You’ll want to read the lengthy fine print, but the main takeaway is that <strong>only new members</strong> are eligible for the free gift card. But if you’ve never been part of the Costco family, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better time to join. An annual Gold Membership typically costs $60, but with a free $30 digital gift card, this essentially cuts that to just $30.</p><p>Beyond price cuts and member-only sales, you’ll also gain access to Costco gas stations, the Costco Travel center for discounted vacations, Costco Optical, Costco Pharmacy, and several other auxiliary perks. And as mentioned above, Costco frequently slashes prices on games or hosts exclusive deals for hot new tech and electronics.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-a-free-30-gift-card-when-signing-up-for-a-costco-membership/1100-6511477/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Dozens Of Destiny 2 Exotic Armor Pieces Are Getting Overhauled In Season 21

<p>As part of the new changes coming in Season 21 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>, developer Bungie has outlined which Exotics armor pieces will be getting overhauled. For <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-deep-release-date-armor-story-and-everything-we-know/1100-6513865/">Season of the Deep</a>, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/exotic-armor-tuning-season-21">Bungie says</a> that it's aiming to identify underused armor pieces and revamp them to increase their appeal, and at the same time, nerf certain armor pieces that have become too powerful. Bungie's other changes will free up space on leg armor that would typically be used to run Surge mods, allowing players to insert other mods instead.</p><p>For Warlocks who enjoy using an explosive strategy, this is where the bad news comes in. Starfire Protocol, which has long been used to spam grenades, is getting heavily nerfed next season. The amount of energy gained from every instance of damage is being decreased from 20% to 2.5%, and Empowered weapon kills will grant 20% grenade energy when Season 21 begins.</p><p>"This Exotic has been strong for a long time, ever since Solar 3.0 dropped and fusion grenades became much more powerful for Warlocks," Bungie explained. "In making these changes, we didn’t want to completely rob the Exotic of its benefits. But right now, Starfire Protocol is one of the best single-target damage boosting Exotics--combine Witherhoard or Wolfpack Rounds with a Rocket Launcher with Demolitionist and you essentially get an infinite loop of rockets and double-detonating grenades--and it’s sucking all of the air out of the room.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dozens-of-destiny-2-exotic-armor-pieces-are-getting-overhauled-in-season-21/1100-6514000/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Mortal Kombat 12 Reveal Could Be Coming Soon, New Teaser Suggests

<p>A new teaser for <em>something </em>related to Mortal Kombat has gone up, suggesting Mortal Kombat 12 news could be on the horizon. The video may even hint at the possibility of a reboot for the franchise, though details remains vague at this point.</p><p>In the video posted on the official Mortal Kombat Twitter account--and also by Mortal Kombat co-creator <a href="https://twitter.com/noobde/status/1656343966306926597">Ed Boon</a>--a clock can be seen counting up from nine and up to 11. But once it gets to 12? The hour-hand straight-up skips that number and goes straight back to one on the clock.</p><p>In the Mortal Kombat timeline, this actually makes sense, as that game ended with a big tease of a major reset. In case you haven't played through the story mode of that game yet, you can skip past the next two paragraphs if you want to avoid spoilers.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-12-reveal-could-be-coming-soon-new-teaser-suggests/1100-6513994/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Movie Based On The Real-Ish Origins Of Flamin' Hot Cheetos Has A Very Spicy Trailer

<p>The first trailer for Flamin’ Hot, a movie about the creation of the Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, has been released. The film purports itself to be based on the "true story" of Richard Montanez (Jesse Garcia), the Frito-Lay janitor who channeled his Mexican-American heritage and upbringing to turn Flamin’ Hot Cheetos into an iconic snack. There are disputes about the actual creation of the cheese puff variation, so this is one man's story about how they came to be. </p><p>Most of the story is based around Montanez's memoir, "A Boy, a Burrito and a Cookie: From Janitor to Executive". The film started production back in 2019 and will be the directorial debut of Eva Longoria with DeVon Franklin producing under his Franklin Entertainment banner and Searchlight Pictures also producing with Lewis Colick and Linda Yvette Chávez co-screenwriting.</p><div>          </div><p>In his memoir, Montanez claimed that he had invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos in the early 1990s observing that the brand did not have any products targeting Latinos. He also claimed he had pitched his idea to CEO Roger Enrico as part of Enrico's initiative to empower employees to help the struggling company. However, corporate records had Lynne Greenfeld leading the project, which was introduced in test markets in the summer of 1990, alongside Flamin' Hot versions of Fritos and Lays.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-movie-based-on-the-real-ish-origins-of-flamin-hot-cheetos-has-a-very-spicy-trailer/1100-6513995/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## I Love Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, But I'll Never Finish It

<p dir="ltr">As its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom glides into view, it's interesting to reflect on the seismic impact The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has had on gaming since its launch in 2017. It has become the flagship open-world experience, and its compulsive, horizon-chasing gameplay loop made it an incredible advert for the Switch's TV-to-handheld unique selling point. Breath of the Wild rekindled my love for open-world adventure games, and the Nintendo Switch reshaped how I played games entirely. Certain games or consoles can become era-defining, not only for the medium, but for us as individual gamers, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Replaying games that have such strong associations with specific moments in your life can feel transportive--even more so than games usually are--as though you're time-traveling. However, while there are plenty of games that evoke a fond nostalgia in me when I play them, this association can be a double-edged sword. I consider Breath of the Wild one of my favorite games of all time, and yet, because of the events in my life when I played it, I'm not sure it's a game I'll ever finish--let alone want to play again.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">In the spring of 2017 I got a phone call from my parents while I was at work. At a certain point in your life, you develop a kind of telepathy around strangely timed calls from family, and so that morning, as my phone buzzed on my desk, I knew what the news was before I'd even answered. "It's your grandmother. Come home."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-love-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-but-ill-never-finish-it/1100-6513991/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Best Easter Eggs In GTA V And How To Find Them

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991081-gtav.png" /><br /><h3><p>Developer Rockstar Games has a long history with easter eggs and other secrets in the world of Grand Theft Auto. Since the beginning of the franchise, the developers have added dozens of easter eggs for fans to find. Usually, these secrets reference another piece of pop culture or another Rockstar Games title. In GTA V, the amount of easter eggs on the map of Los Santos is almost overwhelming. The developers spared little expense when they spent time thinking of and adding secrets in every nook and cranny of the map. From easter eggs that call back to old Rockstar games, like Red Dead Redemption, to secrets that actually trigger and complete side quests, fans can spend hours and hours in GTA V just searching for easter eggs. </p><p>In total, there are over 50 small and large easter eggs in GTA V. Of course, not all of these hold huge significance or are that interesting to find. Some of the easter eggs are as simple as looking at a certain object on the map. However, others are much more significant and are extremely rewarding to find. In this guide, we won't be going over every single easter egg that you can find on the GTA V map. If you want that information, you can visit the GTA V Wiki and browse every single secret that players have discovered in the nine years GTA V has been out. For this guide, we'll be going over the best easter eggs Rockstar Games put in Los Santos and how to find them on the map. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Frozen Alien</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991085-fa.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> This is one of the most well-known easter eggs in GTA V but it's still worth repeating for the sheer entertainment value of it. The Frozen Alien is an easter egg that actually took some time to find in the game after it was initially released in 2013. The easter egg is basically an alien frozen in the ice that players can find during the opening sequence of GTA V. As you're driving away from the cops after robbing the bank, stop just before you hit the train tracks. You will see a detour down the right side of a hill. Take the detour and keep going until you hit the frozen river. Get out of the car and head out to the middle of the ice. You'll see an alien frozen in the river staring at you. However, you can't stay long, as the mission will fail if you're out of the car for too long. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bigfoot</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991086-bigfoot.png" /><br /><h3><p> Another classic easter egg is Bigfoot. The mythical creature was actually first introduced into a GTA game back in San Andreas. In Los Santos, players can actually see Bigfoot a couple of times throughout the story mode. During the mission "The Last One," you play as Franklin and can hunt down "Sasquatch." However, this turns out to just be a man in a costume trying to scare people in the woods. To see the "real" version of Bigfoot, you need to get to the mission "Predator." In this mission, you play as Michael trying to snipe the O'Neil brothers using a thermal sniper. If you aim that sniper out in the woods, you'll see a body in the lower right part of the area. That's actually Bigfoot and not an O'Neil brother. The heat signature of Bigfoot will disappear after a spell, so make sure to catch him in your sights quickly. </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>No Country for Old Men</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991087-nccf.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> Now we're getting into lesser-known easter eggs in GTA V. The film No Country for Old Men was released in 2007, likely during the time that GTA V was being developed. Rockstar Games must have enjoyed it so much that they put the opening scene of the movie into GTA V. If you drive to the Mount Chiliad State Wilderness, you can find a small dirt road that leads to a clearing with four cars around it. There are dead bodies around these cars and even a briefcase containing $25,000 at the bottom of the hill past the cars. All of this is taken directly from the film. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>John Marston's Red Dead</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991117-rd.png" /><br /><h3><p> That's right, John Marston is in fact not dead and lived long enough to write a book called "Red Dead." The obvious nod to Red Dead Redemption can be viewed on the bookshelf in Franklin's Vinewood mansion. It's a small, but neat easter egg. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Back to the Future</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991119-hvc.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> In total, there is three separate Back to the Future easter eggs found in GTA V. The first is the Hill Valley Church, which is a nod to the name of Marty's hometown in the films. The church is located by the Vinewood Cemetery. The second easter egg is found on pretty much every electrical box in the game. On the top right of the boxes, there's an orange sticker that reads "1.21 GW." This is a reference to the amount of power needed to make the Time Machine work. The final easter egg is a sticker inside Lester's house. This stick reads "88 mph Time Travel," which is how fast the Time Machine needs to go to travel through time. The sticker is only found in the current-gen versions of GTA V. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bond's Aston Martin</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991126-jb.png" /><br /><h3><p> Sticking with the movie references, we have a clear nod to James Bond. After you beat the mission "Deep Inside" in GTA V, you unlock the ability to buy a car on the Legendary Motorsport website. This car is called the JB 700 and it shares a strikingly similar appearance to James Bond's Aston Martin. The only difference between the two cars is the JB 700 doesn't have any weapons on board. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Los Santos Whales</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991127-sm.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> This easter egg doesn't necessarily reference anything in particular. In two different locations, you can dive down into the ocean and stumble upon two separate whale skeletons at the bottom of the sea floor. This easter egg has been explained to simply reward players that are willing to explore every inch of the map. The first skeleton is viewable off the coast of Banham Canyon while the other is found near the Seashark Race on the east coast of the map. You can only get to the bottom of the ocean using the Submersible or scuba dive. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Master Chief's Glory Days</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991130-halo.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> Along the Walk of Fame in Los Santos, you can run into two characters that are dressed in bright green robot armor. They have clear helmets and look a little funny when you get up close to them. If you haven't figured it out yet, these are supposed to be Master Chief look-a-likes from the Halo franchise. However, Rockstar Games decided to make Master Chief put on a few pounds with these two characters. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Ghost of Mount Gordo</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991131-mg.png" /><br /><h3><p> This is easily the creepiest easter egg Rockstar Games put in GTA V. If you travel to the top of Mount Gordo from 11:00-12:00 at night, you can see a woman wearing white appear over a bloodstained message. The message says "Jock," which is a reference to Jock Cranley, a character in previous GTA titles. The ghost you see over this message is Jock's wife. It's safe to say you don't want to go near the ghost. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Submerged UFO</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991132-ufo.png" /><br /><h3><p> Another commonly known easter egg in GTA V, this one involves an underwater UFO. This was possibly the ship the Frozen Alien used to get to Los Santos. Nevertheless, you can dive down in the Submersible or with scuba gear near the far northern part of the map's ocean to see this UFO resting on the sea floor. Just go to the northernmost tip of the map, get out your Submersible in the water, and take a dive down. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Senora Serial Killer</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991133-senora.png" /><br /><h3><p>We've returned to the creepy easter eggs, this time with one from a serial killer. Perhaps influenced by popular serial killers like the Zodiac, Rockstar Games wrote a poem wrote an apparent killer on a rock in the Senora National Park. Find the park's welcome sign in Sandy Shores and turn around to find a rock with the following poem on it: </p><p>One is Done </p><p>Two was Fun </p><p>Three tried to Run </p><p>Four called Mom </p><p>Five's not Alive </p><p>Six is Nix </p><p>Seven's in Heaven </p><p>8 won't Wait </p><p>To make matters even creepier, a song will play as you get near the rock that echoes the poem. Children will sing the song for you, adding to the overall suspense of the easter egg. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Playboy Mansion</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1745/17457013/3991135-pob.png" /><br /><h3><p> The last easter egg on our list is a nod to one of the most famous houses in history. Since GTA V is set in the fictional city of Los Santos, which resembles the real-life city of Los Angeles, it's only right that Rockstar Games made a replica of the Playboy Mansion. In the district of Richman, you can find a mansion lit up with pink lights, a wrap-around driveway, elaborate landscaping, and a party going on out back in the pool. Visit this mansion at night and you'll discover naked girls, alcohol, and a party that lasts all night. If this isn't the Playboy Mansion, then we don't know what is. </p></h3></p><br />

## Christopher Nolan Reflects On Not Casting Cillian Murphy As Batman

<p>Director Christopher Nolan and his multiple-time collaborator Cillian Murphy are possibly on their way to another box office success with this summer's Oppenheimer. Their working relationship started with 2005's Batman Begins and most recently 2017's Dunkirk, but the director recalls a time when that almost didn't even have a chance to start. </p><p>Talking with <a href="https://ew.com/movies/oppenheimer-christopher-nolan-cillian-murphy-in-conversation/">Entertainment Weekly</a>, both Nolan, and Murphy talked about the Batman reboot and what it took to get Warner Bros. executives to notice Murphy's talent--even though he wasn't going to take on the Dark Knight mantle. </p><p>"I really wanted to get on set with you, I wanted to get you on film," Nolan said about Murphy. "We did those screen tests very elaborately, on 35mm, with a little set. There was just an electric atmosphere in the crew when you started to perform." Nolan then described how the test went down: they did two scenes, one with Murphy as Bruce Wayne, the other as Batman. It was obvious that Christian Bale would take Batman, but what about Scarecrow, who would make his first live-action debut? The studio still had to be impressed. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/christopher-nolan-reflects-on-not-casting-cillian-murphy-as-batman/1100-6513989/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Criminally Underrated NES Remaster Is The Most Surprising Game Of 2023

<p dir="ltr">We didn't have "arguably the most underrated NES game is finally going to be playable on modern consoles" on our bingo cards for 2023, but that's apparently the case. Gimmick: Special Edition is coming to Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC on July 6.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">If you aren't familiar with Gimmick, you aren't alone; it's a NES game that released late in the system's lifecycle in 1992 and only ever came out in Japan and Scandinavia. Despite garnering mixed reviews on its initial launch, the game has become beloved in certain <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nes/comments/nc619n/i_think_i_really_really_love_the_game_gimmick/">cult circles</a> for its innovative physics system, vibrant art, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU0GEcU63qw">catchy soundtrack</a>, and overall high level of creativity. If you're a fan of NES platformers like Super Mario Bros., Mega Man, and especially Kirby's Adventure, it's definitely worth a look.</p><p dir="ltr">As a retro remaster, Gimmick: Special Edition includes many of the modern features you'd expect, including save and load states, a rewind feature, a time-attack mode, achievements, and more. Physical editions are slated for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch sometime later this year.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/criminally-underrated-nes-remaster-is-the-most-surprising-game-of-2023/1100-6513985/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Krafton has <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/6292">announced</a> that it will be adding a respawn system and a clan function to PUBG: Battlegrounds as part of the game's Update 23.2.</p><p>The update is live on the PC Test Server and will be fully live for PC on May 17 as well as consoles on May 25. The respawn system is called Recall and allows players to pick up a special item called a Blue Chip from a teammate's death box. During every match, a Blue Chip Tower spawns randomly and players can use them to register their corresponding Blue Chips.</p><p>Multiple Blue Chips can be registered concurrently and the activation takes about 10 seconds. A successful revival will have the appropriate teammate respawned in the next phase of the match. After a tower has been used, it will be inactive for a time. Furthermore, players can grab their opponent's Blue Chips to prevent them from respawning their own teammates.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pubg-update-lets-you-respawn-your-teammates-and-join-clans/1100-6513983/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Fortnite creator Epic Games and Lego have had a partnership for a while now, but that hasn't resulted in much on the Fortnite side of things. However, that's apparently set to change, as reliable leaker GMatrixGames has uncovered multiple details that indicate that Lego is coming to Fortnite in some capacity.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Update to "Juno" (Lego)<br />There'll be unique enemies, procedural world generation, custom UI elements, custom shaders that are different from regular FN (was in the files then removed), and something called "Adventures".</p>  — GMatrixGames (@GMatrixGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/GMatrixGames/status/1656282885265973248?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">May 10, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, GMatrixGames said that the Unreal Editor for Fortnite will include Lego bricks in some capacity, though the leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/GMatrixGames/status/1614320327265325056">indicated</a> that it will "not be for normal UEFN builders to use." The leaker also said that it could have a Lego-themed island. Recently, the leaker provided an update, stating that the Lego Fortnite collab will have unique enemies, procedural world generation, custom UI elements, custom shaders, and something called "Adventures." Some fans have speculated that "Adventures" could be its own mode like Fortnite's <a href="https://twitter.com/Gh0st1Knight/status/1656283109380292608">Save The World</a>, but it's really not clear.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on leaked information about the project's test servers, it's speculated that this Lego update will likely arrive in <a href="https://twitter.com/GMatrixGames/status/1625901197881225237?lang=en">fall of this year</a>, possibly September. As usual with these sort of leaks, everything is subject to change, so we recommend taking this information with a grain of salt.

<p>Xbox controllers come in a variety of colors that can suit just about any particular taste, but only one of them has a star-spangled design that looks fit to wield a Vibranium frisbee. Over on Amazon, <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Xbox-One-X-S/dp/B09J7DDH11?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">limited-edition Captain America Xbox wireless controller from Razer</a> </span> has just received a big discount, with its price dropping from $180 to just $108.50. This is the lowest price we've ever seen for this controller.</p><p>This is an eye-catching device, as the red, white, and blue color scheme is accentuated by sleek lines, stars, and it comes with its own themed charging dock. Just like Microsoft's official line of Xbox controllers--keep in mind these are officially licensed and have the same design as Microsoft's various colorways--the Razer one sports fantastic ergonomics, impulse analog triggers, and one of the best D-pads around.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4135842-xbox-controllers.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4135842-xbox-controllers.jpg" /></a></figure><ul><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Xbox-One-X-S/dp/B09J7DDH11?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">Razer Limited Edition Boba Fett Wireless Controller</a> </span> --$108 (<del>$180</del>)</li><li><span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Xbox-One-X-S/dp/B09J7R4X5X?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">Razer Limited Edition Captain America Wireless Controller</a> </span> -- $115 (<del>$180)</del></li></ul><p>Alternatively, you can travel to a galaxy far (far!) away with the <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Xbox-One-X-S/dp/B09J7DDH11?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">Boba Fett controller from Razer.</a> </span>vailable at a discounted price of just $115--also the lowest price we've seen--this controller sports a more weathered design and is influenced by the infamous bounty hunter's Mandalorian helmet.

"They've changed from the previous game. For example, there is a dungeon that connects directly from Hyrule's surface. If you dive from the sky straight into the dungeon, you'll trigger an event.

<p>With the rise of ChatGPT and other AI products and platforms, many people are wondering how AI technology could shape the future of video games. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has commented on this <a href="https://ir.ea.com/calendar-and-events/event-details/2023/Electronic-Arts-Q4-2023-Earnings-Conference-Call/default.aspx">during the company's latest earnings briefing</a>, saying gaming will be "one of the greatest beneficiaries" of AI, even if it does cause a shakeup in the workforce.</p><p>Wilson said the "fear of displacement of the workforce" is a legitimate issue as it pertains to AI. History has shown that major revolutions like the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution led to "displacement" in the workforce in the near term and then "meaningful increases" in job opportunities down the road.

<p>With just a few days left to go before the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo Australia has released a new advert for the game that is aimed at a very specific demographic: middle-aged fans. If you happen to fit that age bracket, be prepared to <em>really </em>feel your age but do pay attention to this brief reminder that you're never too old to enjoy video games. Especially when the game allows you to bonk a Bokoblin on the head with a big rock tied to a stick.</p><div>          </div><p>There's a bittersweet truth to the advert above, as while middle-aged gamers might have the real buying power when it comes to video games, the responsibilities of life generally don't give the working class too much time to sink into a new video game. But with the trailer above, it's a nice reminder that video games can inject a sense of adventure and color into even the most mundane of daily activities, like riding a bus.</p><p>For a more bombastic sizzle reel of what to expect from Tears of the Kingdom, you can check out this trailer that goes all in on cinematic action and rousing orchestral sounds. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-preorder-guide/1100-6492963/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> launches on May 11 for Nintendo Switch, and to see when you can start playing it exactly in case you're going the digital download route, you can check out this guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-time-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-releases-on-switch/1100-6513848/">when the game will unlock</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-advert-reminds-you-that-youre-never-too-old-for-video-games/1100-6513968/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The US Navy's squad of sea lions--yes, actual aquatic mammals--has been trained to play video games as part of a new research program. According to the scientists behind the program, the pinnipeds enjoy gaming just like we do.</p><p>As part of the US Navy's Marine Mammal Program, which trains sea lions and dolphins to assist in reconnaissance and recovery missions, the Navy is also bound to provide the highest standard of care for the animals in its ranks. One of the newest tools developed to keep its animals engaged and happy is a video game.</p><p>Called the Enclosure Video Enrichment system, or EVE, the game sees sea lions using an oversized set of buttons to control a cursor on a screen, completing certain objectives in a simplified form of video game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-us-military-is-training-sea-lions-to-play-video-games/1100-6513964/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
