For\nexample, the last American battleships are called </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa-class_battleship\">Iowa-class</a>,\nafter their \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_ship\">lead\nship</a> the \n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Iowa_(BB-61)\">Iowa</a>.  Until\nrecently, Nora (22m) used this in naming people.  This included,\nat various times:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>\"Mama\"-class: parents.  Julia, me.\n\n</li>\n<li>\"Anna\"-class: siblings, or maybe children.  Most commonly Anna and\nLily.\n\n</li>\n<li>\"Weiwei\"-class: housemates.  Most commonly Weiwei and\nAndrew.\n\n</li>\n<li>[Not Nora but Lily] \"Ella\"-class: cats.  Most commonly our cat at\nthe time, Ella.\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nLily really didn't like being called \"Anna\".  Possibly Lily would have\nminded less if I'd been able to teach Nora to say \"Anna-class\", but I\ndoubt it: the real hurt was not being the class exemplar.  Nora also\nhad a period when she would correct us: whenever anyone said \"Lily\"\nshe would firmly say \"Anna!\"\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis system makes a lot of sense when you consider how few words she\nhad to work with.  Much better to allocate just one of your ~10 words\nto siblings, and you don't hear the word general word (ex: \"sibling\")\nenough for that to be the word you use.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(The post's title would be confusing, except that we've had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing\">Classless\nInter-Domain Routing</a> for thirty years now.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02Mtce5ra7fzMrXiSsS3qnC7QBkqsQzj3HKozx1oXD71AKHFapgcsisSfsLZetZpj3l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110344644260373391\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/class-based-addressing", "date_published": "2023-05-10 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
