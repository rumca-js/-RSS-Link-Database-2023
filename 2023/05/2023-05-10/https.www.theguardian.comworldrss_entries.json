morning. When E Jean Carroll, a magazine writer, came forward to describe how she was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump in a Manhattan department store in 1996, Trump called her claim \u201ca complete con job\u201d and accused her of making it up to sell books. But yesterday, a New York jury \u2013 in a civil, rather than criminal, case \u2013 disagreed. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/09/e-jean-carroll-wins-trump-trial-verdict\">found that he was liable for sexual abuse and defamation</a> \u2013 and ordered him to pay her $5 million in damages.</p><p>The jury did not find that Trump had raped Carroll, as she alleged. But it said that he was shown by a preponderance of the evidence to have sexually abused her, and then told a malicious falsehood about her that did serious damage to her reputation. After years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/17/amy-dorris-donald-trump-women-who-accuse-sexual-misconduct\">credible allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump</a>, yesterday\u2019s verdict is the first time that a court has said that such a claim has been proven to be true.</p><p><em><strong>Science </strong></em>| <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/09/first-uk-baby-with-dna-from-three-people-born-after-new-ivf-procedure\">The first UK baby created with DNA from three people has been born</a> after a groundbreaking IVF procedure that aims to prevent children from inheriting incurable diseases. The technique, known as mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT), uses tissue from the eggs of healthy female donors to create embryos free from harmful mutations carried by their mothers.</p><p><em><strong>Pakistan</strong></em> | Internet services have been suspended across Pakistan after violence erupted when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/pakistan-former-pm-imran-khan-arrested-in-islamabad\">the former prime minister, Imran Khan, was arrested at a court appearance in Islamabad</a> and dragged into an armoured vehicle by security forces in riot gear.

John Allan denies allegations of inappropriate touching and remarks in three cases but apologised for comments about a woman\u2019s appearance at a CBI conference in 2019.</p><p><em><strong>Protest</strong></em> | Conservative MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/09/tory-mps-condemn-use-of-new-laws-to-detain-coronation-protesters\">have condemned the use of new laws to hold anti-monarchy protesters for up to 16 hours</a> during the coronation after the Metropolitan police admitted \u201cregrets\u201d over some of the arrests.
