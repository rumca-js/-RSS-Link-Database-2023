## The Sleep Watcher by Rowan Hisayo Buchanan review – an adolescent awakening

<p>A teenage girl is witness to the hidden dynamics of her parents’ marriage after she embarks on a series of out-of-body night-time adventures</p><p>What would you do with the ability to slip out of your body and prowl the world undetected? The possibilities for crime, mischief or adventure seem limitless, especially for a restless teenager. One night Kit, the introspective narrator of Rowan Hisayo Buchanan’s third novel, rises from her bed in the room shared with younger brother Leo, but realises with a shock that her unresponsive body is still tucked up. Exploring this new freedom, Kit chances to peek at the hidden recesses of her parents’ marriage, but how to interpret the scene is a puzzle that will consume her.</p><p>Just as disruptive poltergeist activity is associated with adolescence, Kit’s out-of-body experiences coincide with a burgeoning sexuality and growing impatience with parental restriction. In literary terms, there is another entity capable of melting through walls and drifting about unseen, and that’s an omniscient narrator. But Kit can only observe on her night-time travels; she can’t penetrate minds, grasp thoughts or read motives, which due to her lack of emotional experience, remain deeply obscure. At her most vulnerable and questioning, she witnesses something disturbing in the dynamic between her quiet, undemonstrative mother (of Japanese heritage, like previous Buchanan characters) and ebullient musician father. “I wondered if I’d got something wrong … If the things I had barely seen were a secret code between the two people I knew best.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/10/the-sleep-watcher-by-rowan-hisayo-buchanan-review-an-adolescent-awakening">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Elena Ferrante to Taffy Brodesser-Akner,<strong> </strong>writers have captured the pressures that being a mother can inflict on marriage and on the creative self</p><p>What surprised me most when I became a mother was how unfeasibly demanding the job was. This work was 24/7, three six five, and nobody even acknowledged that it was work, nor that mothers were doing it, that they were doing all of it, all of the time. You’re welcome, human race.</p><p>How had I not seen this coming? Why hadn’t I read about it? Granted, there was a big baby-shaped hole in my reading life, but still. There are mothers in literary fiction, yes, but they are generally assessed as good mothers or bad ones. Where are the novels about <em>being</em> the mother?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/10/top-10-novels-about-motherhood">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Oh my God, Obama’s stopping by for pasta’: can New York’s Carbone survive its own success?

<p>Ten years after the restaurant’s opening, it’s still the buzziest in town, drawing foodies and celebrities to its intimate space</p><p>The restaurateur and Queens native Mario Carbone grew up enamored with the atmosphere of old-school Italian American restaurants. From crisp white tablecloths to plates overflowing with red sauce, romantic paintings of Italian cities, and waiters rushing table to table clad in tuxedos while Frank Sinatra standards played in the background, Carbone was fascinated: “I thought it was magic.”</p><p>When he decided to open his own restaurant, he wanted to replicate that atmosphere, a place where generations could mark milestones together or escape from their daily lives. It was a decade ago this spring that his restaurant Carbone opened its doors and since then, the New York City eatery has become one of the toughest reservations in the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/09/carbone-restaurant-new-york-city-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Muppet Show’s house band are trying to record a new album in this Disney+ series – and they’re on raucously fun form. Although Animal’s backstory may make you shed a tear …</p><p>The Muppets make me cry now. They are at once avatars of childhood, evocations of simpler, better times filled with simpler, more readily available joys (and intimations of mortality, too). Whereas we are now all Oscar the Grouches in a bin of our own making instead of arm-wavingly enthusiastic Kermits creating an eternally vibrant show out of the chaos of existence. And, yes, this fact can make you want to weep. Or, if already weeping, add another layer of weeping on top.</p><p>But this is not fair on the Muppets. Despite now being owned by Disney, they are still a good and pure thing in this world and deserve to be approached with clear minds and uncankered hearts so they can exercise their talents and their magic to the full once again. If you can settle yourself down enough to make a start on new Disney+ show The Muppets Mayhem, the return of some of its characters will get you the rest of the way there. There’s lead singer Dr Teeth (Bill Barretta) – though he “does not subscribulate” to the notion of frontman status – and fellow bandmates, including murmuring trumpeter Lips (Peter Linz) and – of course – ungovernable drummer Animal (Eric Jacobson).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/10/the-muppets-mayhem-review-theyre-back-and-theyre-as-glorious-as-ever">Continue reading...</a>
