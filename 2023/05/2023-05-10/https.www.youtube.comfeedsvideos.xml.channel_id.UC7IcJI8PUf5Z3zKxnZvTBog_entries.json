Perhaps we\u2019ve crossed a neighbour in the hallway while getting our post. Or we\u2019re on a train, waiting for the doors to open. Why would we bother to hold up our day for a few moments, given how many things we already need to do and how many good friends we have that we haven\u2019t seen in far too long? We may also have a more high minded defence for our silence: we aspire to be profound people and there is no way that we can get anywhere meaningful with a near or complete stranger in a compressed amount of time. We shun the smaller chats because \u2014 in the back of our minds \u2014 we tell ourselves that we are already sufficiently deeply committed to the long and consequential ones\u2026\u201d\n\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE \n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \n http://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life-for-business/\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nNatalia Beigaj\nhttps://www.nb-animation.com/\n\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\n\nGraeme Probert\nwww.gpmotion.co.uk", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT1zpWB74yo", "date_published": "2023-05-10 13:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
