In this video I explain how MSI got hacked by the ransomware gang known as Money Message and 500+ GB of MSI proprietary source code, bios framework, and private keys for signing software were leaked onto the darkweb and how the leaked software signing keys could be used by hackers in the future to create malware that appears to be signed by MSI.
