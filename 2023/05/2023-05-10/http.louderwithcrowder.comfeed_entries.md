Some people like horses. Girls live out their violent fantasies through Beth. For me, there are two key reasons. One is the killer soundtrack and the fact they introduced me to Whiskey Myers. The other is watching Rip beat the crap out of people. According to actor Cole Hauser, there is a "Rip" in all of us.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2022/10/14/has-yellowstones-cole-hauser-ever-been-in-a-bar-fight-does-a-bear-sht-in-the-woods/" target="_blank">Men's Health</a></em> asked him how much Cole relates to Rip. Specifically, when it comes to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bar-brawl-rhode-island" target="_blank">bar fights</a>. How much of this is legit and how much is an actor telling a tale is unclear. But this is still an all-time quote:</p><blockquote>I’ve probably been in one on every continent. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with fighting. Sometimes I’m just tired of words, so let’s beat the shit out of each other. Maybe at the end of it you’ll buy me a Guinness and I’ll buy you a Bushmills, and we’ll be done. It’s kind of what guys do.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Again, I'm not sure how much of this is true. Hauser plays a lot of angry sumbitches. The actor started off his career playing a Southie street tough, a high school senior who enjoyed bullying freshmen (again, with a killer soundtrack), and a private school student who enjoyed bullying the Jewish kid. Typecasting? Who can say? But I'm not afraid to admit he was the one guy in <em>Good Will Hunting</em> I don't think I could take in a fight. So, there's that.</p><p>I also feel <em>"sometimes I’m just tired of words"</em> in my soul. The irony of relying on words to make a living is not lost on me.</p><p>Now if they could just figure out what the deal is with the second half of Season 5. The show ends after season 5 and Kevin Cosner is leaving. But now Costner isn't coming back unless he agrees with how they write off John Dutton. And apparently, there is a new show with Matthew McConaughey that takes place in the <em>Yellowstone</em> universe.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

But Franklin County deputies in Kansas pulled a dude over on suspicion of DUI, saw him dressed as the most embarrassing thing you can be dressed as, and remembered to do it for the content.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p>Here is what happened. This drunk bro was out having one too many cervezas for El Cinco de Mayo. I would hope he was throwing back Modellos and NOT Bud Light, but it's unclear in the police report. Deputies were notified of a possible intoxicated driver traveling down Interstate. They spotted the car and agreed with the possible intoxication. But even more surprising was that homeboy was driving drunk dressed as a beer.</p><p>They made him do a field sobriety test still wearing the Bud Light costume. It doesn't appear they made him put on a wig and say his name is Dylan Mulvaney. Though it's possible that everyone's bodycams all malfunctioned at the exact same time.<br /></p><p>Suds McDerp was placed under arrest and awaits trial. Left unreported is why exactly Suds was dressed as a Bud Light can. I have two theories.</p><p>1. Suds had a job <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/clay-travis-beer-experiment" target="_blank">handing out free Bud Light</a> at an El Cinco De Mayo festival and discovered people would rather drink their own urine <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yuengling-beer-patriotic-can" target="_blank">than be seen holding a Bud Light can</a>. Depressed that no one wanted to talk to him, Suds started throwing back tequila and forgot he was still wearing the costume as he got in his car.</p><p>2. Suds lost a bet and his boys are mean.</p><p>What are your theories?</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## MAGA bro illustrates appropriate way to respond to any CNN reporter... by telling him to go f*** himself

It was an odd decision for both parties because both sides hate each other. But at least for Trump, he only hates CNN. CNN hates Trump, anyone who likes Trump, and anyone who doesn't hate Trump. You need to be careful any time a CNN reporter attempts to ask you a Trump-related question. </p><p>Here CNN's Donie O'Sullivan trying to interview a Trump rallygoer in 2021. You may remember Donie as <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-suspends-journalists" target="_blank">one of the journalismers who got yeeted off of Twitter last year</a>. Andrew "Dice" MAGA answers in the only appropriate way.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">As we prepare for CNN's town hall with Trump tonight, a reminder of the proper way to address CNN journalismers. <a href="https://t.co/cPVAfc4w0u">pic.twitter.com/cPVAfc4w0u</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1656247658514640897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>CNN DOUCHE: What's your name?</blockquote><blockquote>MAGA BRO: My name is Go F*ck Yourself.</blockquote><p>The cool drag off of a cigarette after really makes this video what it is.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>This is the only way for anyone attending one of the former president's performances to respond to CNN. Any reporter, really. We all know reporters are adversaries. We also know how dirty they play. You may be inclined to try to one-up them. Turn the tables and catch them in a lie or something. Always remember that at the end of the day, the media has editorial control and your words will be taken out of context. There is no way to take "go f*** yourself" out of context. The reporter just had to stand there and take it. </p><p>You can of course experiment with your answer and mix it up a bit. "Deez Nuts" is an acceptable name. Also, bonus points are rewarded for any reference to the sexual relations you just had with the reporter's mother. And when all else fails:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">A preview of tonight's CNN town hall with Donald Trump... <a href="https://t.co/fWwyy8lEtK">pic.twitter.com/fWwyy8lEtK</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1656292517577383936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Have fun with it!<br /></p><p>And make sure to tune in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-trump-town-hall" target="_blank">WEDNESDAY NIGHT, MAY 10TH as Crowder live-streams CNN's town hall with TRUMP</a>.

## Watch: MSNBC digs up moldy potato head Brian Stelter to bash Tucker Carlson's "deal" with Elon Musk

Tucker Carlson just tweeted. He's bringing his show back on Twitter.</em></p><p><em>EXECUTIVE PRODUCER: My God. Quick, someone wipe the hot fudge off of Brian Stelter's and clean the Twinkie creme filling off of his blazer. </em></p><p><em>INTERN: Sir, I don't think that's Twinkie...</em></p><p><em>EXECUTIVE PRODUCER: I don't pay you to think! We need Tater on camera.</em></p><p>Okay, I'm not 100% sure that is how the scene unfolded. But SOMEONE at MSNBC heard that Tucker Carlson may or may not be working with Elon Musk (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-elon-musk" target="_blank">we know now not</a>) and believed BRIAN STELTER was the perfect person for commentary.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">NBC’s reaction to Tucker Carlson’s Twitter show announcement: “Will anybody be able to police what Carlson says or is this the point?

This move by Tucker may cement the idea of Twitter as a right-wing website, and we see some users trying to go off to other sites instead. Maybe folks who don't want to be a part of that party going off trying to launch other parties elsewhere.</blockquote><p>Like Brian Stelter knows anything about going to or being invited to a party. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="69a03" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33638536&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>This isn't the first time Tater has attempted a party analogy. When Elon first bought Twitter, Stelter reeeeee'd: "<strong></strong>"If you get invited to something where there are no rules, where there is total freedom for everybody, do you actually want to go to that party or are you going to decide to stay home?"</p><p>The answer is you go to that party because it sounds f*cking awesome. It's what Tucker Carlson is doing. While Stelter attempts to sell his Walter Cronkite award because it's the only way he can still afford cheesecake.</p><p>It's unfortunate that Tucker's new direction appears to be more serious and less mired in cable news bullshit. Because when he was mired in cable news bullshit, Tucker's attacks on Brian Stelter were the stuff of legend.</p><p>He mocked the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brian-stelter-pantsless" target="_blank">genderless potato head for broadcasting in his underpants</a>. He interviewed the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brian-stelter-college-student" target="_blank">college bro who made Stelter look stupid in front of his peers</a>. And my favorite? <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-brian-stelter-1984" target="_blank">The comparison to the Ministry of Truth's spokesman</a> in Orwell's <em>1984</em>.</p><blockquote>"He was a fat but active man of paralyzing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms--one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the thought police, the stability of the Party depended."</blockquote><p>Tucker Carlson remains relevant to the political landscape. Brian Stelter has nothing to do but be green with jealousy. Which, the disgraced media reporter isn't all that bothered by. The color green reminds Stelter of Jell-o.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

We all just live in it and revel in the content.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">We’re back. <a href="https://t.co/sG5t9gr60O">pic.twitter.com/sG5t9gr60O</a><br />— Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) <a href="https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1656037032538390530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Tucker's latest Twitter video, by the time you read this, will have crossed 80 million views. I don't know what Fox News's ratings were last night, but <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/megyn-kelly-tucker-carlson-fox" target="_blank">last week they were down FIFTY F'N NINE PERCENT in the demo</a>. And when Carlson says he's back, he means expect Twitter to be his new broadcast home (so to speak) for the foreseeable future.</p><blockquote><strong></strong>The last big [free speech platform] remaining in the world, the only one is Twitter, where we are now,” Carlson said. “Twitter has long served as the place where our national conversation incubates and develops. Twitter is not a partisan site; everybody’s allowed here. And we think that’s a good thing.<br /></blockquote><p>Axios reported earlier this week <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-war-elon-musk" target="_blank">Tucker had been talking with Elon Musk</a>, and it was assumed this new video meant the two were working together. The Head Twit In Charge clarified that he has NO deal with Carlson. Tucker is merely using Twitter the same way anyone else has the ability to.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">On this platform, unlike the one-way street of broadcast, people are able to interact, critique and refute whatever is said. <br /><br />And, of course, anything misleading will get <a href="https://twitter.com/CommunityNotes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CommunityNotes</a>. <br /><br />I also want to be clear that we have not signed a deal of any kind whatsoever. Tucker is… <a href="https://t.co/0TMjuYnKUp">https://t.co/0TMjuYnKUp</a><br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1656079504778092544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Here's the inherent brilliance of this move from Tucker Carlson. Because of his current Fox News deal, he can't sign with a different network until 2025. He's got lawyers dealing with that. But while Tucker at present time can't jump to a network like Rumble or one lesser than Rumble, he can still tweet. He can still post things on Twitter, the same as he was allowed to tweet and post things on Twitter for the past six years.</p><p>Carlson is free to use Twitter same as you and I. The fact that unlike you and I Carlson has a fully functioning production studio in his barn where he can just flip a switch and say "Hello, this is Tucker Carlson" is a mere coincidence. A coincidence his former and/or current employer (that gets confusing) can't stop him from using. If Sean Hannity can speak into his iPhone, Tucker Carlson can speak into his Sony PXW-FX9K XDCAM 6K Full-Frame.</p><p>Again, it's Tucker's world. Enjoy it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
