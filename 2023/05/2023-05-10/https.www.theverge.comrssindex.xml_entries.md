  <p id="027AgO">Google and Taito are partnering on a new augmented reality version of the arcade classic <em>Space Invaders. </em>The new game, <a href="https://youtu.be/fvA7v5noVjc"><em>Space Invaders: World Defense</em></a>, will use Google tools like ARCore and newly-announced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWL-fr3fDYU">Geospatial Creator</a> to let AR <em>Space Invaders</em> aliens fly around real-world locations.</p>
<p id="Rcc6V9">Based on <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleARVR/status/1656396931625545730">a GIF in a Google tweet</a>, it appears you’ll play the game kind of like a shooting gallery. In the GIF, a handful of aliens appear near and around a static city image, and a reticle appears so that the player can blast the aliens out of the sky. I get the sense this footage might not be fully representative of the final game, though — it kind of looks like the aliens have just been animated over a stock photo.</p>

  <p id="7Qp6Ix">Google’s taken a page from Samsung’s book and made itself a foldable phone. In fact, the newly announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23479753">Google Pixel Fold</a>, shown off at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697481/google-io-2023-news-announcements-rumors-pixel">Google I/O 2023</a> alongside the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23716677/google-pixel-7a-review-screen-camera-battery">Pixel 7A</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23480045">Pixel Tablet</a>, looks as if it borrowed a few chapters from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23308459/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-screen-battery-camera-price">Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>. The foldables share a fairly striking resemblance since Google opted for the phone-unfolds-into--tablet method of design philosophy and an equally lofty <a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_fold?hl=en-US&amp;selections=eyJlOCI6ImNHbDRaV3hmWm05c1pBPT0ifQ%3D%3D">$1,799.99 starting price</a>.

  <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mFKgbv">Google is officially back in the tablet business. After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23065055/google-android-tablet-pixel-io-release-date">teasing it a year ago</a>, the company has now announced the Pixel Tablet, a $499 slab that’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Charging-Speaker/dp/B0C1SLD1PK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">available for preorder</a> starting today, May 10th, and will begin shipping on June 20th.</p>
<p id="1uCUd0">Google’s history with tablets has been, well, fraught. The only real success it’s had was with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/29/3125396/google-nexus-7-review">Nexus 7</a>, a cheap, small tablet that was beloved when it came out back in 2012. The subsequent years saw the company try lots of ideas on portable touchscreen computers, launching new tablets with either Android or ChromeOS and then abandoning them shortly after. None ever recaptured the success of the Nexus 7. It even got to the point where Google’s head of hardware said it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700394/google-tablets-android-chromeos-priorities-cancellation">wouldn’t bother making new tablets...</a></p>

  <p id="kRPQos">Google is launching a new AI-powered coding bot for Android developers. During its I/O event on Wednesday, Google announced that the tool, called Studio Bot, will help developers build apps by generating code, fixing errors, and answering questions about Android.</p>
<p id="zWF9FE">According to Google, the bot is built on Codey, the company’s new foundational coding model that stems from its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23718046/google-ai-palm-2-language-model-bard-io">updated PaLM2 large language model (LLM)</a>. Studio Bot supports both the Kotlin and Java programming languages and will live directly in the toolbar on Android Studio. There, developers can get quick answers to their questions or even have the bot debug a portion of their code. </p>

  <p id="mtCPGl">Google is making generative AI tools available to Play Store developers in an attempt to make it easier for them to build out their app listings. It’s one of a pair of AI-powered features Google is announcing for its Android app store at its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23426166">I/O developer conference</a> today, alongside a new review summary feature that will use AI to summarize app reviews. Other features include a machine translation feature for listings and new options for promoting apps.</p>
<p id="5B1Xe0">The search giant is characterizing the generative AI tool as an experimental feature that’s designed to make drafting a listing easier. “Just open our AI helper, enter a couple of prompts like audience and key theme, and it will generate a draft you can edit, discard, or use,” its blog...</p>

  <p id="yqFBhR">You know the Reddit trick, right? The one where, when you’re searching Google and you want an actual human perspective on which headphones to buy / where to go in Buenos Aires / how many crayons your kid can eat before they get sick, the best thing to do is add “reddit” to the end of your search results? When you do that, you get to skip past the morass of SEO-optimized nonsense websites and find actual human people talking about their actual human experiences.</p>
<p id="ZwKOth">Well, Google has figured this out, too. So it’s launching a new section of its search results page, called “Perspectives,” that is designed specifically for this behavior. It aims to make it easy to find takes from individual people on subjects all over the web. It’s an expansion...</p>

At Google I/O, the company has new branding for this effort — Duet AI — but the features themselves are still not yet widely available to the general public.

<p id="cQtmGb">The company has now taken those great specs and put them into a smaller $4,000 body. The new Nikon Z8 boasts a 45.7MP stacked CMOS sensor that, thanks to the Expeed 7 image processor, can shoot RAW photos at 20fps for over 1,000 frames. There are also autofocus readings up to 120fps.

<p id="6rKPJt">Titled “Google Pixel x NBA: The Greatest Watch Party,” the link was shared in <a href="https://twitter.com/GooglePixel_US/status/1656085696686477312">a tweet</a> posted by the official Google Pixel account last night. It seems Google published the link prematurely as the tweet teasingly instructed readers to “check back in tomorrow.” That said, the tweet also includes a picture of MVP Joel Embiid clearly holding the Pixel Fold, so probably best to not think too hard about it.</p>

  <p id="6Stg5h">We’ll be waiting a little while longer for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. The years-in-the-making sequel to the excellent <em>Hollow Knight</em> was supposed to release within 12 months <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/23164968/xbox-bethesda-games-showcase-2022-activision-blizzard">of the 2022 Xbox June showcase</a>, but a representative for the game said Tuesday evening that the title will be missing that release window.</p>
<p id="jij220">“We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing,” Matthew Griffin, who works on marketing and publishing for the game, <a href="https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680">posted on Twitter</a>. “We’re excited by how the game is shaping up, and it’s gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can. Expect more details from us once we get closer to release.”</p>

  <p id="WyRYN4">Meta will no longer let creators using its <em>Horizon Worlds</em> social VR playscape make dedicated events, the company announced as part of the platform’s v109 update notes on Tuesday. It’s a surprising shutdown of a feature that some creators hoped would someday see improvements.</p>
<p id="XcPiXO">In March, I published a story <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23645512/meta-horizon-worlds-metaverse-comedians">about <em>Horizon Worlds</em> creators who run an in-VR comedy club</a>, the Unknown Theater, and how they organized a VR protest over Meta’s treatment of events on the platform. The protestors took issue with changes that made community-organized events much more challenging to find, which poses a problem for the club’s regularly-scheduled shows, and the way Meta gave more prominence to high-profile events featuring big name stars like Carrie...</p>

  <p id="VG2iS3">Twitter is making some big changes to direct messages and expects to introduce encrypted DMs on Wednesday, according to Tuesday evening tweets from the company and owner Elon Musk.</p>
<p id="cVzo4m">Let’s start first with the immediate changes. As detailed in a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1656090590021312513">the company’s support account</a>, you can now reply to specific messages (which work like the in-line replies you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294389/apple-ios-14-messages-app-memojis-replies-groups-mentions-wwdc-2020">might be familiar with in iMessage</a>) and react to messages with any reaction <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/twitter-dms-now-have-emoji-reactions/">instead of a limited few</a>. I just downloaded the iOS app to my phone and both features were there. You can access them by pressing and holding on a specific message.</p>
