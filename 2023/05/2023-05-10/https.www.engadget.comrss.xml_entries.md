<p>Twitter is beginning to <a href="https://twitter.com/cstanley/status/1656426745128697859"><ins>roll out</ins></a> its long-promised encrypted direct messaging feature. However, the initial rollout comes with some major limitations that could make it less than ideal for privacy-conscious Twitter users.</p><p>Of note, the feature is currently only available to verified Twitter users, which includes Twitter Blue subscribers and those part of a “Verified Organization.” It’s not clear if this is just for the early rollout or if encryption will be added to the growing list of exclusive features for users with a checkmark. For now, an encrypted chat requires both users to be verified, <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/encrypted-direct-messages"><ins>according to</ins></a> the company.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are also some significant limitations to the feature itself. It doesn’t support group messages, or any kind of media other than links. The company also doesn’t allow users to report an encrypted message directly, advising on a help page that users should report accounts separately if they “encounter an issue with an encrypted conversation participant.”</p><figure><img alt="Screenshot of Twitter's DM inbox showing an option to " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/7781c7c0-ef8b-11ed-bbab-a99604cacd42" style="height: 364px; width: 794px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Finally, the level of encryption appears to be less secure than what other apps offer. For one, message metadata is not encrypted. Furthermore, Twitter notes that “currently, we do not offer protections against man-in-the-middle attacks” and suggests that the company itself is still able to access encrypted DMs without the participants knowing. “If someone–for example, a malicious insider, or Twitter itself as a result of a compulsory legal process—were to compromise an encrypted conversation, neither the sender or receiver would know,” the company explains on a help page. It added that it’s working on improvements that would make such exploits more “difficult.”</p><p>That’s particularly notable because it falls far short of the standard Twitter owner Elon Musk has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-has-created-his-own-artificial-intelligence-company-012103279.html">described</a> when expressing his desire to add encryption for Twitter DMs. He has said he wants it to be impossible for the company to access users’ encrypted messages even if “someone puts a gun to our heads.”</p><p>In a tweet, Twitter security engineer Christopher Stanley acknowledged the shortcoming. “We’re not quite there yet, but we’re working on it.”</p><p>For those who are verified and want to try out the feature anyway, encrypted messaging can be accessed via the info menu (that’s the same menu you use to block or report a conversation) within a particular DM. Once encryption is enabled, the encrypted messages will appear as a separate message thread with labels at the top of the chat to indicate that the conversation is encrypted.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitters-encrypted-dms-are-here--but-only-for-verified-users-234934842.html?src=rss

## Scammers used AI-generated Frank Ocean songs to steal thousands of dollars

<p>More AI-generated music mimicking a famous artist has made the rounds — while making lots of money for the scammer passing it off as genuine. A collection of fake Frank Ocean songs sold for a reported $13,000 CAD ($9,722 in US dollars) last month on a music-leaking forum devoted to the Grammy-winning singer, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3mn75/scammer-made-thousands-selling-leaked-frank-ocean-tracks-that-were-fake-ai-generated-the-line-steer-it">according to</a><em>Vice</em>. If the story sounds familiar, it’s essentially a recycling of last month’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/copyright-in-spotlight-after-streaming-platforms-pull-ai-generated-drake-song-183513972.html">AI Drake / The Weeknd</a> fiasco.</p><p>As generative AI takes the world by storm — Google just devoted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-io-2023-everything-announced-at-the-event-193758196.html">most of its I/O 2023 keynote</a> to it — people eager to make a quick buck through unscrupulous means are seizing the moment before copyright laws catch up. It’s also caused headaches for Spotify, which recently pulled not just Fake Drake but tens of thousands of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-has-reportedly-removed-tens-of-thousands-of-ai-generated-songs-154144262.html">other AI-generated tracks</a> after receiving complaints from Universal Music.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The scammer, who used the handle mourningassasin, told <em>Vice</em> they hired someone to make “around nine” Ocean songs using “very high-quality vocal snippets” of the <em>Thinkin Bout You</em> singer’s voice. The user posted a clip from one of the fake tracks to a leaked-music forum and claims to have quickly convinced its users of its authenticity. “Instantly, I noticed everyone started to believe it,” mourningassasin said. The fact that Ocean hasn’t released a new album since 2016 and recently teased an upcoming follow-up to Blond may have added to the eagerness to believe the songs were real.</p><p>The scammer claims multiple people expressed interest in private messages, offering to “pay big money for it.” They reportedly fetched $3,000 to $4,000 for each song in mid to late April. The user has since been banned from the leaked-music forum, which may be having an existential crisis as AI-generated music makes it easier than ever to produce convincing knockoffs. “This situation has put a major dent in our server’s credibility, and will result in distrust from any new and unverified seller throughout these communities,” said the owner of a Discord server where the fake tracks gained traction.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/scammers-used-ai-generated-frank-ocean-songs-to-steal-thousands-of-dollars-222042845.html?src=rss

## Google makes it easier to build sleek Android TV apps

<p>Expect to see better looking Android TV apps, as well as more offerings from developers, in the future. At Google I/O today, the company announced the <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/tv">alpha version of Compose for TV</a>, a framework that will make it easier to build attractive Android TV apps with less code and more intuitive tools. Google says developers will be able to bring over their existing code, and by moving to Compose it should be easier to update apps moving forward. The framework has direct access to the Android APIs — which most devs are already used to — and will support code from existing Android mobile and tablet apps. Google is also unveiling a <a href="https://developer.android.com/design/ui/tv">set of TV design guidelines </a>to help developers optimize their apps for big screens.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Google has certainly come a long way when it comes to home entertainment. Its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-10-29-google-tv-review.html">first Google TV platform</a>, released in 2010 before the rise of streaming services, fizzled and died. It bounced back with the cheaper and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-07-29-google-chromecast-review.html">far more popular Chromecast</a>, which eventually led to Android TV, a platform that now houses a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chromecast-with-google-tv-review-163024220.html">revived &quot;Google TV&quot; interface</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When it comes to streaming platforms, Apple still has more tools for developers to build attractive TV apps, but it's nice to see Google making an effort. It's not like there's much competition from Roku or Amazon's Fire TV devices. Android TV's true power is its ubiquity, much like Android itself. <a href="https://www.strategyanalytics.com/access-services/media-and-services/tv-streaming-platforms/market-data/report-detail/combined-connected-tv-device-and-vendor-os-market-share-q4-2022-(30-countries)">According to Strategy Analytics</a>, Android TV shipped on more devices than any other streaming platform last year.

## Google’s Project Starline booth gave me a holographic meeting experience

<p>It’s been two years since Google introduced its Project Starline holographic video conferencing experiment, and though we didn’t hear more about it during the keynote at I/O 2023 today, there’s actually been an update. The company <a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline-prototype/">quietly announced</a> that it’s made new prototypes of the Starline booth that are smaller and easier to deploy. I was able to check out a demo of the experience here at Shoreline Park and am surprised how much I enjoyed it.</p><p>But first, let’s get one thing out of the way. Google did not allow us to take pictures or video of the setup. It’s hard to capture holographs on camera anyway, so I’m not sure how effective it would have been. Due to that limitation, though, we’re not going to have a lot of photos for this post and I’ll do my best to describe the experience in words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After some brief introductions, I entered a booth with a chair and desk in front of the Starline system. The prototype itself was made up of a light-field display that looked like a mesh window, which I’d guess is about 40-inches wide. Along the top, left and right edges of the screen were cameras that Google uses to get the visual data required to generate the 3D model of me. At this point, everything looked fairly unassuming.</p><p>Things changed slightly when Andrew Nartker, who heads up the Project Starline team at Google, stepped into frame. He sat in his chair in a booth next to mine, and when I looked at him dead on, it felt like a pretty typical 2D experience, except in what felt like very high resolution. He was life-sized and it seemed as if we were making eye contact and holding each other’s gaze, despite not looking into a camera. When I leaned forward or leaned closer, he did too, and nonverbal cues like that made the call feel a little richer.</p><div id="2bdac0ec265448a2bbb9657cc48c0ca2"></div><p>What blew me away, though, was when he picked up an apple (haha I guess Apple can say it was at I/O) and held it out towards me. It was so realistic that I felt as if I could grab the fruit from his fist. We tried a few other things later — fist bumping and high fiving, and though we never actually made physical contact, the positioning of limbs on the call was accurate enough that we could grab the projections of each other’s fists.</p><p>The experience wasn’t perfect, of course. There were parts where, when Nartker and I were talking at the same time, I could tell he could not hear what I was saying. Every now and then, too, the graphics would blink or appear to glitch. But those were very minor issues, and overall the demo felt very refined. Some of the issues could even be chalked up to spotty event WiFi, and I can personally attest to the fact that the signal was indeed very shitty.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that Starline was basically getting the visual and audio data of me and Nartker, sending it to the cloud over WiFi, creating a 3D model of both of us, and then sending it down to the light display and speakers on the prototype. Some hiccups are more than understandable.</p><p>While the earliest Starline prototypes took up entire rooms, the current version is smaller and easier to deploy. To that end, Google announced today that it had shared some units with early access partners including T-Mobile, WeWork and Salesforce. The company hopes to get real-world feedback to “see how Project Starline can help distributed workforces stay connected.”</p><p>We’re clearly a long way off from seeing these in our homes, but it was nice to get a taste of what Project Starline feels like so far. This was the first time media demos were available, too, so I’m glad I was able to check it out for myself and tell you about it instead of relying on Google’s own messaging. I am impressed by the realism of the projections, but I remain uncertain about how effectively this might substitute or complement in-person conversations. For now, though, we’ll keep an eye on Google’s work on Project Starline and keep you posted.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-project-starline-booths-gave-me-a-holographic-meeting-experience-205804960.html?src=rss

## Chipolo's new item trackers are basically AirTags for Android

<p>Google doesn't have a direct equivalent to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">Apple's AirTags</a>, but it might come close. Chipolo has teamed up with Google to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NoaXBvbG8ubmV0L2VuLXVzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2NhdGVnb3J5L2NoaXBvbG8tcG9pbnQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIyYTE1MWUzLWU0MzctNDE1ZC1hYTZlLTIwOTdhZTExOGJkOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbJ8jm-JNn5Q4gq3yit21UST1yuRJmEggtrg7uWor_fE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fchipolo.net%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fcategory%2Fchipolo-point">introduce</a> One Point (shown above) and Card Point (below) item trackers that work exclusively with Android's Find My Device network. They take advantage of the phone platform's ubiquity to not only increase the chances of locating your gear, but to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-findmy-bluetooth-tracker-google-airtag-tile-182832477.html">find unknown trackers</a> that might be used to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-and-google-team-up-to-tackle-bluetooth-tracker-stalking-140516646.html">spy on your whereabouts</a>.</p><p>Both trackers support Android's Fast Pair to speed through setup, and are water-resistant. The differences extend beyond their shapes. The One Point is the loudest with a 120dB ring, and lasts a year on its replaceable battery. The Card Point is quieter at 105dB and relies on a renewal program when the battery wears down, but it also lasts for two years.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Chipolo Card Point" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/8ff754c0-ef70-11ed-aeff-0e7b97035078" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chipolo</div></figure><p>Chipolo is taking pre-orders for both devices now. The One Point sells for $28, and the Card Point is available for $35. Four-packs for each respectively cost $79 and $112, and you can get a One/Card bundle for $77. Orders should ship by the second half of July. You'll need a phone running at least Android 9 with Google Play Services. That covers many phones released in North America and Europe over the past five years.</p><p>The Point trackers are really counterparts to Chipolo's iPhone-oriented <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chipolo-one-spot-air-tag-rival-find-my-network-tracker-tagreview-121030666.html">One Spot</a> and Card Spot. However, they also reflect Google's broader effort to flesh out the Android ecosystem. You don't have to rely on a third-party tracking network like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-thinks-a-1-million-fine-will-deter-stalkers-from-using-its-trackers-181857358.html">Tile's</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-bluetooth-tile-uwb-150004059.html">Samsung's</a> to find missing items. Of course, this also locks you into Android — you'll have to replace your trackers if you ever switch platforms.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/chipolos-new-item-trackers-are-basically-airtags-for-android-204801185.html?src=rss

<p>You won't have to install Android apps on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">your Chromebook</a> when you need them in a pinch. After a preview <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ces-2022-news-fast-pair-nearby-share-windows-chrome-cast-180055389.html">at CES last year</a>, Google has enabled app streaming through Phone Hub in Chrome OS Beta. You can quickly check your messages, or track the status of a food order without having to sign in again.</p><p>Once Phone Hub is enabled, you can stream apps by either clicking a messaging app notification or browsing the Hub's Recent Apps section after you've opened a given app on your phone. Google doesn't describe certain app types as off-limits, although it's safe to say that you won't want to play action games this way.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The feature works with &quot;select&quot; phones running Android 13 or newer. The Chromebook and handset need to be on the same WiFi network and physically close-by, although you can use the phone as a hotspot through Instant Tethering if necessary.</p><p>Google is ultimately mirroring the remote Android app access you've had in Windows <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-10-your-phone-apps-available-164453005.html">for years</a>. However, the functionality might be more useful on Chromebooks. While app streaming won't replace native apps, it can save precious storage space and spare you from having to jump between devices just to complete certain tasks. This approach is also more manufacturer-independent where Microsoft's approach is restricted to Samsung and Honor phones.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/you-can-now-stream-android-phone-apps-to-your-chromebook-202830500.html?src=rss

<p>AI-generated music has been in the spotlight lately, between a track that seemingly featured vocals from Drake and The Weeknd <a href="https://www.engadget.com/copyright-in-spotlight-after-streaming-platforms-pull-ai-generated-drake-song-183513972.html">gaining traction</a> to Spotify reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-has-reportedly-removed-tens-of-thousands-of-ai-generated-songs-154144262.html">removing thousands of songs</a> over concerns that people were using them to game the system. Now, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/">Google</a> is wading further into that space as the company is opening up access to its text-to-music AI, which is called MusicLM.</p><p>Google detailed the system back in January when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-music-generator-210728046.html">published research on MusicLM</a>. At the time, the company said it didn't have any plans to offer the public access to MusicLM due to ethical concerns related to copyrighted material, some of which the AI copied directly into the songs it generated.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="37599532c2d04e1dbb480f99009dbdec"></div><p>The generative AI landscape has shifted dramatically this year, however, and now Google feels comfortable enough to let the public try MusicLM. &quot;We’ve been working with musicians like Dan Deacon and hosting workshops to see how this technology can empower the creative process,&quot; Google Research product manager Hema Manickavasagam and Google Labs product manager Kristin Yim <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/musiclm-google-ai-test-kitchen/">wrote in a blog post</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/10/google-makes-its-text-to-music-ai-public/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"><em>TechCrunch</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>points out, the current public version of MusicLM doesn't allow users to generate music with specific artists or vocals. That could help Google to avoid copyright issues and stop users from generating fake &quot;unreleased songs&quot; from popular artists and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3mn75/scammer-made-thousands-selling-leaked-frank-ocean-tracks-that-were-fake-ai-generated-the-line-steer-it">selling them</a> for thousands of dollars.</p><p>You can now <a href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/experiments/music-lm">sign up</a> to try MusicLM through AI Test Kitchen on the web, Android and iOS.

<p>At <a href="https://www.engadget.com/live-updates-from-google-io-2023-163201853.html">I/O 2023 </a>today, Google shared <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-auto-new-features-google-io-2023/">a few updates</a> for both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-auto-update-hands-on-bmw-i7-ces-2023-005455780.html">Android Auto</a> and Android Automotive OS. Perhaps the biggest news is that Google is working with Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Cisco Webex to bring those virtual meeting apps to Android-equipped vehicles. If the thought of joining a video call in your car sounds like a driving hazard, don't worry: the meetings will be audio only with simplified controls on the infotainment display.</p><p>Google is also rolling out Waze in the Google Play Store for all vehicles with Google built-in. This means the popular navigation app will be available outside of just Android Auto and beyond <a href="https://blog.google/waze/waze-on-google-built-in-arrives-to-volvo-cars-and-polestar-cars/">Volvo and Polestar models</a>. What's more, the company is allowing developers to integrate the instrument cluster with their navigation apps. As you might expect, this will put turn-by-turn directions in the driver's line of sight. Plus, developers can access vehicle data like range, fuel level and speed to give drivers even more insight on their trips.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Waze for Android Automotive OS" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/6b34d2c0-ef66-11ed-9b69-1583b2ca7164" /><figcaption>Waze in the Chevrolet Blazer EV</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google has added new app categories to the Android for Cars App Library. That repository now allows developers to add IoT and weather apps for use in vehicles. For example, The Weather Channel app will be available alongside existing software like Weather and Radar later this year. The company is also making it easier for media apps (music, audiobooks, podcasts, etc.) to port their software to Android Auto and Android Automotive OS.</p><p>Additionally, the company has new categories for video and gaming apps in its library, with the goal of expanding to browsing apps soon. These are specifically designed for use when the car is parked or by passengers. YouTube is now available for all automakers to add to cars with Google built-in. Google says Polestar, Volvo and other &quot;select partners&quot; have committed to adding the video-streaming app via over-the-air updates. In terms of games, the initial slate includes <em>Beach Buggy Racing 2, Solitaire FRVR</em>, and <em>My Talking Tom Friends. </em>What's more, Google plans to add multi-screen support to Android Automotive OS 14, which will allow &quot;shared entertainment experiences&quot; between drivers and passengers.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="YouTube for Android in cars" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/82101c70-ef66-11ed-b7bb-dcfe9616b6cf" /><figcaption>YouTube inside a Polestar vehicle</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google says Android Auto will be available in almost 200 million cars by the end of 2023. The company also says that the number of cars with their infotainment systems powered entirely by Android Automotive OS with Google built-in should nearly double by the end of the year. That latter figure is spurred by adoption by automakers like Chevrolet, Volvo, Polestar, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honda-google-built-in-accord-touring-220752606.html">Honda</a>, Renault and more. In March, GM announced it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-phasing-out-apple-carplay-and-android-auto-in-evs-163104494.html">phase out Android Auto and CarPlay</a> in its EVs in favor of Android Automotive.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-is-bringing-zoom-teams-and-webex-meetings-to-android-auto-200029169.html?src=rss

## Google I/O 2023: Everything announced at the event

<p>To say the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/live-updates-from-google-io-2023-163201853.html">Google I/O 2023 keynote</a> was packed would be an understatement. Google unveiled a flurry of new Pixel devices as well as the latest versions of Android and other platforms. It also won't surprise you to hear that AI was everywhere — this was Google's big chance to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Don't worry if you missed something during the event, though, as we've got all the biggest announcements from the event.</p><h2>Pixel Fold</h2><figure><img alt="Google Pixel Fold" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/12399660-ef66-11ed-b6b7-37cda0a9e6e3" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>There's no doubt that the (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-reveals-the-pixel-fold-174726500.html">previously confirmed</a>) Pixel Fold was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-hands-on-finally-a-real-rival-for-samsungs-foldables-185253034.html">star of the show</a>. Google's first foldable phone features the same Tensor G2 chip as the Pixel 7 Pro, but opens like a book to reveal a 7.6-inch display. There's a 5.8-inch external display, and the cameras are only a slight step back between the 48-megapixel main camera, 10.8MP telephoto and ultra-wide lenses and an 8MP internal shooter. This is also one of the thinner foldables at 0.48in when closed. It's available for pre-order today and will sell for $1,799 when it arrives in June.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Pixel 7a</h2><figure><img alt="Google Pixel 7a" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ce466a50-ef65-11ed-bf8b-e1616270838a" style="height: 1050px; width: 1750px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Google's budget (really, mid-range) phone just got a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7a-review-its-got-everything-you-need-and-more-for-just-499-184517525.html">significant upgrade</a>. The Pixel 7a sports the same Tensor G2 as its pricier Pixel 7 counterparts while adding features that were sorely missed on earlier A-series models, such as a smooth 90Hz display, a 64MP main camera and wireless charging. You can order it today for $499, or $50 more than its predecessor.</p><h2>Pixel Tablet</h2><figure><img alt="Google Pixel Tablet" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/7139cef0-ef66-11ed-bbf2-f47b4f6156b3" style="height: 1050px; width: 1750px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Google first teased the Pixel Tablet <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-tease-185449067.html">a year ago</a>, and it's finally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-tablet-hands-on-basically-a-500-smart-display-with-a-detachable-screen-185151133.html">ready to ship</a> its return to Android-powered slates. As mentioned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-speaker-base-details-145616676.html">last fall</a>, this is really a hybrid 11-inch smart display. It can sit in a speaker dock to serve as a Google Assistant hub and Chromecast device, but detaches when you're ready to watch videos or check your social feeds. It's powered by the same Tensor G2 as the Pixel 7 and offers a healthy 12 hours of battery life. You can expect pen support, too. It's available to pre-order today for $499.</p><h2>Android 14</h2><figure><img alt="Android lock screen customization" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/fd093a60-ef61-11ed-bfef-1cdc89f0f070" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google fully unveiled Android 14 at I/O. The major revision includes upgrades you saw in the previews, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-first-android-14-beta-lets-apps-add-custom-sharing-features-170027699.html">custom sharing features</a> as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-14-blocks-sideloading-very-old-apps-173757328.html">stricter security</a>, but also adds iOS 16-style lock screen customization complete with &quot;cinematic&quot; wallpaper that makes subjects stand out. You'll see likewise see AI-generated wallpapers that are cued to images and art styles. Google will release the new OS late this summer, and is expected to deliver the upgrade to Pixel users first.</p><h2>Wear OS</h2><figure><img alt="Gmail and Calendar apps on Wear OS" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/e60ae610-ef66-11ed-bbcd-0df558719c02" style="height: 583px; width: 875px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google is still committed to improving its Wear OS smartwatch platform following last year's overhaul. At I/O, the company introduced long-sought native <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-remembered-to-add-gmail-and-calendar-to-wear-os-190027384.html">watch apps for Gmail and Calendar</a> that let you manage your messages and schedules from your wrist. WhatsApp is coming to Wear OS, too. Google also released its first developer preview for Wear OS 4, a major update that promises improved battery life and performance, simple watch backups and more accessibility. All the new software arrives later this year.</p><h2>PaLM 2 AI model</h2><figure><img alt="Google logo and AI Artificial Intelligence words are seen in this illustration taken, May 4, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/5e9beb60-ef67-11ed-bf7f-1fe2bdf68ce3" style="height: 2875px; width: 4000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">REUTERS/Dado Ruvic</div></figure><p>In some ways, the most important announcement at I/O is for tech that sits behind the scenes. Google has unveiled a PaLM 2 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-unveils-its-multilingual-code-generating-palm-2-language-model-180805304.html">AI language model</a> that will underpin more than two dozen of the company's products, including Bard. It's faster and more efficient, and can run locally on mobile devices. It's more adept at handling multiple languages and can generate JavaScript and Python code.</p><h2>Search Labs&nbsp;</h2><figure><img alt="Google Search Labs" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ba2f37c0-ef67-11ed-9dff-8da0062b7a08" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Among Google's many, many AI-related introductions are three test features available through Search Labs. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-search-generative-experience-preview-a-familiar-yet-different-approach-175156245.html">Search Generative Experience</a> provides automatically-generated overviews, exploration pointers and follow-ups. Code Tips will even offer programming snippets and advice. Add to Sheets, meanwhile, lets you plug search results into spreadsheets.</p><h2>Bard</h2><figure><img alt="Google Bard on Android phone" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/8aeba650-ef68-11ed-968e-895a7ecdfc3f" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mojahid Mottakin on Unsplash</div></figure><p>Google is rapidly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-transitions-to-palm-2-and-expands-to-180-countries-172908926.html">expanding Bard's capabilities</a>. On top of using PaLM2, the generative AI chatbot will soon let you include images in your queries, and bring pictures into its responses. It will also integrate Google apps (such as exporting to Docs and Gmail) as well as partner products <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-incorporating-adobes-firefly-ai-image-generator-into-bard-174525371.html">like Adobe Firefly</a> (for turning ideas into images). More importantly, it'll be much easier to use Bard in the first place — Google is dropping the waiting list and making Bard available in English to more than 180 countries, along with support for Japanese and Korean.</p><h2>AI in Photos and Workspace</h2><figure><img alt="Google Photos Magic Editor" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/fa235430-ee7f-11ed-bf35-4edb5a8db4cf" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Like it or not, Google is putting generative AI in many of the apps you use. To start, Photos is getting a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-will-use-generative-ai-to-straight-up-change-your-images-171014939.html">Magic Editor</a> that can move subjects, add content and even replace the sky.

Gmail on mobile will help you write messages. Slides will help you create background images using text descriptions. AI in Sheets will analyze your data, while Docs will offer &quot;assisted writing.&quot; Even Meet will use the technology to create unique video call backgrounds.</p><h2>Everything else</h2><figure><img alt="Google I/O 2023 sign" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/db0fdac0-ef68-11ed-a777-79eb4c15693e" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>There were numerous important updates across Google's other products. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/preview-googles-project-tailwind-is-an-ai-infused-personal-notebook-182603885.html?preview=true&amp;feature.preview=1&amp;query_ncp=1">Project Tailwind</a> is an AI-driven personal notebook.

## Google Play developers can now use generative AI to create store listings

<p>Generative AI really is everywhere. It's used to make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-may-have-generative-ai-avatars-soon-065038031.html">social media avatars</a>. It can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-gives-bard-the-ability-to-generate-and-debug-code-130024663.html">help debug code</a>. It can even ask nosey neighbors to be a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/linkedins-new-ai-will-write-messages-to-hiring-managers-162528197.html">little more polite to each other</a>. Now, Google is hoping to use it to encourage app developers to expand their use of custom store listings on the Google Play store. New features announced at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io/">Google I/O</a> will give developers will access to AI-powered tools that will help them create new listings and convert their existing app listings into multiple languages.</p><p>App developers could already create up to 50 custom store listings, but Google hopes these new tools will make managing them easier. To start, it's introducing a store listing groups feature that allows developers to craft a base listing for their app, and then modify specific elements to tailor it to a specific audience demographic or event. Potential users visiting your app's store listing from YouTube might see one set of screenshots, while visitors from another country might see a different series of images, as well as an app description in their native language.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new AI-powered features seem designed to make that easier. The AI helper, for example, can take developer prompts highlighting a key feature or marketing theme, and spit out ready-made text to help a user craft a targeted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-play-store/">Google Play Store</a> listing. There's also a new machine translation tool that can help developers quickly list their app in 10 different languages.</p><p>Although most of these new features were built to help developers find and expand their audience, there's at least one new tool being rolled out to average users: AI-powered review summaries. Google says the feature should &quot;help users learn from each other&quot; about what makes an app &quot;special at a glance.&quot; Even this is designed to help apps gain more reach, however: at launch it will only help summarize positive reviews in English.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-play-developers-can-now-use-generative-ai-to-create-store-listings-193011363.html?src=rss

## Google Pixel Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4: Battle of the foldables

<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-reveals-the-pixel-fold-174726500.html">confirming its existence</a> last week, Google has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-costs-1799-runs-2022-tensor-g2-chip-185213366.html">formally introduced</a> the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Hb29nbGUtUGl4ZWwtRm9sZC1TbWFydHBob25lLVRlbGVwaG90by9kcC9CMEMzNERMNlo3Lz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby14bi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGM4NDdkODktYzZlYS00MzRlLWI4YzgtMTFmMWRiOGQxNzg5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAeYkZ1_-ZyKEeXVzFVfUdZN_Vop9hCV5_GGdUqZDbDqT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-Fold-Smartphone-Telephoto%2Fdp%2FB0C34DL6Z7%2F">Pixel Fold</a>, its first stab at a foldable phone. Like past foldables, the new Pixel has a vertical hinge that lets it unfurl like a book. When it's folded, you get a more traditional form factor with a 5.8-inch display. Open it up, and you get a wider 7.6-inch screen for multitasking or watching videos. Both OLED panels have 120Hz refresh rates, and the device runs on the same Tensor G2 chip found in last year's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html">Pixel 7 line</a>. Google is pushing the phone's thinness (12.1mm folded, 5.8mm when not), battery ("over 24 hours") and weight (10 ounces) in particular as selling points. It also claims that the near-gapless hinge is built to last over time.</p><p>We'll have to review the Pixel Fold before we can speak to that. For now, though, we've laid out how the Fold compares on paper to the most prominent book-style foldable on the market today: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>. No, specs can't tell the whole story with a form factor like this, and both Samsung and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-will-launch-its-first-foldable-smartphone-later-this-year-110040331.html">OnePlus</a> are expected to launch new foldables in the coming months.

## Pixel Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4: Battle of the foldables

<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-reveals-the-pixel-fold-174726500.html">confirming its existence</a> last week, Google has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-costs-1799-runs-2022-tensor-g2-chip-185213366.html">formally introduced</a> the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdC9waXhlbF9mb2xkP2hsPWVuLVVTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkYzg0N2Q4OS1jNmVhLTQzNGUtYjhjOC0xMWYxZGI4ZDE3ODkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfKel6a7DD2C64Em7g2xtv865GIXRWuTPGYuc0QUJx84&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fproduct%2Fpixel_fold%3Fhl%3Den-US">Pixel Fold</a>, its first stab at a foldable phone. Like past foldables, the new Pixel has a vertical hinge that lets it unfurl like a book. When it's folded, you get a more traditional form factor with a 5.8-inch display. Open it up, and you get a wider 7.6-inch screen for multitasking or watching videos. Both OLED panels have 120Hz refresh rates, and the device runs on the same Tensor G2 chip found in last year's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html">Pixel 7 line</a>. Google is pushing the phone's thinness (12.1mm folded, 5.8mm when not), battery (&quot;over 24 hours&quot;) and weight (10 oz) as particular selling points. It also claims that the near-gapless hinge is built to last over time.</p><p>We'll have to review the Pixel Fold before we can speak to that. For now, though, we've laid out how the Fold compares on paper to the most prominent book-style foldable on the market today: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>. Yes, specs can't tell the whole story with a form factor like this, and both Samsung and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-will-launch-its-first-foldable-smartphone-later-this-year-110040331.html">OnePlus</a> are expected to launch new foldables in the coming months.

<p>Google is ready to give Android tablets another go. Nearly five years after launching the ill-fated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-30-google-pixel-slate-review.html">Pixel Slate</a>, the company has fully <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-gives-android-tablets-yet-another-shot-with-the-499-pixel-tablet-184432307.html">taken the wraps off</a> its latest large-screen device, the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdC9waXhlbF90YWJsZXQ_aGw9ZW4tVVMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU4MjQ0NWNiLTg1ZDctNDIxYS1hMjg2LTdiMjZlYTYyNzVlMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATf5cMD3ExgGB6X4IUutvR3V_njPGKn8i5gYP3uqllZ7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fproduct%2Fpixel_tablet%3Fhl%3Den-US">Pixel Tablet</a>. Google had teased the device a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-tease-185449067.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-speaker-base-details-145616676.html">times</a> over the past year, but now it's official: This is a 10.95-inch tablet that doubles as a Nest Hub-style <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-23-smart-display-guide-amazon-google-lenovo.html">smart display</a> with an included speaker dock. That dock also charges the tablet, and the slate itself runs on the same Tensor G2 SoC you'd find in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-launches-a-new-superslim-gram-laptop-with-a-15-inch-oled-display-170407209.html">Pixel 7 phone</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pixel Tablet starts at $499 and is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-order-the-google-pixel-7a-185253414.html">available to pre-order</a> starting today, with shipping starting in June.

<p>Prior to today's I/O event, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-reveals-the-pixel-fold-174726500.html">confirmed</a> the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/leaked-google-pixel-fold-images-show-a-sleek-nearly-gapless-hinge-160537647.html">leaks</a> and rumors about the existence of its first foldable smartphone with a teaser video on YouTube. We now know the full specs and pre-order details for the $1,800 handheld. Starting now, you can pre-order the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdC9waXhlbF9mb2xkP2hsPWVuLVVTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxZDQwNDZkYy04YTc5LTRmZDgtOGE2OC0yYjg4MTRiNzM4MDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQcusugu11bjOwYqGRKr2jIvhQMsZsPyZuuJAHJJf7j5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fproduct%2Fpixel_fold%3Fhl%3Den-US">Google Pixel Fold</a> through Google's store front, and units should begin shipping sometime in June. And when you pre-order, Google will thrown in a free Pixel Watch too.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Like the 7-series Pixel phones, the Pixel Fold will feature Google's Tensor G2 SOC and come with 12GB of RAM and either 256 or 512GB of storage. The claimed battery life extends beyond 24-hours and supports both wireless charging or 30W fast charging. Google says it's the thinnest foldable phone on the market, measuring a half-inch thick when folded.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The exterior features an always-on, 5.8-inch OLED display with up to 1550 nits of brightness and 120Hz refresh rate. It's covered in the same Gorilla Glass Victus as the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro — but it's the interior screen that's getting most of the attention. The 7.6-inch, 120Hz folding display is facilitated by a custom, dual-axis steel hinge and foldable Ultra Thin Glass with a layer of protective plastic. There's just enough friction within the hinges to enable different views when propped up in tabletop mode.</p><p>The Pixel Fold has a total of five cameras: an 8MP inner camera, a 9.5MP selfie cam on the front screen, and three cameras across the rear bar, including a telephoto lens, an ultrawide lens and a 48MP camera with a half-inch sensor. The multiple screens and cameras will enable features like split screen productivity, tripod-free astrophotography and real-time translation during face-to-face conversations.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll have full reviews of the foldable soon. In the meantime our senior reviews writer, Sam Rutherford was able to do <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-hands-on-finally-a-real-rival-for-samsungs-foldables-185253034.html">a quick hands-on</a> with the Pixel Fold and thinks it's a fitting rival for Samsung's foldables. Our comparison post compares the Pixel Fold specs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-battle-of-the-foldables-191551609.html">with the competition</a>.

## Google Pixel 7a vs the competition: Pushing the boundaries of a budget phone

<p>Google's announced the Pixel 7a — and made it available for immediate purchase — during its annual I/O conference. Like other A-model Pixel phones, this is a budget version of what came before, namely the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. At $499, it's $100 cheaper than either of its siblings but manages to meet or exceed many of their specs. It has a similar design, uses the same Tensor G2 processing chip, and offers 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage like the base model Pixel 7. The 7a also matches the water resistance and display refresh rate of that phone, but has a larger battery and higher-res cameras. One key difference is the smaller screen, measuring 6.1 inches versus the Pixel 7's 6.3-inch display.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We know it stacks up nicely against other current-model Pixels, but how does it compare to other budget-model phones? It's a little pricier than either the iPhone SE or the Galaxy A54 and falls between the two on battery capacity, screen size and number of cameras. The Pixel 7a beats both of its competitors on base-level memory and is also the only budget model to use the same processor as its top-end, flagship counterpart. Here are the specs for each phone side-by-side so you can see which one makes the most sense for you.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Google Pixel 7a vs. Apple iPhone SE vs. Samsung Galaxy A54&nbsp;</h2><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p><strong>Google Pixel 7a</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Apple iPhone SE (3rd gen)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy A54</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Pricing</strong></p></td><td><p>Starts at $499</p></td><td><p>Starts at $429</p></td><td><p>Starts at $450</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Release date</strong></p></td><td><p>May 10, 2023</p></td><td><p>March 18, 2022</p></td><td><p>March 24,2023</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Dimensions</strong></p></td><td><p>6.0 x 2.87 x 0.35 in</p><p>(152.4 x 72.9 x 9.0 mm)</p></td><td><p>5.45 x 2.65 x 0.29 in</p><p>(138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3 mm)</p></td><td><p>6.23 x 3.02 x 0.32 in</p><p>(158.2 x 76.7 x 8.2 mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Weight</strong></p></td><td><p>6.81 oz</p><p>(193 g)</p></td><td><p>5.09 oz</p><p>(144 g)</p></td><td><p>7.13 oz</p><p>(202 g)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Operating system</strong></p></td><td><p>Android</p></td><td><p>iOS</p></td><td><p>Android</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Screen size</strong></p></td><td><p>6.1 in</p></td><td><p>4.7 in</p></td><td><p>6.4 in</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Screen resolution</strong></p></td><td><p>1080 x 2400 at 429ppi</p></td><td><p>1334 x 750 at 326ppi</p></td><td><p>2340 x 1080 at 403ppi</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Screen type</strong></p></td><td><p>OLED (90Hz)</p></td><td><p>Retina HD LCD (60 Hz)</p></td><td><p>Super AMOLED (120Hz)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Processor</strong></p></td><td><p>Tensor G2</p></td><td><p>A15 Bionic chip</p></td><td><p>Exynos 1380</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Water and dust resistance</strong></p></td><td><p>IP67</p></td><td><p>IP67</p></td><td><p>IP67</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Battery</strong></p></td><td><p>4385 mAh</p></td><td><p>2018 mAh</p></td><td><p>5000 mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>RAM</strong></p></td><td><p>8GB</p></td><td><p>4GB</p></td><td><p>6GB / 8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Internal storage</strong></p></td><td><p>128GB</p></td><td><p>64GB / 128GB / 256GB</p></td><td><p>128GB / 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Rear camera(s)</strong></p></td><td><p>Two cameras:</p><p>Main: 64MP, ƒ/1.89 aperture</p><p>Wide: 13MP, ƒ/2.2 aperture</p></td><td><p>One camera:</p><p>Main: 12MP, ƒ/1.8 aperture</p></td><td><p>Three cameras:</p><p>Main: 50MP, ƒ/1.8 aperture</p><p>Wide: 12MP, ƒ/2.2 aperture</p><p>Macro: 5MP, ƒ/2.4 aperture</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Video capture</strong></p></td><td><p>4K 60 fps</p></td><td><p>4K at 60 fps</p></td><td><p>4K at 30 fps</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Front camera</strong></p></td><td><p>13MP, ƒ/2.2 aperture</p></td><td><p>7MP, ƒ/2.2 aperture</p></td><td><p>32MP, ƒ/2.2 aperture</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>WiFi</strong></p></td><td><p>WiFi 6E</p></td><td><p>WiFi 6</p></td><td><p>WiFi 6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Charging</strong></p></td><td><p>18W fast charging, 7.5W wireless</p></td><td><p>20W fast charging, 7.5W wireless</p></td><td><p>25W fast charging</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Connector</strong></p></td><td><p>USB-C</p></td><td><p>Lightning</p></td><td><p>USB-C</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>. </em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7a-vs-the-competition-pushing-the-boundaries-of-a-budget-phone-190029045.html?src=rss

## Google remembered to add Gmail and Calendar to Wear OS

<p>Google says Wear OS’ time in the doldrums is over and, two years after it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">approached Samsung</a> to help bail out the platform, it’s now the world’s “fastest-growing” wearable ecosystem. At its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/live-updates-from-google-io-2023-163201853.html">I/O 2023 keynote</a> on Wednesday, the company laid out the roadmap for several improvements arriving in the coming months. That includes tighter integrations with Google Home and Nest, the long-awaited launch of a full Gmail and Calendar app, and the first news about the next-generation of Wear OS.</p><p>Probably the most asked-for feature coming to Wear OS is access to Gmail and Calendar from the wrist. At some point “later this year,” users will be able to access key features on their watch including triaging and offering quick responses to the missives in their inbox. Similarly, in Calendar you can check your schedule, RSVP to invites and update tasks and to-do list items. And if you’re ensconced within Google’s smart home ecosystem, you’ll soon be able to use your watch to see who rang your Nest doorbell, and remotely unlock your door.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of today’s keynote, Google also wanted to highlight the big-name third parties that have thrown their weight behind Wear OS. That includes WhatsApp, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-begins-testing-wear-os-support-105519596.html">recently started beta testing</a> its app for the platform which will offer standalone messaging support. Similarly, Spotify is launching new tiles to trigger a new podcast episode or start a DJ session, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-users-can-now-view-their-heart-rate-on-peloton-equipment-140056941.html">Peloton</a> has recently updated its own Wear OS app to enhance tracking support and let users view their weekly workout progress from their wrist.</p><p>Google also wanted to show off its Watch Face Format, built with Samsung, in order to make it easier for developers to create watch faces for Wear OS devices. The key selling point is that the system itself will handle the hard work, making it easier for less-experienced users to use. That includes optimizing the face for rendering and battery performance, letting designers focus on the actual design part of the job.</p><p>Of more interest, however, is the news that Google is launching the emulator and developer preview for Wear OS 4. The company says that, when it launches “later this year,” users should expect to see improved battery life and performance. In addition, there’s a promise of new accessibility features including a faster and more reliable text-to-speech engine. There’s also new backup and restore support to make it easier to swap their watch (or phone) without a lot of awkward fiddling. We can expect to learn more about this, and everything else Google is showing off, in the coming months.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-remembered-to-add-gmail-and-calendar-to-wear-os-190027384.html?src=rss

## Google's redesigned Home app is available to everyone
 - [https://www.engadget.com/googles-redesigned-home-app-is-available-to-everyone-185733317.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/googles-redesigned-home-app-is-available-to-everyone-185733317.html?src=rss)

<p>Given how important smart home devices have become, it’s not a surprise that Google has a lot of updates to its Home app and how Android users can interact with those devices. The most significant update is to the aforementioned Google Home app for both Android and iOS — it has been completely redesigned and will be available tomorrow.</p><p>The app has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-home-app-smart-home-nest-cameras-130044455.html">in preview since last fall</a>, and Google says they’ve been iterating on it significantly based on user feedback. The new design incorporates a familiar five-tab view along the bottom of the screen: favorites, devices, activity, automation and settings. The favorites tab is the default view and lets you pin interactive tiles to the view for devices, actions and automations you use the most.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For example, it can automatically show you a view from a Nest camera, let you adjust specific lights or change the temperature in a specific room. It’ll also pop up media controls when you have an active video or audio stream playing on one of your devices. A bar at the top of the screen also shows “spaces” that are commonly used, like climate, WiFi control, cameras and lights. This makes it quick to jump right into adjusting those settings across your home.</p><p>Devices, as you might expect, shows everything you have connected, organized by room. The activity tab lets you see how things have changed with your devices, like your thermostat’s activity over time or camera events. It also contains an inbox that pulls together notifications in one place. Cameras specifically are getting a big improvement here, specifically in terms of performance. Google says cameras are 38 percent faster to show you a live feed in the new app, and accessing clips is 29 percent faster.</p><p>The automation tab is the default spot for for building routines that work across multiple devices, and you can schedule them there or active them on the fly. Finally, the settings tab was rebuilt to simplify and bring all controls you need into one place. Google called the old experience fragmented and said that centralizing these tools was a key part of the update.</p><p>Google also has some big news around support for the Matter smart home standard. Most significantly, the Google Home app for iOS now has Matter support, which means you can set up and manage Matter-compatible devices in app on your iPhone. Google says this will go live in the “coming weeks” and will require iOS 16.5. There are also new controllers in the Home app for more than 60 apps, which should make it easier to control more devices in the Home app itself.</p><p>Along with these app updates, the Google Home app is finally coming to Wear OS — you’ll be able to see your favorites on your wrist and scroll through your rooms to make adjustments as needed. You’ll also get camera notifications on your Wear OS watch with an animated preview of what just happened, so you can see that someone just delivered a package, for example. The Wear OS app will be available on May 15th.</p><p>The Home app is also getting updated to work better with tablets. It’s a smart time to do that, given the Pixel Tablet is arriving very soon. Naturally, it’ll take better advantage of a large screen and work in both landscape and portrait orientation. There’s also a new “home panel” that’ll come to both the Pixel Tablet and Pixel smartphones — this will let you do common actions like view a camera, adjust a thermostat or turn on your lights without even going into the Home app. And when the Pixel Tablet is docked, that Home panel will be accessible by anyone so they can adjust things in the house as needed.</p><p>Google also has some good news for people who own older Nest Cam devices. The first generation Nest Cam Indoor and the Nest Cam Outdoor will finally be able to be transitioned from the old Nest app to the new Home app. That’ll happen in July, and you’ll need to be using the public preview of the Home app. Google says the transfer takes about 10 minutes, and then all the data and feeds from those cameras will be available in the same app as the rest of your smart home devices.</p><p>As is often the case with Google, the timeline for all these updates varies — but the biggest change is easily coming to the Home app itself, and that’ll be available tomorrow. Get ready to mash that “update my apps” button.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-redesigned-home-app-is-available-to-everyone-185733317.html?src=rss

<p>I’ve been using some version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Galaxy Z Fold</a> as my daily driver for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/z-fold-3-long-term-durability-report-heres-what-samsung-still-cant-get-right-130053466.html">last three years</a>. So, I’ve been waiting a long time for someone to come along and give Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold line a real challenge – especially in the U.S. where we can’t buy stuff like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n2-flip-foldable-phone-pricing-availability-101858317.html">Oppo Find N2</a>. And after years of rumors, this summer that might finally happen when Google <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vP3BsaT0xJmhsPWVuLVVTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3OWQxYWE1ZC05ZTVmLTRhNzctOWEzZS0wYmUwNjVhNGM3ZWEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfcVBDrZeHz_fmZokRULsP-Vv7vo2q0EX3cZ5maCs7hl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2F%3Fpli%3D1%26hl%3Den-US">releases the Pixel Fold</a>.</p><p>Google’s foldable phone features a different design than most. It has a wider 5.8-inch exterior screen with a 17.4:9 aspect ratio. This makes a huge difference, giving you a more usable screen on the outside allows the Pixel Fold to function like a more full-featured device before you ever open it up. In comparison, Galaxy Z Fold 4’s small cover screen feels like it's designed mainly for doing simple tasks like looking up directions or responding to texts. And in your hand, the Pixel Fold’s wider dimensions make it feel different too. It’s shaped more like a Passport than Samsung’s skinnier baton–like handset.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3b36213e371b4e0ea9194f29cbefe4e6"></div><p>On top of that, the Pixel Fold’s heft is somewhat deceptive. Weighing 10 ounces or 283 grams, it’s actually heavier than the Galaxy Z Fold 4 (263 grams). However, because of its super slim design that measures less than 6mm thick when open (or 12.1mm when closed), it doesn’t feel nearly as dense. Then on the outside, Google created what it claims is the most durable hinge on any foldable yet. But to me the clever thing is that, by pushing all the moving parts as close to the outside of the device as possible, there’s less of a gap between the two halves of the phone, resulting in an almost completely flat device when closed.</p><p>As for its flexible main screen, we’re looking at a big 7.6-inch 2208 x 1840 OLED display with bright vivid colors. Now yes, there is a crease, and I can’t wait for the day when device makers can banish them for good. But at least on the Pixel Fold, it looks slightly less pronounced compared to some other devices. That said, the bigger differences are that Google’s foldable features slightly larger bezels and a wider landscape orientation by default, which is better for watching videos without rotating the phone. And instead of an under-display sensor like Samsung uses, Google has opted for a more traditional interior camera located in the top right corner.</p><figure><img alt="By going with a 5.8-inch exterior display with a wider 17.4:9 aspect ratio, the Pixel Fold feels like a more full-featured device when closed.  " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/1727fd20-eddf-11ed-bfcf-994106cd69b4" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Aside from its design, where things get really interesting is the Pixel Fold’s software and multitasking features. Even though I’ve only had a few minutes with it thus far, I love how snappy and responsive it feels. Switching from the front to the interior screen is super smooth, and I must admit the way Google syncs the movement of bird’s wings on the wallpaper with the position of the screen is a really nice touch. It even seems like Google has learned from Samsung a bit like with the inclusion of a disappearing taskbar that you can summon by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Google also says more than 50 first-party apps have already been optimized to run on devices with large screens like the Pixel Fold. You can see this in apps like Youtube, which automatically switches to a special UI when the phone is bent in half. And while Samsung offers similar tweaks in apps on the Z Fold line, it’s really nice to see continued development for adaptive UIs as they are going to play a huge part in making the next generation of foldable devices really shine. Google even showed off a new Interpreter mode that uses both the inside and outside screen at the same time, which works with the phone’s speech recognition so that people can see two different languages get translated in real-time.</p><p>Moving on to photos, despite the challenge of finding room for camera sensors in a phone this thin, you still get essentially the same great experience that we saw on the Pixel 7 Pro –  including that 5x telephoto zoom. That’s really nice to see compared to the Z Fold 4, which doesn’t have nearly as good sensors and lenses as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review-s-pen-camera-samples-battery-life-160019240.html">S22 Ultra</a>. And just like Samsung, Google included some nifty modes that allow you to shoot photos when the phone is half open or use the rear camera and the front screen at the same to capture super detailed selfies. Sure, these use cases are a bit niche, but they’re really nice for taking group shots without needing to carry a little mobile tripod around.</p><p>Finally, rounding out the Pixel Fold’s specs are a list of very premium components. We’re talking a Tensor G2 chip, 12GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage and 120Hz refresh rates on both screens. You also get a side-mounted fingerprint sensor built into its power button, support for wireless charging and IPX8 water resistance, which remains a real rarity among foldable phones.</p><figure><img alt="The Pixel Fold's wider exterior display and sleeker dimensions make it a bit easier to use compared to the Z Fold 4, even though the Pixel Fold is the slightly heavier device. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/93425040-eddf-11ed-a7f6-c8cc1390139b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, the Pixel Fold also sports a very premium price of $1,799. I was really hoping to see the cost of big foldable phones come down a bit now that they’ve been around multiple generations, but considering that’s basically the same cost as a Galaxy Z Fold 4, it’s hard to be <em>too</em> mad. Long-term durability is another concern. It took Samsung several generations to create a foldable phone that can really survive daily use (and even now things aren’t perfect). And while I’m sure Google has learned a lot from Samsung’s mistakes, only time will tell how the first foldable Pixel will hold up.</p><p>In the end, one thing that really struck me is that, when I had a chance to talk to some of the Pixel Fold’s engineers, they told me that this phone represents Google’s best efforts to put its own spin on a big fancy foldable phone. And while I’ve only had a brief time to play around with it so far, I definitely get it. Between its wider screens and design, there’s no way you’re getting this confused with Galaxy Z Fold. But more than that, I like that Google didn’t cut corners with the Pixel Fold’s camera while also cramming more optimized UI layouts and features derived from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-l-hands-on-some-big-multitasking-upgrades-but-is-it-enough-180002295.html">Android 12L.</a></p><figure><img alt="The Pixel Fold's interior display compared to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/613708c0-eddf-11ed-9efe-c0043964aec2" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Now if you’ll allow me to throw one last comparison in the mix, in a lot of ways, I feel like the Pixel Fold is an even more refined version of what I wanted the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-camera-sample-specs-glance-bar-130004036.html">Surface Duo</a> to be. It’s got a similar shape thanks to its sleek design, but with an extra display on the outside and way better software. And as a longtime user of big foldable phones, I can’t wait to test this thing out for real sometime later this summer.</p><p>Pre-orders for the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vY29uZmlnL3BpeGVsX2ZvbGQ_aGw9ZW4tVVMmc2VsZWN0aW9ucz1leUpsT0NJNkltTkhiRFJhVjNobVdtMDVjMXBCUFQwaWZRJTNEJTNEIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3OWQxYWE1ZC05ZTVmLTRhNzctOWEzZS0wYmUwNjVhNGM3ZWEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUUa8i7yTsY7pbIIEMWrHV5zU5Z3LW4_nKoX8fuAe-Zb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fconfig%2Fpixel_fold%3Fhl%3Den-US%26selections%3DeyJlOCI6ImNHbDRaV3hmWm05c1pBPT0ifQ%253D%253D">Pixel Fold</a> go live today on May 10th with official sales slated to begin sometime in June.</p><p></p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-hands-on-finally-a-real-rival-for-samsungs-foldables-185253034.html?src=rss

<p>Google officially announced the latest Pixel phone at its annual I/O event today — and you can buy one now with no pre-order necessary. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdC9waXhlbF83YT9obD1lbi1VUyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTdmODBjN2ItNTFkZC00ODJmLWFkN2YtNTkzNDY0ODBjYTMxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZh1pvojUf9JxcFjX6CAP7DgfTz1WLBWtf8dtkz3jALk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fproduct%2Fpixel_7a%3Fhl%3Den-US">Google Pixel 7a</a> starts at $499 and comes in four colors: charcoal, sea, snow, and coral. You can only get the vivid orangey hue from the Google store, but Amazon and Best Buy should both have the other colorways ready to ship in the next day or two. Like other A-model Pixel phones, the 7a is a more affordable version of its predecessor, in this case, the Pixel 7 which came out in October of last year. Both phones feature the same system-on-a-chip Tensor G2 processor Google developed specifically for Pixel devices, but the 7a shaves $100 off the MSRP.&nbsp;</p><p>The phone wasn't the only hardware announcement at I/O today. We also learned you can pre-order the Pixel Fold and got more details on the Pixel Tablet. Here's what how to order the new phone and when you'll be able to get your hands on the tablet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Google Pixel 7a</h2><p></p><p>The Pixel 7a looks a lot like its pricier sibling, with the same squared-off design and aluminum camera bar across the back. The display is slightly smaller at 6.1-inches, but it too is a full HD OLED screen with an equally fast 90Hz refresh rate. Both the battery and cameras on the 7a are slightly bigger than the other two current Pixels, with a 13MP front camera and a 64MP main lens around back, next to a 13MP wide-angle camera with a 120-degree field of view.&nbsp;</p><p>Google claims the battery will exceed 24 hours of moderate use and supports 18W fast charging and 7.5W wireless charging. Like the 7 and 7 Pro, you'll be able to unlock your Pixel 7a with face recognition or a fingerprint and the IP68 water-resistance rating can handle submersion up to three feet. Unlike the 7 and 7Pro, however, the 7a comes in just one memory and storage configuration: 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. Those are the same options as the base model 7.&nbsp;</p><p>Google's latest Pixel phone matches — and even exceeds — many specs of the two 7-series models that came before it, while selling for $100 less. Our senior writer Sam Rutherford says the has "everything you need and more." You can read his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7a-review-its-got-everything-you-need-and-more-for-just-499-184517525.html">full review here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Pixel Tablet</h2><p></p><p>Google's new Pixel Tablet can also act as your home's smart display/hub. The $499 price tag includes a full-fledged slate plus a charging dock that doubles as a display stand with a built-in speaker. The Tablet uses the same Tensor G2 chip as Pixel 7 phones and comes with 8GB of RAM and either 128 or 256GB of storage space. The 10.95-inch, Quad-HD LED display has a 16:10 aspect ratio and up to 500 nits of brightness. The Android operating system should give you a fair amount of productivity support, with split screen capabilities and 50 Google apps optimized for the tablet.&nbsp;</p><p>Google says the battery will last through 12 hours of video playback. When it's time to recharge, magnets in the tablet line up with pogo pins on the dock for 15W charging, no cables required. Like a smart display, the Pixel Tablet can manage your connected cameras, doorbells and other smart home devices and, when docked, can act as a digital photo frame.&nbsp;</p><p>The tablet comes in three colors: cement, hazel and a US-exclusive rose. It's made from 30 percent recycled materials and features a matte, nano-ceramic coating which seems an intriguing alternative to the standard plastic or metal of most tablets. Our deputy editor Cherlynn Low did a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-tablet-hands-on-basically-a-500-smart-display-with-a-detachable-screen-185151133.html">quick hands-on</a> with the Tablet, and a full review is on its way.

## Google's Pixel Fold costs $1,799 and runs last year's Tensor G2 chip

<p>Google spoiled one of its biggest I/O announcements last week when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-reveals-the-pixel-fold-174726500.html">confirmed the existence of the Pixel Fold</a>, its first foldable. Now we have the full details: It will cost $1,799, it runs on last year's Tensor G2 chip, and it's available for pre-order today. The company isn't confirming a specific shipping date; Google has only said the device will be available "sometime next month." That vagueness is unusual but then again, this isn't a normal product launch for Google: It's a leap into an entirely new mobile form factor.&nbsp;</p><p>While the Pixel Fold is more expensive than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/leaked-pixel-fold-video-shows-an-internal-display-with-chunky-bezels-164425413.html">earlier reports</a> suggested, its hardware is mostly what we expected: It sports a tall 5.8-inch external display and a wide 7.6-inch internal screen when it's opened up. They're both 120Hz OLED panels with HDR support, but the external one can get a bit brighter (up to 1,200 nits HDR and 1,550 nits peak brightness, compared to the internal displays's 1,000 nits HDR and 1,450 nits peak). Google adds that the phone's steel hinge is built with a "dual-axis, quad-cam synchronized mechanism."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Google Pixel Fold" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/53d4bcf2-ef4b-11ed-9bdd-42db73d8db5f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>In his hands-on with the Pixel Fold, Engadget's Sam Rutherford reports that the device has a smooth opening motion. And, notably, he also thinks the Pixel Fold has a far less prominent crease than its main competitor, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>. Google's pitch for its foldable isn't much different than Samsung's, though: You can get some quick business done with the front screen, and when the desire strikes, you can open it up for a tablet-like experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Being able to fold the phone also enables some nifty features, like being able to watch a YouTube video on the top half with playback controls on the bottom. Google also previewed features that take advantage of both screens simultaneously, like being able to show translated text on the external screen while you enter queries on the other side.</p><p>None of this seems new for the industry, but it's a big step for Google, a company that has historically played it safe on mobile. With its G2 chip and 12GB of RAM, the Pixel Fold is pretty much just a flexible version of the Pixel 7 Pro. That alone could be disappointing for early adopters: Is it really worth spending $1,799 for something with last year's hardware? But while the company could have waited until it had newer chips available, doing so would have left Samsung as the dominant foldable-phone maker for most of the year.</p><div id="c6fd0edb00c84d4db9be60a825e9d034"></div><p>The Pixel Fold's cameras are a slight step backwards from the Pixel 7 Pro, but they're still more impressive than the Z Fold 4. It has a new 9.5 megapixel external camera and an 8MP internal shooter, while its rear setup features a 48-megapixel main camera, a 10.8MP ultra-wide and a 10.8MP telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom. The 7 Pro, meanwhile, had a beefier 50MP Quad Bayer main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 48MP Quad Bayer telephoto. Even its front camera was a bit more impressive at 10.8MP.</p><p>A major reason for the lower-spec sensors is the sheer thinness of the Pixel Fold: It measures 6mm thick when opened (12.1mm thick when closed). Google was likely limited by the camera sensors available for slim devices. Although we'd normally bemoan company's aiming to be thin at all costs, that design also helps to balance the Fold's weight (10 ounces). It's a tad heavier than the Z Fold 4, but the weight distribution makes it feel less dense, according to Sam's hands-on.</p><figure><img alt="Google Pixel Fold" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/53e16722-ef4b-11ed-b5d3-5fe0fbdad566" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>It remains to be seen if the Pixel Fold is actually a better phone than Samsung's Galaxy Z4. While <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-22-samsung-galaxy-fold-review-expensive-experiment.html">Samsung's hardware had an incredibly rocky start</a>, it's had the advantage of improving from those mistakes. This is an entirely new category for Google, so we wouldn't be surprised if the company runs into a few hiccups along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vY29uZmlnL3BpeGVsX2ZvbGQ_aGw9ZW4tVVMmc2VsZWN0aW9ucz1leUpsT0NJNkltTkhiRFJhVjNobVdtMDVjMXBCUFQwaWZRJTNEJTNEIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3MmQ0MDc4NS04MDBjLTRiYTItYjczMy01NTQxOTVlNjA1NmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZWLtmB-OeY_92s9Hpck0DckuAbrF7kBLZq_8CWH65kY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fconfig%2Fpixel_fold%3Fhl%3Den-US%26selections%3DeyJlOCI6ImNHbDRaV3hmWm05c1pBPT0ifQ%253D%253D">Pixel Fold</a> would have been more instantly compelling if Google managed to price it below Samsung's $1,799 device. But the message from the company seems clear: It's aiming for the premium crowd with the Pixel Fold. And, of course, it's in Google's interests to avoid undercutting one of its premier Android partners.</p><p></p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-costs-1799-runs-2022-tensor-g2-chip-185213366.html?src=rss

## Pixel Tablet hands-on: Basically a $500 smart display with a detachable screen

<p>When Google’s vice president of Nest products Rishi Chandra <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-15-google-nest-smart-home-fix-plan.html">told me about the company’s vision for ambient computing in 2019</a>, he talked about a hypothetical smart display that was basically a tablet attached to a speaker dock. You would be able to lift the screen off its base, take it with you to another room and place it on another station there. Today, at Google I/O, that hypothetical device is launching for real as the Pixel Tablet, and I was able to get some hands-on time with it in April.</p><p>Though it was initially teased last I/O, the Pixel Tablet is actually ready for purchase this year. Come May 10th, you’ll be able to pre-order it for $499, and that includes the speaker base. Google won’t be selling the tablet on its own, though you <em>can</em> buy additional docks for $120 each so you can have stations in multiple rooms.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Clearly, the company doesn’t want you to think of this as a $370 tablet. This is more of a hybrid device, better considered as a smart display with a detachable screen. So don’t think of it as a successor to the discontinued <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-30-google-pixel-slate-review.html">Pixel Slate</a> — Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-20-google-is-giving-up-on-tablets.html">said it was done with making its own tablets</a> (or, more specifically, <a href="https://twitter.com/rosterloh/status/1141791243128590336">focusing on laptops</a>) and it is… even if it is confusingly calling this thing the Pixel Tablet.</p><p>In spite of its name, the Pixel Tablet will likely spend most of its time in your home as a smart display. With an 11-inch screen, rounded-rectangle shape and a mesh fabric covering the speaker base, the Pixel Tablet looks incredibly similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">the Nest Hub Max</a>. You can get it in either Hazel (gray), Porcelain (white) or Rose if you’re in the US, and the latter two have white bezels while the first has black borders. The device has a nano-ceramic coating that Google said was “inspired by the feel of porcelain,” lending it a “textured feel unlike any other tablet.” It’s hard to describe how this felt — I liked the matte finish but it’s not like my fingers were sent into spasms of euphoria when I touched the device.</p><p>What I did find impressive was how little it weighed. I picked it up to use while it was still attached to the speaker, and didn’t feel any strain at all. Granted, I only held it that way for a few minutes, and it would probably start to feel heavy if I held it long enough. But then again, you’re not really supposed to hold the screen with the speaker connected.</p><p>On its own, the tablet is a fairly straightforward Android 13 slate. It offers the same multitasking features as most devices running the latest version of Android L for larger displays, though Google has optimized 50 of its own apps for the Pixel Tablet. It also worked with developers to optimize apps like Spotify, Minecraft, Disney+ and more for the larger screen. For instance, Gmail and WhatsApp offer two-column layouts, and when I dragged a slider to expand the width of the former to take up more than half the screen, it went from a single column to a two-column view. Speaking of WhatsApp, you can now make video calls from the app on the Pixel Tablet, making it the first slate to support this.</p><p>You can also do things like drag and drop photos between apps while in split screen mode. A row of icons appears at the bottom of the screen when you drag your finger slightly from the bottom and pause. From here, you can launch your favorite and recently used apps.</p><figure><img alt="The back of the Pixel Tablet, with its grey speaker base facing the camera." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/5fabe950-eefa-11ed-9bf6-c15c1bd1be8a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by: Sam Rutherford / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Pixel Tablet is also the first tablet to be powered by the company’s own Tensor G2 processor, which enables AI features like voice typing, Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur. This is also the first tablet on which you can make WhatsApp video calls, by the way. Of course, you don’t have to be using the screen on its own to make use of these tools — the software works the same way whether the tablet is docked or disconnected.</p><p>Thankfully, the magnets holding the two parts together are strong enough to keep the display from sliding despite the angle it’s propped up at. It’s also possible to remove the screen with one hand, as a Google rep showed me at the demo, but it required some finesse in my experience. The dock isn’t heavy enough that you can simply peel the tablet off from the top — you’d need to use your hand as a lever along the bottom edge to separate the two. With practice, I could see this action becoming easier to do.</p><p>When the screen is attached to the base, a few things happen. The onboard speakers are deactivated and any media you’re playing will automatically stream through the dock’s more-capable system. From what I heard, the base speakers sound similar to those on the Nest Hub Max, which is to say the music was clear and had a nice amount of bass. I haven’t heard enough to judge the audio quality for sure, but it was definitely an upgrade from the tablet’s tinny output.</p><p>Another feature that becomes available when the display is connected to the dock is Hub Mode. You’ll see your selected photos on the lock screen, just like you do on Nest Hubs, as well as a home button on the bottom left. Tapping this brings up a control panel for your compatible connected home appliances like thermostats, lights, locks and camera feeds.</p><figure><img alt="The Hub Mode smart home controls dashboard on the Pixel Tablet, showing four square buttons at the top followed by eight blocks below. Two of these rectangles contain feeds from security cameras, while another two are controls for lamps." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/eb7ae2c0-eef9-11ed-a7b7-f4e0c429de74" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by: Sam Rutherford / Engadget</div></figure><p>In this mode, anyone who can physically touch the Pixel Tablet can access this dashboard, so if you have a friend visiting, they can also turn on the lights without having to unlock your device. This only works when the tablet is docked. They’ll also be able to set timers or play music and ask Google for answers. But don’t worry — they can’t do things that require your personal info, like see your calendar events, for example. That would require unlocking the tablet, and I appreciate that there’s a fingerprint sensor on the power button at the top to make this more convenient.</p><p>During the hands-on event in New York, I used the demo unit to turn off a lamp in a San Francisco office and was able to watch it happen via the camera feed that was also onscreen.</p><p>When the tablet is docked, you’ll also be able to use it as an additional screen and Chromecast to it. Google said this is the first tablet with Chromecast built in, but to be clear, the feature is only available when the device is docked and in Hub Mode, not as a standalone slate. It’s a nice touch regardless, and great for places like your bedroom if you don’t have space for a TV. I’m definitely planning on leaving a Pixel Tablet dock by my bed so I can stream Netflix in the background when trying to fall asleep.</p><p>I also like the idea of using the Pixel Tablet as a dedicated device for my video conferences. The slate itself has two 8-megapixel cameras — one on the rear and one in front. Google has designed Meet to keep the user centered in the frame even if you’re moving around. The company says the Pixel Tablet “has the best Google Meet app video calls of any tablet,” which is a claim I’ll have to put to the test in the real world.</p><figure><img alt="The Pixel Tablet on a brown bookshelf with its screen facing out." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ab0946e0-eefa-11ed-97f7-d396792f4f4c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by: Sam Rutherford / Engadget</div></figure><p>Using the Tensor G2 processor, the system will automatically adjust brightness to make sure you’re well lit. This was pretty funny to watch during our demo when the camera hunted for a person to keep in frame when I left its view. It discovered my colleague Sam about a foot away, even though he wasn’t facing the Tablet, and zoomed in on him. When both of us looked at the camera, the framing changed to accommodate us.</p><p>I’m not a fan of the low camera angle when the screen is docked, but the good news is you can still use Meet when the tablet is detached. Google also makes a case that you can buy for $79. It comes with a kickstand that doubles as a handle when unfolded all the way, so you can prop the device up on the go or hang it on a hook if you wish. I can see myself propping the tablet up on a higher surface or hanging it on a kitchen cabinet if I were to take a call from my parents while cooking dinner. What's nice is that because of the way the case is designed, you can easily snap the screen back onto the dock even with the case on, since the kickstand fits nicely around the base and the pogo pins can still make contact.</p><p>It’s worth noting that when the screen is detached, the speaker base is basically useless. You can’t cast to it, and because it doesn’t have a microphone onboard, it won’t hear your commands. It doesn’t have a battery onboard either, so this isn’t a portable system you can take to the beach or on a road trip (though I can’t imagine why you would).</p><figure><img alt="The back of the Pixel Tablet Case, showing its racetrack-shaped kickstand." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/cdb3f0f0-eefa-11ed-b8af-c961e55bec54" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by: Sam Rutherford / Engadget</div></figure><p>The tablet battery will last for 12 hours of video streaming, according to Google, so you should at least be able enjoy an entire season of <em>You</em> on a longhaul flight.</p><p>But remember. This isn’t meant to be a tablet first. Most other Android slates you’ll probably pick up about a few times a month, only to be annoyed to find it’s dead and need charging. Or you’ll take it with you on a trip to watch shows on the train or if you don’t like inflight entertainment options. With the Pixel Tablet, you’ll at least not have to worry about keeping it charged.</p><p>I’ve liked the idea of a smart display with a detachable screen since Chandra first mentioned it to me and, at first blush at least, the concept seems solid. I’ll have to wait till I can test out a unit in my own home to know how practical this idea is, but so far I’m intrigued.</p><p></p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/pixel-tablet-hands-on-basically-a-500-smart-display-with-a-detachable-screen-185151133.html?src=rss

## Android 14 uses AI to customize your home screen

<p>When Android 14 arrives later this year, it will bring new customization features to Google's mobile operating system. On Wednesday at the company's I/O developer conference, Android chief David Burke showed off a handful of new features for creating custom wallpapers. The tools build on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-material-you-android-personalized-redesign-182501466.html">Material You</a> design system Google introduced in 2021 by allowing users to create a custom wallpaper by picking a few of their favorite emojis. The creation tool allows you to add up to 14 emojis to a single wallpaper. You can then pick a pattern and a color to bring everything together. Once the wallpaper is on your home screen, the characters will react when you tap on them.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want something more sentimental, there's a separate option to create &quot;Cinematic&quot; wallpapers. The feature uses on-device neural networks to animate your favorite photos. Once the photo is on your home screen, tilting your device will cause it to move, giving the image more depth and life than it would have had you not used the new feature. Burke said both cinematic and emoji wallpapers would arrive on Pixel devices next month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Come the fall, Google will also introduce a built-in AI image generator within Android's customization menu. You can use the tool to create wallpapers you can't find online. It comes with pre-populated prompts you can tweak to make the process of guiding the AI easier. Once you add an AI wallpaper to your home screen, Android's Material You system will automatically color-match all the user interface elements, including any app icons, so they don't clash with one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/android-14-uses-ai-to-customize-your-home-screen-185022787.html?src=rss

## Google Pixel 7a review: It’s got everything you need and more for just $499

<p>Google’s A-series phones have been some of the best deals on the market dating back to the original Pixel 3a. And while the cost of recent devices has crept up a bit, they’ve also become more well-rounded. But with the Pixel 7a, it feels like Google has nailed the balance between price and performance. We’re talking a Tensor G2 chip, a 90Hz display, wireless charging and a higher-res rear cam–all starting at just $499. And when you factor in its design, the Pixel 7a delivers everything I like about the regular Pixel 7 for $100 less. So if you’re the kind of person who just wants a solid phone for a great price, the Pixel 7a has everything you need.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>From the outside, the 7a looks like a carbon copy of the standard Pixel 7. It’s got a familiar two-tone design with IP67 water resistance and an almost identical camera bar. But if you peer a little closer you’ll notice a couple differences like a slightly smaller 6.1-inch OLED screen (versus 6.3 for the regular Pixel 7) and a very slightly thicker and slightly lighter body. And even though the 7a features what Google calls thermal-formed polycarbonate (a fancy way of saying “nice plastic”) on its back, it pretty much feels the same too. In fact, I had to tap a coin on the back of the phone to make sure, because up until then I thought both phones used the same material.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Performance</h2><div id="0a6320ed26604014b42b09e13f6f7b68"></div><p>Meanwhile in front, the 7a still gets a lovely full HD (2400 x 1080) OLED display with an in-screen fingerprint sensor, except now it features a 90Hz refresh rate. Granted, that’s not quite as fast as you get on the Pixel 7 Pro or other flagships, but coming from the 60Hz panel on last year’s phone, it’s a very welcome upgrade. And when you combine that with a Tensor G2 chip, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, you end up with a really smooth user experience. Text just glides down the screen when you’re scrolling through websites.  And while its smaller display means the 7a probably isn’t going to be a mobile gamers first choice for handsets, I still had a blast playing titles ranging from more demanding fare like <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> to casual stuff like <em>Marvel Snap.</em></p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>As for photography, the two big changes are that the Pixel 7a features a new high-res 64-MP main cam in back, while the 13-MP selfie camera can record videos in 4K. In the past, the Pixel A-line has crushed basically every other phone in its price range. So this time to give the 7a more of a challenge I compared it to both the Pixel 7 Pro and the S23 Ultra. And while the 7a doesn’t have some of the more advanced features like a dedicated zoom, when it comes to pure photo quality this $499 phone more than holds its own.</p><figure><img alt="The Pixel 7a looks nearly identical to the standard Pixel 7, though its rear panel is made of polycarbonate instead of glass. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/d5b1a200-ee0c-11ed-9e7b-36ec70c6e9f4" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>For example, in a daytime shot of a flower Pixel 7a did a way better job of preserving details and highlights compared to a similar shot by the S23 Ultra. And in a pic of a dandelion, the Pixel 7a captured every fluffy seed. You don’t get a dedicated telephoto lens, but Google’s Super Res can produce some quality long-range images. Though, as you can see when compared to the S23 Ultra, it’s still not as good as having a dedicated telephoto lens. Also, even though I don’t love taking selfies, I gotta say pics look sharp there too.</p><p>In low light, Google’s Night Sight mode remains among the best in the business, though the Pixel 7a’s 64-MP camera does add a little more noise to photos than I expected. In a nighttime shot of a mural, despite the Pixel 7a’s pic looking a touch underexposed, it has a better white balance compared to the S23 Ultra while still preserving a lot of details. It’s only when you zoom in that you notice a bit of extra graininess. And in another picture taken at a local community garden, the 7a produced a pic that’s really close to what I got from phones twice its price.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><h2></h2><p>Another highlight is that the combination of a relatively small screen and a decent-sized 4,385 mAh battery results in great longevity. On our local video rundown test, the Pixel 7a lasted 17 hours and 41 minutes which, unsurprisingly, is really close to what we got from last year’s Pixel 7 (17:54) and an hour longer than the Pixel 7 Pro’s time of 16:42. However, for those who need a really long-lasting device, bigger phones like the OnePlus 11 and S23 Ultra are still the better choice, with both phones lasting over 19 hours on our tests.</p><p>I also really appreciate the addition of Qi wireless support, even if charging speeds cap out at 7.5 watts. When I’m charging the phone overnight or trying to keep the phone topped up during the day, the convenience of slapping a phone on a wireless pad can’t be beat. Besides, if you need some juice in a jiffy, there’s still the option of wired charging at 18 watts, which isn’t blazing, but it’s good enough.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt="The Pixel 7a features an aluminum zirconium band around the sides along with a new mid-frame structure. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/22183230-ee0d-11ed-b1f2-66e798df6621" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>I’ve always appreciated that Google has never tried to do too much with its Pixel A phones. The Pixel 7a is a simple device that packs a nice screen that’s now even better thanks to a 90Hz refresh rate, solid performance and cameras that can hang with rivals twice its price. And now for 2023, you get handy upgrades like support for wireless charging, not to mention all the great existing Pixel-specific features like Hold For Me, Clear Calling and my personal favorite–the Pixel Recorder app. If you’re someone who needs to record conversations or interviews on the regular, I’d argue that app on its own is worth the price of a 7a.</p><p>My two minor complaints are that while the 7a’s speakers are generally fine, they sound a bit shallow. And, if you’re someone who cares about mmWave 5G, you’ll have to shell out an extra $50 to get support for that (and that model is only available from Verizon). As a whole, the 7a is kind of a shock because it delivers 95% of what you get from the standard Pixel 7, but for $100 cheaper. Usually, device makers don’t cannibalize their own devices like this. But Google didn’t shy away and the result is a big win for consumers. Would I like to have a dedicated zoom lens or a larger screen? Sure, but that’s [kind of] why the Pixel 7 Pro exists.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7a-review-its-got-everything-you-need-and-more-for-just-499-184517525.html?src=rss

## Google gives Android tablets yet another shot with the $499 Pixel Tablet

<p>Google wasn’t kidding when it said last year that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-tease-185449067.html">the Pixel Tablet was “months away.”</a> In fact, it was a whole year away, but we’re finally getting full details today. The $499 tablet is built around an 11-inch screen, with Google’s Tensor G2 chip inside. The chip and screen aren’t exactly a big surprise, but Google is doing something a little unusual with the Pixel Tablet: it comes with a speaker dock that turns it into a Nest Hub Max with a better screen.</p><p>Rather than outfit the Pixel Tablet with accessories like a stylus and keyboard, as others like Samsung, OnePlus and of course Apple have done with their tablets, Google is pitching the Pixel Tablet as a device for entertainment and to control your home.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When the Pixel Tablet is attached to the speaker dock, the software runs in a Hub Mode to make it easy to access controls for all your smart home devices. Naturally, it also serves as a digital photo frame and can play back tunes and videos with audio through the built-in speaker. I haven’t heard that speaker yet, but Google says it’ll deliver “room-filling music.” Given that Google is including it at no extra charge, it doesn’t have to deliver too much to be worth it. The tablet itself also has four built-in speakers.</p><p>From a specs perspective, the Pixel Tablet features an 11-inch display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and a 2,560 x 1,600 resolution. There’s no word on the refresh rate, but that’s a nice size and resolution for a tablet in this price range. In addition to the Tensor G2 chip, the Pixel Tablet also has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (you can bump that up to 256GB if you’re so inclined). Credit here to Google for starting things off with 128GB of storage, rather than the stingy 64GB Apple includes on most of its base iPads.</p><figure><img alt="Google's new Android-powered Pixel Tablet" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/26f566d0-ef37-11ed-bf0d-d3b6312d2927" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Given that Google is positioning the Pixel Tablet as a hub of sorts, it naturally has a front-facing camera for video calls. Unsurprisingly, it’s nothing too special, an 8-megapixel shooter with an f/2.0 aperture and fixed focus. But it can shoot and transmit video at 1080p at 30 fps, so it should be decent enough for video cals. The back camera has identical specs. As for the battery, Google says it will last for 12 hours of video streaming, but that’s another thing we’ll need to test in person to verify.</p><p>In addition to the speaker dock (which Google is selling separately, as well, for people who want to place them around the home), Google is also selling a basic case that comes with a built-in metal ring stand that lets you place the tablet at a variety of angles. You can also dock the tablet without removing the case. And partner Speck is making a handful of other cases as well.</p><figure><img alt="Google's new Android-powered Pixel Tablet" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/26ed7790-ef37-11ed-9e7f-657dd88a4fd6" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Of course, the real key to making Android work on a tablet is having good apps, and that’s long been a struggle that continues to this day. Google says that there are “more than 50 Google apps” optimized for the Pixel Tablet and that it can run them in split-screen for multitasking.</p><p>I just reviewed the OnePlus Pad and can confirm that Google’s own apps work well on tablets at this point, but the problem really is in the third-party ecosystem. Google points out that it is working with developer partners to optimize their apps and cites Spotify, Minecraft and Disney+ as a few cases that take advantage of the large screen.</p><p>The Pixel Tablet goes up for pre-order today and starts at $499; it'll start shipping in June. It’s available in three colors: A gray-ish “Hazel” with a black screen bezel, a white-ish “Porcelain” with a white bezel and a pink-ish “Rose” with a white bezel.

<p>At its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/live-updates-from-google-io-2023-163201853.html">I/O 2023 keynote</a> today, Google’s revealed its latest Pixel A-series smartphone, and once again it draws inspiration from the previous year's flagship device, just with a more accessible price. The $499 Pixel 7a is $50 more expensive than last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6a-review-battery-life-camera-samples-170025138.html">Pixel 6a</a>, but the upgrades may be worth it, especially when it comes to imaging. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdC9waXhlbF83YT9obD1lbi1VUyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGFjNGZmMjUtZjk2Mi00Y2U5LWEwNzEtOWYzZGU0N2RjZWVjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZilKt-DyLlmsuOTEBV7VNVNYTB-5H8hzYyW_RJFFAjf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fproduct%2Fpixel_7a%3Fhl%3Den-US">Pixel 7a</a> has a glossy metallic finish on the camera bar that matches the rest of the Pixel 7 family and ditches the glass of its predecessor. Additionally, you'll get a new 64-megapixel primary camera sensor (an upgrade from the 12.2MP camera on the Pixel 6a) and a 13MP ultrawide camera with 120-degree field-of-view. It’s also worth noting that it’s a higher-resolution primary sensor than the main camera on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html">Pixel 7</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That high-resolution sensor brings super-res zoom to the Pixel A series, using digital zoom on 64MP images to hone in your subject better. Optical zoom tops out at 2x magnification and you’ll still get Night Sight, Photo Unblur, and Long Exposure thanks to Google's camera app software. This is Long Exposure's first appearance on an A-series device.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Pixel 7a" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/62c657f0-edb6-11ed-9efd-e3a584041161" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>With a 6.1-inch screen, the Pixel 7a is smaller than the 6.3-inch Pixel 7 or 6.7-inch Pixel 7 Pro. However, it’s roughly equivalent to the iPhone 14, so it’s not a tiny phone. The OLED screen now tops out at 90Hz (another improvement since the 6a) and works with Google’s adaptive brightness feature, cranking up the nits when outdoors for improved legibility. You’ll even be able to make your manual adjustments, and Google says the algorithm will gradually learn your preferences.

<p>Project Tailwind is Google's latest foray into AI and it's aimed at helping students organize their notes. Google describes it as &quot;your AI-first notebook,&quot; and the toolset is able to distill information from a personal notebook, making it all searchable, suggesting questions and main themes, and otherwise organizing the subject matter in an interactive way. Project Tailwind is an experiment at the moment and it's available only in the US — the waitlist to try it out is accessible <a href="https://thoughtful.sandbox.google.com/about">via Google</a>.</p><p>Google revealed Project Tailwind during today's I/O developer conference, showing off a few minutes of the program in action. After selecting a subject — computer science history — and pulling up a few pages of notes in paragraph form, the developer had Project Tailwind summarize the content, generate a glossary for one of the subjects, and offer a quiz on the information, among other actions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>This is a developing story.

<p>Google has stood at the forefront at many of the tech industry's AI breakthroughs in recent years, Zoubin Ghahramani, Vice President of Google DeepMind, declared in a blog post while asserting that the company's work in foundation models, are &quot;the bedrock for the industry and the AI-powered products that billions of people use daily.&quot; On Wednesday, Ghahramani and other Google executives took the Shoreline Amphitheater stage to show off its latest and greatest large language model, PaLM 2, which now comes in four sizes able to run locally on everything from mobile devices to server farms.&nbsp;</p><p>PaLM 2, obviously, is the successor to Google's existing PaLM model that, until recently, powered its experimental Bard AI. &quot;Think of PaLM as a general model that then can be fine tuned to achieve particular tasks,&quot; he explained during a reporters call earlier in the week. &quot;For example: health research teams have fine tuned PaLM with with medical knowledge to help answer questions and summarize insights from a variety of dense medical texts.&quot; Ghahramani also notes that PaLM was &quot;the first large language model to perform an expert level on the US medical licensing exam.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bard now runs on PaLM 2, which offers improved multilingual, reasoning, and coding capabilities, according to the company. The language model has been trained far more heavily on multilingual texts than its predecessor, covering more than 100 languages with improved understanding of cultural idioms and turns of phrase.&nbsp;</p><p>It is equally adept at generating programming code in Python and JavaScript. The model has also reportedly demonstrated &quot;improved capabilities in logic, common sense reasoning, and mathematics,&quot; thanks to extensive training data from &quot;scientific papers and web pages that contain mathematical expressions.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even more impressive is that Google was able to spin off application-specific versions of the base PaLM system dubbed Gecko, Otter, Bison and Unicorn.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We built PaLM to to be smaller, faster and more efficient, while increasing its capability,&quot; Ghahramani said. &quot;We then distilled this into a family of models in a wide range of sizes so the lightest model can run as an interactive application on mobile devices on the latest Samsung Galaxy.&quot; In all, Google is announcing more than two dozen products that will feature PaLM capabilities at Wednesday's I/O event</p><p><em>This is a developing story.

<p>Google is adding some new features to its image search function to make it easier to spot altered content, the company announced at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/live-updates-from-google-io-2023-163201853.html">I/O 2023 keynote</a> Wednesday. Photos shown in search results will soon include an &quot;about this image&quot; option that tells users when the image and ones like it were first indexed by Google. You can also learn where it may have appeared first and see other places where the image has been posted online. That information could help users figure out whether something they're seeing was generated by AI, according to Google.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you'll be able to see if the image has been on fact-checking websites that point out whether an image is real or altered. Vice President of search Cathy Edwards told Engadget that the tool doesn't currently tell you directly if an image has been edited or manipulated, though the company is researching effective ways of detecting such tweaks.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new feature will show up by clicking the three dots on an image in Google Image results. Google did not say exactly when the new feature will be available, besides that it will launch first in the United States sometime in the &quot;coming months.&quot; Those images will include a markup in the original file to add context about its creation wherever its used. Image publishers like Midjourney and Shutterstock will also include the markup.</p><p>Google Search seems to be going all-in on AI. The company announced its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-search-generative-experience-preview-a-familiar-yet-different-approach-175156245.html">Search Generative Experience</a> that gives an AI summary of results and other information on search, upcoming products like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-searchs-new-perspectives-tab-will-highlight-forum-and-social-media-posts-175209372.html">the &quot;Perspectives&quot; tab in search</a> that highlights forum and social media posts and other developments that you can test out in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-search-labs-lets-you-test-its-ai-powered-products-and-ideas-175254478.html">Google's Search Labs</a>.

<p>It's fair to say that Google was caught flat-footed by Microsoft's launch of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-next-gen-bing-more-powerful-language-model-than-chatgpt-182647588.html">Bing search powered by ChatGPT</a>, as it didn't have anything similar when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-unveils-its-chatgpt-rival-apprentice-bard-192055722.html">unveiled</a> its own conversational AI, Bard. Now, Google has announced <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-labs-sign-up/">Search Labs</a>, a new way for consumers to test &quot;bold new ideas and ideas we're exploring&quot; in search, the company said at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/live-updates-from-google-io-2023-163201853.html">I/O 2023 keynote</a>.</p><p>There are three key features available for a limited time. The first is called Search Generative Experience (SGE), bringing generative AI directly into Google Search. &quot;The new Search experience helps you quickly find and make sense of information,&quot; Google's Direct of Search wrote. &quot;As you search, you can get the gist of a topic with AI-powered overviews, pointers to explore more, and ways to naturally follow up.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Google's Search Labs let you test its AI powered 'products and ideas'" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/27032470-ef21-11ed-a5ab-52259e9c4dec" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Also available from the Search prompt are Code Tips, that use large language models to provide snippets and &quot;pointers for writing code faster and smarter,&quot; according to Google. You can get reponses about languages including Java, Go, Python, Javascript, C++, Kotlin, shell, Docker and Git.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, &quot;Add to Sheets&quot; lets you insert search results directly into a spreadsheet. For example, if you're planning a vacation on a Sheets document, you can easily add a link straight from Google Search.&nbsp;</p><p>Google's Bard could potentially improve all of Google's products ranging from Maps to Drive. Search, however, is the company's core function and principal moneymaker, and was one of the first things it mentioned when announcing Bard. To that end, it will be interesting to see how it compares with what Microsoft's ChatGPT-powered Bing can do.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-search-labs-lets-you-test-its-ai-powered-products-and-ideas-175254478.html?src=rss

<p>Search is, a quarter-century since its launch, arguably still Google's most impactful and familiar creation — a way in this day and age to sort through the chafe of unsourced nonsense on Twitter or Facebook and hopefully finding vetted, trusted information quickly. With that context it mind, Google announced an absolutely puzzling new feature today for its flagship product at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/live-updates-from-google-io-2023-163201853.html">I/O 2023 keynote</a>: the Perspectives tab.&nbsp;</p><p>Perspectives, according to the company, is a means to &quot;exclusively see long- and short-form videos, images and written posts that people have shared on discussion boards, Q&amp;A sites and social media platforms.&quot; In addition to the Perspectives tab, a carousel of the same results &quot;may&quot; appear in some search results — a standalone module graphically resembling the Top Stories module.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its announcement, Google mentioned the Perspectives initiative is happening in tandem with its quest to &quot;transform&quot; search through AI. What role AI will play in sourcing content for Perspectives is still unknown, but automating content selection and providing a sheen of authenticity to it has had its hiccups for Google in the past. The Popular On Twitter module has surfaced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/google-is-surfacing-texas-shooter-misinformation-in-search-results-thanks-also-to-twitter/">misinformation</a> about breaking news events like mass shootings in the past, and it's nearly certain Perspectives will hit many of the same snags. Google was also among the tech companies <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=60e97fc3-5759-41aa-a73b-6317bb989588&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=BBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2MGU5N2ZjMy01NzU5LTQxYWEtYTczYi02MzE3YmI5ODk1ODgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktNTY1MjMzNzgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImEzYWI4ODc3LWZjNjQtNDRhMS1iOGQzLTRmZThiNWRhNDg0ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUAia8fCu6wwoal7FZIeH1BqzQPuO3XO93sUy_QpK8RH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-56523378">grilled</a> by Congress in 2021 over its role in the spread of fake news, an issue which again, Perspectives seems poised to exacerbate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This shift toward potentially dubious sources seems to not simply be the result of trawling forums and tweets for a new glut of hits for search results, but a considered strategy away from legacy sources of information. The company claims Perspectives will coincide with changes in &quot;how we rank results in Search overall, with a greater focus on content with unique expertise and experience.&quot; Has anyone at Google been on a forum or social media website? Unique expertise is almost universally in short supply.&nbsp;</p><p>Perspectives launches &quot;in the coming weeks.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-searchs-new-perspectives-tab-will-highlight-forum-and-social-media-posts-175209372.html?src=rss

<p>Knowingly or unknowingly, Microsoft kicked off a race to integrate generative AI into search engines when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html">introduced Bing AI in February</a>. Google seemingly rushed into an announcement <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-unveils-its-chatgpt-rival-apprentice-bard-192055722.html">just a day before</a> Microsoft’s launch event, telling the world its generative AI chatbot would be called Bard. Since then, Google has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-opening-up-access-to-its-bard-ai-chatbot-today-140047434.html">opened up access to</a> its ChatGPT and Bing AI rival, but while Microsoft’s offering has been embedded into its search and browser products, Bard remains a separate chatbot.</p><p>That doesn’t mean Google hasn’t been busy with generative AI. It’s infused <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-shoving-generative-ai-into-gmail-docs-sheets-meet-chat-and-slides-161711903.html">basically</a> all of its products with the stuff, while leaving Search largely untouched. That is, until now. At its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/live-updates-from-google-io-2023-163201853.html">I/O 2023 keynote</a> today, the company unveiled the Search Generative Experience (SGE) as part of the new experimental Search Labs platform. Users can sign up to test new projects and SGE is one of three available at launch.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I checked out a demo of SGE during a briefing with Google’s vice president of Search and, while it has some obvious similarities to Bing AI, there are notable differences as well.</p><p>For one thing, SGE doesn’t look too different from your standard Google Search at first glance. The input bar is still the same (whereas Bing’s is larger and more like a compose box on Twitter). But the results page is where I first saw something new. Near the top of the page, just below the search bar but above all other results is a shaded section showing what the generative AI found. Google calls this the AI-powered snapshot containing “key information to consider, with links to dig deeper.”</p><p>At the top of this snapshot is a note reminding you that “Generative AI is experimental,” followed by answers to your question that SGE found from multiple sources online. On the top right is a button for you to expand the snapshot, as well as cards that show the articles from which the answers were drawn.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot showing Google's new Search Generative Experience page with results to a query about an e-bike." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/7825c070-eefd-11ed-bffd-3f7b3e7e5141" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>I asked Edwards to help me search for fun things to do in Frankfurt, Germany, as well as the best yoga poses for lower back pain. The typical search results showed up pretty much instantly, though the snapshot area showed a loading animation while the AI compiled its findings. After a few seconds, I saw a list of suggestions for the former, including Palmengarten and Romerburg. But when Edwards clicked the expand button, the snapshot opened up and revealed more questions that SGE thought might be relevant, along with answers. These included “is Frankfurt worth visiting” and “is three days enough to visit Frankfurt,” and the results for each included source articles.</p><p>My second question yielded more interesting findings. Not only did SGE show a list of suggested poses, expanding the answers brought up pictures in the source articles that gave a better idea of how to perform each one. Below the list was a suggestion to avoid yoga “if you have certain back problems, such as a spinal fracture or a herniated disc.” Further down in the snapshot, there was also a list of poses to avoid if you have lower back pain.</p><p>Importantly, the very bottom of the snapshot included a note saying “This is for informational purposes only. The information does not constitute medical advice or diagnosis.” Edwards said this is one of the safety features built into SGE, where the disclaimer shows up on sensitive topics that could affect a person’s health or financial decisions.</p><p>In addition, the snapshot doesn’t appear at all when Google’s algorithms detect that a query has to do with topics like self-harm, domestic violence or mental health crises. What you’ll see in those situations is the standard notice about how and where to get help.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot showing the SGE's snapshot reply, with individual items neatly listed in a chart." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/c1941f40-eefd-11ed-a5fd-2b17cdb60c10" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Based on my brief and limited preview, SGE seemed at once similar and different to Bing AI. When citing its sources, for example, SGE doesn’t show inline notations with footnotes linking to each article. Instead, it shows cards on the right or below each section, similar to how the cards on news results look.</p><p>Both Google and Microsoft’s layouts offer conversational views, with suggested follow-up prompts at the end of each response. But SGE doesn’t have an input bar at the bottom, and the search bar remains up top, outside of the snapshot. This makes it seem less like talking to a chatbot than Bing AI.</p><p>Google didn’t say it set out to build a conversational experience, though. It said “With new generative AI capabilities in Search, we’re now taking more of the work out of searching.” Instead of your having to do multiple searches to get at a specific answer or itinerary or process, you can just bundle your parameters into one query, like “What’s better for a family with kids under 3 and a dog, Bryce Canyon or Arches.”</p><p>The good news is that when you use the suggested responses in the snapshot, you can go into a new conversational mode. Here, “context will be carried over from question to question,” according to a press release. You’ll also be able to ask Google for help buying things online, and Edwards said the company sees 1.8 billion updates to its product listings every hour, helping keep information about supply and prices fresh and accurate. And since it’s Google after all, and Google relies heavily on ads to make money, SGE will also feature dedicated ad spaces throughout the page.</p><p>Google also said it would remain committed to making sure ads are distinguishable from organic search results. You can sign up to test the new SGE in Search Labs The experiment will be available to all in the coming weeks, starting in the US in English. Look for Labs Icon in the Google App or Chrome desktop and visit labs.google.com/search for more info.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-search-generative-experience-preview-a-familiar-yet-different-approach-175156245.html?src=rss

## Google’s Duet AI brings more generative features to Workspace apps

<p>After OpenAI’s ChatGPT caught the tech world off guard late last year, Google reportedly declared a “code red,” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chatgpt-ai-chatbot-search-170007802.html">scrambling to plan a response</a> to the new threat. The first fruit of that reorientation trickled out earlier this year with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html">Bard chatbot</a> and some generative AI features <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-shoving-generative-ai-into-gmail-docs-sheets-meet-chat-and-slides-161711903.html">baked into Google Workspace</a> apps. Today at Google I/O 2023, we finally see a more fleshed-out picture of how the company views AI’s role in its cloud-based productivity suite. Google Duet AI is the company’s branding for its collection of AI tools across Workspace apps.</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-365-copilot-uses-ai-to-automate-everyday-tasks-in-multiple-apps-151133434.html">Microsoft Copilot</a> for Office apps, Duet AI is an umbrella term for a growing list of generative AI features across Google Workspace apps. (The industry seems to have settled on marketing language depicting generative AI as your workplace ally.) First, the Gmail mobile app will now draft full replies to your emails based on a prompt in a new “Help me write” feature. In addition, the mobile Gmail app will soon add contextual assistance, “allowing you to create professional replies that automatically fill in names and other relevant information.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Screenshot of Google Slides, showing the Duet AI helper." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/abc0cf10-ef52-11ed-8dbe-f4f6e95715a4" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Duet AI also makes an appearance in Google Slides. Here, it takes the form of image generation for your presentations. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/midjourney-ends-free-trials-of-its-ai-image-generator-due-to-extraordinary-abuse-153853905.html">Midjourney</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/open-a-is-dall-e-2-produces-fantastical-images-of-most-anything-you-can-imagine-170056814.html">DALL-E 2</a>, Duet AI can now turn simple text prompts (entered into the Duet AI “Sidekick” side panel) into AI-generated images to enhance Slides presentations. It could help save you the trouble of scouring the internet for the right slide image while spicing them up with something original.</p><p>In Google Sheets, Duet AI can understand the context of a cell’s data and label it accordingly. The spreadsheet app also adds a new “help me organize” feature to create custom plans: describe what you want to do in plain language, and Duet AI will outline strategies and steps to accomplish it. “Whether you’re an event team planning an annual sales conference or a manager coordinating a team offsite, Duet AI helps you create organized plans with tools that give you a running start,” the company said.</p><figure><img alt="Presentation of Duets AI in Docs" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/96716dd0-ef58-11ed-abf7-00f97d7df1f2" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, Duet AI in Google Meet can generate custom background images for video calls with a text prompt. Google says the feature can help users “express themselves and deepen connections during video calls while protecting the privacy of their surroundings.” Like the Slides image generation, Duet’s Google Meet integration could be a shortcut to save you from searching for an image that conveys the right ambiance for your meeting (while hiding any unwanted objects or bystanders behind you).</p><p>Duet also adds an “assisted writing experience” in Google Docs’ <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-smart-canvas-productivity-app-172323639.html">smart canvas</a>. Entering a prompt describing what you want to write about will generate a Docs draft. The feature also works in Docs’ smart chips (automatic suggestions and info about things like documents and people mentioned in a project). Additionally, Google is upgrading Docs’ built-in Grammarly-style tools. A new proofread suggestion pane will offer tips about concise writing, avoiding repetition and using a more formal or active voice. The company adds that you can easily toggle the feature when you don’t want it to nag you about grammar.</p><p>Initially, you’ll have to sign up for a waitlist to try the new Duet AI Workspace features. Google says you can <a href="https://workspace.google.com/solutions/ai/">enter your info here</a> to be notified as it opens the generative AI features to more users and regions “in the weeks ahead.”</p><figure><img alt="Thomas Kurian at Google I/O revealing Duet AI for Google Cloud" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ce088d10-ef5c-11ed-bfff-68749750af55" style="height: 3240px; width: 5760px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Duet AI also adds a set of machine learning-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-17-google-unveils-automl-ai-training-tool.html">Google Cloud</a> developer tools. It can provide real-time code assistance and recommend generated code blocks while pointing out errors. The feature supports Go, Java, Javascript, Python and SQL. Meanwhile, Duet AI’s chat assistance is a chatbot to answer your coding and Google Cloud questions. Finally, Google Vertex is adding new foundation models for AI developers to play with: Codey, Imagen and Chirp.</p><p>The company announced new foundation models for developers and data scientists. These include Codey, which can speed up development with real-time code completion and generation and supports over 20 programming languages. Second, Imagen is the company’s image generator, including upscaling, mask-free editing and automatic captioning in more than 300 languages. Finally, Chirp offers real-time speech translation (based on a two-billion-parameter speech model). Google says it “helps organizations engage with customers and constituents more inclusively in their native languages.” Examples include using it for call center agents and captioning videos. “Chirp achieves 98% accuracy on English and relative improvement of up to 300% in languages with less than 10 million speakers,” the company said.</p><figure><img alt="Google example of coding with Duet AI" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/3305d6c0-ef56-11ed-bfbb-89507f6d279e" style="height: 1168px; width: 1758px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Also folded into the Cloud AI announcements is the Embeddings API for text and images. It can help developers build “powerful semantic search and text classification.” The company says, “Embeddings convert text and image data into multi-dimensional numerical vectors that map semantic relationships and can be processed by large models and are particularly useful for longer inputs, such as texts with thousands of tokens.” Embeddings API is available now for devs in Vertex AI, with the text version in preview; only trusted testers can use the text / image API.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.

## Google Bard transitions to PaLM 2 and expands to 180 countries

<p>For the past two months, anybody wanting to try out Google's new chatbot AI, Bard, had to first register their interest and join a waitlist before being granted access. On Wednesday, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-bard-updates-io-2023/">the company announced</a> that those days are over. Bard will immediately be dropping the waitlist requirement as it expands to 180 additional countries and territories. What's more, this expanded Bard will be built atop Google's newest Large Language Model, PaLM 2, making it more capable than ever before.</p><p>Google hurriedly released the first generation Bard back in February after OpenAI's ChatGPT came out of nowhere and began eating the industry's collective lunch like Gulliver in a Lilliputian cafeteria. Matters were made worse when Bard's initial performances <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.htmlhttps://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html">proved less than impressive</a> — especially given Google's generally-accepted status at the forefront of AI development — which hurt both Google's public image <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/">and its bottom line</a>. In the intervening months, the company has worked to further develop PaLM, the language model that essentially powers Bard, allowing it to produce better quality and higher fidelity responses, as well as perform new tasks like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-gives-bard-the-ability-to-generate-and-debug-code-130024663.html">generating programming code</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As Google executives announced at I/O on Wednesday, Bard has been switched over to then new PaLM 2 platform. As such, users can expect a bevy of new features and functions to roll out in the coming days and weeks. Features like a higher degree of visual responses to your queries, so when you ask for &quot;must see sights&quot; in New Orleans, you'll be presented with images of the sites you'd see, more than just a bullet list or text-based description. Conversely, users will be able to more easily input images to Bard alongside their written queries, bringing Google Lens capabilities to Bard.</p><p>Even as Google mixes and matches AI capabilities amongst its products — 25 new offerings running on PaLM 2 are being announced today alone —  the company is looking to ally with other industry leaders to further augment Bard's abilities. Google announced on Wednesday that it is partnering with Adobe to bring its Firefly generative AI to Bard as a means to counter Microsoft's BingChat-DallE2 offering.</p><p>Finally, Google shared news that it will be implementing a number of changes and updates in response to feedback received from the community since launch. Clicking on a line of generated code or chatbot answer and Bard will provide a link to that specific bit's source. Additionally, the company is working to add a export ability so users can easily run generated programming code on Replit or toss their generated works into Docs or Gmail. There will even be a new Dark theme.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-transitions-to-palm-2-and-expands-to-180-countries-172908926.html?src=rss

## Google is incorporating Adobe's Firefly AI image generator into Bard

<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-is-bringing-generative-ai-features-to-photoshop-after-effects-and-premiere-pro-130034491.html">Adobe announced</a> that it too would be jumping into the generative AI pool alongside the likes of Google, Meta, Microsoft and other tech industry heavyweights with the release of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-fireflys-new-ai-tools-aim-to-cut-down-drudge-work-for-editors-130005412.html">Adobe Firefly</a>, a suite of AI features. Available across Adobe's product lineup including Photoshop, After Effects and Premiere Pro, Firefly is designed to eliminate much of the drudge work associated with modern photo and video editing. On Wednesday, Adobe and Google jointly announced during the 2023 I/O event that both Firefly and the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7247b01c-2a32-4141-aac1-4e4bb8170ec0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Rite+Aid&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MjQ3YjAxYy0yYTMyLTQxNDEtYWFjMS00ZTRiYjgxNzBlYzAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvYmUuY29tL2V4cHJlc3MvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1NzhiMTFiNC03MjRlLTQ0YzctOTQ1NS0xZWExNTA1NmVkY2EifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb4xrsggOJ0HN9-rFxFUt65pp1Tjt-rHYVn9483Czra9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fexpress%2F">Express graphics suite</a> will soon be incorporated into Bard, allowing users to generate, edit and share AI images directly from the chatbot's command line.</p><p>Per a release from the company, users will be able to generate an image with Firefly, then edit and modify it using Adobe Express assets, fonts and templates within the Bard platform directly — even post to social media once it's ready. Those generated images will reportedly be of the same high quality that Firefly beta users are already accustomed to as they are all being created from the same database of Adobe Stock images, openly licensed and public domain content.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, Google and Adobe will leverage the latter's existing Content Authenticity Initiative to mitigate some of the threats to creators that generative AI poses. This includes a "do not train" list which will preclude a piece of art's inclusion in Firefly's training data as well as persistent tags that will tell future viewers whether or not a work was generated and what model was used to make it. Bard users can expect to see the new features begin rolling out in the coming weeks ahead of a wide-scale release.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-is-incorporating-adobes-firefly-ai-image-generator-into-bard-174525371.html?src=rss

<p>Google is stuffing generative AI into seemingly all its products, and that now includes the photo app on your phone. The company has previewed an &quot;experimental&quot; Magic Editor tool in Google Photos that can not only fix photos, but outright change them to create the shot you wanted all along. You can move and resize subjects, stretch objects (such as the bench above), remove an unwanted bag strap or even replace an overcast sky with a sunnier version.</p><p>Magic Editor will be available in early form to &quot;select&quot; Pixel phones later this year, Google says. The tech giant warns that output might be flawed, and that it will use feedback to improve the technology.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google is no stranger to AI-based image editing. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/magic-eraser-is-coming-to-older-pixel-phones-and-google-one-starting-today-170019112.html">Magic Eraser</a> already lets you remove unwanted subjects, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html">Photo Unblur</a> resharpens jittery pictures. Magic Editor, however, takes things a step further. The technology adds content that was never there, and effectively lets you retake snapshots that were less-than-perfectly composed. You can manipulate shots with editors like Adobe's Photoshop, of course, but this is both easier and included in your phone's photo management app.</p><p>The addition may be helpful for salvaging photos that would otherwise be unusable. However, it also adds to the list of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tech-leaders-and-ai-experts-demand-a-six-month-pause-on-out-of-control-ai-experiments-114553864.html">ethical questions surrounding generative AI</a>. Google Photos' experiment will make it relatively simple to present a version of events that never existed. It may be that much harder to trust someone's social media snaps, even though they're not entirely fake.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-will-use-generative-ai-to-straight-up-change-your-images-171014939.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-maps/">Google Maps</a> is expanding the Immersive View format it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-adds-immersive-view-of-major-cities-172303086.html">revealed last year</a> to an important part of the app: routes. When you look for directions in Google Maps on iOS and Android in select cities, you'll see a more detailed view of the route.</p><p>The feature isn't just about making your journey look nicer than a bold line tracing the steps from point A to B (and maybe C). The idea is to bring all of the key information that you may need about the trip into a single place. You'll see details on traffic, weather, air quality, bike lanes and where to find nearby parking.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you're planning a journey ahead of time and the weather is expected to be foggy or rainy, you'll see that in the visualization. Google is also using a blend of AI, real-time data and long-term trends to give you a sense of how busy traffic might be by displaying a certain number of vehicles on the virtual roads.</p><div id="1d747eb5350149048e262b95374bdfc2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">From Street View ➡️ New Immersive View for routes in <a href="https://twitter.com/googlemaps?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GoogleMaps</a> 🧵↓<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleIO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GoogleIO</a><a href="https://t.co/CMdR697hwm">pic.twitter.com/CMdR697hwm</a></p>— Google (@Google) <a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1656345182629920789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/">Google I/O</a>, Miriam Daniel, Vice President of Google Maps Experiences, told Engadget that the team was focusing on the above-ground parts of the journey for now. So, don't expect the visualizations to include your subway trips quite yet. Still, given that Google Maps users look up around 20 billion kilometers' worth of directions per day, Immersive View for Routes could come in handy for many folks.</p><p>Google plans to roll out Immersive View for Routes in 15 cities by the end of the year. In the coming months, you'll be able to check it out in Amsterdam, Berlin, Dublin, Florence, Las Vegas, London, Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Paris, Seattle, San Francisco, San Jose, Tokyo and Venice.</p><p>Immersive View uses AI and computer vision to blend together billions of aerial and Street View images to create 3D models of spaces. Google announced the feature at I/O last year and started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-immersive-view-glancable-directions-170504886.html">rolling it out more broadly in February</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google has some Maps-related updates for developers (I/O is the company's annual developer conference, after all). The Google Maps Platform is offering a preview of an Aerial View API for locations in the US starting today. Developers can use this to add &quot;a pre-packaged, birds-eye view video&quot; of a location to their apps or websites. Some of Google's partners are testing out the API, including Rent, which is using it to offer potential renters a more expansive look at a property and the surrounding area. That could give folks a clearer idea of the location where they may end up living before they visit an apartment in person.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google is adding Photorealistic 3D Tiles to the Map Tiles API on an experimental basis starting today. This grants developers access to the high-resolution 3D imagery that powers Google Earth. It could make it easier for folks to create their own 3D maps. Google suggests that a tourism company might use the tiles to build interactive maps for guided tours or to show off the most striking features of a national park.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Google I/O 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-io-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-is-expanding-immersive-view-to-routes-170618016.html?src=rss

<p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, the long-awaited sequel to 2017’s indie blockbuster <em>Hollow Knight</em>, has been delayed, as announced by <a href="https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680"><ins>Team Cherry developer Matthew Griffin on Twitter</ins></a><ins>.</ins> The sidescrolling metroidvania platformer was scheduled for release in the first half of 2023, but, well, it’s May, so that isn’t happening.

<p>Google is hosting its first full-on in-person I/O developer conference since the pandemic and we expect the company to announce a biblical amount of news at breakneck pace. Engadget is here at the show and will bring you a liveblog of what's happening at the keynote as it happens. The show kicks off at 1pm ET today and we'll be starting our commentary as early as noon.

<p>It’s Google I/O time, which means the company is about to host a keynote that will likely be packed with announcements and updates.

## Arturia's MicroFreak gets sample playback, granular synthesis and gorgeous Stellar edition

<p>I routinely state that the Arturia MicroFreak is one of my favorite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-beginners-guide-to-buying-a-first-synth-synthesizer.html">budget synths</a>. But honestly, I’m doing it a disservice. I think the MicroFreak is one of the best synths out there at any price. That has as much to do with the versatility of its sound engine as it does with Arturia’s relentless updates. Since being introduced in 2019 this little synth has seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-microfreak-v3-firmware-three-new-oscillators-noise-engineering-synthesizer-184459017.html">countless updates</a>, most of them adding fairly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-microfreak-vocoder-synthesizer-limited-edition-220640296.html">significant new features</a>.</p><p>The forthcoming update to firmware version 5.0 is arguably one of the biggest. It adds a sample playback engine and three different granular engines. That brings the total number of synth engines on the MicroFreak to a frankly absurd 22. Sure, not all of the engines are as usable as the others, and some are relatively similar to each other.

The total number of preset slots on the MicroFreak will expand to 512, and there will be two new modulation options added to the utility menu – random per-key and snap.</p><p>Since the MicroFreak had a wavetable engine to start, and in 2021 Arturia added support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-custom-wavetables-micro-freak-synthesizer-4-0-update-162124618.html">custom user wavetables</a>, sample playback should be simple enough since the wavetables are just .wav files. And if there’s sample playback and wavetable support, then granular isn’t too much of a stretch since that’s just chopping up a .wav file and playing it back in little rearranged bits. Still, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1010-music-lemondrop-and-fireball-nanobox-synthesizer-review-130035502.html">granular synthesis</a> is pretty hard to come by in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bastl-microgranny-monolith-review-vintage-sampling-grit-in-a-portable-package-133044781.html">hardware instrument</a> so it’s worth celebrating here. (Side note: I would expect to see more in the near future as granular seems to be gaining popularity and processors are powerful enough now to make building them trivial.)</p><figure><img alt="New Sample engine in Arturia MicroFreak V5" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/438028c1-ef2e-11ed-8fdf-117cf69c7c28" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The sample engine is relatively rudimentary. You can change the start and end point and set a loop point, but that’s it. There’s no time stretching or anything (that I’m aware of), pitch changes are achieved simply by speeding up and slowing down playback. But there’s something about the way that is handled on the MicroFreak that sounds incredible. It’s got an almost late ‘70s, early ‘80s digital vibe that speaks to my love of grit. And many of the included samples at least remain usable over a wide number of octaves. In fact, I’d say that at the lower extreme’s they’re not just usable, but fantastic sounding – especially that PGTS Keys sample. And then, obviously, you’ve got the rest of the synth at your disposal to add filtering and modulation.</p><p>One trick I quickly fell in love with was using the new per-key random setting to slightly alter the pitch. Combining that with the lo-fi piano sample gets you something that’s never quite in tune, but never so far out that it sounds bad. It does require some minor menu diving, but it’s worth it. And then the key/arp row in the mod matrix becomes another source of randomization. And honestly, I didn’t really think I needed <em>more</em> randomization on a synth that has both sample-and-hold and random options for the LFO, plus the Spice and Dice parameters for injecting chaos into your arps and sequences, but here we are.</p><p>I assume that instead of one granular engine, it’s broken down into three separate engines in part because of the limited controls on the front. Scan plays a sample from start to finish (mostly), but it allows you to control the speed at which the grain moves through the file so you can get really lo-fi time stretching effects. But if you modulate the speed at which it scans and set the density (number of grains) reasonably low and the chaos reasonably high, you get this sort of warped vinyl tremolo sound. I especially love the way it sounds on the Braam brass sample. The biggest con here is that samples won’t loop in the scan engine, so you can't get good drones out of it.</p><figure><img alt="Slow Amen patch on Arturia MicroFreak V5" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/43804fd1-ef2e-11ed-bff2-6b7d3bf5186a" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Cloud, on the other hand, is <em>built</em> for drones. It plays back multiple overlapping grains, looping around the file to create alien textures perfect for scoring a retro sci-fi point and click adventure. This is the sort of thing that people immediately associate with granular synthesis. It has a strange character that can’t be mistaken for anything else.</p><p>Lastly, the Hit engine is all about percussion. This is where you go to create clicky sound effects and stuttering glitchy rhythm tracks, even if the source material isn’t a drum sample. In fact, I’d say the results are often more interesting when working with what was originally a melodic sample. Though, I won’t pretend it’s not loads of fun to pop an 808 kick in there and just let it create relentless, skull-crushing avalanches of bass.</p><figure><img alt="Cloud Grains engine in Arturia MicroFreak V5" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/438028c0-ef2e-11ed-bb1f-c57b09a07223" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s rare to see a company continue to add this many features to a product years after its release. Whether we’re talking about a synth, a phone or a camera. But Arturia deserves credit (Novation too, just for the record) for continuing to devote time and resources to even its entry level products. Perhaps the most shocking thing about the MicroFreak 5.0 update is that we haven’t seen its big brother, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-minifreak-digital-synth-review-weird-161551334.html">MiniFreak</a>, receive a single significant update. Despite costing nearly twice the price, it now has six fewer synth engine options, at least by my count.</p><p>While you wait for the free update to drop on May 30th, take a few moments to ogle the new <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/hardware-synths/microfreak-stellar/overview">MicroFreak Stellar</a> limited edition pictured at the top of this post. It swaps the original's birds and floral flourishes for a space themed design and swaps out the white keys for a monochromatic all black deck. The MicroFreak Stellar is available now for $399.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/arturias-microfreak-gets-sample-playback-granular-synthesis-and-gorgeous-stellar-edition-150008075.html?src=rss

## Nikon's Z8 mirrorless camera offers 8K60p RAW video and 20fps burst speeds

<p>Nikon has announced the <a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/mirrorless-cameras/z-8.html">45.7-megapixel Z8</a>, a powerful full-frame mirrorless camera with up to 8K60p RAW video, 20fps RAW burst speeds and more. It's effectively a slimmed-down version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z-9-mirrorless-camera-review-143006924.html">Nikon's Z9</a>, and shares the latter's stacked, backside-illuminated (BSI) sensor and complete lack of a mechanical shutter. The main thing the Z8 lacks next to the Z9 is unlimited video recording, but it's also $1,500 cheaper.</p><p>Nikon is best known for photography, but the Z8's headline feature is the 8K60p N-RAW video. There's an interesting story there, as the cinema camera company RED has used its patents to stop other camera companies from using RAW video in the past. However, RED's lawsuit against Nikon was <a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/04/27/reds-lawsuit-against-nikon-dismissed-z9-gets-to-keep-compressed-raw/#:~:text=RED's%20lawsuit%20against%20Nikon%20for,video%20recording%20in%20its%20cameras.">dismissed late last month</a>, allowing Nikon to use N-RAW (a compressed 12-bit RAW codec developed in conjunction with a company called intoPIX) in any of its cameras. It can also capture 12-bit ProRes RAW video.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Nikon's Z8 mirrorless camera offers 8K60p RAW video and 20fps burst speeds" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/949ec1c0-ef39-11ed-bf7c-250cfbd0debb" style="height: 1600px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>Along with 8K60p, the Z8 supports 4K capture at up to 120fps and 10-bit ProRes, H.264 and H.265 formats. It also offers exposure tools like waveforms, customizable autofocus and more. As mentioned, the smaller body means it can't record all video formats for an unlimited time like the Z9. Rather, you're limited to 90 minutes for 8K30p and two hours for 4K60p without overheating. With the stacked sensor, rolling shutter should be very well controlled, just like on the Z9.</p><p>In terms of photography, the Z9's burst speeds aren't restrained by a mechanical shutter, because there isn't one. As such, you can capture 14-bit RAW+JPEG images at up to 20 fps, mighty impressive for such a high-resolution camera. It comes with settings designed for portrait photographers like skin softening and human-friendly white balance.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Nikon's Z8 mirrorless camera offers 8K60p RAW video and 20fps burst speeds" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ac3b5fa0-ef39-11ed-95fd-5fe6829b0312" style="height: 1909px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>It offers face, eye, vehicle and animal detection autofocus, promising AF speeds at the same level as the (excellent) Z9. It can recognize nine types of subjects automatically, including eyes, faces, heads and upper bodies for both animals and people, along with vehicles and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The Z8's magnesium-allow body may be smaller than the Z9, but it's equally as dust- and weather-resistant. It's also much the same in terms of controls, with a generous array of dials and buttons to change settings. Battery life is good at 700 shots max (CIPA) and two-plus hours of 4K video shooting, but if you need more, you can get the optional MB-N12 battery grip ($350).&nbsp;</p><div id="33c4937e2feb4b26b2096dbbf7c80cef"></div><p>Other features include 6.0 stops of in-body stabilization with compatible lenses, which is good but not as good as recent Sony, Canon and Panasonic models. The electronic viewfinder (EVF) has a relatively low 3.69 million dots of resolution, but also very low lag and a high 120Hz refresh rate. Unfortunately, the 3.2-inch, 2,100K dot rear display only tilts up and doesn't flip out, so the camera won't be suitable for many vloggers — a poor decision on Nikon's part, in my opinion.&nbsp;</p><p>It has one SD UHS-II and one CFexpress card slot that supports speeds up to 1,500 MB/s required for internal 8K RAW recording. That differs from the Z9, which has two CFexpress card slots. On top of the usual USB-C charging port, it has a super-speed USB communication terminal for rapid data transfers. It also comes with a full-sized HDMI connector for external video recording and monitoring, along with 3.5mm headphone and microphone parts.&nbsp;</p><p>The Nikon Z8 goes on sale on May 25th, 2023 for $4,000. That's $1,500 less than the $5,500 Z9, $2,500 less than the Sony A1 and $700 more than Canon's R5 — with far less serious overheating issues.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Nikon Z8 full-frame mirrorless camera" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/0130f240-ef3a-11ed-bff9-c91b73160bc5" style="height: 2400px; width: 2070px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nikons-z8-mirrorless-camera-offers-8k60p-raw-video-and-20fps-burst-speeds-141556946.html?src=rss

## Vast and SpaceX plan to launch the first commercial space station in 2025

<p>Another company is racing to launch the first commercial space station. Vast is partnering with SpaceX to <a href="https://www.vastspace.com/updates/vast-announces-the-haven-1-and-vast-1-human-spaceflight-mission-launched-by-spacex-on-a-dragon-spacecraft">launch</a> its Haven-1 station as soon as August 2025. A Falcon 9 rocket will carry the platform to low Earth orbit, with a follow-up Vast-1 mission using Crew Dragon to bring four people to Haven-1 for up to 30 days. Vast is taking bookings for crew aiming to participate in scientific or philanthropic work. The company has the option of a second crewed SpaceX mission.</p><p>Haven-1 is relatively small. It isn't much larger than SpaceX's capsule, and is mainly intended for science and small-scale orbital manufacturing for the four people who dock. Vast hopes to make Haven-1 just one module in a larger station, though, and it can simulate the Moon's gravity by spinning.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ad17ea1967f041a9af1d2aa6f88b1ff7"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>As <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/10/vast-and-spacex-aim-to-put-the-first-commercial-space-station-in-orbit-in-2025/?guccounter=1">notes</a>, the 2025 target is ambitious and might see Vast beat well-known rivals to deploying a private space station. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin doesn't expect to launch its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/orbital-reef-200848765.html">Orbital Reef </a>until the second half of the decade.

Axiom stands the best chance of upstaging Vast with a planned late 2025 liftoff.</p><p>There's no guarantee any of these timelines will hold given the challenges and costs of building an orbital habitat — this has to be a safe vehicle that comfortably supports humans for extended periods, not just the duration of a rocket launch. However, this suggests that stations represent the next major phase of private spaceflight after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-dennis-tito-moon-space-tourist-161528381.html">tourism</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacexs-starship-will-carry-an-suv-sized-rover-to-the-moon-in-2026-213926510.html">lunar missions</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/vast-and-spacex-plan-to-launch-the-first-commercial-space-station-in-2025-134256156.html?src=rss

## The best self-care gifts for graduates

<p>Graduates have spent the past couple of years <em>hustling</em>. Between coursework, jobs, family responsibilities and, of course, the pandemic, they likely haven't had a ton of time to devote to themselves. Now that they've donned their cap and gown, it's time for them to enjoy some well deserved rest and relaxation. If you want to get the grad in your life a treat that can help them do that, we at Engadget have some ideas based on how we like to treat ourselves when we need a break.</p><h2>Theragun Mini</h2><p></p><p>With many gyms and exercise facilities still closed, you might be dabbling in some workouts from home alongside working from home. You might also have overextended yourself, leading to tender shoulders, thighs and calves. I may have done just that (several times over) but have been able to ease some of the soreness — or at least make myself feel better — with my trusty <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UaGVyYWd1bi1NaW5pLTItMC1QZXJjdXNzaW9uLUF0dGFjaG1lbnRzL2RwL0IwQjZSVlFRRzM_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8teGUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViMjE5ZTcxLWE2OGQtNGViMS1iYzlmLWFkMDg1MjFhNmU4OCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcuxEFtREvj3SYtwdz-dQFRdwkw2VZWf2_uQr3SRRqkG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTheragun-Mini-2-0-Percussion-Attachments%2Fdp%2FB0B6RVQQG3%3F">Theragun Mini</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We’ve already covered Theragun’s flagship percussive therapy “gun,” the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UaGVyYWd1bi1FbGl0ZS1HZW5lcmF0aW9uLVBlcmN1c3NpdmUtVHJlYXRtZW50L2RwL0IwODZaNlhTVzQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8teGUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViMjE5ZTcxLWE2OGQtNGViMS1iYzlmLWFkMDg1MjFhNmU4OCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXRvPIAeJV8GoAspUSgQpc4Dry_KUOx21j1_ipidKHFq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTheragun-Elite-Generation-Percussive-Treatment%2Fdp%2FB086Z6XSW4">Elite</a>, but you might find the Theragun Mini does almost as much for far less. It’s also less bulky. The $200 gun is a solid triangle but is small enough to grasp with a single hand, directing the vibrations to that one part of your hammies that needs some TLC. There are three speed settings, and the Mini benefits from Theragun’s quieter motors so it doesn’t sound like you’re drilling a shelf to anyone nearby. It’s definitely not <em>quiet</em>, but you can still hear the TV or hold a conversation over the massaging.</p><p>If you’re looking to upgrade, Theragun also offers a peripheral that doubles the number of heads on any of its massage guns. The Duo Adapter offers a wider spread, meaning it feels like it takes me less time to hammer out the aches.

It not only cut the chill in our bedroom, a space that often feels 10 degrees colder than other areas of the apartment, but it made the room enjoyable to be in even on the coldest days. And on the weekends when my partner and I parked ourselves in our living room, it was easy to pick up the Dyson and tote it to where we were. The remote control is super handy, too, letting us adjust the temperature, oscillation and timer functions without getting up from the couch. While you can't find the AM09 now, Dyson has upgraded most of its Hot &amp; Cool fans to also be air purifiers, so you'll essentially get a 3-in-1 device. <em>— V.P.</em></p><h2>MoonPod</h2><p></p><p>As a self-care gift for your grad, consider getting them a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb29ucG9kLmNvLz8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImViMjE5ZTcxLWE2OGQtNGViMS1iYzlmLWFkMDg1MjFhNmU4OCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeD97hdsfKqpB92mtzz5cOJNFzlPxY3og5i2DZqNytRc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.moonpod.co%2F%3F">MoonPod</a>.

VanMoof co-founder Ties Carlier said in a press release this was an attempt at a “more simple, more accessible and more reliable” e-bike. One major simplification is the transition to adaptive motor support and a two-speed gear hub. The SX5 series had a three-speed gear system, and while it had a torque sensor to assist, adaptive motor support is new for these cheaper e-bikes. The company expects the range to be equivalent to both the SA5 and older SX3 e-bikes, 37-62 miles (60-150 km), depending on conditions and rider.

<p>Joseph James O'Connor has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/uk-citizen-extradited-and-pleads-guilty-cyber-crime-offenses">pleaded guilty</a> to playing a role in various cybercrime activities, including the July 2020 hack that took over hundreds of high-profile Twitter accounts. O'Connor, who's known by the name <em>PlugwalkJoe</em> online, was originally from Liverpool, but he was extradited from Spain to the US in April. If you'll recall, the perpetrators of the 2020 Twitter hack hijacked accounts owned by popular personalities, including Bill Gates, Barack Obama and Elon Musk, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crypto-scammers-hack-elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-204011058.html">promoted crypto scams</a> under their names.

He allegedly purchased access to at least one Twitter account himself for $10,000. In addition, he was also apparently involved in the hack of a TikTok account with millions of followers, as well as a Snapchat account, via SIM swapping. In both cases, O'Connor and his co-conspirators stole sensitive personal information from the victims and then threatened to release them to the public. While the DOJ didn't identify victims in those cases, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/10/twitter-hack-uk-man-pleads-guilty-to-hijacking-accounts-including-of-joe-biden-and-elon-musk"><em>The Guardian</em></a> says they were named in press reports as TikTok star Addison Rae and actor Bella Thorne.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>From March 2019 until May 2019, O'Connor was also allegedly involved in the infiltration of a Manhattan-based crypto company to steal $794,000 worth of cryptocurrency. They used SIM swapping to target three of the company's executives and successfully pulled it off with one of them. Using the compromised executive's credentials, they were able to gain unauthorized access to the company's accounts and computer systems. They then laundered the stolen cryptocurrency by transferring them multiple times and using crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p><p>O'Connor has pleaded guilty to a lengthy list of charges, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, both of which carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. He is now scheduled for sentencing on June 23rd.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/uk-citizen-pleads-guilty-to-2020-twitter-hack-and-other-cybercrimes-102634567.html?src=rss

<p>Uber has started offering domestic and international flight bookings in the UK and will continue rolling it out across the whole region over the coming weeks, according to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0acdb9bd-2ec9-4050-891a-e5d6b60d1d94"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. The company's general manager for the UK, Andrew Brem, told the publication that this is "the latest and most ambitious step" it has taken to achieve its goal to become a wider travel booking platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Uber first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-plans-to-add-trains-coaches-and-flight-bookings-to-its-app-in-the-uk-120521257.html">revealed</a> its plans to add train, bus and flight bookings to its UK app in April last year and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-tests-train-and-bus-bookings-in-the-uk-omio-091509352.html">launched</a> the first two options a few months later. Brem said train bookings have been "incredibly popular" so far and have grown 40 percent every month since they became available, though he didn't give the <em>Times</em> concrete ticket sales numbers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For its flights, the company has teamed up with travel booking agency Hopper. The <em>Times</em> says Uber will take a small commission from each sale and could add a booking fee on top of its offerings in the future. It's unclear how much the company's cut actually is, but it charges its partner drivers <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2cd8d8eb-701c-4377-94c5-920a8345ffac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Uber&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyY2Q4ZDhlYi03MDFjLTQzNzctOTRjNS05MjBhODM0NWZmYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudWJlci5jb20vZ2gvZW4vZHJpdmUvYmFzaWNzL3RyYWNraW5nLXlvdXItZWFybmluZ3MvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkYzg4NTVlYS03ZDQ1LTQ4NDYtOGRlZC0xMjhlNjk3MjA5NzUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbGrXf_WRWP9pCW-c9vtptznEqzUr0pmtF0BxL0w4S4u&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fgh%2Fen%2Fdrive%2Fbasics%2Ftracking-your-earnings%2F">25 percent</a> on all fares. As the <em>Times</em> notes, offering flight bookings could also help grow Uber's main ride-hailing business even further, since users are likely to book rides <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-expands-airport-reservation-service-globally-100029895.html">to and from the airport</a> through the service, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Although flight bookings are only available in the UK at the moment, the region — one of its biggest markets outside North America — only serves as a testing ground for Uber's plans. Brem told the publication that the company is hoping to expand flight offerings to more countries in the future, but it has no solid plans yet. Uber did offer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-06-uber-helicopter-nyc.html">$200 chopper rides</a> in the US back in 2019, but that service was discontinued in the midst of pandemic-related lockdowns.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/uber-starts-offering-flight-bookings-in-the-uk-074558236.html?src=rss

## MediaTek's newest Dimensity chip is built for gaming phones

<p>MediaTek has a simple answer to Qualcomm's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomms-snapdragon-8-gen-2-chip-offers-hardware-accelerated-ray-tracing-230008445.html">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> you see in many gaming phones: deliver an uprated version of last year's high-end hardware. <a href="https://i.mediatek.com/mediatek-5g">The brand</a> has unveiled a Dimensity 9200+ system-on-chip with improvements that will be particularly noticeable with games. You'll find higher clock speeds for the main Cortex-X3 core (up from 3.05GHz to 3.35GHz), three Cortex-A715 cores (from 2.85GHz to 3GHz) and four Cortex-A510 efficiency cores (1.8GHz to 2GHz). More importantly, the company says it has &quot;boosted&quot; the Immortalis-G715 graphics by 17 percent — games that were borderline playable before should be smoother.</p><p>The Dimensity 9200+ is built using TSMC's newest 4-nanometer process, potentially extending battery life and allowing for cooler, slimmer phones. The WiFi 7 support, AI processing unit and image signal processor are unchanged, although there's not much room to complain. WiFi 7 still isn't a finished standard, for example, and routers that support it are still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netgears-first-wifi-7-router-offers-extra-low-latency-for-gaming-123037814.html">extremely rare</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You won't have to wait long to see the first phones based on this chip. MediaTek expects the first Dimensity 9200+ phones to launch later this month, although it hasn't named customers as of this writing. The question is whether or not this refresh is enough. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 has only a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-mediatek-dimensity-9200/">slight edge</a> over the regular 9200, so a higher-clocked 9200+ might emerge victorious. However, Qualcomm doesn't usually sit still — it likes to ship <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-120047819.html">mid-cycle upgrades</a> of its own.</p><p>Nonetheless, this may be an important release if you're a mobile gamer. This gives Qualcomm fresh competition in the Android gaming world. That, in turn, could lead to both more variety in phones as well as more aggressive pricing.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mediateks-newest-dimensity-chip-is-built-for-gaming-phones-070007357.html?src=rss
