This week on Breakout, we discuss "console wars" and how they've been over for a long time now and people just haven't seemed to realize it yet.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
