When we have multiple ships built along similar designs, it's
customary to refer to them by the initial example of the design.  For
example, the last American battleships are called </span>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa-class_battleship">Iowa-class</a>,
after their 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_ship">lead
ship</a> the 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Iowa_(BB-61)">Iowa</a>.  Until
recently, Nora (22m) used this in naming people.  This included,
at various times:



<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li>"Mama"-class: parents.  Julia, me.

</li>
<li>"Anna"-class: siblings, or maybe children.  Most commonly Anna and
Lily.

</li>
<li>"Weiwei"-class: housemates.  Most commonly Weiwei and
Andrew.

</li>
<li>[Not Nora but Lily] "Ella"-class: cats.  Most commonly our cat at
the time, Ella.

</li>
</ul>



<p>

Lily really didn't like being called "Anna".  Possibly Lily would have
minded less if I'd been able to teach Nora to say "Anna-class", but I
doubt it: the real hurt was not being the class exemplar.  Nora also
had a period when she would correct us: whenever anyone said "Lily"
she would firmly say "Anna!"

</p>

<p>

This system makes a lot of sense when you consider how few words she
had to work with.  Much better to allocate just one of your ~10 words
to siblings, and you don't hear the word general word (ex: "sibling")
enough for that to be the word you use.

(The post's title would be confusing, except that we've had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">Classless
Inter-Domain Routing</a> for thirty years now.)
