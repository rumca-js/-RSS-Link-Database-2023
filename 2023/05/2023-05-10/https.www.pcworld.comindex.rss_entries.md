<p>Google released its first self-branded Android phone in 2010, and has been releasing steady new models at least once a year since then. Its history with tablets is more tumultuous: After getting early hits with the affordable Nexus series, Google tablets have lost out to Samsung and Apple at every turn, and it&rsquo;s been almost five full years <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402945/google-pixel-slate-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">since the ill-fated Pixel Slate</a>. The $499 Pixel Tablet, fully revealed at Google I/O 2023 after a year of waiting, is taking a new approach by playing on Google&rsquo;s smart home prowess. </p>



<h2 id="whats-different-about-the-pixel-tablet">What&rsquo;s different about the Pixel Tablet? </h2>



<p>The Pixel Tablet is both a conventional, media consumption-focused slate, comparable to the iPad Air, and a smart home management station, a la Google&rsquo;s own Nest Hub or Amazon&rsquo;s more premium Echo devices. Pull the thing out of your bag and it&rsquo;s a regular tablet, ideal for surfing or streaming video. But place it on the magnetic speaker dock with POGO pin charging (included in the box, no less!) and it becomes a sort of super-powered Nest screen in what Google calls &ldquo;Hub Mode.&rdquo; From there it&rsquo;s ready to manage all your home&rsquo;s lights, music, and other gadgets, or function as a Google Cast screen for the media on your other devices &mdash; a first for an Android tablet. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Pixel Tablet Android interface" class="wp-image-1815732" height="576" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pixel-Tablet-Docked-Hazel.png" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Google</p></div>



<h2 id="what-are-the-specs-of-the-pixel-tablet">What are the specs of the Pixel Tablet?</h2>



<p>If this seems a bit familiar, it should: <a href="http://pcworld.com/article/632038/spring-has-sprung-but-prices-are-dropping-get-the-fire-hd-10-plus-for-just-120.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Amazon tried something similar a few years ago</a>, selling charging docks that would turn its Fire-branded tablets into de facto Echo devices. The difference is the scope. Google is aiming the Pixel Tablet as a more premium device competing directly with mid-range iPads, as opposed to Amazon&rsquo;s always-budget Fire line. The Pixel Tablet uses an 11-inch, 2560&times;1600 LCD screen, Google&rsquo;s Tensor G2 processor (the same one found in the Pixel 7 phone), 8GB of RAM, and a fingerprint unlock built into the power button. </p>



<p>The tablet&rsquo;s looks are a little on the plain side, more like the unassuming Pixel 5 than newer Google phones, with a single 8MP camera on the rear and a matching one on the front. The case uses aluminum with a nano-ceramic coating for a matte finish, available in &ldquo;Porcelain&rdquo; (white, with matching white bezel on the front) or &ldquo;Hazel&rdquo; (grey). An off-pink &ldquo;Rose&rdquo; color is available in some markets, and all are matched to the speaker dock included in the box. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Man using Pixel Tablet with case on small table" class="wp-image-1815734" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pixel-Tablet-and-case_Hazel.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Google Pixel Tablet with Charging Speaker Dock Lifestyle Photography</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Google</p></div>



<p>Speaking of that dock, it includes an impressive 15-watt speaker with a 43.5mm driver for &ldquo;four times the bass than the Pixel Tablet alone.&rdquo; When you dock the tablet audio will seamlessly transition to the dock, and the tablet&rsquo;s unique triple far-field microphones will start listening for your &ldquo;Okay Google&rdquo; commands, just like any of Google&rsquo;s Nest devices. Oddly the Pixel Tablet lacks the face-scanning powers of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.google.com/product/google_nest_hub_max?hl=en-US&amp;xcust=2-1-1816339-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nest Hub Max</a>, but otherwise it&rsquo;ll essentially turn itself into a happy (and cute) little smart screen. You can buy extra docks to rest and charge the tablet around the house or your office, and accessories like the kickstand-packing first-party case work with the dock. Off of that 15-watt charger, Google says the tablet will last for 12 hours of video streaming. </p>



<h2 id="what-software-does-the-pixel-tablet-run">What software does the Pixel Tablet run? </h2>



<p>The Pixel Tablet comes with Android 13, the latest version of Google&rsquo;s mobile operating system, with five years of guaranteed updates. And it is definitely <em>mobile </em>&mdash; unlike the more professionally-targeted Pixel Slate which ran ChromeOS and was heavily marketed with keyboard add-ons. No, Google&rsquo;s backing off the idea of a productivity device and not intending to compete with cheaper laptops or Microsoft Surface-style gadgets, leaving that space to Chrome-powered tablets <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/557564/ideapad-chromebook-duet-5-review-less-than-the-sum-of-its-parts.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">like the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet</a>. This thing is all-tablet, all the time&hellip;when it&rsquo;s not a smart home hub. The tablet also includes some first-to-Android support for multiple user profiles, ideal for sharing the device around the people in your home. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google Pixel Tablet spec screen " class="wp-image-1816791" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-10_14-44-49.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Google</p></div>



<h2 id="how-much-will-the-pixel-tablet-cost">How much will the Pixel Tablet cost? </h2>



<p>Which brings us to the price. Google is asking $499 for the Pixel Tablet (&pound;599 in the UK). It&rsquo;s up for pre-order now, shipping in June. That puts it between the price of the standard iPad and the upgraded iPad Air, with better storage (128GB on the base model versus 64GB) and the included dock in the box, but sans the option for a 5G upgrade. On paper it&rsquo;s a great deal, even if Google&rsquo;s tablet is thicker and heavier than the svelte Air. </p>



<p>But Google has spent the last five years more or less ignoring the Android tablet market, ceding the hardware space almost entirely to Samsung, Amazon, and Lenovo, and giving app developers little to no reason to focus on software experiences for bigger screens. Perhaps the announcement of the Pixel Fold, Google&rsquo;s first foray into folding phones, will give Android a long-overdue reason to focus on more than five-to-six inches of screen space. And perhaps pairing the Pixel Tablet to Google&rsquo;s more solid position in the smart home space will give it a necessary boost on the competition. </p>



<p>But speaking as someone who&rsquo;s been with Google hardware since that very first phone, various Nexus tablets, the Pixel C <em>and </em>the Pixel Slate, I wouldn&rsquo;t hold my breath. Positioning this as a premium tablet in the same space as the iPad, and thus competing with Apple&rsquo;s best-in-the-industry tablet interface and app support, is an aggressive move from a company that hasn&rsquo;t earned the trust of tablet users after a decade of attempts. </p>

## Google bakes fundamental AI productivity tools into Bard, Workspace

<p>Is Bard back? Google unveiled fundamental new improvements to its AI chatbot during the company&rsquo;s I/O 2023 keynote on Wednesday, with AI powers fundamentally improving its Workspace productivity apps as well.</p>



<p>AI has been one of the unexpected breakthroughs of the past year, with nearly daily updates from tech giants big and small implementing AI. Even the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1809479/biden-administration-wants-to-use-ai-ethically.html">U.S. government wants to use AI</a>. Google, long the dominant player in search, has had its reputation undermined by AI models like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">ChatGPT</a> and even <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/820518/midjourneys-ai-art-goes-live-for-everyone.html">generative AI art from Midjourney</a>.</p>



<p>Google has lagged behind OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT and Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing in terms of AI, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504572/google-announces-bard-ai.html">launching its own Bard chatbot in February</a>, a day before <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504771/microsoft-unveils-ai-powered-bing-search-edge.html">Microsoft had publicly launched Bing&rsquo;s AI chatbot</a>. So far, Bard has seemed to prioritize search, &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; up-to-the-minute facts. In fact, if you ask Bard a query, one of the possible outcomes is to &ldquo;Google it&rdquo; for more information. However, Bard has offered less creativity than either ChatGPT or Bing, tying for second in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671133/chatgpt-vs-bing-vs-bard-whats-the-best-ai-chatbot.html">March showdown between the three AI chatbots</a>. </p>



<p>But now, you can try out Bard for itself &mdash; Google said it&rsquo;s eliminating the waitlist and opening it up to general use.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google Bard maps" class="wp-image-1816774" height="690" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Gogole-Bard-maps.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Closer integration between other Google services and Bard will enable Bard to display Google Maps.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>With a new PaLM 2 &ldquo;large language model&rdquo; underneath it, Bard can now understand twenty programming languages, and can now better understand and provide code. It can even link to the code and analyze it, Google executives said. That code can then be able to be exported and tested via a &ldquo;collab&rdquo; &mdash; a remote test server.</p>



<p>More tools are also coming to Bard, with extensions that are essentially third-party plug-ins. It&rsquo;s beginning with Google&rsquo;s own services, using images both as inputs and outputs. In part, that will be done with Google Lens. Maps will be integrated as well, so that Bard will output mapping directions. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google Bard images" class="wp-image-1816772" height="688" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-Bard-images.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A rather nice new look for Google Bard, with integrated images.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Plugins from Khan Academy and Adobe Firefly are coming, executives added. It appears that Bard will not create generative AI images itself, but use the third-party Firefly app instead.</p>



<h2 id="ai-is-coming-to-google-workspace">AI is coming to Google Workspace</h2>



<p>Google was expected to follow the trail blazed by Microsoft with its various <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661514/microsoft-365-copilot-is-microsofts-ai-powers-applied-to-work.html">Copilot AI enhancements</a> for Microsoft 365: adding generative text creation to Google Docs, for example, and AI assistance when creating a Slides presentation. Microsoft has shown off key features of how Copilot works, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1811855/microsoft-copilot-ai-helps-you-skip-meetings-zoom-through-email.html">including the ability to skip meetings</a> by using a &ldquo;follow&rdquo; feature that combines automated transcription with an AI tool that you can query to reveal why other participants made their decisions. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google Sheets AI" class="wp-image-1816770" height="692" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-Sheets-with-AI.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Being able to describe what you want to do and then let AI handle it (in this case, Google Sheets) is an ideal use for AI.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>That indeed happened at I/O 2023. Google showed off how a simple text description in Docs could create a sophisticated job description. In Slides, Google showed off how a poem prompt could generate an image, applying different styles. &ldquo;Trusted testers&rdquo; will be able to try this next month, Google said. It will be wrapped up in a new service called &ldquo;Duet AI for Workspace.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Google also demonstrated generative text-writing in Docs using prompts &mdash; an AI suggested a few paragraphs, then asked the user how to proceed. Images were suggested, too. Google appears to believe that users will respond better to prompts than having to suggest everything themselves.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google AI generative AI art" class="wp-image-1816771" height="695" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-Slides-generative-AI-art.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Though Bard will use plugins like Firefly, Google does have its own generative AI art capability, as this Slides shot shows.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Google additionally showed off how AI can be used to pull up and enhance Workspace files that you already have, such as creating speaker notes for a presentation on the fly.</p>



<h2 id="googles-ai-foundation-palm-2">Google&rsquo;s AI foundation: PaLM 2</h2>



<p>CNBC had previously reported that Google is improving the underlying capabilities of Bard and other models, adding a more powerful PaLM 2 model that can speak 100 languages. Google executives said PaLM 2 is supposed to better understand logic and coding, and possibly images as well. That&rsquo;s important, given that AI input has been largely text-based, for now. On the other hand, for years Google has offered image searching capabilities that use your smartphone&rsquo;s camera, so it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that capability wouldn&rsquo;t appear in Google&rsquo;s AI engines.</p>



<p>Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said that over 25 products would be powered by PaLM 2, with differently sized models. The smallest, Gecko, can work natively on mobile devices. Google will even have a version for medical devices, called Med-PaLM.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Google is building in watermarking to any of its generative AI art. The metadata will signify when an image is created by AI, so that content creators will get credit and to avoid misinformation. </p>

## Google Search is getting a radical AI-powered overhaul

<p>Google&rsquo;s search engine has remained relatively unchanged for decades. With the advent of AI, look for that to change&mdash;and you can test the new-look Search today. </p>



<p>Google Search&rsquo;s familiar interface, with a search box and a list of responses, is being overhauled to look more like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1808784/1808784.html">Microsoft Bing&rsquo;s chatbot</a> now does, with AI stepping in to provide supplementary information it never offered before. (In Bing, you can perform a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; search, with a list of links and a Bing Chat box to the side; you can also conduct the search entirely within the Bing Chat interface by selecting Chat from a list of options, or scrolling / swiping up on the Bing Search page).</p>



<p>Google is trying something a bit different with its updated search engine, bringing in recommendations as well as facts. Searching for a &ldquo;good bike for a 5 mile route with hills,&rdquo; will interpret that result with bikes with a good suspension and tires, built on Google&rsquo;s Shopping graph. </p>



<p>Want a follow-up? Google will offer a conversational mode as well, with follow-up queries and other search results. Supplementary results in a sidebar can show you which merchants have the bike in stock and what their policies are.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google AI search" class="wp-image-1816734" height="678" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-Search-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Bulleted lists and integrated images are something that most AI chatbots can&rsquo;t do. Google Search can.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The search function will appear on mobile and in a conversational interface, too, knowing previous queries. </p>



<p>Google also showed off a quick snapshot of the future such as bulleted responses, more images, integrated videos, and sophisticated queries that included comparisons and deep knowledge, including restaurant menus.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img alt="Google AI search" class="wp-image-1816735" height="473" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Google-Search-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="645" /><figcaption>Another look at Google Search.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Google said that it&rsquo;s using <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1816361/googles-bard-workspace-gain-powerful-new-ai-smarts.html">an updated PaLM 2 model</a> as its foundation, driving both Google Search as well as its Bard chatbot. The demonstration also revealed a more subtle change: Google Search looks like it will be a front door to Bard, so that a &ldquo;search&rdquo; will now appear more like a conversation.</p>



<p>Want to try it out? You can tap the labs icon (the small flask icon) in either the latest version of the Google app or the Chrome desktop. That will put you on the waitlist, where you&rsquo;ll be able to play with it at a later date. How long will that be? Well, since Bard is now open to public (goodbye, waitlist!), hopefully not long. </p>

<p>Today, at the Google I/O developer conference, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai pledged to use AI responsibly, by improving knowledge and learning, boosting creativity, and deploying AI responsibly to help maintain equality. Pichai showed off three apps that will use AI to improve them:</p>



<h2 id="gmail-help-me-write">Gmail (Help Me Write)</h2>



<p>Gmail has been a pioneer in predictive responses, and it&rsquo;s continuing with a new feature called Help Me Write. </p>



<p>Help Me Write uses your previous history to create an email on a given topic, so you can ask for a refund on a travel reservation, using the previous email history to help negotiate a settlement. All you need to ask Help Me Write to craft the email. This feature will start rolling out as part of the company&rsquo;s upcoming Workspace update, Pichai said.</p>



<h2 id="google-maps">Google Maps</h2>



<p>Last year, Google launched Immersive View to do what Maps does best, Pichai says. Google Maps performs 20 billion directions per day. Now, the app will provide additional information about your route, including traffic and weather, and will roll out in 15 years by the end of the year, Pichai said.</p>



<h2 id="google-photos-magic-editor">Google Photos (Magic Editor)</h2>



<p>Photos&rsquo; Magic Erase previously used AI to eliminate objects from a scene. Now, Magic Editor can move objects around in a scene and even change the background.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google Magic Editor" class="wp-image-1816611" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-10_13-16-44.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Magic Editor will include outpainting,   adding objects that aren&rsquo;t in your photo, like these balloons.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>Magic Editor can use &ldquo;outpainting,&rdquo; expanding the scene to generate AI-based backgrounds and objects that weren&rsquo;t necessarily there. </p>



<p>Google will roll out Magic Editor to Photos later this year.</p>

## Stardock’s awesome Groupy 2 lets you treat apps like browser tabs

<p>If you&rsquo;ve enjoyed the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430331/use-the-new-tabbed-file-explorer-to-simplify-your-life.html">new tabs in Windows 11&rsquo;s File Explorer</a> and want to go even further, consider investing seven bucks in the successor to Stardock&rsquo;s wonderful Groupy app, the aptly named Groupy 2.</p>



<p>Stardock&rsquo;s latest software doesn&rsquo;t differ that much from the awesome original <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.stardock.com/products/groupy/&amp;xcust=2-3-1815015-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Groupy</a>, which <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407624/stardock-groupy-manage-windows.html">debuted in beta way back in 2017</a>. At the time, Microsoft was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407641/windows-10-sets-timeline.html">talking about Sets</a>, a prototype UI that would organize apps in much the same way that browsers organize different webpages. It featured a tabbed interface that kept multiple windows organized together in a unified manner.</p>



<p>Microsoft quietly killed Sets, though, before that vision came to be. Today, Microsoft applies the tabbed interface to Edge, as well as multiple instances of File Explorer and a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1478585/tabbed-notepad-joins-improved-settings-spotlight-in-windows-betas.html">tabbed Notepad UI</a>. If you&rsquo;d like to keep Word alongside PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook in a single window, however, Windows doesn&rsquo;t allow it. Groupy does.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Stardock Groupy 2" class="wp-image-1815043" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Related open Excel, PowerPoint and Word files, all within Groupy 2 tabs.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Stardock</p></div>



<p>What&rsquo;s different in Groupy 2 is that Stardock has allowed you to save tabbed apps as a, well, group, and then launch them as a single click. We&rsquo;ve seen this mechanism elsewhere, most usually in various browsers, where groups of tabs can be saved wholesale and then launched together when it&rsquo;s time to shift attention to this new task.</p>



<p>Groupy also allows you to mouse over the app tab to view the open file, and group instances of the same app together.</p>



<p>Groupy 2 supports additional customization options, including the ability to place tabs in a new tab row, color-code them, and more. While Groupy was designed to work with both Windows 10 and 11, the tab experience more closely matches Windows 11. (Microsoft has said that Windows 10 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801718/windows-10-wont-receive-any-more-feature-updates.html">won&rsquo;t be getting any additional feature updates</a>, though it <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1069153/windows-10-continue-until-2025-microsoft.html">will end support in 2025</a>.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Stardock Groupy 2" class="wp-image-1815042" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4-3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Groupy 2&rsquo;s configuration options include tab placement, colors, and how they&rsquo;re grouped.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Stardock</p></div>



<p>Stardock will charge $6.99 for Groupy 2 during the beta period, and increase the price to $9.99 after it ends. The price is for a perpetual license. Stardock said that there are a few additional features that the company plans to add during the beta period.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s officially spring time folks, which means it&rsquo;s time to get your house in order. The easiest way to clean your dirty floors is to invest in a smart vacuum. If you&rsquo;re in the market for such a thing, then you&rsquo;re in luck. Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Vacuum-Wi-Fi-Connectivity-Carpets-Self-Charging/dp/B08SP5GYJP&amp;xcust=2-1-1815971-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">iRobot Roomba 694 for $179.99</a>, which is 35 percent off of the original $274.99 price. This thing has a knack for cleaning up pet hair, crumbs, dirt, and so on. It has a three stage cleaning system and dual multi-surface brushes, which allows it to lift debris from both carpets and hard floors.</p>



<p>The Roomba 694 features a runtime of 90 minutes and, according to the manufacturer, a &ldquo;full suite of advanced sensors.&rdquo; That means it&rsquo;s smart enough to navigate around and under bulky furniture.

<p>Few people in the world these days get excited about USB thumb drives. Especially with so many users relying solely on storage in the cloud. But I&rsquo;ll be damned if I don&rsquo;t experience a slight twinge of &ldquo;<em>Oh, boy!</em>&rdquo; when I get 700MBps-plus writing from one of these tiny wonders&mdash;in this case, the PNY Pro Elite V2 flash drive.</p>



<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s because I tend to run repair utilities and alternate operating systems from them. But even the average user will appreciate being able to offload or back up the day&rsquo;s work in just a few seconds, rather than the minutes that slower 5Gbps USB sticks can take. </p>



<p>And while online storage has proven relatively secure and safe to date, there&rsquo;s nothing quite as safe or secure as your data tucked away in your pocket.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">best external drives</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="pny-pro-elite-v2-design-and-features">PNY Pro Elite V2 design and features</h2>



<p>The Pro Elite V2 is available in 256GB ($44.99/tested), 512GB ($74.99), and 1TB ($109.99) capacities. Note that these prices were further discounted to the tune of $3 to $15 on Amazon at the time of this writing. Even discounted, that&rsquo;s up to five times what you&rsquo;ll pay for a 5Gbps USB stick of like capacity. Ahem. </p>



<p>PNY didn&rsquo;t disclose the inner workings of the Pro Elite V2 on our fact check, but it&rsquo;s a sure bet from the performance that it has to be NVMe internally. Also, given the small form factor, the NAND is either TLC or QLC. Since the lowest speed I saw in testing off cache was 350MBps, I&rsquo;m calling TLC. (QLC will generally write natively at 90 to 150MBps.)</p>



<p>Unlike many of its ilk, the Pro Elite V2&rsquo;s USB connector doesn&rsquo;t slide into an enclosed body, but rather the connector is part of cartridge like element that is pushed in from the rear of the stick to produce the USB connector up front. When the connector is retracted, the cartridge element protrudes from the back. The approximately 2.2-inch long, 0.74-inch wide, 0.37-inch thick profile remains constant in either state. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1807429" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PNY-Elite-Pro-V2-open.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The USB connector  of the PNY Pro Elite V2 exposed.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Inserting the Pro Elite V2&rsquo;s by holding its end eliminates my common complaint with USB stick retractable connectors: top-mounted slide switches that may be obstructed by other USB sticks, cables, etc. Not the Pro Elite V2. Nice touch, PNY.</p>



<h2 id="how-does-the-pny-pro-elite-v2-perform">How does the PNY Pro Elite V2 perform?</h2>



<p>Either we received an upgraded version, or PNY is being stupidly modest in its claims of 600MBps read and 200MBps write performance for the Pro Elite V2. We saw 637MBps reading (no surprise), and a whopping 753MBps writing&mdash;nearly four times the claimed write speed. How many sales has the company squandered because of this error?</p>



<p>Compared to the other 10Gbps USB stick we&rsquo;ve tested&mdash;the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1480094/teamgroup-c212-usb-drive-review.html">Teamgroup C212</a>&mdash;the Pro Elite V2 mopped the floor with it. Of course, the C212 is rather less expensive than the Pro Elite V2, though hardly bargain-basement 5Gbps-priced.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1807499" height="524" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PNY-Elite-Pro-V2-CDM-8-seq.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>The  PNY Pro Elite V2 easily outpaced the Teamgroup C212, though CrystakDiskMark 8 returned seriously lower numbers on our new testbed.  See the next slide for different results. Longer bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Note that these numbers are from a retest of the C212 on our new test bed (described at the end of this article). Its numbers under AS SSD, albeit still slower than the Pro Elite V2&rsquo;s, are more in line with the real-world performance seen in the 48GB transfers. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1807530" height="573" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PNY-Elite-Pro-V2-AS-SSD-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>While the PNY Pro Elite V2 still beat the Teamgroup C212, it had some issues with random throughput. Longer bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The 256GB version of Pro Elite V2 we tested might have suffered from lack of secondary cache during our 48GB copy tests, though it still did quite well compared to the C212. Also, 256GB is obviously not enough to participate in the 450GB write, which we&rsquo;d normally include in the article right after the 48GB transfers.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1807502" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PNY-Elite-Pro-V2-48GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Despite having only 256GB to work with, the Pro Elite V2 turned in very good times in our 48GB transfer tests. Shorter bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>While we weren&rsquo;t able to perform the 450GB write on the Pro Elite V2, based on the 350MBps low point we saw with the 256GB version close to full, the 500GB and 1TB versions should be able to finish the task in 22 minutes or less&mdash;well under half the time (52 minutes) it took the C212. Again, that&rsquo;s not a guarantee, nor a promise, but a projection based on observation. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Either we received an upgraded version, or PNY is being stupidly modest in its claims of 600MBps read and 200MBps write performance for the Pro Elite V2.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="is-the-pny-pro-elite-v2-worth-it">Is the PNY Pro Elite V2 worth it</h2>



<p>If you just want a plain-Jane USB stick, you can get one for far less than the Pro Elite V2. If on the other hand, you consider your time valuable, or occasionally need to rush to catch the bus, then the PNY&rsquo;s product is well worth the extra coin. Zero complaints. Good stuff. </p>



<p><em>How we test</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>External drive tests currently utilize Windows 11 (22H2) 64-bit running on an X790 (PCIe 5.0) motherboard/i5-12400 CPU combo with two Kingston Fury 32GB DDR5 modules (64GB of memory total). Intel integrated graphics are used. </em></p><p><em>The 48GB transfer tests utilize an ImDisk RAM disk taking up 58GB of the 64GB total memory.

Note that in normal use, as any drive fills up, performance will decrease due to less NAND for caching, and other factors.</em> </p><p><em>The policy for all drives is set to</em> <em>&ldquo;Better performance&rdquo; with write caching enabled</em>. <em>You might get lower numbers if you leave the drive&rsquo;s policy set to &ldquo;Quick Removal&rdquo; (the default).</em></p><p><em>The performance numbers shown apply only to the drive we were shipped as well as the capacity tested. SSD performance can vary by capacity due to more or fewer chips to read/write across and the amount of NAND available for secondary caching (writing TLC/QLC as SLC).</em> </p><p><em>Vendors also occasionally swap components and Teamgroup reserves this right.

## This radical Philips dual monitor is half LCD, half e-ink

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>E-ink promised us a future free from eye strain a few years ago. That hasn&rsquo;t quite come to pass &mdash; outside of the portable e-reader niche and maybe <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444648/lenovos-newest-e-ink-laptop-might-be-worth-buying.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">one new Lenovo laptop a year</a>, easy-to-read e-ink screens are still pretty thin on the ground. Philips is making a case for their utility with the Business Monitor Dual Screen Display. That rather dull name hides an intriguing design: conventional 24-inch IPS monitor on one side, 13.3-inch black-and-white ePaper on the other. </p>



<p>Fans of e-ink will recognize this as essentially an expansion of an existing Philips design, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.philips.com.cn/c-p/13B1K3300_93/business-monitor-electronic-paper-display/overview?fbclid=IwAR2EtYALMU7ViP71rnAkqU9S2hNGE1dJr2u5p7FqROAjMpK7l400a0B1F9k#see-all-benefits&amp;xcust=2-1-1815909-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recently-revealed Business Monitor e-Paper Display</a> (really killing it with these names, guys). It&rsquo;s a 13.3-inch panel in a vertical &ldquo;paper&rdquo; layout, with a relatively tame 1600&times;1200 resolution. The matte, 4-bit grayscale screen is ideal for reading long documents without the usual eye strain, and like most Amazon Kindles, it can work in low-light situations thanks to a front light. The stand-alone version of the screen includes DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB-C connections, and it goes for $800 &mdash; fairly standard for this small market segment. </p>



<p>The more bombastic dual-screen option, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://goodereader.com/blog/technology/philips-launches-two-in-one-monitor-with-lcd-and-e-ink-panels&amp;xcust=2-1-1815909-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as revealed by GoodEReader</a>, slaps that ePaper display onto the side of a fairly normal 23.8-inch, 1440p IPS monitor. The whole thing is one solid unit, not two displays packed in the same box. They&rsquo;re connected with a hinge and the rear monitor mount is centered, giving the combined screens an odd off-center look, but making sense in both practical and ergonomic terms. (You can VESA mount the big, unwieldy thing if you like.) The combined unit has the same input options, plus Ethernet and four USB-A ports for handy connections and USB-C power delivery at up to 90 watts. Some fancy software allows you to view windows or documents from remote machines on the ePaper half. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="philips business display epaper eink rear" class="wp-image-1816016" height="772" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/philips-business-display-epaper-eink-rear.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Philips</p></div>



<p>I can see the appeal of this design for someone whose job includes hours of meticulous text scanning every day. And I can see the appeal if this is the only monitor (monitors?) on your desk &mdash; even with those chunky bezels, there&rsquo;s a nice unity of design thanks to the integrated hinge and the vertical alignment. But remember that the ePaper version of this display is $800&hellip;and the $1599.99 price for the dual monitor version becomes far less appealing. Philips is basically asking $800 for a 24-inch IPS monitor with some nice connection chops, which would be worth $300 or so on its own on a good day. </p>

## Beyond passwords: How to set up passkeys with your Google account

<p>Passwords have one big flaw:<strong> </strong>If anyone guesses what your password is, you&rsquo;re left with no defense. It&rsquo;s why we use <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">password managers</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/403535/two-factor-authentication-faq-sms-authenticator-security-key-icloud.html">two-factor authentication</a> to better safeguard our accounts.</p>



<p>Passkeys, on the other hand, are immune to this issue. In fact, this newer login method is both simpler and more secure. With just a smartphone, you can generate and store passkeys, and they don&rsquo;t require as much interaction or management. Once they&rsquo;re set up, you just approve login attempts with a PIN or biometrics (e.g., fingerprint or facial identification).</p>



<p>If that sounds exciting, you&rsquo;re in luck. Passkey support beginning to pick up steam, and Google is the latest big corporation to let you log into an account <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313&amp;xcust=2-1-1815683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">with a passkey</a>. Here&rsquo;s how to get started.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-set-up-passkeys-for-your-google-account">How to set up passkeys for your Google account</h2>



<p>On PC, you&rsquo;ll begin by heading to the web version of Google&rsquo;s account management. If you plan to set up a phone or tablet, it must be nearby the computer you&rsquo;ll be using. The PC also must have Bluetooth and run Windows 10 or 11, and you must use Chrome (version 109 or newer) or another Chromium browser like Edge (version 109 or newer).</p>



<ol><li>Head to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://myaccount.google.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1815683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"><em>myaccount.google.com</em></a>.</li><li>On the left side of the page, click on <em>Security</em>.</li><li>Under <em>How you sign into Google</em>, click on <em>Passkeys</em>. If you don&rsquo;t see this option, you&rsquo;ll need first to click on <em>Use your phone to sign in</em> and link your account to a device like a phone or tablet.</li><li>Click on the blue <em>Use passkeys</em> button.</li></ol>



<p>You&rsquo;ll now see a management screen for your passkeys. If you have any Android devices already logged into your Google account, they&rsquo;ll automatically be available for passkey setup. You just have to log into your account to complete the process.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="manually created passkey for google account" class="wp-image-1815698" height="551" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/secondary-passkey-screenshot-2-1.png" width="980" /><figcaption>When you&rsquo;ve manually set up a passkey successfully, you&rsquo;ll see this confirmation screen.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>To manually create a passkey, click the white <em>Create a passkey</em> button. If you&rsquo;re on an incompatible PC, you&rsquo;ll see a dialog box with a blue button to <em>Use another device</em>. You can choose to set up a device like a phone or tablet by scanning a QR code, or a security key. (For setting up passkeys in a compatible password manager, use the QR code method.)</p>



<p>If you decide you don&rsquo;t like passkeys and want to remove them, you can delete manually added ones by clicking the X button. For automatically added devices, you must remove that phone or tablet from your account.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-use-a-passkey-to-log-into-your-google-account">How to use a passkey to log into your Google account</h2>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve set up passkeys for your Google account, they become your default login method. After you enter your user name, you&rsquo;ll see a screen prompting you to use your passkey. Click on the blue <em>Continue</em> button.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="google passkey challenge screen" class="wp-image-1815719" height="570" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/google-passkey-login.png" width="854" /><figcaption>Once you setup passkeys, they become the default login method.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve used a phone or tablet (which most people will), you&rsquo;ll see another prompt asking if you want to sign in using the passkey on that device. Click continue, then switch to your phone to verify the request with your PIN or biometrics. You&rsquo;ll then be logged in&mdash;if two-factor authentication is enabled on your Google account, it&rsquo;ll only be necessary when logging in with your password. A passkey is considered to already be both something you know (the private encryption key stored on the device) and something you have (the phone). In other words, it&rsquo;s two factors already combined into one system.</p>



<h2 id="how-passkeys-work">How passkeys work</h2>



<p>At first glance, passkeys may seem less secure due to their simplicity. It can look like a phone&rsquo;s facial recognition, fingerprint, or PIN becomes the only thing protecting the Google account.</p>



<p>Passkeys use <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-asymmetric-encryption/&amp;xcust=2-1-1815683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">public-key encryption</a>, also known as asymmetrical encryption, for login authentication. When you create a passkey, a public key and a private key are generated. The public key gets shared with the website (in this case, Google), while you hang on to the private key. You need both to sign into your account&mdash;whenever you try to log on, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication&amp;xcust=2-1-1815683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">website will ask for proof</a> that you&rsquo;re you. If you approve the request, your device will use your secret key to create a digital signature to send to the website, which the website will unencrypt using the public key you gave it. Your PIN (or biometrics) safeguards use of your private key, rather than serving as the full authentication process.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Illustration showing how a passkey can link to multiple devices as well as the cloud" class="wp-image-1806668" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/passkey-sync.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Sync your passkey to the cloud and you can more easily use it across devices (or pick up where you left off, if your primary device is lost or stolen).</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Google</p></div>



<p>This process offers better protection against website breaches, since no one can guess your private key based on the public key. Passkeys are also tied to the website they&rsquo;re generated for, so they can&rsquo;t be captured by fake phishing sites like passwords can.</p>



<p>Passkeys can also be saved in several different ways&mdash;not just to your device, but also to hardware security keys, a compatible PC, and the cloud. For cloud backups, you can use a password manager like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407081/dashlane-password-manager-review.html">Dashlane</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394924/nordpass-review-streamlined-password-management.html">NordPass</a>, or save them to your operating system (Windows; macOS &amp; iOS). You can control how widely you spread your collection.</p>



<h2 id="other-sites-that-use-passkeys">Other sites that use passkeys</h2>



<p>Google isn&rsquo;t the only major site that supports passkey login&mdash;Apple beat them to the punch late last summer. You can find more websites (like Best Buy) on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://passkeys.directory/&amp;xcust=2-1-1815683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">this list</a> hosted by password manager 1Password. Password managers will also be more widely adopting passkey support in the coming months, too. Overall, expect passkeys to become more common as the year rolls on.</p>

<p>Most super-ultrawide monitors have an extreme curve for maximum immersion, but that curve can be a distraction when it&rsquo;s time to clock in. The Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW is a practical alternative with a less aggressive curve, more restrained image quality, and tons of connectivity. It&rsquo;s a solid pick if you need a super-ultrawide for work.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470449/best-ultrawide-monitors.html">best ultrawide monitors</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-specs-and-features">Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW specs and features</h2>



<p>The U4924DW&rsquo;s display specifications are typical of a 49-inch super-ultrawide monitor, with one exception: It has an IPS Black panel. This relatively new panel, produced by LG, promises better contrast and improved dark scene performance.</p>



<ul><li>Display size: 49-inch 32:9 super-ultrawide</li><li>Native resolution: 5120&times;1440</li><li>Panel type: IPS Black LCD</li><li>Refresh rate: 60Hz</li><li>Adaptive-Sync: None</li><li>HDR: None</li><li>Ports: 1x USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 90 watts Power Delivery, 4x USB-A, 2x USB-C, USB-B, 2x HDMI, DisplayPort, audio line-out, Ethernet</li><li>Stand adjustment: Height, tilt</li><li>VESA mount: Yes, 100x100mm</li><li>Speakers: Yes, 2x none-watt</li><li>Price: $1599.99</li></ul>



<p>But it&rsquo;s arguably the monitor&rsquo;s connectivity that deserves center stage. The monitor acts as a USB-C hub that provides a total of six downstream USB ports (four USB-A, two USB-C) plus Ethernet and audio-out.</p>



<h2 id="dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-design">Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW design</h2>



<p>The Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW&rsquo;s design is unusual for a simple reason: It&rsquo;s curved, but only just. It&rsquo;s a stark contrast against popular super-ultrawide gaming monitors like the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9, which seem to wrap around the user&rsquo;s field of view, and more similar to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-49wl95c-we-ultrawide-monitor&amp;xcust=2-1-1813208-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">LG 49WL95C-WE</a>, a competitive super-ultrawide productivity monitor.</p>



<p>Toning down the curve has perks. An extremely aggressive curve can seem more immersive in games but also distorts the image. Lines that appear straight may instead seem curved, which isn&rsquo;t ideal when image accuracy and consistency matters. Aggressive curves also amplify glare, especially from light sources directly behind the user. The Dell U4924DW will still show some glare, but the less aggressive curve and anti-glare finish are an effective combination.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt=" Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW back" class="wp-image-1813214" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The &nbsp;Dell U4924DW from behind.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Curve aside, the U4924DW adopts the usual Dell Ultrasharp design language. That means thin black bezels and silver faux-metallic plastics across most of the rear display panel and stand, although the stand base seems to be real metal. The monitor is noticeably more robust than competitive super-ultrawides from LG and Samsung which, in my experience, tend to creak and groan when handled.</p>



<p>The practical stand is hefty and keeps the monitor planted yet doesn&rsquo;t take up excess space on a desk. This, too, is an advantage over Samsung and LG alternatives which use wide, beefy stands that leave large portions of your desk unusable. The U4924DW supports both 100x100mm and 200x100mm VESA mount patterns, providing a wide range of options for third-party monitor stands and arms. The monitor&rsquo;s panel is heavy at 27 pounds, however, so you&rsquo;ll need a top-tier monitor arm to support it.</p>



<h2 id="dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-features-and-menus">Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW features and menus</h2>



<p>Dell&rsquo;s Ultrasharp U4924DW boasts an impressive array of connectivity surpassing other super-ultrawide monitors currently available.</p>



<p>The highlight is the USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and an impressive 90 watts Power Delivery, which lets owners connect and charge a laptop or tablet simultaneously. The USB-C port also acts as a hub for access to four USB-A, two USB-C ports, and an ethernet port. The monitor can completely replace most USB-C hubs and midrange USB-C docks.</p>



<p>Those who don&rsquo;t want to connect to the monitor over USB-C can instead use a USB-A to USB-B cable to access the monitor&rsquo;s connectivity.</p>



<p>Additional video connectivity comes from two HDMI inputs and a single DisplayPort input, bringing the total number of video inputs to a healthy four. The monitor is missing a second DisplayPort-out port for connecting a second monitor directly to the U4924DW, which I find odd: Less expensive monitors in this model line, like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/693931/dell-u3223qe-review.html">Dell U3223QE</a>, have that feature. I can&rsquo;t be too harsh about its exclusion, though, as I can&rsquo;t think of a competing super-ultrawide that offers it.</p>



<p>Dell&rsquo;s menu system is controlled by a joystick on the monitor&rsquo;s right lower flank. It&rsquo;s logically arranged and easy to navigate thanks to responsive controls, relatively large font sizes, and clear menu labels. Image-quality options include color temperature presets that target specific color temperature values, color hue, gain, offset, and saturation adjustment, and several modes that target a specific color gamut, such as sRGB and DCI-P3. There&rsquo;s no gamma adjustment, however.</p>



<p>Like most super-ultrawides, the U4924DW presents a buffet of picture-in-picture and picture-by-picture modes. Users can split the screen in half or divvy or access a variety of picture-in-picture modes that place the PIP image in different locations on the display.</p>



<p>The U4924DW includes two 9-watt speakers that deliver acceptable volume. The lack of low-end oomph and sometimes harsh quality of highs makes them a poor choice for music, but they&rsquo;re great for podcasts, video calls, and most YouTube content. Most super-ultrawides don&rsquo;t have speakers or, if they do, use weak speakers that can be difficult to hear even at maximum volume.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The monitor can completely replace most USB-C hubs and midrange USB-C docks.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-image-quality">Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW image quality</h2>



<p>The Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW is not an inexpensive monitor, so it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect top-tier image quality. It delivers, though perhaps not in the ways display enthusiasts would expect. It&rsquo;s an unapologetic productivity monitor.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt=" Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW brightness chart" class="wp-image-1813212" height="829" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Brightness comes in at a maximum of 333 nits. As the graph shows, there&rsquo;s an extremely wide range of brightness among today&rsquo;s high-end ultrawide and super-ultrawide monitors, and the Dell U4924DW lands smack in the middle. It&rsquo;s bright enough for use in nearly all situations, though it might seem a bit dim in a room lit by floor-to-ceiling windows on a sunny day.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt=" Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW contrast chart" class="wp-image-1813217" height="826" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The U4924DW has a new type of IPS panel called &ldquo;IPS Black&rdquo; which promises an improved contrast ratio thanks to lower luminance in dark areas of the image. It delivers a contrast ratio of 1,510:1, much higher than conventional panels, which range between 800:1 and 1200:1, depending on the display. The monitor&rsquo;s lower minimum luminance helps to rein in the dreaded &ldquo;IPS glow,&rdquo; or hazy gray sheen present in dark scenes on most IPS displays.</p>



<p>With that said, the U4924DW&rsquo;s contrast is behind alternatives with a Mini-LED backlight, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1511598/viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-review.html">Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K </a>or Samsung Odyssey Neo G9. They serve up a superior sense of depth in games and movies.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt=" Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW color gamut chart" class="wp-image-1813218" height="793" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-color-gamut.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Color gamut performance is a tad underwhelming, spanning 94 percent of DCI-P3 and 88 percent of AdobeRGB. That&rsquo;s good enough for most users and also above average for a monitor, but it&rsquo;s the worst performance in this competitive set.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the U4923DW ships with a default color gamut setting that spanned only 89 percent of DCI-P3 and 88 percent of AdobeRGB. This appears to be an sRGB mode that aims to provide a more accurate look in everyday use and avoid oversaturated colors. It&rsquo;s successful and makes sense given the monitor&rsquo;s focus on office productivity, but would-be owners should make note of this quirk. The monitor should be manually set to DCI-P3 or Custom Color mode to achieve the widest possible color gamut.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt=" Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW color accuracy chart" class="wp-image-1813219" height="873" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-color-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Color accuracy is better than it appears in the graph. The monitor&rsquo;s color error is the highest of this bunch, but all of these monitors perform well and are unlikely to present any problem in real-world use. The image appears realistic, pleasant, and lifelike. Also, as mentioned, the monitor has extensive color calibration options that help users change any aspect of color presentation they dislike.</p>



<p>The monitor&rsquo;s default color temperature came in at 6900K, a tad cooler than the target of 6500K, and the gamma curve came in at 2.1, which indicates content may appear a bit brighter than it should. Neither variance is drastic though, at this price, I did expect to see a spot-on color temperature reading of 6500K.</p>



<p>Sharpness is excellent. The monitor&rsquo;s 5120&times;1440 resolution is equivalent to a 27-inch 1440p monitor and packs roughly 109 pixels into each inch. A 27-inch 4K monitor is much sharper at 163 pixels per inch, but this comparison is a bit academic, as no super-ultrawide sold today beats a vertical resolution of 1440p. This is as sharp as it gets at this size and aspect ratio.</p>



<p>The U4924DW&rsquo;s image quality is mediocre overall but well suited to its intended task. It&rsquo;s bright enough for use in most offices and offers a sharp, accurate image with good contrast. The monitor lacks the hyper-realistic, oversaturated look common to high-end monitors, and that will disappoint those looking to play games or watch movies.</p>



<h2 id="dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-hdr-image-quality">Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW HDR image quality</h2>



<p>The Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW does not support HDR, which may come as a surprise given its price. However, the monitor&rsquo;s focus on productivity makes the absence of HDR understandable. Office tasks and Windows desktop applications rarely benefit from the enhanced color range and contrast provided by HDR. Choosing to omit HDR presents shoppers with an easy choice: If you want HDR, don&rsquo;t buy the U4924DW.</p>



<h2 id="dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-motion-performance">Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW motion performance</h2>



<p>The motion clarity of the Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW is satisfactory for its 60Hz refresh rate, but not better than competitors. Fast-moving objects are noticeably lacking in detail and scrolling across an image or webpage will make most content illegible.</p>



<p>The absence of Adaptive Sync makes it less than ideal for gaming, as screen tearing or micro-stutters may appear when a game&rsquo;s framerate deviates from 60fps. Gamers will want to use a V-sync option in games which provide it.</p>



<p>Games can be enjoyed despite these flaws, but competitors like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49--odyssey-g95na-gaming-dqhd-led-monitor-ls49ag952nnxza/&amp;xcust=2-1-1813208-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Samsung Odyssey Neo G9</a>, which has a 240Hz refresh rate and supports both AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, are superior in games.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt=" Dell Ultrasharp U4924DW multitask" class="wp-image-1813213" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dell-ultrasharp-u4924dw-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You can see how conducive the Ultrasharp U4924DW  is to multitasking.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>



<h2 id="is-the-ultrasharp-u4924dw-worth-it">Is the Ultrasharp U4924DW worth it?</h2>



<p>Dell&rsquo;s Ultrasharp U4924DW is a super-ultrawide built for a specific demographic. It drops features that target games and entertainment like an aggressive curve, enhanced refresh rate, and HDR, in favor of a simple, functional display that&rsquo;s comfortable and attractive when using basic productivity applications.</p>



<p>The monitor also delivers outstanding USB connectivity that can replace a standalone USB-C hub or dock. The U4924DW pairs well with a USB-C laptop, as it can charge the laptop while improving its connectivity.</p>



<p>Pricing is an obstacle, as Dell charges a stiff MSRP of $1,599. That&rsquo;s equivalent to alternative monitors with better image quality like the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677744/corsair-xeneon-flex-monitor-review.html">Corsair Xeneon Flex</a>. Still, the U4924DW is a good choice if you plan to spend more time in Microsoft Excel than <em>League of Legends</em>.</p>

## Wi-Fi problems? Here’s how to diagnose your router issues
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/695032/how-to-fix-wifi-router-issues.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/695032/how-to-fix-wifi-router-issues.html)

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Whenever someone sends me a question about how to fix their Wi-Fi, I wince. It&rsquo;s not that I dislike helping people with their router problems. In fact, there are few geeky endeavors I find more rewarding than fixing Wi-Fi connection issues at a friend or family member&rsquo;s home.</p>



<p>But Wi-Fi has always felt more like a dark art than a science, and it&rsquo;s an art that&rsquo;s hard to conjure without being physically present. Potential points of failure are everywhere, and what works well in one home might not in another. Even the reviewers of networking gear can reach drastically different conclusions about the very same product. </p>



<p>Wi-Fi is fundamentally at odds, then, with my desire to answer questions with specific recommendations. The best I can do is walk your through how I diagnose Wi-Fi problems myself. That way, you can make better decisions on whether (and how) to upgrade your own gear.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397435/best-mesh-wi-fi-routers.html">The best mesh Wi-Fi routers</a></p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Size up the Wi-Fi problem</strong></h2>



<p>The first step to solving Wi-Fi issues is to see if the slowdown is coming from your cable modem (which brings internet service into the home) or from the router (which distributes Wi-Fi connectivity throughout the home).</p>



<p>Start by plugging a computer directly into your modem with an ethernet cable and running a speed test. (The easiest way is to do a Google search for &ldquo;speed test,&rdquo; then hit the blue &ldquo;Run Speed Test&rdquo; button atop the search results.) A <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Mobi-Lock-Compatible-Computers-Including/dp/B00NLL10P4/&amp;xcust=2-2-695032-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">USB-to-Ethernet adapter</a> will be necessary for testing on computers that don&rsquo;t have an ethernet port, but if that&rsquo;s too much trouble or you don&rsquo;t have a proper computer at all, you can also try calling your internet provider and asking them to test your internet speed remotely.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google speed test tool" class="wp-image-695042" height="825" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/speedtest.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Running speed tests throughout the house can help you figure out where the Wi-Fi trouble spots are.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>If wired connection speeds are on par with your internet provider&rsquo;s advertised speeds, the next step is to start running speed tests throughout the house. Measure speeds around the area where connectivity feels slow, then work your way back to where the router is located, running multiple tests in each area as you go.</p>



<p>The goal here is to figure out where your connection troubles are occurring. Consistently slow speeds throughout the house may be a sign of an outdated router, while dead zones or range issues may require a more powerful router or mesh Wi-Fi system. (More on that shortly.)</p>



<h2><strong>Find your Wi-Fi router&rsquo;s 802.11 version</strong></h2>



<p>To figure out whether a router needs replacing, it helps to know how old it is. One way to do this to locate the router&rsquo;s model number&mdash;it&rsquo;s likely printed on the router itself&mdash;then search the web for info about which version of Wi-Fi it supports. Here are the major Wi-Fi versions to know about:</p>



<ul><li><strong>802.11a/b/g:</strong> Extremely old and almost certainly the source of all your Wi-Fi problems.</li><li><strong>802.11a/b/g/n (or just 802.11n):</strong> Outdated at this point and a solid candidate for replacement. Many of these routers only support a single frequency band that&rsquo;s slower and more congestion-prone, and &ldquo;dual-band&rdquo; variants have limited range on the faster 5 GHz frequency band.</li><li><strong>802.11ac (also marketed as Wi-Fi 5):</strong> Not the latest standard, but still widely available even in some high-performance routers.</li><li><strong>802.11ax (or Wi-Fi 6):</strong> Routers using this standard started shipping in late 2020, so your router is likely quite new.</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi 6E:</strong> Congrats, you <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/693391/eero-pro-6e-mesh-wi-fi-review-more-family-sedan-than-sports-car.html">probably just bought a new router</a>. </li></ul>



<p>Wi-Fi versions alone aren&rsquo;t an indicator of quality&mdash;a cheap Wi-Fi 6 router can be worse than a high-end mesh system with Wi-Fi 5&mdash;but each successive version has introduced new features that improve connectivity, and we&rsquo;ve generally seen a push toward better performance over time.</p>



<h2><strong>Try some smaller router fixes</strong></h2>



<p>Just to rehash a tip I <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394866/fix-slow-wi-fi-with-this-router-settings-tweak.html">discussed back in July</a>, sometimes changing your router&rsquo;s channel and bandwidth settings can work wonders for reducing Wi-Fi interference, especially if you&rsquo;re seeing inconsistent speeds on devices that aren&rsquo;t too far from the router. By digging into your router&rsquo;s settings, you can bypass automatic channel selection and find a channel that might be less congested.</p>



<p>You can also try some other little tweaks, like getting your router off the ground and clearing some space around it&mdash;but I wouldn&rsquo;t start rearranging your room for the router&rsquo;s sake. Chances are the improvements will be minimal. Of course, moving your router to a more central location in the home can help, but that would likely require having the cable company rewire your home internet connection.</p>



<h2><strong>Wi-Fi extenders: a last resort</strong></h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="TP-Link extender" class="wp-image-695041" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tplinkextender.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>An extender can help squeeze more range out of your router, but it&rsquo;s not a panacea.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">TP-Link</p></div>



<p>Because replacing a router is a pain, a lot of folks wonder if they can just solve their problems with a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AC750-WiFi-Range-Extender/dp/B07N1WW638&amp;xcust=2-2-695032-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Wi-Fi extender or repeater</a>, which take the wireless signal from a router and rebroadcast it farther away. (&ldquo;Extender&rdquo; sometimes refers to a device with a wired connection to the router, though I often see both terms used interchangeably.)</p>



<p>My experience with Wi-Fi extenders is hit or miss. Wireless repeaters will always degrade whatever signal they receive, so the benefits can cancel out if you&rsquo;re trying to address a dead zone or interference from other nearby wireless devices. The same is true with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631890/devolo-magic-2-wi-fi-next-review.html">powerline adapters</a>, which send a wired ethernet connection from your router to another part of the house through your wall outlets. Depending on how your house is wired, this approach can give you a weak connection or not work at all.</p>



<p>I don&rsquo;t tell people to avoid extenders outright, because they can work in some scenarios, but keep your expectations low and be prepared to return the device if it doesn&rsquo;t help. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394819/how-to-set-up-a-wi-fi-extender.html">how to set up a Wi-Fi extender</a> if you decide to go that route.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397435/best-mesh-wi-fi-routers.html">mesh Wi-Fi system</a> will be the surest way to solve your Wi-Fi problems, especially in larger homes or ones with lots of dead zones. These systems let you plug in multiple access points throughout the house, creating one big network. They&rsquo;re better at managing connections than a router with an extender, and systems advertised as &ldquo;Tri-Band&rdquo; can connect each access point without congesting the rest of the network.</p>



<p>Such systems might not be necessary, though. If you haven&rsquo;t replaced your router in a while, even a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624515/tp-link-gx90-review-a-supremely-powerful-gaming-router.html">new standalone router</a> might be enough to power through dead zones if they&rsquo;re not too far away. Standalone routers are generally less expensive than mesh systems, and some have features that mesh systems lack, such as USB storage support or a large number of ethernet ports.</p>

<p>Ultimately, though, there&rsquo;s no way to tell for sure if a new router will work without trying it yourself. You can read all sorts of reviews&mdash;PCWorld reviews both <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397435/best-mesh-wi-fi-routers.html">Wi-Fi mesh systems</a> and the latest <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624515/tp-link-gx90-review-a-supremely-powerful-gaming-router.html">Wi-Fi 6E routers</a>&mdash;but even the best advice isn&rsquo;t one-size-fits-all. Buying a new router will always involve a leap of faith.</p>



<h2><strong>A note on modem/router combos</strong></h2>



<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s one more complicating factor: Although cable companies used to distribute internet modems and routers separately&mdash;the former bringing in the internet from outside the house, and the latter to distributing Wi-Fi through the home&mdash;it&rsquo;s increasingly common now to get both functions in one box. That makes installation easier for the cable company, but makes router replacement trickier for you.</p>



<p>If you have a combo box and are paying for it in rental fees, consider replacing it with two devices: A new router and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-cable-modem/&amp;xcust=2-2-695032-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a separate cable modem</a>. But be aware that some companies&mdash;particularly fiber-optic internet providers such as AT&amp;T and Verizon&mdash;make replacing the modem component difficult or impossible.</p>



<p>If replacing the modem isn&rsquo;t possible or necessary, you can just disable its Wi-Fi features so they don&rsquo;t interfere with your new router. The instructions for doing so can vary by provider, so expect to do some Googling of &ldquo;modem mode&rdquo; or &ldquo;bridge mode&rdquo; plus the name of your internet provider.</p>
