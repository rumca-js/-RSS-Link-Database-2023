Primary medical care has morphed into general practice in two senses. First, members of the primary healthcare team are no longer necessarily medically qualified, but may be drawn from nursing, physiotherapy and other professions. Second, the primary function of GPs \u2013 diagnosing and treating mental and physical illness in the community \u2013 has been subsumed into a tsunami of additional tasks. Some have been imposed by government or academic diktat, others requested by an increasingly needy and demanding public.</p><p>I am pleased that the Guardian qualified one of the proposed conditions, urinary tract infections (UTI). Other media sources were less careful. Uncomplicated UTI in women is usually easy to manage, but not always easy to diagnose. Other conditions need to be considered, including sexually transmitted disease and interstitial (autoimmune) cystitis. Also, men and trans women require specifically tailored treatment. Good medical care is surprisingly complex and difficult to achieve.

I\u2019ve done it once before and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/apr/15/how-i-built-a-gaming-pc\">wrote an article about what a nightmare the process was</a> \u2013 although the issue turned out to be with the USB stick I used to install the motherboard update patch and \u2026 well, don\u2019t get me started. The thing is, I figured it out because when you have played PC games for as long as I have, you know that figuring technical stuff out is a key part of the experience.</p><p>While games consoles have always been pure plug-and-play experiences, PC games have definitely not. When I started playing in the early 1990s, they came on multiple floppy discs \u2013 The Secret of Monkey Island was on eight \u2013 and you had to keep swapping them in and out of the drive, like feeding a voracious robot. Not that you necessarily bought complete games back then. I first played Wolfenstein 3D when my friend got the first couple of levels free on a magazine cover disc. That\u2019s how a lot of games were distributed \u2013 the famed shareware model. Once you\u2019d played the sample, you were supposed to contact the publisher to get the full game sent to you. Comparatively few people had the internet back then, so as a distribution model it made a lot of sense. It\u2019s rumoured that there were once more copies of the shareware version of Doom (pictured below) on PCs than there were copies of Microsoft Windows 95. This was just another oddity of being a PC gamer \u2013 having a drawer full of magazine front cover discs crammed with shareware and public domain mini games.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/10/pushing-buttons-how-to-build-gaming-pc\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/10/pushing-buttons-how-to-build-gaming-pc", "date_published": "2023-05-10 10:45:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Mother\u2019s Day brings only grief for those seeking Mexico\u2019s disappeared", "description": "<p>Mothers whose children have been abducted or are missing in endemic cartel-fueled violence have little cause to celebrate</p><p>Her final Mother\u2019s Day feels like it was yesterday.

Here\u2019s how we must defend it</p><p>Democratic freedoms are hard won and easily lost. Rights secured after generations of struggle \u2013 by citizens risking their safety, liberty and, indeed, lives \u2013 can be stripped away in weeks with barely a murmur. Such is the fate of the right to protest, which has now been redefined in the UK as a privilege that exists at the discretion of the police. This weekend, dozens of peaceful protesters advocating republicanism \u2013 a cause backed by <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/863893/support-for-the-monarchy-in-britain-by-age/\">around a quarter</a> of the population, or well over 13 million British adults \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/06/head-of-uks-leading-anti-monarchy-group-arrested-at-coronation-protest\">were arrested</a>. The Metropolitan police has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/08/arrests-coronation-protesters-premeditated-republic-chief-police\">expressed regret</a> at the arrest of six of them belonging to the Republic group, including its head, Graham Smith, but it is rather too late, not least because such repressive behaviour has a chilling effect that deters others from protesting.</p><p>The basis of their arrest offers an instructive lesson about how freedom is lost. All six of the Republic protesters were apprehended under the new Public Order Act, which allows for protesters to be arrested on suspicion of intending to \u201clock on\u201d \u2013 that is, to fix themselves to a target. In the case of these six arrested protesters, the \u201clock-on equipment\u201d was luggage straps to gather placards. When these laws are passed, opponents who warn they will be enforced far beyond their supposed remit are accused of hyperbole and scaremongering, yet they are invariably proven correct. Unless our politicians are completely stupid, they must be aware of how frequently legislation is used to curtail peaceful protest \u2013 and therefore we must conclude this is, in part, the intent. Given that the separate <a href=\"https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/advice_information/pcsc-policing-act-protest-rights/\">Policing Act</a> allows for protests to be suppressed if they are deemed too noisy \u2013 protests are, almost by definition, noisy \u2013 this reasoning seems beyond dispute.</p><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Rishi Sunak will take prime minister\u2019s questions for the first time today since his party suffered huge losses in the huge local elections. Normally, when a governing party faces defeat on a scale like this, there is some form of public backlash from MPs against the leadership. But this time backbenchers have been largely keeping quiet, and the most outspoken Tory critical of Sunak has been David Campbell Bannerman, a former Conservative MEP who used to be in Ukip. (If Sunak were in real trouble, no one would even know what Campbell Bannerman thought, because journalists would be quoting much more prominent figures instead.) At PMQs we will see whether support for Sunak is holding, or whether some of his MPs are starting to speak out.</p><p>As PMQs is taking place, peers will be debating the second reading of the illegal migration bill. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, is among those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/09/archbishop-of-canterbury-criticise-small-boats-bill-house-of-lords-justin-welby\">expected to condemn it</a>. Lord Paddick, the Lib Dem peer, has tabled an amendment saying the bill should not get a second reading because, among other reasons, it \u201cundermines the rule of law by failing to meet the United Kingdom\u2019s international law commitments\u201d. But in the Lords peers almost never vote against a bill at second reading, Labour is not backing the Paddick amendment, and the legislation will go through to its next stages.</p><p>It is entirely right that the Lords should scrutinise this important piece of legislation \u2013 that is the purpose of parliament\u2019s second chamber. At the same time, it must be balanced against the clear desire of the British people to control immigration. This was a government manifesto commitment in 2019, with a pledge to take back control of our borders.</p><p>And yet illegal migration is out of control. It is also intolerably unfair: on taxpayers, on would-be immigrants who do the right thing and play by the rules, on people who see accommodation and public services put under unbearable pressure, and on those sold a dangerous lie by wicked people smugglers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/may/10/suella-braverman-illegal-migration-bill-lords-rishi-sunak-conservatives-pmqs-uk-politics-latest\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/may/10/suella-braverman-illegal-migration-bill-lords-rishi-sunak-conservatives-pmqs-uk-politics-latest", "date_published": "2023-05-10 08:17:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Police arrest man in gimp suit who jumped in front of motorist in Somerset", "description": "<p>Man in his 30s, under investigation for previous incidents, held on suspicion of causing public nuisance</p><p>A man has been arrested after a motorist reported someone wearing a black gimp suit had jumped out in front of her.</p><p>Avon and Somerset police said a man in his 30s was being held on suspicion of causing a public nuisance after an alleged incident near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/10/police-arrest-man-gimp-suit-jumped-front-motorist-somerset\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/10/police-arrest-man-gimp-suit-jumped-front-motorist-somerset", "date_published": "2023-05-10 08:16:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Wetherspoon\u2019s enjoys record sales as people turn to cheaper pubs", "description": "<p>Pub chain reports highest Easter week sales and busiest-ever Saturday</p><p>The pub chain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jdwetherspoon\">JD Wetherspoon</a> has reported its highest Easter week sales and busiest-ever Saturday, with cash-conscious drinkers searching out cheaper options amid the cost of living crisis.</p><p>Wetherspoon\u2019s, which runs more than 830 branches across the UK and Ireland, said it had benefited from a rise in sales in the past two weeks, both of which included bank holiday weekends.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/10/wetherspoons-enjoys-record-sales-as-people-turn-to-cheaper-pubs\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/10/wetherspoons-enjoys-record-sales-as-people-turn-to-cheaper-pubs", "date_published": "2023-05-10 08:15:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Golden Age by Wang Xiaobo review \u2013 sex, death and politics", "description": "<p>This bawdy, irreverent Cultural Revolution classic is also bizarrely moving</p><p>During the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/the-cultural-revolution-50-years-on-all-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-political-convulsion\">Cultural Revolution</a>, children killed parents, lives were broken irrevocably, millions were beaten and starved to death \u2013 and Wang Xiaobo wrote an erotic comic novel about it all.</p><p>Now one of China\u2019s most popular modern writers, Wang was completely unknown when he released Golden Age in Taiwan in 1992; now it is available for the first time in complete form in a sparky, earthy translation by the young Chinese American translator Yan Yan.

Netflix\u2019s docudrama Queen Cleopatra tries to have its cake and eat it too: it has all the campy fun of Cleopatra the soap opera in dramatic re-enactments, but intersperses them with straight-faced expertise from academic talking heads.

Her Macedonian roots had spent eight generations in Egypt at the time of her birth, and many of the specifics of her family tree have been lost to the annals of time. But while that uncertainty opens her up to being played by any number of actors, it is notable that some see blue-eyed Elizabeth Taylor and Israeli Wonder Woman Gal Gadot as more accurate. Cleopatra\u2019s precise skin and hair texture are up for speculation, but to default to whiteness is insidious and ridiculous. Cultural acceptance of an image of a beautiful white woman with a straight jet-black bob does not make it a fact, as her portraits of the era are limited to the sides of coins, and tales of her stunning looks were written hundreds of years after her death.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/10/queen-cleopatra-review-a-fun-drama-weighed-down-by-the-self-serious-need-to-educate\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/10/queen-cleopatra-review-a-fun-drama-weighed-down-by-the-self-serious-need-to-educate", "date_published": "2023-05-10 08:00:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UFC-backed skateboarding tour leans into right-wing media ties", "description": "<p>The execs who steered the UFC from freak show to billion-dollar property are trying the same with a new skateboarding league \u2013 by partnering with the go-to streaming site of the right</p><p>The Street League Skateboarding (SLS) Championship Tour made a thrilling return last month in Chicago.
