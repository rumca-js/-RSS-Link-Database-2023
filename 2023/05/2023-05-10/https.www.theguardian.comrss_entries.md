<p>Republican voter event in New Hampshire comes after Trump is told to pay $5m in damages to E Jean Carroll</p><p><em>The CNN town hall will be Donald Trump’s first television appearance since being found liable for sexual abuse and defamation by a federal jury in New York City on Tuesday. Don’t expect contrition; among other things, the former president called the verdicts a “disgrace” minutes after they were handed down. As the Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joan-greve">Joan E Greve</a> reports, the curious among the audience of Republican and undeclared voters may still decide to ask him about it:</em></p><p>Donald Trump could face questions about being found to have sexually abused E Jean Carroll when he participates in a CNN town hall on Wednesday night.</p><p><strong>What’s his reaction</strong> to the finding by a federal jury on Tuesday that he was civilly liable for sexually abusing and defaming advice columnist <strong>E Jean Carroll</strong>? The verdict in the lawsuit was one of the biggest legal losses Trump has suffered recently, and in that regard, he doesn’t appear to be out of the woods yet …</p><p><strong>What will happen</strong> if he’s indicted by a grand jury for tampering with the 2020 election, hiding classified documents or instigating the January 6 insurrection? Justice department-appointed special counsel <strong>Jack Smith</strong> is looking into all of the above, while Atlanta-area district attorney <strong>Fani Willis</strong> is investigating his attempts to overturn <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s win in Georgia three years ago.</p><p><strong>Would he back a national abortion ban?</strong> Abortion opponents are a major voting bloc for Republicans, but Trump has demurred as to whether he would support banning the practice nationwide.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/may/10/trump-town-hall-cnn-republicans-live-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ukrainian commander says Russian forces pushed back in Bakhmut; Britain set to blacklist Wagner as terrorist organisation</p><p><strong>A Ukrainian military commander has said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/10/russians-near-bakhmut-have-retreated-by-up-to-2km-ukrainian-official-says">Russian forces in Bakhmut had been pushed back</a> by up to 2km in some areas,</strong> after counter offensives. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, who heads Ukraine’s ground forces, made the comments in a post on Telegram. He said: “In some areas of the front, the enemy could not resist the onslaught of the Ukrainian defenders and retreated to a distance of up to two kilometers.”</p><p><strong>Russia’s military operation against Ukraine is “very difficult” but certain goals have been achieved, Tass cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying on Wednesday. </strong>Russia has succeeded in severely damaging Ukraine’s military machine and this work will continue, he added.</p><p><strong>Russia’s oil pipeline operator Transneft said that a filling point on the Europe-bound Druzhba pipeline in a border area between Russia and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> had been targeted in a “terrorist” attack,</strong> according to the Tass news agency. Transneft said nobody was injured in the incident, which it called a “terrorist attack”, according to Reuters.</p><p><strong>It comes as Ukraine’s military said its forces have seriously damaged Russia’s 72nd independent motorised rifle brigade near Bakhmut, </strong>made up of thousands of troops. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukrainian troops in the east, said the situation remained “difficult” in Bakhmut but Moscow was increasingly forced to use regular army units because of heavy losses among the Wagner private army group.</p><p><strong>France’s anti-terrorism prosecution office on Wednesday announced it had opened an investigation for possible war crimes and crimes against humanity</strong> after an AFP video journalist was killed on Tuesday by Grad rocket fire near Chasiv Yar, in eastern Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin has complained that his fighters were still not getting enough shells from the official defence ministry. </strong>In an audio statement, he said the defence ministry had been holding long meetings on the shell issue but there had been no breakthrough. “We’re not receiving enough shells, we’re only getting 10%,” Prigozhin said, reported Reuters.</p><p><strong>The French parliament has called on the EU to formally label the Wagner group terrorists. </strong>France’s parliament unanimously passed a non-binding resolution aimed at encouraging the 27 members of the EU to put Wagner on its official list of terrorist organisations.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/10/uk-proscribing-wagner-group-as-terrorist-will-help-ukrainians-sue-says-lawyer">Britain is also set to formally blacklist Wagner</a> as a terrorist organisation to increase pressure on Russia,</strong> the Times reported on Tuesday. After two months of building a legal case, proscription or a formal blacklisting of the group was “imminent” and likely to be enacted within weeks, the newspaper reported, citing a government source.</p><p><strong>Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday he thought </strong><strong>the Ukraine</strong><strong> Black Sea grain deal could be extended for at least two more months,</strong> as officials held the first day of talks on an extension in Istanbul. Russia has said it would not extend the pact beyond 18 May unless a list of demands is met to remove obstacles to its own grain and fertiliser exports. Cavusoglu was speaking to reporters on his return from a trip to Moscow.</p><p><strong>Russian forces are planning to “evacuate” more than 3,000 workers from the town that serves the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, </strong>resulting in a “catastrophic lack” of personnel, Ukraine’s state-owned Energoatom company claimed on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>Former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder has been criticised again for his links to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> after attending a Victory Day party at the Russian embassy in Berlin.</strong> Schröder was seen at the reception on Tuesday marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war, along with senior figures from the far-right Alternative for Germany party and the far-left Linke party.</p><p><strong>Russia may formally “denounce” the treaty on conventional armed forces in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> that it pulled out of in 2015, </strong>according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.</p><p><strong>The governor of Russia’s Voronezh region said on Wednesday that two drones attempted to attack a military facility in his region,</strong> but failed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/11/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-442-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Minerva theatre, Chichester<br /></strong>Amy Herzog’s play about a grandmother surprised by her grandson is given a contemplative staging by Richard Eyre</p><p>Timothée Chalamet and Eileen Atkins were fully rehearsed for this family drama at London’s Old Vic when theatres closed due to Covid in 2020. After its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/05/timothee-chalamets-west-end-debut-cancelled-after-two-years-of-postponements">eventual cancellation</a>, Atkins picks up her role as 91-year-old Greenwich Village lefty Vera, directed instead by Richard Eyre in Chichester, opposite Heartstopper’s Sebastian Croft in lieu of Chalamet.</p><p>Croft plays Vera’s 21-year-old grandson, Leo, who arrives out of the blue after a cross-country bike ride. Leo has hauled plenty of baggage with him, which is unpacked over several weeks. Amy Herzog’s 2011 play (a Pulitzer finalist) may have the familiar premise of odd couple flatmates but is distinguished by their startling topics of conversation: the amount of tongue, for example, used in Leo’s recent kiss with his adopted sister, or how his girlfriend Bec has “kind of a weird pussy”.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.cft.org.uk/events/4000-miles">Minerva theatre</a>, Chichester, until 10 June</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/11/4000-miles-review-eileen-atkins-sebastian-croft-chichester">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After the silence, the explosion. It was the biggest game this city has seen in two decades, and if there was a certain restraint to the emotions at full time it was only the knowledge that next week’s will be bigger still. Yet after 90 minutes we have a clear favourite: Simone Inzaghi’s flawed but fearless Inter Milan, who claimed the spoils in a startling opening burst and then held off their bitter rivals through gritted teeth, and against an atmosphere that shook the senses.</p><p>Even on their home turf this was an away game for Inter, and as pre-match nerves gave way to open hostility, they produced a performance to stand alongside any in the club’s recent European history. Edin Dzeko and Henrikh Mkhitaryan claimed the goals, but in reality this was a triumph of leadership: not so much from Inzaghi himself but from the big-game players who did their jobs, won their duels, sensed and sniffed their way through the sort of game for which no team talk or training can really prepare you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/10/milan-internazionale-champions-league-semi-final-first-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Paddy Wivell’s documentary about families rebuilding relationships does away with formality, wins its subjects’ trust and finds shocking moments – plus plenty of hope</p><p>‘Before, if Xorin had killed someone, I’d’ve said: ‘Right, I’m gonna grass you up.’ Now, it’s like: ‘Mate, I’ll help you bury the body.’ That’s how close we’ve become.” Xorin is 17 and his potential partner in crime is Kelly, his mother – the first teen/parent pair we meet in Kids, Paddy Wivell’s three-part documentary utilising unprecedented access to the work of Coventry children’s services. In a programme that finds some despair and a lot more hope in how errant parents are given second chances, what Kelly is saying is: she’s getting it right this time.</p><p>Three years ago, Xorin was moved by CCS from Kelly’s house in Coventry to a residential children’s home in south Wales, for his own safety. An argument at home had ended with Kelly slapping him, and a gang had corralled him into dealing crack and heroin. Now he’s back on a trial basis and, when we initially encounter Kelly, she seems maddeningly complacent. “Who the fuck are you then, girl?” she cheerfully asks a young woman from CCS who has perched, a little gingerly, on the sofa, clipboard on knee. Asked to rate her own parenting, Kelly awards herself a series of nines and tens.</p><p>Kids is on Channel 4.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/10/kids-review-a-startling-unprecedented-look-at-children-in-care">Continue reading...</a>

Emma Hayes’s options in attack are enviable. Guro Reiten and Sam Kerr got one apiece, a partnership up front that has defined their season.

## A prescription for added pressure on pharmacists | Letters

<p>Readers respond to the government’s proposal to allow pharmacists in England to prescribe drugs for some common conditions</p><p>I am concerned but not at all surprised that pharmacists may be asked to treat certain acute illnesses (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/09/pharmacies-england-prescriptions-seven-conditions-amid-surgery-crisis" title="">Pharmacies in England to offer prescriptions for seven conditions amid surgery crisis, 9 May</a>). Primary medical care has morphed into general practice in two senses. First, members of the primary healthcare team are no longer necessarily medically qualified, but may be drawn from nursing, physiotherapy and other professions. Second, the primary function of GPs – diagnosing and treating mental and physical illness in the community – has been subsumed into a tsunami of additional tasks. Some have been imposed by government or academic diktat, others requested by an increasingly needy and demanding public.</p><p>I am pleased that the Guardian qualified one of the proposed conditions, urinary tract infections (UTI). Other media sources were less careful. Uncomplicated UTI in women is usually easy to manage, but not always easy to diagnose. Other conditions need to be considered, including sexually transmitted disease and interstitial (autoimmune) cystitis. Also, men and trans women require specifically tailored treatment. Good medical care is surprisingly complex and difficult to achieve. I fervently hope that my pharmacist colleagues are given the training and resources they will require.<br /><strong>Dr Peter Baddeley</strong><br /><em>Painswick, Gloucestershire</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/10/a-prescription-for-added-pressure-on-pharmacists">Continue reading...</a>

When they came to my very racially diverse urban comprehensive school, all staff were issued with bright yellow forms on which to record every inspector’s visit to a class, and any interaction with students or staff during the lesson. This was done quite overtly, so Ofsted knew what was happening.</p><p>Interviews with heads of department and senior staff outside the classroom were audio-recorded. Students knew what was happening and closed ranks against the perceived “enemy”. Behaviour was exemplary, and they all praised the school to the skies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/10/when-ofsted-got-a-taste-of-its-own-medicine">Continue reading...</a>

## Sabalenka’s progress faces test as she enters Swiatek’s Rome fortress | Tumaini Carayol

<p>Just how much the world No 2 has closed the gap on her rival could become clear on the slow clay in Italy</p><p>Early in the second set of the Madrid Open final, Aryna Sabalenka was in full flow. After planting herself inside the baseline, Sabalenka <a href="https://twitter.com/WTA/status/1654906682185781249">unloaded on her nuclear groundstrokes</a>, slamming the ball from side to side. Each time she seemed to have landed the decisive blow, though Iga Swiatek would slide into view in the nick of time, her supreme defence keeping her alive. It took 10 strokes until Sabalenka finally drilled a crosscourt backhand winner past her.</p><p>The point was an example of the impact that Swiatek herself has had on the players beneath her. A year ago, the world No 1’s defensive prowess would have elicited an unforced error from Sabalenka in a similar situation. But the Belarusian spent her off-season working hard in Miami on pushing herself to new athletic heights with Swiatek in mind; her footwork was spectacular. Even when she was pushed back behind the baseline or out of position, she skipped around the ball with pristine footwork and gave herself sufficient space to unload again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/10/aryna-sabalenka-iga-swiatek-rome-open-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

## Sergio Busquets: the unique talent who changed Barcelona and the game

<p>The midfielder, the key figure as the pivot of the team despite his work often going unnoticed, is leaving Barcelona at the end of the season</p><p>Timing was always Sergio Busquets’ greatest gift, and now he has decided it is time to go. “It wasn’t an easy decision but the moment has come,” the Barcelona captain said. In two months he turns 35; in four days he leads his team into the derby against Espanyol, knowing that a win would make them champions again. The <em>ninth</em> La Liga title of his career will also be his last. At the end of this, his 15th, season he will leave the Camp Nou and “the club of my life”, an era closing with him.</p><p>Xavi Hernández, once Busquets’ teammate and now his coach, had wanted him to stay, just as Luis Enrique had wanted him to continue with the national team. But Busquets retired from international football after Qatar and he is departing Barcelona too, destination as yet unknown, after negotiations over a new contract failed to end in agreement. There is no one left in the Spain team who won the World Cup, no one left in Catalonia from the team that won it all, the generation that changed everything, including the game itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/10/sergio-busquets-the-unique-talent-who-changed-barcelona-and-football">Continue reading...</a>

Veteran stage and screen actor who starred in the BBC children’s TV series The Demon Headmaster<p>Terrence Hardiman, who has died aged 86, was an actor whose military bearing and deadpan, silently sinister look naturally led him to be cast as authority figures – most memorably as the star of the BBC television children’s drama The Demon Headmaster, in which the description “authoritarian” was more appropriate.</p><p>The programme, which began in 1996, was compulsive viewing with its stories of Hardiman’s terrifying megalomaniac exerting hypnotic powers over his pupils. In the opening episode Dinah Glass, an orphan, sits at the head’s desk as he takes off his dark glasses, stares at her with his piercing green eyes and says: “Funny you should be so tired so early in the morning. So tired you can hardly move your arms and legs. You are tired, so tired. You feel your head begin to nod and, slowly, your eyes are starting to close.

<p>The Grammy-winning songwriter’s new album is her first for a major label. But does it risk enraging her core audience – and opening up a cautious musician to mainstream expectations?</p><p>In March Lauren Daigle released Thank God I Do, the first single from her forthcoming self-titled album. The music video is set on a flower-festooned street in her home state of Louisiana. Daigle, equally garlanded, wanders through them singing uplifting things about love. Many of the YouTube comments mention how it has touched their hearts or helped them through a difficult time. They make the ones accusing of her apostasy and paganism sound even more unreasonable.</p><p>Daigle, 31, has experienced plenty of these kinds of attacks. For a decade the two-time Grammy winner has been one of the biggest names in contemporary Christian music (CCM), a multimillion-dollar industry that tends to go unnoticed beyond its religious base. Its most popular hits are regularly incorporated into modern worship in churches worldwide. Meanwhile its artists exist under a unique level of scrutiny.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/10/its-in-my-blood-to-see-barriers-break-christian-pop-star-lauren-daigle-on-trump-trolling-and-abortion">Continue reading...</a>

## From rampaging teenagers to female assassins: why has East German culture become so cool?

<p>Is Britain’s sudden appetite for the GDR an unhealthy obsession? Katja Hoyer, author of Beyond the Wall, examines the new wave of books and shows about life under the Stasi in the vanished state</p><p>“It is obviously incredibly difficult to understand and make comprehensible how we lived back then,” sighed a frustrated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel">Angela Merkel</a> shortly before she was appointed chancellor of Germany in 2005. She was about to become one of the most powerful women on Earth, yet the world made no effort to understand how she had got to this point. Occasionally a commentator would remark that she was different from other German politicians: a scientist, a woman, and from the East! But like many others who were born in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), as East Germany was officially called, Merkel found that any references to this past were met with derision or even suspicion. It was “as if this life before German reunification didn’t really count,” she said in 2021 in a rare public show of her frustration, “no matter what good and bad experiences one had.”</p><p>More than three decades have now passed since the Berlin Wall fell and, like Merkel’s, other East German voices are finally beginning to break through. And not just in Germany. There is a new and much welcome curiosity in Britain, too, about what life was really like in the countries that once lay behind the iron curtain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/10/rampaging-teenagers-female-assassins-east-german-culture-cool-kleo-wall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When you’re dealing with the day’s big issues, a little hesitation is natural. But mine got out of control</p><p>‘Could you de-um this please?” the producer asked, handing me a reel of quarter-inch audio tape. Being eager to please, I told him I’d be happy to, even though I knew not what he was on about. This was 1994. I had just started working at BBC Radio and was still learning the ropes. Furtively, I sought a friendly face to tell me a) what de-umming was and b) how to go about it.</p><p>It turned out to be exactly what it sounded like – removing the ums, ers and ahs from recorded interviews. It really was the most infernal fiddle, involving razor blades and bits of sticky tape, for which I had neither the skills nor the patience. Mercifully, before long, someone having decided that I should be a presenter, de-umming no longer seemed to be my responsibility. I’ve not wielded a razor blade in a quarter of a century, and neither has anyone else since quarter-inch tape became obsolete. There must be billions of miles of it somewhere. Has all the audio been digitised and the tape disposed of?

<p><strong>Alexandra Palace, London</strong><br />Creating a nostalgic pop punk party for fans of her noughties hits, the Canadian remains a great singer and performer</p><p>‘Some things never changed after all these years – I still love skater boys!” proclaims a giddy Avril Lavigne to a sold out Alexandra Palace. An explosion of red confetti, cheap guitar riffs, and bratty pop punk vocals about an unlikely romance between a girl who does ballet and an adolescent punk then combine to inspire non-stop whooping from the crowd.</p><p>When Lavigne, now 38, initially released Sk8er Boi in 2002, she was a teenager providing mixtape anthems for jorts-wearing teens who snogged one another in mall car parks. This is reflected by tonight’s nostalgic outfit (red tartan skirt and hole-ridden tights) and a largely thirtysomething audience, with the skater boys now skater dads. But nostalgia is one hell of a drug, and it’s hard not to feel re-energised by a crowd who treat Ally Pally like it’s the raucous dancefloor at a high school reunion, air guitars and all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/10/avril-lavigne-review-alexandra-palace-london">Continue reading...</a>

## Abomination: A DUP Opera review – brilliant satire skewers politicians with their own words

<p><strong>Theatre Royal, Brighton<br /></strong>Anger seethes beneath the Belfast Ensemble’s waltzes in Conor Mitchell’s scathing denunciation of homophobia and hate speech</p><p>Conor Mitchell’s Abomination: A DUP Opera, a scathingly brilliant satire about homophobia, hate speech and the people who perpetrate it, comes to the Brighton festival after performances in Dublin and London with the same cast that gave <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/18/abomination-dup-opera-belfast-arlene-foster-drag-queen-gay-cake">the Belfast premiere in 2019</a>. The opera’s starting point is <a href="https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/iris-robinson-slammed-for-offering-gay-cure/28519012.html">Iris Robinson’s notorious Radio Ulster interview</a> with Stephen Nolan in 2008, during which Robinson, a Democratic Unionist Party MP and wife of Northern Ireland’s then first minister, was asked to reflect on her previous description of homosexuality as “an abomination” in the wake of a recent attack on a gay man in Belfast. Robinson refused to retract her comments, and went on to recommend the services of “a lovely psychiatrist” who peddled conversion practices.</p><p>The interview, set verbatim, forms the basis of Mitchell’s libretto, though he expands the text with quotes from other DUP members, whose comparable expressions of prejudice are sung by an ensemble of four vocalists and streamed as newsprint or documentary footage across screens behind the performers. Mitchell in part allows his politicians to skewer themselves with their own words, though the real brilliance here lies in the scorn to which his music subjects their appalling utterances.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/10/conor-mitchell-abomination-a-dup-opera-review-theatre-royal-brighton">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Being found liable for sexual assault would normally leave your career in tatters. But the cult of Trump means nothing is out of the question</p><p>Donald Trump has boasted about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/10/trump-access-hollywood-tape-evidence-jean-carroll-trial">grabbing women by the pussy</a> without their consent. He has made innumerable misogynistic comments. He has been accused of sexual misconduct by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/17/amy-dorris-donald-trump-women-who-accuse-sexual-misconduct">at least 26 women</a>. He has suggested that some of the women who have accused him of misconduct were <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-jessica-leeds-accusations-229805">too unattractive to assault</a>. And, until this week, he has managed to get away with all of it. Trump has faced no meaningful consequences for his actions; he has given every impression of being above the law.</p><p>Until this week. It may have taken decades, but the law has finally caught up with Trump. On Tuesday, a jury in New York found that the former president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/09/e-jean-carroll-wins-trump-trial-verdict">sexually abused the advice columnist E Jean Carroll</a> in the changing room of a department store 27 years ago. It was a civil case, so Trump hasn’t been taken away in handcuffs, but his reputation and his wallet have suffered a blow. While the jury <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/05/trump-e-jean-carroll-verdict-rape-sexual-abuse.html">did not find that Trump raped Carroll</a>, its verdict brands him a sexual predator.

## Agustina Bazterrica: ‘Capitalism and cannibalism are almost the same’

<p>The Argentinian writer on her new short-story collection and how her dystopian novel about a human meat industry became a TikTok sensation</p><p>Every day, upon leaving her Catholic high school, Agustina Bazterrica and her friends were followed by the same predatory man who would aim “the most terrible words” in their direction. A different man once masturbated in front of her on a packed train. “No one did anything,” she recalls. Coupled with the epidemic of violence against women in her native Argentina – where <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102274/number-femicide-victims-argentina/#:~:text=Argentina%3A%20femicide%20victims%202015%2D2022&amp;text=In%202021%2C%20a%20total%20of,classified%20as%20femicides%20in%20Argentina.">212 femicides</a> were reported in 2022 – these early experiences nurtured the feeling that “because you are a woman, anything can happen to you at any time”.</p><p>This sense of ever-present threat permeates the author’s new short story collection, 19 Claws and a Black Bird, translated by Sarah Moses, which serves up a smörgåsbord of assault, murder and suicide. It follows Bazterrica’s second novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/21/tender-is-the-flesh-agustina-bazterrica-review">Tender Is the Flesh</a>, set in a world where cannibalism has been legalised after a virus renders animal meat unfit for human consumption. That novel laid bare the violence in everyday experiences of womanhood through visceral, often shocking prose: for example, a female “head” (the euphemistic word for human livestock) has her vocal cords removed to prevent her from screaming.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/10/agustina-bazterrica-capitalism-and-cannibalism-are-almost-the-same">Continue reading...</a>

Many years ago, I loved being a junior doctor.

A doctor coming on shift is handed a long list of tasks: when they eventually hand over to the next team, they pass on a similar one.

The thing is, I figured it out because when you have played PC games for as long as I have, you know that figuring technical stuff out is a key part of the experience.</p><p>While games consoles have always been pure plug-and-play experiences, PC games have definitely not. When I started playing in the early 1990s, they came on multiple floppy discs – The Secret of Monkey Island was on eight – and you had to keep swapping them in and out of the drive, like feeding a voracious robot. Not that you necessarily bought complete games back then. I first played Wolfenstein 3D when my friend got the first couple of levels free on a magazine cover disc. That’s how a lot of games were distributed – the famed shareware model. Once you’d played the sample, you were supposed to contact the publisher to get the full game sent to you. Comparatively few people had the internet back then, so as a distribution model it made a lot of sense. It’s rumoured that there were once more copies of the shareware version of Doom (pictured below) on PCs than there were copies of Microsoft Windows 95. This was just another oddity of being a PC gamer – having a drawer full of magazine front cover discs crammed with shareware and public domain mini games.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/10/pushing-buttons-how-to-build-gaming-pc">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I relate because I’m also that uncool guy’: inside Ed Sheeran’s mysterious fanbase

<p>For a pop superstar, Sheeran’s stans – unlike the Swifties or the BeyHive – are unusually low-key. As he releases an exposing new album, his ‘Sheerios’ discuss their bond</p><p>E<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran">d Sheeran</a> is very aware of the contradictions at the heart of his superstardom. The first line of his new Disney+ documentary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/02/ed-sheeran-the-sum-of-it-all-review-a-surprisingly-moving-intimate-view-of-marriage-loss-and-mental-health">The Sum of It All</a>, finds the multi-platinum songwriter declaring: “I’m speccy, ginger hair, really short, English, from the countryside, who stutters and beatboxes. That guy doesn’t become a pop star.” Yet 16 Grammy nominations, 14 UK No 1 singles and 150m record sales later, here we are.</p><p>His success has brought with it another paradox. For one of the biggest pop stars in the world, Sheeran’s presumably gigantic hardcore fanbase is unusually quiet compared to stans of other superstar acts: Swifties, the BeyHive or the Styles-loving Harries. It’s quite possible that you had no idea they’re known as the Sheerios, a sobriquet that lacks immediate brand recognition. While the documentary shows jubilant fans singing along at his stadium shows, wearing DIY T-shirts bearing the mathematical symbols Sheeran has named his albums after, they rarely get into conflagrations online; unlike Styles, Swift or even Drake admirers, there’s little wider sense of a distinct fan culture with its own language, memes and even infighting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/10/ed-sheeran-fans-sheerios-documentary-the-sum-of-it-all">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Humphry Davy on laughing gas, Sigmund Freud on cocaine … how self-experimentation shaped science and art</p><p>Before writing this review, I got hold of some tiny canisters of nitrous oxide, filled a balloon or two and, watched by my bemused wife, breathed in the gas. It gave me no more of a buzz than smoking a cigarette. I must have been doing it wrong because, according to Mike Jay’s compelling history of narcotic self-exploration, it was when the chemist Humphry Davy began inhaling this newly discovered gas in Bristol in 1799, sometimes in the company of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, that he started a revolution. While high, Davy declared that “Nothing exists but thoughts!”</p><p>This insight wasn’t new, of course. Bishop Berkeley had made it the cornerstone of his philosophy. Yet for Davy, it felt transformative. Another laughing gas lover, the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29559088/" title="">psychologist William James</a>, later observed that there are two types of people: the once-born and the twice-born. The once-born accept the world as it is and get on with it. The twice-born have a life-changing insight or vision. Some become questing, drug-ingesting “psychonauts” as a result – and it is they who form the focus of this fascinating book.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/10/psychonauts-by-mike-jay-review-the-drug-takers-who-changed-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Players from Ferguson’s extraordinary Aberdeen side recall a ‘miracle’ as Madrid fell to defeat in a major European cup final</p><p>“Nothing short of a miracle” is how Sir Alex Ferguson has described the most astonishing victory of his managerial career.

## Consider the coronation arrests – and witness Britain’s slide towards authoritarianism | Owen Jones

<p>The Public Order Act shows how this Tory government is hollowing out our democracy. Here’s how we must defend it</p><p>Democratic freedoms are hard won and easily lost. Rights secured after generations of struggle – by citizens risking their safety, liberty and, indeed, lives – can be stripped away in weeks with barely a murmur. Such is the fate of the right to protest, which has now been redefined in the UK as a privilege that exists at the discretion of the police. This weekend, dozens of peaceful protesters advocating republicanism – a cause backed by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/863893/support-for-the-monarchy-in-britain-by-age/">around a quarter</a> of the population, or well over 13 million British adults – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/06/head-of-uks-leading-anti-monarchy-group-arrested-at-coronation-protest">were arrested</a>. The Metropolitan police has since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/08/arrests-coronation-protesters-premeditated-republic-chief-police">expressed regret</a> at the arrest of six of them belonging to the Republic group, including its head, Graham Smith, but it is rather too late, not least because such repressive behaviour has a chilling effect that deters others from protesting.</p><p>The basis of their arrest offers an instructive lesson about how freedom is lost. All six of the Republic protesters were apprehended under the new Public Order Act, which allows for protesters to be arrested on suspicion of intending to “lock on” – that is, to fix themselves to a target. In the case of these six arrested protesters, the “lock-on equipment” was luggage straps to gather placards. When these laws are passed, opponents who warn they will be enforced far beyond their supposed remit are accused of hyperbole and scaremongering, yet they are invariably proven correct. Unless our politicians are completely stupid, they must be aware of how frequently legislation is used to curtail peaceful protest – and therefore we must conclude this is, in part, the intent. Given that the separate <a href="https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/advice_information/pcsc-policing-act-protest-rights/">Policing Act</a> allows for protests to be suppressed if they are deemed too noisy – protests are, almost by definition, noisy – this reasoning seems beyond dispute.</p><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>Both Azdyne Amimour and Georges Salines have children who died in the attack that day – but Amimour’s son was one of the terrorists. They describe what brought them together and why their bond is so important</p><p>Huddled together at an outdoor cafe table in Paris, immersed in animated conversation, Azdyne Amimour and Georges Salines look like typical old friends. Admittedly, they’re something of an odd couple: Amimour, a French-Algerian in a flat cap, sneaks in a cigarette; Salines, a white, French retired doctor, has just locked up his bicycle and arrives in cycling gear. This is a friendship borne of extraordinary circumstances.</p><p>The date of 13 November 2015 is as deeply etched into Parisians’ memory as 9/11 is in the minds of New Yorkers. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/29/paris-attacks-trial-to-conclude-after-10-months-of-harrowing-testimony" title="">That night</a>, six separate Islamist terror attacks occurred in Paris, killing 130 people. The most deadly of all was at the Bataclan theatre, where three gunmen opened fire on a packed crowd during a gig, killing 90 people. Salines’ 28-year-old daughter, Lola, was one of the victims. Amimour’s son, Samy, also 28, was one of the attackers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/10/fathers-of-forgiveness-the-extraordinary-friendship-formed-in-the-shadow-of-the-bataclan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Latest updates: House of Lords debates second reading of illegal migration bill as ministers say public wants to control migration</p><p>Good morning. Rishi Sunak will take prime minister’s questions for the first time today since his party suffered huge losses in the huge local elections. Normally, when a governing party faces defeat on a scale like this, there is some form of public backlash from MPs against the leadership. But this time backbenchers have been largely keeping quiet, and the most outspoken Tory critical of Sunak has been David Campbell Bannerman, a former Conservative MEP who used to be in Ukip. (If Sunak were in real trouble, no one would even know what Campbell Bannerman thought, because journalists would be quoting much more prominent figures instead.) At PMQs we will see whether support for Sunak is holding, or whether some of his MPs are starting to speak out.</p><p>As PMQs is taking place, peers will be debating the second reading of the illegal migration bill. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, is among those <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/09/archbishop-of-canterbury-criticise-small-boats-bill-house-of-lords-justin-welby">expected to condemn it</a>. Lord Paddick, the Lib Dem peer, has tabled an amendment saying the bill should not get a second reading because, among other reasons, it “undermines the rule of law by failing to meet the United Kingdom’s international law commitments”. But in the Lords peers almost never vote against a bill at second reading, Labour is not backing the Paddick amendment, and the legislation will go through to its next stages.</p><p>It is entirely right that the Lords should scrutinise this important piece of legislation – that is the purpose of parliament’s second chamber. At the same time, it must be balanced against the clear desire of the British people to control immigration. This was a government manifesto commitment in 2019, with a pledge to take back control of our borders.</p><p>And yet illegal migration is out of control. It is also intolerably unfair: on taxpayers, on would-be immigrants who do the right thing and play by the rules, on people who see accommodation and public services put under unbearable pressure, and on those sold a dangerous lie by wicked people smugglers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/may/10/suella-braverman-illegal-migration-bill-lords-rishi-sunak-conservatives-pmqs-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>

## Queen Cleopatra review – the idea that you need a white actor is utterly insidious

<p>Adele James, who stars in this curious Netflix docudrama about ancient Egypt’s most famous queen is the best thing about it – despite the furore around her race</p><p>There’s often a debate about whether real-life subjects are better suited for drama or documentary treatment, the core (but admittedly oversimplified) belief being that documentaries serve primarily to educate while drama serves to entertain. Netflix’s docudrama Queen Cleopatra tries to have its cake and eat it too: it has all the campy fun of Cleopatra the soap opera in dramatic re-enactments, but intersperses them with straight-faced expertise from academic talking heads. Despite these historians’ impressive credentials, the drama outshines the testimony at every turn. Executive producer Jada Pinkett Smith delivers the narration with such sombre self-righteousness that it sucks the joy out of the atmosphere. It’s a deliciously fun drama weighed down by the self-serious need to educate.</p><p>The biggest buzz about Netflix’s latest comes from casting a Cleopatra with light brown skin and curly hair – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/28/cleopatra-was-light-skinned-egypt-tells-netflix-in-row-over-drama">it met with uproar from those who insisted that she couldn’t possibly be black</a>. This insistence on her whiteness is curious, as much of her lineage (including her mother’s race) is unknown. Her Macedonian roots had spent eight generations in Egypt at the time of her birth, and many of the specifics of her family tree have been lost to the annals of time. But while that uncertainty opens her up to being played by any number of actors, it is notable that some see blue-eyed Elizabeth Taylor and Israeli Wonder Woman Gal Gadot as more accurate. Cleopatra’s precise skin and hair texture are up for speculation, but to default to whiteness is insidious and ridiculous. Cultural acceptance of an image of a beautiful white woman with a straight jet-black bob does not make it a fact, as her portraits of the era are limited to the sides of coins, and tales of her stunning looks were written hundreds of years after her death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/10/queen-cleopatra-review-a-fun-drama-weighed-down-by-the-self-serious-need-to-educate">Continue reading...</a>

It will be the first election in American history in which one candidate has already been impeached – twice, in fact. It will be the first election since 1800 in which one of the major candidates can reasonably be called a threat to or disloyal to the United States of America (Aaron Burr in 1800 was the first).

<p>Private security firms are increasingly being used to patrol shops and private open spaces. What happens if they overreach their limited powers?</p><p>Earlier this year, a video of a black teenager being pinned to the ground and handcuffed in a Superdrug in Chichester went viral. Th<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/23/boy-handcuffed-civilian-security-staff-shop-chichester-superdrug">e video, posted by the 15-year-old’s mother</a>, shows the boy lying face down on the floor, two adult men kneeling on top of him and yanking his arms behind his back. The video brings to mind other such clips of force used against<strong> </strong>black people that have proliferated online in recent years; but in this case, things were different. The two men restraining the teenager were not police officers but private security guards.</p><p>Known as “rangers”, they are employed by a firm called Blayde Security, contracted by Chichester’s business improvement district (BID) to patrol the high street. Business improvement districts, introduced by New Labour and expanded by the coalition government, are defined areas where businesses pay into a fund to provide “additional or improved services” – such as extra cleaning or, as in this case, security. We do not yet have all the details of what happened in Chichester; the 15-year-old was arrested on suspicion of assault and a second teenager was arrested on suspicion of assault and other offences. Both were released on bail<strong> </strong>and the BID said it was cooperating with the police. But in the aftermath of the incident, the teenager’s mother Kirsty Buchanan – a former Downing Street aide – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/23/boy-handcuffed-civilian-security-staff-shop-chichester-superdrug">called for a review</a> of private security guards to examine “what due diligence is carried out before rangers are hired, what training they receive and what their remit is”. These are reasonable questions that go far beyond this one locality. As trust in police collapses amid a series of scandals and years of sharp spending cuts, we are seeing a rise of what might be termed “pseudo-police” across the UK.</p><p>Samira Shackle is a freelance journalist and a regular contributor to the Guardian long read.

<p>Two-time world champion thrived as most successful Briton in six-day racing and will be remembered fondly for his fight</p><p>I first met Tony Doyle in the lounge of a hotel near his home in Woking. He arrived early, smartly dressed and prepared to give up several hours for an interview about his cycling career. He was similarly generous with his time and wisdom during a friendship that lasted another eight or so years. He was also punctual without fail and I never saw him without a formal jacket. Tony was a proud man and the news of his death last Friday came as a shock.</p><p>I considered him a mate and I hoped the feeling was mutual. If I needed a quote, a contact or just fancied a chat, no request was too much for him. Sure, as a journalist, I was of use to Tony and he was happy to take advantage of that. But he helped me out far more often than I did him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/10/tony-doyle-british-cycling-world-championship-tour-of-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A conservationist’s search for meaning after his daughter’s sudden death</p><p>Ben Goldsmith’s remarkable memoir begins with his daughter, Iris, swimming into the sea to place her hands on the carcass of a humpback whale, captured by whalers off the island of Bequia in the Caribbean. The powerful image of the “teenage girl in the blood-red water unafraid, tenderly handling the dead monster” illustrates Iris’s reverence for the natural world as well as being a portent of tragedy.</p><p>In 2019, the gentle rhythm of a normal summer’s day was shattered by Iris’s death in an accident on the family farm in Somerset. Goldsmith’s world was thrown into disarray. He recounts those final, awful hours in quiet, careful prose that nevertheless lays bare their gut-wrenching agony.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/10/god-is-an-octopus-by-ben-goldsmith-review-the-consolations-of-nature">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With book bans continuing across the US, a museum in New York has assembled a hub for those defying extreme censorship</p><p>“I was struck by somebody who felt so strongly about his art that he was willing to create something that would get him potentially killed.” The artist Eric Gottesman is telling me about the Ethiopian novel Oromay, which was published in Amharic by author Baalu Girma in 1983, was banned five days later and ultimately got its author killed. “That dedication of an artist to speak truth to power was humbling, awe-inspiring, confusing – it made me ask, why do we do these things as artists?”</p><p>Selections from Gottesman’s Oromaye Project – in which the artist uses Oromay as a template for creative photographic work – are on display at Fotografiska in New York through 22 October in the show Listen Until You Hear, co-curated by the artist collective For Freedoms’ co-founders Gottesman and Michelle Woo. The multimedia show, which encourages audiences to develop their skills for “radical listening”, includes a banned books annex featuring books that have been prohibited in American schools since 2021.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/10/banned-books-museum-new-york-eric-gottesman-ethiopia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When a new friend told me his diagnosis, we were as alarmed as each other by my promise to write. But it made him feel less isolated – and led to a whole new direction for me too</p><p>As soon as I said it, I knew it sounded crazy. “I’ll write letters to cheer you up through your treatment.” Brian, sitting opposite me in the pub, back in the summer of 2010, looked bemused. He had just told me he’d been diagnosed with bowel cancer and I suspect he was hoping for a cure, not a correspondent. But when someone tells you something that devastating, I don’t think it’s unusual to feel awkward, helpless, and to say something you later wish you hadn’t.</p><p>Not only had I said I’d write (who writes letters these days, for goodness sake?),<br /> I’d said they’d cheer him up. So they’d have to be funny, and what is funny about cancer? Brian later told me he went home that night thinking I was a bit weird.

<p>To combat an ageing population, a future Japan passes a law to pay older citizens to sign up for an easeful death, in this weird and poignant film</p><p>This strange, melancholy film from Japan effectively makes the (unfashionable) case against euthanasia: that old people won’t want to be a bother or appear selfish and so will feel pressured into accepting state medicide. Director and co-writer Chie Hayakawa imagines a future in which Japan, burdened with an ageing population, proposes a supposedly voluntary but actually insidiously coercive arrangement called Plan 75, in which citizens of 75 years and above can sign up for an easeful death in return for 1,000 dollars which they can either spend on themselves or give away to their family. The system becomes a success, to the extent that a chilling Plan 65 is mooted, and the drama shows us how this creates a new burden for old people: the burden of explaining to themselves why they don’t just do the rational thing and end it all.</p><p>We see older characters retired from jobs which they really need, people without access to welfare and housing, old people who are desperately lonely and who even crave the Plan 75 helpline as someone to talk to. But the movie creates dissident moments: a young employee of Plan 75 realises that one applicant is his elderly uncle, while a Plan 75 call centre operative meets an old lady in person and takes her for an evening’s bowling, and realises that her colleagues are being trained in steering callers away from the last-minute change of heart which is the customer’s theoretical right.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/10/plan-75-review-life-is-terminated-at-75-in-melancholy-anti-euthanasia-drama">Continue reading...</a>

## Ditch your spade, forget fertiliser, listen to the weeds: Alys Fowler’s guide to laid-back gardening

<p>Itching to whip your flowerbeds or veg patch into shape now spring has finally arrived? Not so fast! Life’s much easier when you work with nature rather than against it</p><p>After almost 30 years of gardening, several of those at fine institutions such as the Royal Horticultural Society and Kew Gardens, I’ve realised that much of what I was taught is, if not wrong, not exactly on the mark either. All that laboured effort – the weeding, the fertilising, the digging, the tending and pruning, the selecting and conforming – it’s not working. Not for the plants, the soil or the community around them, which includes you and me. Indigenous cultures everywhere have based their practices on observing and honouring the ecology, while we in the “developed world” wrote down our rules. Our attempt to control nature has perpetuated poor relations with all the beings in the garden, turning everything into some sort of battle, or endless regimes whether that’s mowing, hoeing, watering or attacking some critter. It is a lot of work and these days way more than I am prepared to put in. Now spring is finally unfurling, this growing season, perhaps rather than going to work in our gardens, we could all relax a little, spend more time looking and listening, waiting rather than reacting, being in the garden as much as actively gardening. Here is how it’s done.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/10/ditch-your-spade-forget-fertiliser-listen-to-the-weeds-alys-fowlers-guide-to-laid-back-gardening">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My community ostracized me in the name of love. What followed was years of confusion</p><p>The night the world ended, I was at a bowling alley in a strip mall in the suburbs of Montreal, throwing strikes with other Jehovah’s Witness friends. Wholesome activities were the only way we could cool our hot teenage blood. If we weren’t bowling, we were at chaperoned, alcohol-free basement parties or outings to the cinema to watch movies that didn’t contravene God’s laws.</p><p>This one summer night at the lanes, I made the mistake of calling another young man handsome. My friends heard me but didn’t say anything. For the Witnesses, to be queer is an abomination. I had hidden my queerness successfully for years, suffocating my desires and my identity so that I could have a chance to live forever on a paradise earth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/09/jehovahs-witnesses-coming-out-lgbtq">Continue reading...</a>
