The possibilities for crime, mischief or adventure seem limitless, especially for a restless teenager. One night Kit, the introspective narrator of Rowan Hisayo Buchanan\u2019s third novel, rises from her bed in the room shared with younger brother Leo, but realises with a shock that her unresponsive body is still tucked up. Exploring this new freedom, Kit chances to peek at the hidden recesses of her parents\u2019 marriage, but how to interpret the scene is a puzzle that will consume her.</p><p>Just as disruptive poltergeist activity is associated with adolescence, Kit\u2019s out-of-body experiences coincide with a burgeoning sexuality and growing impatience with parental restriction.
