<p>In today’s newsletter: What you need to know about the verdicts against the former president – and what they mean for his hopes of returning to the White House</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email">Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition</a></strong></li></ul><p>Good morning. When E Jean Carroll, a magazine writer, came forward to describe how she was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump in a Manhattan department store in 1996, Trump called her claim “a complete con job” and accused her of making it up to sell books. But yesterday, a New York jury – in a civil, rather than criminal, case – disagreed. They <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/09/e-jean-carroll-wins-trump-trial-verdict">found that he was liable for sexual abuse and defamation</a> – and ordered him to pay her $5 million in damages.</p><p>The jury did not find that Trump had raped Carroll, as she alleged. But it said that he was shown by a preponderance of the evidence to have sexually abused her, and then told a malicious falsehood about her that did serious damage to her reputation. After years of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/17/amy-dorris-donald-trump-women-who-accuse-sexual-misconduct">credible allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump</a>, yesterday’s verdict is the first time that a court has said that such a claim has been proven to be true.</p><p><em><strong>Science </strong></em>| <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/09/first-uk-baby-with-dna-from-three-people-born-after-new-ivf-procedure">The first UK baby created with DNA from three people has been born</a> after a groundbreaking IVF procedure that aims to prevent children from inheriting incurable diseases. The technique, known as mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT), uses tissue from the eggs of healthy female donors to create embryos free from harmful mutations carried by their mothers.</p><p><em><strong>Pakistan</strong></em> | Internet services have been suspended across Pakistan after violence erupted when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/pakistan-former-pm-imran-khan-arrested-in-islamabad">the former prime minister, Imran Khan, was arrested at a court appearance in Islamabad</a> and dragged into an armoured vehicle by security forces in riot gear.
