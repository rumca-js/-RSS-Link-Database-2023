Take a behind-the-scenes look at a tense fight scene between Letty and Cipher in this featurette for Fast X. Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious saga, stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jason Momoa, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Sung Kang, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior, Scott Eastwood, Leo Abelo Perry, with Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, and Rita Moreno.

Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever. 

In 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. 

Dante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. 

Fast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum, and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis, and Mark Bomback.

Fast X, directed by Louis Leterrier, opens in theaters on May 19, 2023.

Check out the trailer for Padre Pio, an upcoming movie starring Shia LaBeouf, Cristina Chiriac, Marco Leonardi, Asia Argento, Vincenzo Crea, Luca Lionello, Brando Pacitto, Stella Mastrantonio, and Salvatore Ruocco. 

It is the end of World War I and the young Italian soldiers are making their way back to San Giovanni Rotondo, a land of poverty, historic violence and the iron clad rule of the church and its wealthy landowners. Families are desperate, the men are broken, but victorious. Padre Pio (Shia LaBeouf) also arrives, to a remote Capuchin monastery, to begin his ministry evoking an aura of compelling charisma, saintliness and storied visions of Jesus, Mary and the Devil himself. The eve of the first free election in Italy sets the stage for an historic, and metaphoric massacre, an apocalyptic event, one that changes the course of the world.

The film is produced by Diana Phillips, Philipp Kreuzer, and Maurizio Antonini and executive produced by Hammerstone’s Alex Lebovici, Keanu Mayo, and Kyle Stroud. It is written by Maurizio Braucci and Abel Ferrara.

Padre Pio, directed by Abel Ferrara, opens in theaters on June 2, 2023.

James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy wrapped up the sweet story of cosmic misfits finding family in each other with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It seems like it was just yesterday that Marvel Studios placed a big bet on this C-list team of comic book characters, but that bet paid off big. We're looking back at the Guardians' appearances in the MCU, and tracing how their unlikely involvement in the growing universe (and subsequent Infinity Saga) ended up shaping the rest of it. From humor to heart, and going beyond Earth and Asgard's atmospheres, the Guardians of the Galaxy will always have that lasting legacy on the MCU.

Honkai: Star Rail reviewed on PC by Jess Reyes.

"Honkai: Star Rail is the best free-to-play game of the year so far. Its stellar storytelling and satisfying progression systems offer dozens of hours of content that a HoYo newcomer can enjoy, even without paying for gacha items or having played Honkai Impact 3rd or Genshin Impact. Combat boasts layers of strategy for those willing to dig into details without barring more casual players from enjoying it. Its worldbuilding also expands outside of the main story into the side missions and interactable objects, making an already captivating world even more lively. It surpasses even Genshin in my mind, and I can see myself playing even months from now."

No Bloodborne sequel has been officially announced or even rumored, but that didn’t stop us from whipping up some homemade AI-generated boxart, complete with plot synopsis and features breakdown. To create this hypothetical masterpiece, we used a combination of text generated by Inferkit, images rendered by Playground AI, a logo from DesignEvo, a PS5 boxart template posted on Reddit, Photoshop, and the office laser printer. The result? Let’s just say, if this boxart is any indication, we’d prefer any potential Bloodborne sequel to be developed the old-fashioned way. With Bloodborne the action and survival elements come first. A new tip: turning off your auto-save in the menu!
