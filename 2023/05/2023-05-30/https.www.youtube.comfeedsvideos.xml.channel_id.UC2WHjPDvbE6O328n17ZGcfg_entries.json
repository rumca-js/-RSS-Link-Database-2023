It was to build DatasetGPT, that operates just like ChatGPT, but scrapes the internet for the information you\u2019re looking for and returns that as a dataset. The amount of data I\u2019ve needed over the past month is astounding, from scraping YouTube videos for market research to scraping Amazon to get me data on competitive products to a company I\u2019m hoping to buy. Now imagine one could just type \u201cget me the 10 most popular YouTube videos from these three channels\u201d into ChatGPT. Well that was DatasetGPT, and I made some progress on it too.\nBut as you'll find in the video, I need your help. Here\u2019s how to get started: Fork or clone the repositories.\nSo for the GPT API, you\u2019ll need to make an account and can utilize the free tokens. Change my credentials to your credentials.\nFor the Bright Data scraper, click this link https://brightdata.com/products/scraping-browser?utm_source=brand&amp;utm_campaign=brnd-mkt_youtube_fknight&amp;promo=fknight to make an account and utilize free spend limit. Go to dashboard, create a new proxy, name it want you want, and replace USERNAME:PASSWORD with yours - the host URL is the same. Ensure you have all of the dependencies installed using this command for the book-scraper: `npm install puppeteer-core` and this command for DatasetGPT: `npm install openai express cors body-parser`. If you need me to create a Wiki or README with this info, let me know.\nTest each one out and they should work. Now you\u2019re ready to combine the two to create my initial vision for DatasetGPT, which was really to act just like ChatGPT, but have the ability to access real-time data on the internet and scrape it via Bright Data\u2019s Scrapping Browser and Puppeteer, then return it as a dataset in the requested format. That\u2019s it.\n\nDatasetGPT Repo: https://github.com/ForrestKnight/DatasetGPT\nbook-scraper Repo: https://github.com/ForrestKnight/book-scraper\n\nThis video was sponsored by Bright Data\n\n------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\ude80 GitHub: https://github.com/forrestknight\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/forrestpknight\n\ud83d\udcbc LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestpknight\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/forrestpknight\n \n\ud83d\udcd3 Learning Resources: \nMy Favorite Machine Learning Course:  https://imp.i384100.net/YgYEBJ\nOpen Source Computer Science Degree:  https://bit.ly/open-source-forrest\nPython Open Source Computer Science Degree:  https://bit.ly/python-open-source\nUdacity to Learn Any Coding Skill: http://bit.ly/udacity-forrest\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb My Coding Gear:\nMy NAS Server: https://amzn.to/3brqO7b\nMy Hard Drives: https://amzn.to/3aKetMi\nMy Main Monitor: https://amzn.to/3siQfPa\nMy Second Monitor: https://amzn.to/3keHT84\nMy Standing Desk: https://amzn.to/3boAcbC\nMy PC Build:  https://bit.ly/my-coding-gear\nMy AI GPU: https://amzn.to/3uvmUmz", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1vJ71KnHY", "date_published": "2023-05-30 15:15:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
