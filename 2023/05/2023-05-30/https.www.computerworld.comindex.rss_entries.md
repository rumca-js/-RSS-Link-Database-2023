<p>When is an iPhone not an iPhone? When it’s almost as big as an iPad mini. Is a 7-inch iPhone Ultra really on the Apple road map, and is this the gadget mobile professionals need?</p><h3 class="body">A computer, a tablet, a smartphone</h3>

<p>Edge, sit down. We need to talk. (You too, Bing.)</p><p>Lately you’ve gone from a browser that was ignored by many but had the potential to be a very <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3587752/online-privacy-best-browsers-settings-and-tips.html">well-behaved and secure browser</a> to one that is being, well, a bit pushy. And Bing has been taking a page from your playbook and gotten a little pushy as well.</p><p>Let’s take a recent change with Edge that is now exposed with controls. Included in Edge build 113 or later, you can now control the campaigns that will attempt to change a user’s default browser. If you disable this policy, users will not be prompted to set Microsoft Edge as the default browser, or to set Microsoft Bing as the default search engine.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3697809/microsoft-edge-is-getting-pushy.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>When ChatGPT arrived in November 2022, it made mainstream the idea that generative artificial intelligence (AI) could be used by companies and consumers to automate tasks, help with creative ideas, and even code software.</p><p>If you need to boil down an email or chat thread into a concise summary, a chatbot such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Bard can do that. If you need to spruce up your resume with more eloquent language and impressive bullet points, AI can help. Want some ideas for a new marketing or ad campaign? Generative AI to the rescue.</p><p>ChatGPT stands for chatbot generative pre-trained transformer. The chatbot’s foundation is the GPT large language model (LLM), or a computer algorithm that processes natural language inputs and predicts the next word based on what it’s already seen. Then it predicts the next word, and the next word an so on until its answer is complete.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3697649/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
