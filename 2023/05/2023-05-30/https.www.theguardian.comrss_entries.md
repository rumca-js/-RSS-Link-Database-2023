## Gender Wars review – you’d need hundreds more of these shows to truly address the issues around trans rights

<p>This carefully scripted hour-long documentary gives voice to both sides of the transgender debate. But given its divisive and complex topic, it is a mere introduction</p><p>‘Battle lines have been drawn and any constructive dialogue seems to be impossible.” So runs the opening line of the very carefully scripted narration of Gender Wars, a documentary about one of the most polarising, saddening, enraging and toxic debates of our time. Channel 4 has bitten the bullet and is the first, I think, to produce a programme giving voice to both sides of what is usually called “the trans issue”. However, the first problem it faces is that “the trans issue” is actually about 400 issues packed into one, which has partly contributed to the endless difficulties in approaching, let alone resolving, it.</p><p>Wisely, Gender Wars does not try to cover everything. It looks at the phrase “trans women are women” and the ramifications, if it is to be taken not as a catchy slogan, embodying the idea that everyone should be allowed to dress, present and live as they choose, but as literal truth and the central plank of an increasingly popular and powerful ideology.</p><p>Gender Wars is on Channel 4.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/30/gender-wars-review-youd-need-hundreds-more-of-these-shows-to-truly-address-the-issues-around-trans-rights">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It may have an absolutely star-packed cast, but this meandering political farce will rapidly lose your interest – unless you’re an aficionado of US political scandals from the 70s</p><p>White House Plumbers is an A-list, star-stuffed, prestige retelling of the Watergate scandal, which might sound familiar to viewers of last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/24/gaslit-review-a-star-powered-watergate-drama-that-grips-and-doesnt-let-go" title="">Gaslit</a>, another A-list, star-stuffed, prestige retelling of the Watergate scandal. Even with Julia Roberts as its star, Gaslit got lost in the avalanche of great television that continues to arrive, and White House Plumbers may share the same fate. Here, the mood is more satirical, and it veers into slapstick, although it tries to balance that with a strand of serious family and personal drama. It has a slick elegance to it, but it never quite feels as if it pulls the many elements together successfully.</p><p>The Veep showrunner David Mandel directs, which should give some idea of the acerbic tone it aims for. The obligatory “based on a true story” note that opens the show cheekily points out that “no names have been changed to protect the innocent, because nearly everyone was found guilty”. Over five episodes, it follows the inept misadventures (and that’s putting it lightly, although, surprisingly, the series does occasionally allow space for an interpretation of the pair as quirky goofs) of the Nixon operatives <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jan/25/guardianobituaries.usa" title="">E Howard Hunt</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/07/g-gordon-liddy-obituary" title="">G Gordon Liddy</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/30/white-house-plumbers-review-youll-give-up-on-woody-harrelsons-watergate-drama-after-one-episode">Continue reading...</a>

## The Boogeyman review – deftly made yet derivative Stephen King horror

<p>Host director Rob Savage makes the most of a ho-hum short story from the horror master</p><p>The creative constraints of the early Covid era, forcing writers and directors to maximise the minimalism of remote production, led to an inevitable and seemingly inexorable dip in quality. Stories were told on laptops or phones or both at a time when most of us wanted to escape the exhaustion of life lived on a screen, not embrace it, the overwhelming majority offering nothing more than a depressing reminder of how incredibly small our world had suddenly become.</p><p>But fresh young British director Rob Savage, using the same base tools as his far more experienced peers, found a way to turn our eyerolls into wide-eyed admiration with his ingeniously effective horror <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/31/host-film-review-zoom-seance-shudder-rob-savage">Host</a>. Based entirely on Zoom, it told the story of group of friends who decide to do a guided seance online, and while not a single viewer will be surprised about how this turns out to be a very very bad idea, the ways in which it descends into chaos do prove at times genuinely unexpected. It was an imperfect film but a perfect calling card, showing how much Savage can do with so little. While his rushed follow-up Dashcam was a total, at times embarrassing, bust – messy and saddled with a wildly grating lead – his closely followed Hollywood debut still arrives with more expectation than most studio horrors despite the conventional packaging.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/30/the-boogeyman-movie-review-stephen-king">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sir Keir Starmer is right to say no to new hydrocarbon extraction from the North Sea</p><p>Sir Keir Starmer has been admirably straightforward about his mission to make Britain a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/24/keir-starmer-unveils-green-growth-plan-to-counter-liz-trusss-tax-cuts" title="">clean energy superpower</a>”. Blocking new oil and gas fields is a sine qua non to realise that ambition. The Labour leader even went to the lion’s den of Davos earlier this year to give business leaders that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/davos-2023-starmer-says-no-new-uk-oil-gas-investment-under-labour-government-2023-01-19/" title="">message</a>.</p><p>But judging from the headlines over the past few days, you might be forgiven for thinking that Sir Keir had never uttered a word about his plans. Or that Labour had not argued that a big public investment programme was needed to green the economy. The Conservative press instead said Labour’s ideas were a “gift to Putin”; raised a “<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-28-billion-question-starmer-must-answer-7rl0ntqvx" title="">£28bn question</a>”; and were a sure sign that eco-friendly <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12137431/LEO-McKINSTRY-Just-Stop-Oil-havoc-Starmers-loyalties-REALLY-lie.html" title="">donors</a> were being appeased.

<p>The World Health Organization has said that Covid-19 is no longer a global health emergency. But its impact will be felt for years</p><p>Once we could talk of nothing else. Now we barely speak of it at all. A leading Chinese epidemiologist has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-once-pioneer-of-zero-covid-shrugs-off-looming-wave-2485e089" title="">warned</a> that there could be up to 65m cases of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak" title="">Covid-19</a> a week in his country by the end of June. Yet there appears to be little concern within China, and there is certainly little attention outside it. When the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/05/covid-19-no-longer-global-health-emergency-world-health-organization" title="">declared</a> earlier this month that the Covid pandemic was no longer a global health emergency, the announcement was greeted not with cheers or even muted celebration, but with what seemed to be utter indifference.</p><p>To some it may have seemed a statement of the obvious. Vaccines and treatments have made the disease far less dangerous and frightening to most. A disease that claimed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05522-2" title="">millions of lives</a>, ravaged economies and upended societies has become an afterthought – though as the WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, pointed out, it is still killing someone every three minutes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/30/the-guardian-view-on-the-pandemic-forgotten-but-not-gone">Continue reading...</a>

The tone-colours coaxed from his musicians – albeit necessarily fewer than in big houses – are captivating, and the sense that his fine cast of singers were able to luxuriate in the orchestral sound as well as their own is underpinned by tight discipline.</p><p>Götterdämmerung is at <a href="https://lfo.org.uk/">Longborough Festival Opera</a> in rep on 31 May, and 2, 4 and 6 June.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/30/gotterdammerung-review-conductor-anthony-negus-is-the-lord-of-this-ring">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Abused by a neighbour as a girl, Reverend Joyce McDonald ran away from home and hit a downward spiral. Then one day during detox, she began modelling with clay – and hasn’t stopped</p><p>Clay may have saved the Reverend Joyce McDonald. Addiction, abusive relationships and sex work blighted much of the first half of her life. Now, at 72, she is emerging as the celebrated artist it seems she was always destined to be. In just a few short years, McDonald’s work has been added to the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum in New York and the Hammer in Los Angeles. The Brooklyn-based artist is now making her British debut – with her first solo show outside the US.</p><p>The exhibition, at Studio M in London, will include works going back to the 1990s. Mostly clay figurative sculptures, her work often incorporates other items including fake pearls, mirror and clothing. While her work is often biographical, suffused by her faith, and deals with difficult issues such as addiction and racism, there is something touchingly universal about it too. A hopefulness in dark times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/30/shooting-art-gallery-reverend-heroin-sex-wo-sculpting-joyce-mcdonald">Continue reading...</a>

## Malcolm McLaren’s Duck Rock at 40: the album that foretold today’s anything-goes pop

<p>The 1983 LP introduced a generation to hip-hop and mashed up style – but by not crediting Black musicians, it was also cultural appropriation. Producer Trevor Horn recalls its creation</p><p>The story of what may be the most groundbreaking and prescient album of its era begins with a mystery: what on earth did a major record label think they were doing giving Malcolm McLaren £100,000 to make a solo album in the early 80s? Having opened the Sex boutique with Vivian Westwood in the mid-70s and managed the Sex Pistols and New York Dolls, he had both a reputation as a nonpareil troublemaker and no actual experience of making music himself, unless you counted the version of the old Max Bygraves song You Need Hands that he sang in The Great Rock’n’ Roll Swindle, his preposterous cinematic rewriting of the Pistols’ story; and the handful of lyrics he’d written for Bow Wow Wow, the band he was currently supposed to be managing, but in whom he’d completely lost interest.</p><p>In 1981, he had pitched Steve Weltman of RCA some intriguing, if confused, ideas: Appalachian square dances, the South American and Caribbean music he’d discovered on a scholarly 1958 album called The Dances of the World’s Peoples (Vol 3), while browsing the record library at the Pompidou Centre in Paris, plus something about a club he had visited in New York where people span on their heads while listening to “DJs who use record players like instruments … moving the needle manually backwards and forwards”, which he kept insisting was the new punk rock. When Weltman went to Charisma Records in 1982 – best known for being home to Genesis – he signed McLaren without the latter having done a note of music. But ideas are one thing, and discernible musical talent is another entirely. And McLaren was completely deficient in the latter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/30/duck-rock-at-50-malcolm-mclaren-seminal-album-with-a-queasy-underside">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We asked the UK’s top cheesemongers what varieties they favour for a perfect melt. It’s all about acidity, moisture and a sense of place …</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What are the best cheeses for melting, and how do I know how they will behave under heat?<br /></strong><em><strong>Andrew, Gamboa, Panama</strong></em><br />We probably first need to define what we mean by melting, says Rob Lightbody from <a href="https://www.nealsyarddairy.co.uk/">Neal’s Yard Dairy</a>. “Most cheese will melt, but when a cheesemonger talks about ‘a good melter’, they’re probably talking about that satisfying stretch and pull you get from a good toastie, or from raclette melted over potatoes.” But Andrew’s right: because different cheeses do different things under heat, and that comes down to a few factors.</p><p>First, says Jazz Reeves, quality manager at cheesemonger <a href="https://www.paxtonandwhitfield.co.uk/">Paxton &amp; Whitfield</a>, there’s the moisture and fat content. “When cheese is heated, the protein structure breaks down and it releases the fat and water, so cheese with higher fat and moisture tends to melt well.” Acidity also comes into play: “Cheese with high acidity [eg feta] won’t melt, but low-acidity cheeses [parmesan, say] won’t melt, either, so look for something in the middle.” That’s to say a pH level between 5 and 5.4, says Oli Smith, co-owner of <a href="https://www.bristol-cheese.co.uk/">The Bristol Cheesemonger</a>. Mozzarella, he adds, “melts beautifully and produces those extraordinary stretches because it’s at that pH sweet spot of about 5.2”. Then there’s the age of the cheese to consider. “Younger ones are held together by a sort of protein matrix,” Smith explains, but that breaks down with time, which is why you can get those oil pools when extra-mature cheddar goes under the grill.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

As you might be dimly aware, the daytime show is in disarray to the point of anarchy, unable to control its populace and beset by previously spurned warlords making significant territorial gains across the border from GB News. So the share price stability is the best news ITV has had all week.

## Marnus Labuschagne: ‘Test cricket has been unbelievable … the game is coming alive’

<p>The world’s No 1 Test batsman on why he’s not worried about the rise of T20 cricket and how he and his Australian teammates are looking to negate England’s aggressive play in the Ashes</p><p>Marnus Labuschagne has been putting the glamour into Glamorgan since 2019, but still there is something slightly hallucinatory about finding the world’s best Test batter at Sophia Gardens. Yet here he sits, snacking on biltong – you can take the kid out of South Africa and all that – while overlooking the outfield at the end of a day’s play, a few weeks before Australia steal him away to join their Test squad for the Ashes and World Test Championship. “I love coming to Cardiff,” he says. “I love the people, I love the club, my family loves being here. It’s kind of like a second home.”</p><p>His actual second home for the last couple of years was a Cardiff house shared with his Glamorgan and occasional international teammate Michael Neser, who like Labuschagne was born in South Africa, moved to Australia as a child (Neser was nine, Labuschagne a year older) and settled in Queensland. But now he has a baby, so it didn’t seem like such a good idea. “We’re staying right across the road from each other, literally opposite,” Labuschagne says. “It’s really nice to share the experience, to have been able to share this journey with someone else, a really close friend.” These days, though, Neser is not the only one of those he has here: “I’ve played with these guys for four years. We’re good friends, our wives, kids – you know, you’re building real relationships and a culture and a great feeling.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/30/marnus-labuschagne-england-australia-ashes-2023-interview-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

The man who first got her on the game is her own father (Sean McGinley), who she still visits for a line of coke in his seedy trailer every now and again.</p><p>One day, shy tech wiz Sam (Aaron Cobham), a man with his own sad backstory, is compelled by a debt owed to the brothel’s vicious owner Max (Neil Bell) to install secret cameras in the rooms so Max and his henchman Barry (Theo Ogundipe) can spy on the workers and clients. Alison and Sam become unlikely friends, bonded over the photographs he takes of her that capture something other than her hardened exterior. Sam and Alison end up going on the run, rocking up in a different part of the country where Alison’s sister Karen (Elva Trill) is raising Alison’s daughter (Izzy McKenty) as her own, while Max rages, chewing chunks of the set’s tatty scenery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/30/wait-for-me-review-grimy-yorkshire-melodrama-offers-serious-scenery-chewing">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Various venues, Edinburgh<br /></strong>For children wondering what their parents do all day, many of the delightful shows programmed here will show them that they’re not really so grown up</p><p>How curious to be a child trying to make sense of adult behaviour, with its rules, routines and unfathomable absence of fun. Several of the shows on the opening weekend of the Edinburgh international children’s festival take this idea as a starting point, turning their attention away from the lives of the target audience and towards the world of adult eccentricity.</p><p>This can be a risk. In the almost wordless <a href="https://www.imaginate.org.uk/festival/whats-on/9-to-5">9 to 5</a>, the Belgian company Nevski Prospekt fields four office workers wearing identical grey suits as they loop through the rituals of dull bureaucratic life. A young Edinburgh audience with no experience of crowded commuter trains or complex filing systems (aren’t offices paperless these days?) struggles to know what is going on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/30/edinburgh-international-childrens-festival-review-playful-inner-child-serious-grownup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sex with my first partner has been great for both of us, but I would like to learn how to become a more satisfied and satisfying lover</p><p><strong>I</strong><strong> am an 18-year-old man </strong><strong>and recently lost my virginity</strong><strong>. I have</strong><strong> been sexually active with the same girl since. I have </strong><strong>never been able to </strong><strong>ejaculate during</strong><strong> sex, </strong><strong>even though it has been great</strong><strong> for both of us. </strong><strong>I decided to research </strong><strong>the issue </strong><strong> and now believe it has something to do with my masturbation style, which is typically pretty fast, and unrealistic </strong><strong>to replicate during sex. </strong><strong>Is there was any way for me to change this, to make the sex more enjoyable for me?</strong></p><p>You are right in thinking that a person’s masturbation style can effect their ability to engage successfully in partner sex. I am assuming you mean that you believe you would need to thrust very rapidly to ejaculate? Fortunately, a person’s sexual response is something that can be changed and developed. You must be patient. First, practise slowing down during masturbation. When you are with your girlfriend, try not to be anxious about finishing. Instead, focus on the pleasure you can both experience. Instead of being afraid of how you are “performing” try to enjoy the present moment, and focus on giving her pleasure. Ask her what she enjoys and practise those sexual skills. You are at the very beginning of your shared sexual journey: allow yourself to take the time you need to become a satisfied and satisfying lover.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

Street Fighter 6, on the other hand, feels heartily robust from the word go. It’s bursting at the seams with things to do, assured in its gameplay, and wrapped in a stylish, colourful, confident swagger that the game can absolutely back up.</p><p>This time around, the basics are properly accounted for: there are versus and arcade modes, an options-rich training room, and some respectably detailed tutorials that dive into the nitty-gritty of fighting game fundamentals. A new addition is World Tour, a sprawling single-player mode that lets you create your own (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLt9bvZ4AXw&amp;ab_channel=outsidexbox">potentially horrifically proportioned</a>) fighter and lets them loose into a universe where just about everyone is ready to throw down at the slightest invitation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/30/street-fighter-6-review-the-new-king-of-fighting-games">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Biological facilities in the US and around the world suffer breaches, including of potentially pandemic-causing pathogens, but are shrouded in secrecy</p><p>At biological research facilities across the United States and around the world, hundreds of safety breaches happen every year at labs experimenting with dangerous pathogens. Scientists and other lab workers are bitten by infected animals, stuck by contaminated needles and splashed with infectious fluids. They are put at risk of exposures when their protective gear malfunctions or critical building biosafety systems fail.</p><p>And, like all humans, the people working in laboratories make mistakes and they sometimes cut corners or ignore safety procedures – even when working with pathogens that have the potential to cause a global pandemic.</p><p>Alison Young is an investigative reporter and the Curtis B Hurley Chair in Public Affairs Reporting at the University of Missouri School of Journalism.

<p>Indigenous boutique owners Liana Shewey and Korina Emmerich want to acknowledge traditions but also push the design narrative</p><p>Location, location, location. It can make or break a business. For Liana Shewey and Korina Emmerich, it was a call to action. When a mutual friend told the activists and creatives – Shewey is an educator and Emmerich is a fashion designer – about a newly vacant storefront on the ground floor of her mother’s Manhattan co-op building, the pair, who met five years ago at an Indigenous women’s collective and quickly became best friends, visited the space. It was 350 sq ft – a far cry from the 20,000 sq ft clubhouse of the duo’s wildest fantasies. But something felt right. “We jumped on it,” said Shewey.</p><p>The co-op board wasn’t willing to hand the keys over to just anyone. But their friend’s mother is Navajo, and also the board president. Within days the building had its newest tenant: Relative Arts NYC, a boutique that carries pieces by Indigenous designers and also hosts literary readings, album releases and art installations featuring work by Indigenous artists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/30/relative-arts-indigenous-boutique-liana-shewey-korina-emmerich">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Speeding through Coward’s journey from humble origins to all-round megastardom, we don’t get to engage with his complex private life</p><p>Here is a brisk documentary about Noël Coward, who sailed to New York aged 20 with £17 in his pocket, and by his 30th birthday was the highest-paid author in the western world; in his lifetime he wrote 500 songs and 60 plays – acting in more than 70. At its best, this is an efficient film that does a solid, succinct job of fitting a lot of life into a little over 90 minutes; Coward died aged 73 in 1973. But in some ways this feels like a Wikipedia entry read out loud, never quite getting under the skin of a complicated man.</p><p>Coward grew up poor in the suburbs of London, aided and abetted on to the stage as a child by his adoring mother, Violet, who seems to have indulged her son’s precocious show-offy streak. Violet was a genteel woman who had fallen on hard times, and kept a boarding house. Coward once said he wanted to become as rich and successful as quickly as possible “to get mother out of that damned kitchen”. Even after his first big sensation in 1920s London with The Vortex, he lived at home with his mum and dad.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/30/mad-about-the-boy-the-noel-coward-story-review-brisk-trot-through-life-and-career">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Four people on using the nostril-based antidote to opioid overdoses, newly approved for over-the-counter sale</p><p>Over 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses last year. Advocates say a vast number of them might still be alive if they’d had access to naloxone. Brandon Kilmer, a 24-year-old from Minneapolis, lost his brother to a fentanyl overdose in 2022. Now, he distributes a pack of Narcan to everyone he meets. “I don’t care if you’re a 17-year-old kid or an 80-year-old grandmother,” he said. “I want you to have it.”</p><p>Naloxone, better known by the brand name Narcan, reverses overdoses by binding to the opioid receptors in the brain, blocking the effects of drugs such as fentanyl or heroin. Harm reduction workers say it should be as ubiquitous in Americans’ homes as dental floss or hand sanitizer, but not enough people have access to it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/30/what-is-narcan-naloxone-overdose">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A tale of folklore and magic from Angie Thomas, a hidden land of nature’s wonders and a town full of werewolf children are among the highlights this month</p><p>Jackson, Mississippi native Angie Thomas, whose YA debut <em>The Hate U Give</em> hit hard in 2017, has turned her gaze on books for younger children. <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/nic-blake-and-the-remarkables-the-manifestor-prophecy-9781529506549">Nic Blake and the Remarkables: The Manifestor Prophecy</a></strong> (Walker) handles often familiar terrain with brio, using a cast of figures from American folklore and a smattering of Swahili.</p><p>Even pre-<em>Harry Potter</em>, a genre you might call “Oh no, it seems I am the chosen one!” has been a literary staple. Jackson resident Nic and her single father have often moved because of their gifts, lest unremarkables suspect there’s a magical world. But unanswered questions and her father being falsely (she hopes) accused of a crime spur Nic, her pals and her hellhound puppy on a quest to clear his name. It’s a formula, but Thomas is hardly formulaic. She strings out the tension for ages until the penny drops.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/30/childrens-and-teens-roundup-the-best-new-chapter-books-angie-thomas-nick-blake-and-remarkables-pari-thomson-greenwild-the-world-behind-door-katya-balen-thames-and-tide-club">Continue reading...</a>

## The Old Man Movie: Lactopalypse! review – brilliantly weird Estonian stop-motion

In short, it’s brilliant.</p><p>City brats Priidik (voiced by co-director Mikk Mägi), Aino (co-director Oskar Lehemaa) and Mart (Mägi) are sent to stay with their grandfather (Mägi), who to their scorn is always doing “barn things”. The old fella prides himself on his way with an udder; he starts to rid them of their urban prissiness with a few squirts of yoghurty lactate. But when his prize cow escapes, one-time milking champion Old Milker (Jan Uuspõld) turns up to alert them of the danger: relieve that udder within 24 hours, or risk unleashing “lactopalypse”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/30/the-old-man-movie-lactopalypse-review-estonian-stop-motion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Matt Lloyd-Rose deserves credit for serving as a volunteer in the Met, but his findings suggest that current policing only deepens the conflict it seeks to end</p><p>Matt Lloyd-Rose sounds like an idealistic young man with a well-developed social conscience. A former primary school teacher, he has a deep interest in the workings of communities, the marginalised and excluded. Wanting to get closer to the frontline of social problems, he became a volunteer police officer in Brixton and Streatham.</p><p>His experiences patrolling this ethnically diverse and far from tranquil sector of south London are what he recounts in <em>Into the Night</em>, a compelling snapshot of modern-day policing. About halfway through the book, after countless stops and searches, arrests for minor drug offences, visits to domestic violence incidents, drunks urinating in the street, casual sexism and misogyny, slightly more guarded racism, robberies, stabbings and adrenaline-pumping pursuits, the author observes: “Unlike teaching, I found policing a difficult role in which to live my values.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/30/into-the-night-a-year-with-the-police-review-matt-lloyd-rose-why-the-fight-against-crime-needs-more-care">Continue reading...</a>

We drove down gravel roads where the only other traffic was cowboys on horseback, across iron girder bridges covered in rust and the webs of giant spiders. A caracara falcon stood in the centre of the road pulling a dead iguana apart. But then we left cattle country and crossed a desert made of pineapples. Darkness fell. After the shop where a mule was tied up, there were no more lights and the track clambered into the jungled hills. Eventually we pulled up at a gateway marked by a weird metal sculpture.

Luckily, picking one wasn’t a particularly tough decision. The Disruption was a largely pointless episode of ping pong between Kendall and the rest of the Roys, notable for how uncharacteristically heavy-handed it was. Shiv published a damning open letter about Kendall’s mental state; he played Nirvana’s Rape Me while she was making a speech. A bewildering outlier for such a good series.</p><p><strong>38. </strong><strong>Lifeboats (s1 e3)</strong><br />Aside from the pilot, Succession’s first season took a few episodes to fully hit its stride.

<p>A flood of new research is overturning old assumptions about what animal minds are and aren’t capable of – and changing how we think about our own species </p><p>Giraffes will eat courgettes if they have to, but they really prefer carrots. A team of <a href="https://theconversation.com/research-shows-giraffes-can-use-statistical-reasoning-theyre-the-first-animal-with-a-relatively-small-brain-known-to-do-this-204808" title="">researchers from Spain and Germany</a> recently took advantage of this preference to investigate whether the animals are capable of statistical reasoning. In the experiment, a giraffe was shown two transparent containers holding a mixture of carrot and courgette slices. One container held mostly carrots, the other mostly courgettes. A researcher then took one slice from each container and offered them to the giraffe with closed hands, so it couldn’t see which vegetable had been selected.</p><p>In repeated trials, the four test giraffes reliably chose the hand that had reached into the container with more carrots, showing they understood that the more carrots were in the container, the more likely it was that a carrot had been picked. Monkeys have passed similar tests, and human babies can do it at 12 months old. But giraffes’ brains are much smaller than primates’ relative to body size, so it was notable to see how well they grasped the concept.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/may/30/can-humans-ever-understand-how-animals-think">Continue reading...</a>
