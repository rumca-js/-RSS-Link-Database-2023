Sources <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/05/30/pixel-watch-2-specs/\">speaking</a> to <em>9to5Google</em> claim the Pixel Watch 2 will switch from Samsung's 2018-era Exynos 9110 to one of Qualcomm's much newer <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-plus-smartwatch-chip-160032423.html\">Snapdragon W5</a> models. Although the battery in the new smartwatch isn't supposed to be significantly bigger, the longevity is supposed to be much-improved \u2014 reportedly, it can last over a day with the always-on display enabled where that simply wasn't possible before.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 is also said to use the same health sensors as the Fitbit Sense 2. That could introduce ways to measure stress (that is, electrodermal activity) and skin temperature. Many other details remain a mystery, but it won't be surprising if the new model is one of the first devices to run <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-remembered-to-add-gmail-and-calendar-to-wear-os-190027384.html\">Wear OS 4</a>.

If the wristwear does use Snapdragon hardware, it'll represent an unusual twist. Google has so far leaned heavily on Samsung-based chips for recent mobile devices, including the Tensor G2 found in phones as recent as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7a-review-its-got-everything-you-need-and-more-for-just-499-184517525.html\">the Pixel 7a</a>.

They still offer THX-certified sound with customizable active noise cancellation (ANC) levels. This being Razer, there's Chroma RGB lighting to flaunt your choice of personal audio. How long they last on battery depends on how you're connected and what you're using. You can manage up to 6.5 hours of listening on Bluetooth with ANC and lighting disabled, with 24 hours of extra power from a wireless charging-capable case.

I really want deep worlds that you can interact with.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about those comments while playing <em>Diablo IV</em>. Blizzard\u2019s latest is easily one of the best games the studio has released in about a decade, but I can\u2019t help imagining what <em>Diablo IV </em>could have been if it were a smaller, more focused experience.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The story of <em>Diablo IV</em> opens decades after the end of <em>Diablo III: Reaper of Souls, </em>with the world of Sanctuary still reeling from the events of that game. Structurally, the narrative that unfolds is similar to <em>Diablo II</em>. Following a visit to a remote village, your character sets off after the demon Lilith \u2013 who is the daughter of Mephisto, one of the Prime Evils you defeated in <em>Diablo II. </em>More often than not,<em>&nbsp;</em>your character finds they\u2019re one step behind Lilith, leading to predictably dire results.</p><div id=\"e9aa2e1b48b84920a820c758318c7ad5\"></div><p>I won\u2019t say much more about <em>Diablo IV\u2019s</em> story other than to note Blizzard smartly grounded it in the tragedy of its human characters. When the narrative calls on elements from past games, it does so in ways that feel natural and earned. Lilith is also a great antagonist. Every time she appeared on-screen, I felt a sense of unease waiting to see what kind of calculated cruelty she\u2019d inflict on those unlucky enough to cross her path. If you only end up playing <em>Diablo IV </em>for its story, I think you will enjoy the experience, but if you decide to veer off its<em>&nbsp;</em>critical path, be prepared to play through a lot of uninspired content.</p><p>If you tried <em>Diablo IV </em>during one of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-beta-preview-more-polished-and-even-more-satisfying-133038708.html\">open betas</a> Blizzard held in recent months, you\u2019ve seen most of what the game\u2019s open world has to offer as you\u2019re leveling your character. Did you encounter a world event in the Fractured Peaks that tasked you with protecting a group of villagers hiding under their carts? Guess what \u2013 you\u2019ll find another group just like that one again in Scosglen, the game\u2019s second zone, and in other areas, too. I bet you played through a few optional dungeons. Well, there are more than 100 in the full game, and most feature a limited combination of layouts and objectives. World bosses and camps are more fun to complete, but there are far fewer of them than all the other content present in the game. The post-campaign adds more things to do like helltides and nightmare dungeons, but those increase the difficulty of the content, rather than introducing something substantially new.</p><p>Sometimes you\u2019ll discover some interesting lore, a nifty bit of environmental storytelling or a named enemy that will drop an item with unique flavor text, but those moments are few and far between. I kept waiting for <em>Diablo IV</em>\u2019s world<em>&nbsp;</em>to surprise me, to do something unexpected. The closest the game came to scratching that itch was when it sent the Butcher, a boss that shows up in nearly every Diablo game, to murder my character in an optional dungeon I was exploring. Even though my barbarian didn\u2019t survive the encounter, I wanted more moments like that. Instead, the game seemed dead set on offering me an endless checklist of samey content if I ever decided to strike off on my own.</p><figure><img alt=\"Screenshot of the Dry Steppes, one of the areas players can visit in Diablo IV. The environment of the Dry Steppes is characterized by desert and dry shrub. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/83060b00-fe55-11ed-b9b1-01b294f1744b\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Blizzard Entertainment</div></figure><p>That frustration is palpable while playing <em>Diablo IV</em> because so much of the game is immediately compelling. Nearly every inch of its<em>&nbsp;</em>open world is striking, with some of the most detailed and creative assets Blizzard has ever produced. Add to that a soundtrack that is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Vkdr-iSt5O0\">haunting and evocative</a>, and you have an experience that\u2019s begging for players to inhabit it.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s my fault for expecting a live service game to offer something more substantive, but everywhere in <em>Diablo IV, </em>you see evidence that the people who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/12/08/diablo-iv-release-date-crunch/\">spent years of their lives working on this project</a> wanted the same thing. Just look at character creation. Clearly, the intention here was to allow players to make their druid, barbarian, sorcerer, rogue or necromancer look exactly like they\u2019ve always appeared in their imaginations. <em>Diablo IV </em>offers a dizzying amount of visual customization for each class. In addition to all of the items, you can give your character different hairstyles and tattoos, and modify their skin tone, eye color and other attributes. Add in the transmog system, which allows you to transform the appearance of items to make them look like ones you\u2019ve found in the past, and I can guarantee no two characters will look alike.</p><p>Blizzard obviously also put a lot of thought into player agency, allowing each class to be played in a variety of ways. The Aspects system is one of <em>Diablo IV\u2019s</em> most compelling features: By completing dungeons and finding legendary items, you will collect item affixes that modify how skills work, and they\u2019re transferable among your inventory. Some of these can completely change how your build functions. After some initial frustration, I found a build that allowed my barbarian to make short work of both hordes of monsters and <em>Diablo IV\u2019s </em>spongy bosses, and I had a lot of fun with the game. I just wish there was more to do in <em>Diablo IV\u2019s </em>world other than kill countless monster hordes. After all, role-playing has always been part of the ARPG genre.</p><figure><img alt=\"Screenshot of the Diablo IV shop, showing the Lion of Arreat cosmetic set for barbarians.  \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/16507e90-fe56-11ed-bbe7-5bd060bc3883\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Blizzard Entertainment</div></figure><p>One last thing I want to note is that I played a version of <em>Diablo IV</em> that did not include any of the microtransactions the final build will feature. If you haven\u2019t followed that aspect of the game\u2019s development, I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-reveals-diablo-iv-monetization-170021763.html\">Blizzard\u2019s monetization plans</a> for <em>Diablo </em>IV last year. In short, <em>Diablo IV</em> is a full-priced game that also happens to feature an in-game shop and seasonal passes. Blizzard has promised that none of the cosmetic items you can buy in the shop or earn by completing the paid track of a season pass will grant \u201cdirect or indirect\u201d gameplay advantages. The studio was also quick to note the shop and season pass will offer \u201cmore diversity of choices, not systematically better choices\u201d for customizing your character. After <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/diablo-immortal-review-120001807.html\"><em>Diablo Immortal</em></a>, I\u2019m fine with this setup, but I know some people will be put off by the presence of a season pass.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to give you the wrong impression of my time with <em>Diablo IV</em>; I enjoyed nearly every moment of it. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s the Diablo game I\u2019ve been dreaming of ever since I first set foot in the world of Sanctuary back in 1997. But it is also a reminder of all the ways Blizzard has changed since I first encountered its games. There\u2019s no way the company that released <em>Diablo II </em>in 2000 and even <em>Diablo III </em>in 2012 could have created a game of <em>Diablo IV</em>\u2019s scale, but sheer size is not what makes <em>Diablo IV </em>enjoyable. So often, that scale works against the game, resulting in a world that is, as Warren Spector might say, simulated at a level of an inch per mile.</p><p><em>Diablo IV </em>will be available on PC, PlayStation and Xbox on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-release-date-030739148.html\">June 6th</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-review-a-mechanically-perfect-romp-through-a-shallow-world-160017353.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-review-a-mechanically-perfect-romp-through-a-shallow-world-160017353.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-30 16:00:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sony's new WH-CH720N wireless headphones drop to $128 at Amazon", "description": "<p>Sony's latest mid-range headphones are already a solid deal at their normal price, and now they've received a significant discount.

It is also meant to create common knowledge of the growing number of experts and public figures who also take some of advanced AI\u2019s most severe risks seriously.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai-presents-risk-of-extinction-on-par-with-nuclear-war-industry-leaders-say-114025874.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ai-presents-risk-of-extinction-on-par-with-nuclear-war-industry-leaders-say-114025874.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-30 11:40:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: NASA's SLS rocket is already $6 billion over budget", "description": "<p>According to the latest audit from NASA's inspector general, the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket designed to take astronauts to the Moon is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasas-sls-rocket-is-6-billion-over-budget-and-six-years-behind-schedule-091432515.html\">substantially over budget and far behind schedule</a>. NASA's spending on the Artemis Moon Program is expected to reach $93 billion by 2025, including the $23.8 billion already spent on the SLS system through 2022. That sum represents &quot;$6 billion in cost increases and over six years in schedule delays above NASA\u2019s original projections,&quot; says the report.</p><p>One of the issues has been integrating older NASA technology with newer systems. &quot;These increases are caused by interrelated issues such as assumptions that the use of heritage technologies\u2026 were expected to result in significant cost and schedule savings compared to developing new systems for the SLS,&quot; the audit states. &quot;However, the complexity of developing, updating and integrating new systems along with heritage components proved to be much greater than anticipated.&quot;</p><p>The Artemis Moon mission project was based on the Constellation program, launched in 2005 with the goal of returning to the Moon by 2020. Following its cancellation, the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 mandated construction of the SLS and required the repurposing of existing technology, contracts and workforce from Constellation.</p><p>\u2013 Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn\u2019t just a</em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/\"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> \u2013  it\u2019s also a daily podcast.

The company revealed the tech during its generative AI keynote at Computex 2023, showing a demo called <em>Kairos. </em>The dialogue is rather wooden, but feeding voice-based interactions could be an interesting new dynamic in games. It uses NVIDIA <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-made-an-open-source-tool-for-creating-safer-and-more-secure-ai-models-130005790.html\"><ins>NeMo tech</ins></a> for building, customizing and deploying large language models customized with lore and character backstories while using guardrails to protect against inappropriate conversations.

This will start later this year with a pilot route between Ottawa, the capital, and Sudbury. There will be 750 opened stations by the end of 2025, and &quot;at least&quot; 350 of those will be speedy 250kW Superchargers. That performance is important, given the focus on long-distance travel. The government is teaming up with partners to help install nearly 3,000 EV chargers in multi-use residential buildings, offices, public places and fleets. The majority of the chargers will be Level 2 with around 100 faster Level 3 outlets.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tesla-will-open-its-supercharger-network-to-other-evs-in-canada-150057481.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-test-brings-screen-sharing-to-android-phones-135041152.html\">WhatsApp test brings screen sharing to Android phones</a></h2><h3>It's reportedly rolling out to more users soon.</h3><h3></h3><p>WhatsApp's newest update takes a page out of work-centric video call platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams. The messaging app is adding a screen-sharing feature that will record and display the contents of your screen with whoever is on the other end of the video call, according to <em>WABetaInfo</em>. Screen sharing is only available to select Android beta testers right now but should roll out to more users in the coming weeks. However, it might not work on older Android models, bigger group calls or with people who don't have WhatsApp's latest version.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-test-brings-screen-sharing-to-android-phones-135041152.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-nasas-sls-rocket-is-already-6-billion-over-budget-111519603.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-nasas-sls-rocket-is-already-6-billion-over-budget-111519603.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-30 11:15:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
