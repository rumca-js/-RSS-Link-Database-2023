Diablo IV's surprisingly moving and engrossing story encapsulates gameplay systems that have learnt all the right lessons from entries past.

It's sometimes difficult to reconcile that Diablo III is over a decade old. Its release was polarizing for a number of reasons, but its evolving formula of action role-playing endured, enjoying a resurgence with its post-launch expansion that carried through years of ongoing seasonal updates. It shouldn't come as a surprise, then, that each of those years helped inform the design of Diablo IV, a game which confidently delivers gameplay that has been carried forward and refined from both Diablo II and III, while also establishing a strong foundation for the franchise's future.

Tears of the Kingdom may be a single player game, but its creative open ended approach has led way to players sharing their experiences as if they were all playing together.

Kurt's been playing The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. He's been playing it alone (it is as single player game, after all), and yet he feels like he's playing it with everyone. Whether at the office, or scrolling through his Twitter feed, it seems like everyone around him isn't just playing Tears of the Kingdom, but they're sharing their experiences and creations in the game with the rest of the world. This is a game that invites you, and you alone, to go on an adventure. But somehow Kurt feels more connected with the players around him in the real world more than most multiplayer games.

In this episode of The Kurt Locker, Kurt spends a lot of time thinking about connection through playing games like Tears of the Kingdom, despite it a single player game.

Street Fighter 6 steps into the arena looking good and fighting fit.
#streetfighter6 #sf6 #gamespot 

Street Fighter 6 learns an immediate lesson from the content-bare release of its predecessor, as it offers a variety of significant features and modes right out of the gate. It is a robust, fighting game that is of a premiere quality. Street Fighter 6 is incredible; a return to form for the franchise that welcomes both new fighters and seasoned pros.
