Find one at Amazon - https://lon.tv/8ul9v (compensated affiliate link) - The Zapperbox M1 is a great example of the "minimally viable product." It's an ATSC 3 tuner box that right now just tunes live TV but with future firmware updates should be able to do a lot more. See more ATSC 3 - http://lon.tv/atsc3 and subscribe! http://lon.tv/s
