  <p id="aIpUuC">All the first Pixel Watch had to do was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/22/23316396/pixel-watch-google-wear-os-backups-smartwatches">not suck</a>. That won’t be good enough for its successor, which is rumored to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/05/05/google-pixel-watch-2-2/">debut later this fall</a> and be called the Pixel Watch 2. Its one job is to last longer than 24 hours, which is why it’s both surprising and not so surprising that the next-gen smartwatch will reportedly be leaving Samsung processors behind.</p>
<p id="E4zWtI"><a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/05/05/google-pixel-watch-2-2/">According to <em>9to5Google</em></a>, the Pixel Watch 2 will sport Qualcomm’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/19/23268272/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-wearables-processor">Snapdragon W5 Plus chip</a>. The 4nm processor was announced last summer and promises double the performance and enable multiday battery life. On the one hand, this makes a ton of sense. The current Pixel Watch runs on Samsung’s last-gen wearable chip, the 10nm Exynos 9110, and its battery life stinks compared to the competition....</p>

## Nvidia’s new ultra-low motion blur tech lets PC gamers have high refresh rates, too

  <p id="vgqgG3">Nvidia is updating its Ultra Low Motion Blur (ULMB) technology, which could make gaming even smoother on high-end monitors.

<p id="0UTjwO">This means you no longer have to choose between having a more responsive refresh rate or reducing motion blur, both of which affect gameplay. Now Nvidia says the effective motion rate for a 360Hz monitor with ULMB 2 enabled is 1440Hz. “That means in order to obtain the same level of motion clarity without ULMB 2, gamers would need a classic panel capable of 1440 Hz,” Nvidia notes.

  <p id="xIKbWr"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, the recently announced remake of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>, will reuse the voice lines from the original game with no changes, according to Tommy Williams, Konami’s head of communications for the Americas.</p>
<p id="WPtBEJ">Konami revealed the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735626/playstation-showcase-metal-gear-solid-3-delta-snake-eater-remake">last week</a>, and its language about how the original voice cast would be featured has been murky. The company’s press release <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/eu/en/topics/17164/">said that</a> the remake will “star the original voice characters,” and <a href="https://twitter.com/Metalgear/status/1661803315112583168">a tweet</a> said that the “story and character voices” in <em>Delta</em> would “remain the same from the original game.”</p>
<p id="uCPM4W">That language left some room for interpretation. Would the same voice actors be back but with new lines?

Now, Scaringe is giving Rivian fans a teaser of the new compact SUV that’s expected to be much more affordable than the R1S, which currently starts at $78,000.</p>
<p id="Zt0zQI">During an Instagram <a href="https://youtu.be/xqiQUQFvzjI?t=168">Q&amp;A session</a> hosted by Scaringe over Memorial Day weekend, the CEO took a moment to link up with Rivian lead designer Jeff Hammoud to show a glimpse of the R2’s shape.

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MpehvC">With the end of <em>Yellowjackets</em>’ second season, even as a self-confessed indulger of period dramas and teen angst, I don’t know how they’re going to stretch it across three more seasons. (It was initially sold as a five-season show, and <a href="https://ew.com/tv/yellowjackets-five-season-plan/">co-creator Ashley Lyle says they’re still on track for that</a>.) I say this with both love and optimism because it has, across the board, a brilliant ensemble cast with stellar chemistry; there’s a little bit of meta irony in that, among the adult <em>Yellowjackets</em>, Juliette Lewis (Natalie), Christina Ricci (Misty), and Melanie Lynskey (Shauna) have the shared experience of beginning their acting careers as teens and making it big in the ’90s in a past iteration of Hollywood that thrived on the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/yellowjackets-melanie-lynskey-christina-ricci-surviving-hollywood-1235191000/">trauma of young...</a></p>

## Motorola’s third Moto G Stylus 5G might be the charm

  <p id="DHrXPu">Motorola hasn’t had a lot of success with midrange devices lately, but it’s trying again with the Moto G Stylus 5G — 2023 edition. It’ll sell for $399 unlocked for a variant with a healthy 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage (carriers will sell a variant with 128GB of storage and either 4 or 6GB of RAM) and comes with a 6.6-inch screen, updated rear camera system, and Qualcomm’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/6/23339715/new-snapdragon-chips-midrange-android-phones-ai-features-2023">new midrange Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chipset</a> for 20 percent faster performance than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23054028/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-2022-price-screen-specs-battery">last year’s model</a>. Oh, and a stylus, of course.</p>
<p id="Topwxx">The 2023 G Stylus 5G has a slightly smaller screen than last year’s edition — a 6.6-inch display versus 6.8 inches — though it’s still a 1080p LCD with a top refresh rate of 120Hz. The drop in screen size is actually a good thing: 1080p...</p>

## Niantic has a new experience for Quest headsets that features an ‘AI-enabled’ owl

Titled “Wol,” it can be played on Quest headsets and features an “AI-enabled” talking owl discussing the redwood forest.</p>
<p id="2PN4hg">I packed a lot into that sentence, so let’s break it down. While you can check out this experience on your phone, it differs from Niantic’s AR mobile games because you can also try it using the passthrough video feature on VR headsets like Meta’s Quest 2 and Quest Pro. To use it, you visit a URL — <a href="http://MeetWol.com">MeetWol.com</a> — meaning you don’t need an app to try it. In the experience itself, a large portal into a virtual redwood forest will appear in front of you, and then Wol will fly over and start...</p>

  <p id="VSseyg">I have two pieces of news for you this morning. The first is that My Photo Stream, the free cloud-based photo syncing feature <a href="https://youtu.be/OHQidGlP230">Apple launched in 2011</a>, is still up and running in 2023. That’s despite it being effectively superseded by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/5/7982735/apple-new-iphoto-announced-photos-app-for-mac#:~:text=Photos%20is%20tied,and%20services%20here.">iCloud Photo Library roughly eight years ago</a>. Now that you’re up to date, the second piece of news is that My Photo Stream is shutting down in a couple of months’ time on July 26th, according to an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210705">Apple Support page</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1662159208786034690">spotted by <em>Bloomberg’s </em>Mark Gurman</a>.</p>
<p id="YVHygv">The end of My Photo Stream won’t come as too much of a surprise. Although it was free, it came with a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202299">long list of restrictions</a> on the amount of photos you could upload, and these were only saved on Apple’s servers for 30 days.

  <p id="GpwTMf">MSI — a brand traditionally known for gaming hardware — has announced a bunch of laptops at Computex 2023, and there’s an interesting lack of gamery among them. Instead, the company appears to be focusing hard on the premium lifestyle space with its mid-2023 offerings. </p>
<p id="VAZoPe">Notable among these releases is the new Commercial 14 series, a line of business laptops intended to compete with high-end enterprise PCs — the likes of the ThinkPad. I conclude this from the fact that MSI’s press release highlights its “tailor-made solutions to enterprises through a series of optional security measures, NFC (near-field communication) and built-in Smart Card Reader.” If that’s not a word-for-word ThinkPad pitch, I don’t know what is.</p>
