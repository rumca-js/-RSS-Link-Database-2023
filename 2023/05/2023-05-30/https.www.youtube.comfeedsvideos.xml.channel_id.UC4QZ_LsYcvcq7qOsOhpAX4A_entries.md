In today's episode, we look at the life, philosophy and legacy of Sam Altman, the man behind OpenAI. I started covering OpenAI back in 2017. Even back then, right out of the gate, they were achieving breakthroughs. Only time will tell if Sam ends up being a hero or villan, but one thing is for sure: his company has certainly shaken things up.
