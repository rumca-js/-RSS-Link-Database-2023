Sony's eagerly awaited PlayStation Showcase has come and gone. I found it to be a solid collection of upcoming releases - Sword of the Sea, in particular, looked nice. However, this wasn't the best showcase for Sony's first-party studios or a smattering of upcoming exclusives for the PS5.

Some are fine with that. Others are probably angry. You can make up your mind. However, it does raise the question: What are Sony's first-party studios doing?

System Shock is one of the most important games in history, kicking off the immersive sim as the genre we know today. The remake does an incredible job of bringing System Shock to a modern gaming audience, and while its slavish devotion to being as faithful as possible to the original might have some drawbacks—I still don’t like the maze-like layout of the game’s levels—it still does a great job of being the best way to experience System Shock.
 
The System Shock remake is the best way to experience the original System Shock in all of its glory. While the remake might be faithful to the original to a fault, the changes it introduces—like the modernized interface and controls—are a welcome change and make System Shock an absolute joy to play.

Street Fighter 6 impressed us with its incredible sense of style from the very minute its gameplay was first revealed. Now that we've finally gotten our hands on it, the developer's latest fighter offers more than a gorgeous aesthetic. It also has excellent gameplay, backed by a well-rounded roster and the new Drive System.

With excellent single-player modes like Arcade and Extreme Battle, extensive tutorials and Trials for learning each character, and solid online play, Street Fighter 6 casts off the spectre of its predecessor and kickstarts a brave new era for the series.

Whether you're practicing for hours or matching other players, blow for blow, in Battle Hub, it's all about the World Warriors, the grind to get good and the satisfaction that comes when everything clicks, even if some elements, like World Tour, aren't the best.
