I found it to be a solid collection of upcoming releases - Sword of the Sea, in particular, looked nice. However, this wasn't the best showcase for Sony's first-party studios or a smattering of upcoming exclusives for the PS5.\n\nSome are fine with that. Others are probably angry.

While the remake might be faithful to the original to a fault, the changes it introduces\u2014like the modernized interface and controls\u2014are a welcome change and make System Shock an absolute joy to play.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1rVRbcycvw", "date_published": "2023-05-30 13:30:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Street Fighter 6 Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "Street Fighter 6 impressed us with its incredible sense of style from the very minute its gameplay was first revealed.
