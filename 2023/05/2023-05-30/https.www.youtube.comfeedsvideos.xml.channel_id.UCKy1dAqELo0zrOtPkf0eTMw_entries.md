## Diablo 4 Review

Diablo 4 reviewed by Travis Northup on Xbox Series X|S, also available on PlayStation and PC.

Blizzard's long-awaited sequel to Diablo 3 has near perfect endgame and progression design that makes it absolutely excruciating to put down. The story is a disappointment despite still being a noticeable improvement over Diablo 3 and there are some annoying bugs that need squashing, but the combat, the loot game, and both the sights and sounds of this world are impressive enough to smooth over those rough edges. Diablo 4 takes the strategy of refining things the series already did so well rather than giving it a more substantial overhaul, and that careful and reverent path has shaped this massive sequel into one of the most polished ARPGs ever created.

Reviewed by Mitchell Saltzman on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, and PC.

Street Fighter 6 comes out the gate swinging as the most feature-rich a Street Fighter game has ever been at launch. Boasting 18 characters, a 20+ hour single-player story mode, fantastic additions to the excellent 1-on-1 fighting formula, and a keen eye for nailing the smaller details that make a stellar fighting game. Street Fighter 6 has it all, and then some.
