Having opened the Sex boutique with Vivian Westwood in the mid-70s and managed the Sex Pistols and New York Dolls, he had both a reputation as a nonpareil troublemaker and no actual experience of making music himself, unless you counted the version of the old Max Bygraves song You Need Hands that he sang in The Great Rock\u2019n\u2019 Roll Swindle, his preposterous cinematic rewriting of the Pistols\u2019 story; and the handful of lyrics he\u2019d written for Bow Wow Wow, the band he was currently supposed to be managing, but in whom he\u2019d completely lost interest.</p><p>In 1981, he had pitched Steve Weltman of RCA some intriguing, if confused, ideas: Appalachian square dances, the South American and Caribbean music he\u2019d discovered on a scholarly 1958 album called The Dances of the World\u2019s Peoples (Vol 3), while browsing the record library at the Pompidou Centre in Paris, plus something about a club he had visited in New York where people span on their heads while listening to \u201cDJs who use record players like instruments \u2026 moving the needle manually backwards and forwards\u201d, which he kept insisting was the new punk rock. When Weltman went to Charisma Records in 1982 \u2013 best known for being home to Genesis \u2013 he signed McLaren without the latter having done a note of music. But ideas are one thing, and discernible musical talent is another entirely. And McLaren was completely deficient in the latter.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/30/duck-rock-at-50-malcolm-mclaren-seminal-album-with-a-queasy-underside\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/30/duck-rock-at-50-malcolm-mclaren-seminal-album-with-a-queasy-underside", "date_published": "2023-05-30 13:20:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Nato troops on guard in Kosovo town after clashes with Serb protesters", "description": "<p>Situation remains \u2018fragile but calm\u2019 as protesters in Serb-majority Zve\u010dan gather at town hall</p><p>Nato-led peacekeepers in full riot gear have secured a town hall in the Kosovo town of Zve\u010dan as the situation remained tense a day after 30 soldiers and more than 50 ethnic Serbian protesters were injured in clashes.</p><p>Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, had previously put the army on the highest level of combat alert, and on Tuesday Moscow accused the west of \u201cblaming\u201d Serbs it said were \u201cdriven to despair\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/30/nato-troops-on-guard-in-kosovo-town-after-clashes-with-serb-protesters\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/30/nato-troops-on-guard-in-kosovo-town-after-clashes-with-serb-protesters", "date_published": "2023-05-30 13:10:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Invasive moth species spreading across south-east England, say experts", "description": "<p>Government curbs transfer of trees to and from affected areas to limit spread of  rash-causing oak processionary moths</p><p>The government has introduced new legislation controlling the movement of oak trees in south-east England due to a rise in the numbers of a toxic, invasive moth species.</p><p>The oak processionary moth was first spotted in Kew Gardens, in south-west London, in 2006 after the eggs were imported on an oak from Europe.

Mozzarella, he adds, \u201cmelts beautifully and produces those extraordinary stretches because it\u2019s at that pH sweet spot of about 5.2\u201d. Then there\u2019s the age of the cheese to consider. \u201cYounger ones are held together by a sort of protein matrix,\u201d Smith explains, but that breaks down with time, which is why you can get those oil pools when extra-mature cheddar goes under the grill.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?
