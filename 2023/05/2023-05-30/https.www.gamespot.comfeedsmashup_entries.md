## The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Is Fun Even When You're Not Leatherface

<p dir="ltr">When The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (TCM) released in 1974, it was years before the slasher genre took hold of the horror world for decades. But by the time its sequels started to pour in beginning 12 years later, it was after horror buffs had met the likes of Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Freddy Krueger. In that new world, the marketing folks behind TCM needed a monstrous mascot to lean into, and thus Leatherface was elevated from one (admittedly standout) member of a vile family of killers to its centerpiece, eventually even garnering a prequel movie simply titled Leatherface.</p><p dir="ltr">Every modern take on the franchise since the underrated 2003 reboot has focused on the Ed Gein-inspired villain, often excluding any inclusion of his family at all. But Gun Interactive and Sumo Nottingham's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre/">upcoming video game</a> is based on that original movie, so it can't just be a Leatherface game. It has to be a game about the Slaughter family. After a few hours with the game during the weekend's tech test, it seems they understood the assignment.</p><p dir="ltr">Anecdotally, it seems the desire to be the powerful slasher at the heart of the franchise is a problem a lot of asymmetrical horror multiplayer games must account for. In Friday the 13th, players often preferred being Jason, while Dead By Daylight seems to have similar issues with players exclusively queuing as some of the many killers on its roster, rather than their potential victims. In TCM's unique 4v3 setup, players may prefer being the killers over the survivors--time will tell--but within that team of killers, one might expect players to demand to play as Leatherface himself given the spotlight he's enjoyed over the last 40+ years. Perhaps in the early days or weeks after launch, that will hold true. But in my experience, Leatherface's family members, the Cook and the Hitchhiker, are just as viable as the big man--in fact, I may even prefer one of them.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-is-fun-even-when-youre-not-leatherface/1100-6514663/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Lost Creator "Shocked And Appalled" Over Toxic Workplace Claims

<p>A new report, based on interviews with the cast and writers of Lost, reveals an unspoken racist and toxic culture behind the scenes of the hit show. <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/05/lost-tv-show-culture">In a Vanity-Fair-published excerpt from the upcoming book Burn It Down: Power, Complicity, and a Call for Change in Hollywood</a>, reporter Maureen Ryan details the hostile working environment behind the scenes of Lost. Ryan interviewed over a dozen people who worked on Lost across all six seasons.</p><p>Actor Harold Perrineau, who played Michael, told Ryan that the show constantly favored the white characters over the people of color. When Perrineau attempted to bring up his concerns, they were met with indifference or outright hostility. Eventually, he was fired before season 3 began shooting. Additionally, while the cast made early efforts to have equal pay, the cast ended up having compensation tiers, the highest of which was entirely occupied by white cast members.</p><p>The writer's room itself was reportedly also hostile to people of color, especially women. Writers who took offense or spoke up were ostracized. Multiple sources related that when Perrineau's departure from the show was discussed, Lindelof said, "[he] called me racist, so I fired his ass." Writer Hsu Taylor claimed that co-showrunner and executive producer Carlton Cuse took false credit for an acclaimed episode she had written and denied her work opportunities.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lost-creator-shocked-and-appalled-over-toxic-workplace-claims/1100-6514662/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Overwatch 2 team has <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23949662/">announced</a> that the game will be celebrating Pride month for the first time in the series' history beginning on June 1. These festivities will include a handful of small-yet-meaningful updates, including changes to two of the game's current maps: Midtown and Watchpoint: Gibraltar.</p><p>Starting on June 1, the Midtown map will be updated to showcase the city shortly after a Pride parade, with rainbow confetti and inclusive signage generously sprinkled throughout the entire map. Watchpoint: Gibraltar is getting a much more subtle update in the shape of a picture of Tracer and her longtime partner, Emily, placed in the barracks. This picture will also be available as a spray for Tracer.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4145464-ow_pride_traceremily_004.png"><img alt="A framed photo of Tracer and Emily." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4145464-ow_pride_traceremily_004.jpg" /></a><figcaption>A framed photo of Tracer and Emily.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to these map changes, the Pride event will also introduce several permanent icons and name cards to the game, allowing players to freely express their identities while they play. Those represented by the cards and icons include Agender, Aromantic, Asexual, Bisexual, Gay, Genderfluid, Intersex, Lesbian, Non-binary, Pansexual, and Transexual individuals. For fans looking to express themselves and their sexual identity outside of the world of Overwatch, the team also shared a link to <a href="https://gear.blizzard.com/collections/blizzard-pride?_gl=1*1p2izmp*_ga*Njc0MzcwNTAxLjE2ODQ1MTM5NDQ.*_ga_VYKNV7C0S3*MTY4NTQ3MzA1Ny4yLjAuMTY4NTQ3MzA1Ny42MC4wLjA.">Blizzard's Pride month collection</a>, with a note that all of Blizzard's net proceeds raised from May 16 through June 30 will be donated to the <a href="http://transequality.org/">National Center for Transgender Equality</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-team-announces-pride-month-event-plans-to-revisit-older-characters-identities/1100-6514660/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Sam Lake On Alan Wake 2: "There Was Never A Time When I Felt Like It Would Not Happen"

<p dir="ltr">To the public, a sequel to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake/">Alan Wake</a> didn't always seem possible. In fact, it seemed quite improbable at times. The 2010 original was never a sales juggernaut when it launched as an Xbox 360 exclusive, and with each passing year, the game felt less likely despite a core of passionate fans. Ending on a cliffhanger with more mysteries left unresolved than a season of Lost, players wanted more. Alan Wake had become a cult classic, but it can be hard to get back to a passion project like that, especially in an industry dominated by hits.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite all this, fans never stopped hoping for the game to get its follow-up, and Remedy always seemed just as keen--it just felt like the timing was never right. After many different iterations and interpretations of what the sequel would look like, Remedy has settled on a sequel that delves deep into a new genre and explores its world through a new character, alongside Alan. Continuing our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/">Alan Wake 2</a> coverage from last week, in which we <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/alan-wake-2-11-clues-you-may-have-missed-in-the-may-2023-trailer/2900-4756/">broke down the new trailer for clues</a> and introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exclusive-alan-wake-2-new-hero-saga-anderson-ushers-in-remedys-darkest-version-of-the-sequel/1100-6514543/">co-protagonist Saga Anderson</a>, GameSpot was able to catch up with Remedy's creative director and writer on Alan Wake 2, Sam Lake. I wanted to hear it from Lake himself--often seen as the face of the studio--exactly how we got here, and why he says it's even a good thing it's only happening now.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">"There was never a time when I felt that it would not happen. It just hadn't happened <em>yet</em>," Lake told me of the sequel, which is due out this October, nearly 14 years after the original hit shelves. "When you work on something with the intent of making it and then you realize it's not happening, there is disappointment for sure. But what happened with Quantum Break, what happened with Control, is that in that creative process of creating a concept [for Alan Wake 2], there were other ideas that sprang from that workshopping."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sam-lake-on-alan-wake-2-there-was-never-a-time-when-i-felt-like-it-would-not-happen/1100-6514610/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Mark Hamill, who famously plays Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars movie series, has commented on whether or not he could come back to play the character yet again. Speaking to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/mark-hamill-talks-the-machine-star-wars-1235501998/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Hamill said fans should not count on it.</p><p>There are a series of new Star Wars movies in the works, but Luke Skywalker is dead and Hamill doesn't think he's coming back. "No, I don't have any expectations of that happening," he said.</p><p>Luke Skywalker dies in 2017's The Last Jedi, but in the Star Wars universe, Jedi can live on as Force ghosts. Luke appeared in The Rise of Skywalker in this manner. Anything is possible in Hollywood, but it sure sounds like Hamill is done.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mark-hamill-on-whether-or-not-hed-return-to-star-wars/1100-6514659/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>House of the Dragon will soon return and, according to studio heads, it's going to be "extraordinary." In an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/francesca-orsi-hbo-qa-succession-finale-the-last-of-us-house-of-the-dragon-white-lotus-euphoria-perry-mason-1235374588/">Deadline</a> about the the state of HBO drama, executive vice president Francesca Orsi discussed the next season of House of the Dragon and the ongoing effects of the writers' strike.</p><p>According to Orsi, House of the Dragon season 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/production-of-house-of-the-dragon-season-2-will-continue-despite-hollywood-writers-strike/1100-6513773/">set to debut in the summer of 2024</a> and production is going well. She said, "We have a beautiful cast that was assembled by Kate Rhodes [James], and we just are proud of seeing how those scripts are coming alive, the emotionality that the cast is bringing to it is something that we feel confident with and know that we’re going to deliver something special." Co-creator Ryan Condal is still working on the show as a (non-writing) producer, as he completed the scripts for each episode ahead of the beginning of the strike.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-will-reportedly-be-shorter/1100-6512791/">previously reported</a>, House of Dragon season 2 will comprise eight episodes, a reduction from the previous season's 10. Orsi clarified that some of the story originally intended for season 2 has been moved to the third season. There is an ongoing debate as to whether <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/house-of-the-dragon-will-be-at-least-3-seasons-showrunner-says/1100-6513902/">the show will last three or four seasons</a>. Orsi said, "George [R. R. Martin] and Ryan [Condal] are going to meet after the writers strike. They had originally planned to meet before the strike took place and that was to figure out at what point the series itself was going to end."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-boss-teases-extraordinary-house-of-the-dragon-season-2/1100-6514656/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>We may have arrived in the age of streaming, but there's still something to be said for physical media -- movies just look better on disc, because they're less compressed than the streaming versions. If you want the best-looking version of a movie, you need that disc.

## WoW: Dragonflight's Dragonriding Will Expand To Older Zones And Mounts, Blizzard Confirms

<p>One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a>: Dragonflight's best features, dragonriding, will soon break free of the expansion it was introduced in and come to older areas of Azeroth, Blizzard has confirmed, though it might not as soon as some fans would like.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragonriding has revolutionized navigating Blizzard's MMO, turning the act of flying from a passive speed boost into active gameplay. The only downside is that dragonriding is currently only usable in the new Dragon Isles zones and with specific dragonriding mounts. There was a bit of excitement then when data-miners combing through the public test realm build of Dragonflight's upcoming Fractures in Time content patch discovered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-could-soon-revolutionize-how-players-fly-around-its-world/1100-6514115/">several indicators that pointed towards Blizzard adding dragonriding to the whole of Azeroth</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In the files were new options for "flight styles," one of which allowed for "dynamic flight abilities." That sounded an awful lot like dragonriding, and pointed towards some non-dragonriding mounts possibly being retrofitted to support the feature. Turns out, those data-miners were 100% correct, with Blizzard acknowledging their discovery in a recent <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/feedback-kalimdor-cup/1596833/49">forum post</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-dragonriding-will-expand-to-older-zones-and-mounts-blizzard-confirms/1100-6514653/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>HBO's Game of Thrones series was a cultural phenomenon and its prequel spin-off series, House of the Dragon, had a hit Season 1 with Seasons 2 and 3 on the way. The ongoing WGA strike has had a pencils-down effect on several shows as the studios continue to not negotiate, leaving the fate of some productions unknown at this time.</p><p>One of those productions is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-thrones-spinoff-about-jon-snow-confirmed-was-kit-haringtons-idea/1100-6504909/">Jon Snow spin-off series with Kit Harington</a>. The show was pitched by Harington to Game of Thrones writer George R. R. Martin successfully but kept the details of the show close to his chest. "There's not much more I can tell you, not until HBO gives me a green light," Martin said at the time.</p><p>However now that show might not make it to production. Talking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/francesca-orsi-hbo-qa-succession-finale-the-last-of-us-house-of-the-dragon-white-lotus-euphoria-perry-mason-1235374588/">Deadline</a>, Max's head of drama Francesca Orsi explained that not everything planned is going to make it to the streaming service with the ongoing strike and how things are run under the David Zaslav regime.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-thrones-jon-snow-spin-off-tv-series-update-no-guarantee-itll-be-made/1100-6514654/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">System Shock is one of the most influential games of the 90s, but its technical limitations and rough edges have made it difficult to revisit in the intervening 30 years. Nightdive Studios' remake of the game is now finally out, and judging by the reviews, it's a return to form, though it might stick a little too closely to the original's blueprint for true neophytes.</p><p dir="ltr">Over at GameSpot's sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/system-shock/critic-reviews">Metacritic</a>, System Shock (2023) has a Metascore of 75, denoting generally favorite reviews. However, it's worth noting that 75 is the lowest possible score in that bracket, as a 74 would denote mixed or average reviews. In general, critics have praised the game's visual upgrade over the original, while noting that it does not overhaul the basic systems of the original as much as you might expect.</p><p dir="ltr">System Shock is now out on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It released on May 30 and costs $40.

<p dir="ltr">After MagicCon Minneapolis earlier this month gave a few small teases about the upcoming set, this week's WeeklyMTG livestream saw Wizards Of The Coast drop a motherlode of information on Magic: The Gathering's upcoming Lord Of The Rings: Tales Of Middle-earth set, with over 120 cards and card variants revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">The reveal showed 126 cards in total, with every Magic: The Gathering color and card type represented. The only new mechanic coming from this set is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-the-ring-tempts-you-in-the-magic-the-gatherings-lord-of-the-rings-expansion/1100-6513838/">The Ring Tempts You</a>, where a creature becomes the Ring-Bearer and gains abilities whenever a card includes that line of text. However, two other mechanics from Magic's past will feature in the set as well:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Amass, which lets a player create a creature token and power it up every time a card reads "Amass X." In LOTR's case, players will amass Orc Army tokens.</li><li dir="ltr">Sagas, which are enchantments that have one action when the enter the battlefield, and then during the controlling's players upkeep, they gain a lore counter and perform another action. Once all actions on the card have been completed, the Saga is sacrificed.</li></ul><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4143842-daily_icon-1080x1920_431884.png"><img alt="Aragorn and Arwen, Wed." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4143842-daily_icon-1080x1920_431884.png" /></a><figcaption>Aragorn and Arwen, Wed.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">The set focuses on the book versions of J.R.R.

<p>The Last of Us was one of HBO's most popular shows in recent years, and fans are understandably eager to learn when the series might return for its second season. We don't know when that will be, but HBO boss Francesca Orsi has stated that the plan, prior to the start of the Hollywood writers' strike, was for the drama based on Naughty Dog's video game to come back for its sophomore season in 2025.</p><p>She told <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/francesca-orsi-hbo-qa-succession-finale-the-last-of-us-house-of-the-dragon-white-lotus-euphoria-perry-mason-1235374588/">Deadline</a> that it's "too early to tell" how the schedule might be impacted due to the work stoppage, though. "We were looking at The Last Of Us for some time in 2025," Orsi said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Orsi said Season 2 will add new cast members, but she "can't get into" that right now. Season 2 is expected to adapt the events of The Last of Us Part II, and one of the central characters of that game, Abby, is expected to appear in Season 2 of the show. Orsi also confirmed that Season 2 will film in Vancouver, as opposed to Calgary from Season 1.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-was-planned-for-2025-prior-to-writers-strike/1100-6514648/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After almost a decade behind the wheel of its Destiny series, Bungie is returning to its roots with a new chapter in its Marathon franchise. Revealed at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-may-2023-start-time-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6514429/">May 2023 PlayStation Showcase</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-revival-of-pre-halo-sci-fi-series-marathon/1100-6514533/">Marathon</a> is a multiplayer-focused return to the classic trilogy of Mac games that helped put Bungie on the map.</p><p>With a rich lore, groundbreaking gameplay elements, and ideas that would help shape the studio's work on Halo and Destiny, Bungie's return to a series that has laid dormant for almost three decades is something to take notice of. Unlike a lot of games that are also in early stages of development, there's actually a decent amount of information on this project and what you can expect from it. </p><p>After the reveal, Bungie said that it would be going dark and that new details won't be revealed for quite a while. We've gathered up all the information below, and you can read up on how Marathon is shaping up so far.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>We hope you're hungry, because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV</a> and KFC have partnered once again, this time to offer exclusive weapon cosmetics. Developer Blizzard and the fried chicken chain previously teamed up to give away closed beta keys earlier this year.</p><p dir="ltr">This time around, there are five exclusive weapon cosmetics to earn by ordering KFC either online or through the restaurant's official app. You'll need to link your Battle.net account and your KFC account to start earning rewards. Thankfully, the simple act of linking the two accounts will earn you one cosmetic free of charge.</p><p dir="ltr">For the remaining four, however, you'll have to order and pick up some food. According to an <a href="https://www.kfc.com/diablo">official webpage for the promotion</a>, any qualifying purchase and pick-up will unlock a reward, as designated by a "Unlock Diablo IV Rewards'' banner blazoned across various menu items. The least expensive option appears to be buying a classic or spicy chicken sandwich on its own for around $5 (though some prices do vary by region). The promotion is for U.S. residents only and runs from now until July 15, though you'll need to make your qualifying purchases by July 2.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-kfc-weapon-cosmetic-promotion-asks-you-to-eat-a-whole-lot-of-fried-chicken/1100-6514651/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

At a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-ace-for-games-generative-ai-npcs/">keynote</a> earlier this month, Nvidia unveiled a suite of AI-powered tools for creating NPCs that it's calling Nvidia Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE).

Nvidia Riva is a service that uses automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech tech to "enable live speech conversation with Nvidia NeMo." It also has Nvidia Omniverse Audio2Face, which creates facial animation for game characters from an audio source. The suite is also easily connected to Unreal Engine 5.</p><p dir="ltr">The above demo shows off the capabilities of the technology.

## Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best

<p dir="ltr">It's sometimes difficult to reconcile that Diablo III is over a decade old. Its release was polarizing for a number of reasons, but its evolving formula of action role-playing endured, enjoying a resurgence with its post-launch expansion that carried through years of ongoing seasonal updates. It shouldn't come as a surprise, then, that each of those years helped inform the design of Diablo IV, a game which confidently delivers gameplay that has been carried forward and refined from both Diablo II and III, while also establishing a strong foundation for the franchise's future.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo games have always contained stories for their single-player campaigns, but you'd be forgiven for thinking of past storylines as merely contextualization for the game's primary focus: dungeon-crawling. That's where Diablo IV makes one of its most striking changes: It not only takes its story far more seriously, but it tells one that's far more engrossing than ever before. As a traveling wanderer, you come across a small town of villagers on a snow-capped mountain range looking for some aid. After killing some creatures and returning, you're welcomed as a hero and given food and shelter, only for the villagers to try to use you in a ritual sacrifice to Lilith, co-creator of Sanctuary and recently resurrected antagonist of this tale, moments later. This encounter links you to Lilith, driving you forward on a quest to stop her plan of amassing an army for her own nefarious purposes.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Much of that sounds like standard Diablo fare. There's a big, bad demon, and you're the only one who can stop it. But Diablo IV makes intelligent use of Lilith, layering her motivations slowly to the point where you can't help but consider her side of the argument. She's not driven solely by the lust for destruction. Instead, she's grieving, with the place she once created to escape the endless cycle of war between heaven and hell now being used as a staging ground to continue it. She's an antagonist that has been slighted by those she trusted at every turn, and while her means of exacting justice provide the reason for your entire crusade in the first place, it's surprising and equally welcome when Diablo IV forces you to slow down and consider the true goal of your struggle.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Max Head Talks About Everchanging Plans With Strike Still Ongoing

<p>HBO once defined itself with its dramatic lineup from The Sopranos which revolutionized the "prestige drama" to Oz and Six Feet Under. With the Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon coming back and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/house-of-the-dragon-will-be-at-least-3-seasons-showrunner-says/1100-6513902/">will be at least three seasons long</a>, and the adaptation of The Last of Us also returning, the heads over at the newly christened Max are coming up with a game plan to keep people plugged in despite the ongoing WGA strike.</p><p>"While everything at this moment is pencils down, I’m hopeful that we can come to terms sooner than later. Otherwise, we will have to assess what is the end of the '24 schedule, what are the shows that are going to be delivered for 2025," said Max's head of drama Francesca Orsi told <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/francesca-orsi-hbo-qa-succession-finale-the-last-of-us-house-of-the-dragon-white-lotus-euphoria-perry-mason-1235374588/">Deadline</a>. "At this point, those shows that I'm looking to air wouldn't necessarily be ready if this strike lasts six to nine months. So yes, that's a big question for us, but I think we'll cross that road once we come to it."</p><p>The Last of Us Season 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-was-planned-for-2025-prior-to-writers-strike/1100-6514648/">was planned for 2025</a>, prior to the beginning of the strike, Orsi explained. The strike has already affected another Game of Thrones spin-off, A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight. Freshman shows like Euphoria and Perry Mason were delayed because of COVID going into their second season, as well, and no date has been set for further seasons in the pipeline. Fan favorites The Gilded Age and Winning Time are returning this year for their second season, too, but everything is now on a day-to-day basis on renewal.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/max-head-talks-about-everchanging-plans-with-strike-still-ongoing/1100-6514650/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>At long last, Sony has a new handheld gaming console on the way. Kind of. Revealed at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-showcase-may-2023-the-biggest-games-and-announcements/1100-6514540/">PlayStation Showcase</a> in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-is-returning-to-handheld-gaming-sort-of-with-project-q/1100-6514539/">Project Q</a> is a streaming device that can transmit PS5 games directly from the console and onto its screen. Sony is entering cloud gaming territory that Microsoft has had a major presence in for years, but Sony has its work cut out for it when it comes to marketing this hardware and convincing consumers as to why it's better than a tablet or smartphone using Remote Play and a Bluetooth-tethered controller.</p><p>Project Q only got a brief shoutout at the PlayStation Showcase, but some interesting information is available ahead of a bigger reveal from Sony later this year.</p><h2>Release date</h2><p>There's no exact date yet for Project Q, but Sony has confirmed that it will launch "later" this year. A report from Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson claims that the device <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-handheld-project-q-will-launch-in-november-report/1100-6514569/">will launch in November</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-q-release-date-price-and-everything-we-know-about-sonys-new-playstation-handheld/1100-6514623/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A group of experts in the field of artificial intelligence, including some of the companies directly involved in the space and those who stand to benefit commercially, have signed a document saying AI poses a major risk to human life. A <a href="https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk">statement posted on the Center for AI Safety website</a> says that mitigating the risk of "extinction from AI" should be as significant a priority as other "societal-scale" risks like nuclear war and pandemics.</p><p>Dozens of experts in the field of AI have signed a statement on AI's risks, including OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman, the CEO of Google DeepMind, Demis Hassabis; Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott and Microsoft chief scientific officer Eric Horvitz; Cambridge University professor of physics Martin Rees; the musician Grimes; and numerous other people from universities, OpenAI, Google, and other institutions around the world.</p><p>"Despite its importance, AI safety remains remarkably neglected, outpaced by the rapid rate of AI development. Currently, society is ill-prepared to manage the risks from AI," the Center for AI Safety said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-is-an-extinction-level-concern-similar-to-nuclear-war-experts-warn/1100-6514645/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Valheim Developers Say Paid Mods Are "Against The Open And Creative Spirit Of Modding Itself"

<p dir="ltr">Valheim is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valheim-reaches-nearly-7-million-sales-and-its-still-growing/1100-6491759/">biggest indie hits</a> in recent memory, spawning a loyal playerbase and a thriving mod scene. Developer Iron Gate clarified in a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3705945096234321242">Steam announcement</a> that the team behind the game does not condone the practice of paid mods, which they feel is "against the creative and open spirit of modding itself."</p><p dir="ltr">To clarify, Iron Gate is specifically talking about the practice of keeping your mod behind a paywall, in part or in its entirety. The team say that they support voluntary donations to mod authors, but that they are wholly against mods that require payment to access.</p><p dir="ltr">Iron Gate also clarifies a few other aspects of Valheim's mod scene in the Steam post. The studio notes that the game currently lacks any official mod support, meaning that all mods for the game are installed at the user's own risk, and that those mods may not be compatible with newer versions of the game. The developer also stated that it would appreciate if mod authors would include some sort of message indicating that their mods are unofficial, especially given that players often join servers that force them to download mods without the user realizing it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valheim-developers-say-paid-mods-are-against-the-open-and-creative-spirit-of-modding-itself/1100-6514642/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The beloved Wii and GameCube emulator Dolphin was set to launch on Steam earlier this month, but Nintendo had other plans. The team behind the project announced that its Steam launch is "indefinitely postponed" after Valve removed the listing due to a Nintendo C&amp;D that cites the DMCA.</p><p dir="ltr">The legal notice from Nintendo (as reviewed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nintendo-sends-valve-dmca-notice-to-block-steam-release-of-wii-emulator-dolphin/">PC Gamer</a>) claims that the emulator violates Nintendo's intellectual property rights. It specifically claims that Dolphin uses "cryptographic keys without Nintendo's authorization" and "decrypts ROMs at or immediately before runtime." This wording specifically appeals to one aspect of the DMCA, which states that circumventing a technological measure that controls access is illegal.</p><p dir="ltr">"This emulator illegally circumvents Nintendo's protection measures and runs illegal copies of games," a Nintendo representative <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gamecube-wii-emulator-dolphin-valve-piracy-1850482929">told Kotaku</a> via email. "Using illegal emulators or illegal copies of games harms development and ultimately stifles innovation.

<p>It turns out that Zonai pots are useful to have in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, as not only can you use them to make some quick health-restoring meals between battles, but you can also use them to improve the comfort of your ride. On Twitter, Star Games Blog detailed how when a Zonai pot is attached to the end of an object, it creates a ball-and-socket joint. Once you attach a wheel to the other end of the construct, you're left with a far more flexible vehicle that can be ridden around Hyrule's rough terrain.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">携帯鍋はジョイントとして優秀!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%80%E3%81%AE%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#ゼルダの伝説</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TearsOfTheKingdom?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#TearsOfTheKingdom</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#ティアキン</a><a href="https://t.co/s8DNKmlAm8">https://t.co/s8DNKmlAm8</a> <a href="https://t.co/QpNzxttiZI">pic.twitter.com/QpNzxttiZI</a></p>  — ティアキンネタまとめ【totk,zelda tears of the kingdom】 (@STARGAMES_blog) <a href="https://twitter.com/STARGAMES_blog/status/1663042985288781824?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">May 29, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p><span>Surprising discoveries like this have become commonplace in Tears of the Kingdom since it launched this month, as players have been using the game's Zonai technology to engineer all manner of powerful devices, vehicles, and weapons.

## Robert Englund Reflects On A Life As Freddy Krueger, And The Evolution Of Nightmare On Elm Street

<p dir="ltr">You may not know the name Robert Englund straight off, but his alter ego, Freddy Krueger, is known by millions. The burned child killer of nightmares--and slasher movie greatness--became something of a legend when he debuted in Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984. The role of Freddy Krueger was taken on by Robert Englund, who, up through this point in his career, had been a solidly working actor. He wasn't a superstar; he wasn't a name. He was an actor who had appeared in a dozen feature films, as everything from the best friend to the thug, from comedy and drama to horror and sci-fi.</p><p dir="ltr">But things changed in 1984, when he auditioned for the role of Freddy Krueger. Not because it was some kind of calling, but because it was a job. This is one of the things you learn in Hollywood Dreams &amp; Nightmares: The Robert Englund Story, a documentary about Englund's career. It will be available on Screambox and digitally beginning on June 6.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, a large part of this documentary is about Freddy Krueger and his career in horror, but it also focuses on Englund's beginnings in theater, his non-horror roles, and how Mark Hamill wouldn't have become Luke Skywalker without him. I spoke with Englund to discuss what we learned in the documentary--and what we didn't.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robert-englund-reflects-on-a-life-as-freddy-krueger-and-the-evolution-of-nightmare-on-elm-street/1100-6514631/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Star Wars TV series Obi-Wan Kenobi got solid reviews and people seemed to like seeing Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen return, but the series was conceived as a standalone limited show and there are no plans for additional episodes. That's according to director Deborah Chow, who told <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/obi-wan-kenobi-ep-director-deborah-chow-on-three-year-journey-with-disney-series-whether-theres-more-crew-call-podcast-1235382284/">Deadline</a> that while the book is closed for now, she believes there is a possibility for more storytelling.</p><p>"This was conceived as a limited series; it is closed," Chow told Deadline. "There's 10 more years before New Hope, so never say never."</p><p>Obi-Wan Kenobi takes place years after Revenge of the Sith and features McGregor returning as Obi-Wan and a young Princess Leia played by Vivien Lyra Blair.

## Silent Hill: Ascension Will Let You Decide The Series' Canonical Story

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-ascension/">Silent Hill: Ascension</a> was announced alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake a few months ago, and while most of us were understandably focused on returning to one of the best horror games of all time, it looks like Ascension could be one of the series' most ambitious games yet. You could play a direct role in shaping the official Silent Hill story, too.</p><p>In a new trailer, developer Genvid Entertainment--the studio behind The Walking Dead: Last Mile--paint a suitably bleak picture. Set in several places around the world rather than in the titular Silent HIll, the game sees horrors living in communities and passed on from one generation to the next. Murders in the various communities, as well as "long-suppressed guilt and fears," cause monsters to emerge and terrorize those within. We see several monsters in the trailer, including a Lovecraftian giant and some sort of bat-like monster, with a human figure wielding a scepter in the shadows at the very end. </p><p>Silent Hill: Ascension makes use of real-time streaming gameplay to allow the community to decide what happens. Which of the characters live will be entirely determined by players, and there will be "live story moments" later this year, with daily changes based on what the community did so far. These won't just be one-off "what if" stories, either: They will exist alongside the rest of Silent Hill as official canon. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-ascension-will-let-you-decide-the-series-canonical-story/1100-6514630/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After months of speculation, Konami finally confirmed at the May PlayStation Showcase that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-remake-metal-gear-solid-collection-revealed/1100-6514455/">remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a> is in development. Remaking what is arguably considered to be the best game in the Metal Gear Solid series is no small feat, and fittingly, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is being worked on under a veil of secrecy.</p><p>The original game blended jungle survival with a tight political plot, heartbreaking betrayals, and an origin story for Big Boss, who operated under the codename of Naked Snake in the game. For the remake reveal, Konami showed off a jungle environment that was populated by dangerous wildlife, military structures, and Naked Snake working a scowl so hard that it had begun absorbing the fabric of his bandana. And yes, that is Cynthia Harrell’s rendition of the Snake Eater theme song that you hear at the end.</p><p>Details are slim on the game for now, but after combing through official assets, social media, and Konami data, we've managed to piece together an early look at the Snake Eater remake that's currently in development.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6514614/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">In one play session, I'm honing my skills with my main man Zangief. In another, I'm walking a fully customized avatar through a bustling city, its streets lined with AI-controlled strangers I can challenge to battle at my leisure. In a third, that same avatar is dropped into a massive room filled with arcade cabinets and other players looking for a fight. Street Fighter 6 learns an immediate lesson from the content-bare release of its predecessor, as it offers a variety of significant features and modes right out of the gate. It is a robust, fighting game that is of a premiere quality. Street Fighter 6 is incredible; a return to form for the franchise that welcomes both new fighters and seasoned pros.</p><p dir="ltr">SF6 splits its content into three hubs: Fighting Ground, which most closely emulates the classic SF experience; Battle Hub, where players can congregate to challenge each other and compete in tournaments; and World Tour, which is a sprawling, globe-trotting story mode with an open world and RPG hooks. Each format centers around the classic Street Fighter style of 2D fighting gameplay, and that excellent core experience is what drives everything.</p><p dir="ltr">Mechanically, Street Fighter 6 doesn't fall far from previous games in the series: You have multiple normal attacks, special attacks, Super Arts, and movement techniques specially designed for each of the roster's 18 characters. Some have an in-your-face style with heavy strikes and damaging throws, while others are better suited to keeping their distance and picking moments to strike. What distinguishes SF6 from previous iterations are the core universal mechanics shared by all characters. While the effects and execution are the same for each fighter, these mechanics have their own distinct flair and flourish of personality depending on the character you choose. These universal mechanics are also where much of Street Fighter 6's gameplay depth is.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/street-fighter-6-review-battle-hardened/1900-6418073/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p> Last week Microsoft filed its appeal against the UK Competition and Markets Authority's decision to block its acquisition, and now the <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2023-05/2023.05.25_Microsoft_Activision_Rule_14_summary_final.pdf">details of its appeal</a> have been revealed. Microsoft has said that the CMA made "fundamental errors" when assessing its position in the cloud gaming sector, a vital part of the UK's decision to block the acquisition.</p><p>Microsoft has said that the CMA failed to properly consider the constraints of "native gaming," that is playing a game that is installed on your device, on cloud gaming services. Microsoft argues that cloud gaming shouldn't be seen as a seperate market, due to the potential for gamers to decide to switch to native gaming instead. </p><p>Along with correcting the CMA's "erroneous, narrow, market definition" of cloud gaming, Microsoft points to "three long-term commercial agreements" that would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-stands-up-for-microsoft-after-uk-blocks-activision-merger/1100-6513696/">bring Microsoft-owned games to other cloud services</a> for the next ten years, including Activision titles if the merger goes through.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uk-made-fundamental-errors-in-blocking-activision-sale-microsoft-says-in-appeal/1100-6514625/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
