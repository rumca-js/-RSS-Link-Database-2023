<ul><li>Manager fails to offer any guarantees he will stay after final</li><li>Mourinho says he was denied chance to win trophy at Spurs</li></ul><p>If this is to be José Mourinho’s last game at Roma, at least it is a final. The Portuguese coach, who left Porto and Internazionale to join Chelsea and Real Madrid immediately after winning European Cups in 2004 and 2010 respectively, admitted that his concerned club captains have asked him if history might repeat itself in Hungary. As he seeks his sixth major European title at a fourth different club, he also offered another pointed reminder that he was denied the chance to win a trophy at Tottenham Hotspur, who sacked him six days before the Carabao Cup final in 2021.</p><p>Roma face Sevilla in the Europa League final in Budapest amidst doubts over Mourinho’s future, with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain among potential destinations. He said that he had not spoken to any clubs, insisted that all that matters is winning a second European trophy in two years, and noted that the situation is even more complicated for his counterpart José Luis Mendilibar, whose short-term contract in Seville expires next month. But he did not offer any guarantees beyond the final, hinting instead at a departure most in Rome expect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/30/jose-mourinho-admits-roma-captains-asked-if-history-will-repeat-itself-if-they-win-europa-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>City winning five of the last six titles has not diluted interest as the popularity of England’s top flight outstrips its competitors</p><p>There are concerns in England about whether the increasing dominance of Manchester City will reduce the popular and commercial appeal of the Premier League. The signs in Asia, the biggest overseas market, however, suggest that even a succession of City processions will result in more fans for the club rather than fewer for the league.</p><p>“Nobody in South Korea thinks that the Premier League will not be competitive, especially if City can also achieve meaningful results continentally and there are still dogfights between big clubs to qualify for the Champions League,” Baek Jung-hyun, head of planning at KBS Sports, South Korea’s public broadcaster, said. “There are enough interesting points in the Premier League for Korean fans. Arsenal could have been champions and nobody expected that at the start of the season.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/30/premier-league-still-booming-in-asia-despite-manchester-city-dominance">Continue reading...</a>
