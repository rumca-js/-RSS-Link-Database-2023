<p>Nestled among the flood of Computex news about AI, laptops, and other PC advancements are the crazy builds that we&rsquo;ve all come to know and love. (Anyone still remember the re-creation of Thor&rsquo;s Mjolnir?) And while this year may not have such a strong focus on the stuff of myth and legend, you can still find legendary PC builds on the show floor&mdash;like Cooler Master&rsquo;s wild sneaker PC.</p>



<p>This mix of plastic, aluminum, and steel isn&rsquo;t small, either&mdash;measuring 25.6 x 12 x 25.6 inches (650 x 306 x 651mm), this case definitely has a <em>footprint</em>. Cooler Master describes it in the press release as &ldquo;perfect for sneaker enthusiasts, collectors, and gamers looking to showcase their style alongside their gaming passion.&rdquo; But in real terms, it&rsquo;s for anybody who wants to have a dramatic conversation piece.</p>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container"><ul class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper"><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="Cooler Master Sneaker X" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-1935753" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sneaker-X-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" /></figure></li><li class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide"><figure><img alt="Cooler Master Sneaker X special edition" class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-1935754" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sneaker-X-Pink-4-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /></figure></li></ul><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white"></a><a class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause"></a><div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white"></div></div></div>



<p>The Sneaker X will come as a kit, with the case populated with a Cooler Master Masterfan MFL120 Halo RGB fan, 850W Cooler Master V850 Gold SFX power supply, Master Liquid PL360 Flux Sneaker Edition CPU cooler, 400mm PCIe 4 x16 riser cable, PWM fan, and ARGB controller. You&rsquo;ll have to acquire and install your own CPU, mini-ITX motherboard, memory, storage (max of one 2.5-inch SSD in the case), and graphics card (up to 304mm in length and three slots thick).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Standard off-the-shelf PC components work with this one-of-a-kind case, so if you get the urge to replace parts down the road, it&rsquo;s a simple shopping trip. You probably will want to stretch its life out, too, given the Sneaker X&rsquo;s cost. When it launches in early July, it&rsquo;ll set you back $5,999. Cooler Master is promising the red variant in the photo above, but its data sheet also teases &ldquo;special editions&rdquo; as well&mdash;which are hinted at in the sample images on the company&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://summit.coolermaster.com/chronos/streaming/sneaker-x/&amp;xcust=2-1-1935746-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Sneaker X concept site</a>.</p>

## MSIâ€™s Project Zero continues the war on motherboard cables

<p>Threading cables to and from the power supply to the motherboard and other components has been a headache for PC builders for decades. But what would happen if you could just tuck them out of the way? That&rsquo;s MSI&rsquo;s Project Zero, designed for AMD Ryzen builds, that MSI showed off at Computex.</p>



<p>Project Zero puts the cables on the back of the case, plumbing through the connectors to the bottom of the motherboard where a thin gap allows the cables to snake through without impeding airflow. That&rsquo;s the key. While a largely cable-less central chamber may look fresh and clean (and it does!) the idea is to eliminate any obstacles to that sweet, sweet cool air as it flows inside the chassis.</p>



<p>Of course, you&rsquo;ll need a motherboard that accommodates this, and that&rsquo;s the other piece of the puzzle: a microATX Project Zero board that MSI plans, too. For now, the board is built around a B650, AMD&rsquo;s mainstream chipset for the AM5 socket used by the Ryzen 7000 series. We don&rsquo;t have pricing for this yet, but we know that it will ship sometime in the second half of the year.</p>



<p>For those who might be thinking, <em>hey, this feels kind of familiar</em> &mdash; well, you&rsquo;re right. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/705375/take-a-closer-look-at-gigabytes-wire-free-project-stealth-motherboard.html">Gigabyte and Aorus tipped off Project Stealth</a> last year, which also routes the connectors down through the board to the back, and hides them in the back of the case. The difference? Project Stealth was an ATX board. MSI plans an ATX board as well, but that&rsquo;s coming in the future. Gordon Ung walks you through what all this means in our video, below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>What&rsquo;s even better is that MSI sounds like that they&rsquo;re willing to work with other board vendors, too. We don&rsquo;t have a formal, collaborative name for all of this, but it sounds like there&rsquo;s at least a willingness to allow you to mix and match these sorts of compact, reversed boards in the future. And that&rsquo;s good news for everybody. </p>

## Asus revives ROG Matrix as a chart-topping RTX 4090 with liquid metal inside

<p>Now that EVGA and its beloved Kingpin GPUs are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1069790/report-evga-is-ditching-graphics-cards.html">out of the picture</a>, there&rsquo;s room at the top for a new company to perch atop the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">no-compromises graphics card throne</a>. And Asus&rsquo;s Republic of Gamers division just made a mighty convincing claim, reviving the long-dormant Matrix brand for a fire-breathing, chart-topping version of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">monstrous GeForce RTX 4090</a>, complete with tricks learned from years of building high-performance laptops.</p>



<p>&ldquo;No reason to beat around the bush: the ROG Matrix GeForce RTX 4090 has the highest boost clocks of any RTX 4090 on the planet,&rdquo; Asus proudly crows in its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/articles/gaming-graphics-cards/an-icon-returns-introducing-the-rog-matrix-geforce-rtx-4090/&amp;xcust=2-1-1935716-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> (while neglecting to specify those speeds). The liquid-cooled beast comes with a custom 360mm radiator and a trio of the company&rsquo;s ROG MF-12S ARGB fans, while a custom-engineered coldplate helps keep not only the GPU itself, but also the VRMs and memory chips cool. This thing was made to shatter 3Dmark Hall of Fame records.</p>



<p>But perhaps the most interesting part? The cooling material used to connect the GPU to all that heavy metal. The Asus ROG Matrix features liquid metal thermal compound rather than traditional paste.</p>



<p>Liquid metal offers significantly cooler temperatures than traditional paste, but it&rsquo;s also electrically conductive&mdash;which means if it&rsquo;s not carefully applied, the material could also short-circuit your graphics card. Gulp. But Asus has spent the last several years perfecting liquid metal application in a range of potent ROG laptops like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/399315/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-gx550-review-two-screens-and-a-whole-lot-of-speed.html">Zephyrus Duo</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394673/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-review.html">Strix G15 Advantage Edition</a> and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394093/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-with-xg-mobile-gpu.html">ROG Flow X13</a>, all of which scored highly in PCWorld reviews.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Matrix RTX 4090" class="wp-image-1935723" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/070A8521_PCW.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>That liquid metal sure is purdy.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>Now Asus feels confident enough to bring liquid metal to the ROG Matrix RTX 4090. Here&rsquo;s how the company describes it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&ldquo;Building on years of expertise with liquid metal in the ROG laptop division, we have a patented production process that can safely harness the power of liquid metal while still allowing for vertical GPU mounting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By applying a UV resin above the surface-mounted capacitors that border the GPU die, and then adding two additional protective layers between the die and the main PCB, we ensured that the ROG Matrix GeForce RTX 4090 exploits the incredible thermal transfer inherent to liquid metal with no risk of leakage.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>



<p>Giddy up. And Asus is putting those lower temperatures to good use by giving buyers up to 600 watts of overclocked power, blowing past the stock 4090&rsquo;s 450W rating.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Matrix RTX 4090" class="wp-image-1935721" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/070A8538_PCW.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asus ROG Matrix RTX 4090&rsquo;s hollow chamber design.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>Add in magnetic connectors that make cable management a breeze, a stainless steel backplate, and a ferociously attractive &ldquo;hollow chamber&rdquo; design augmented with the company&rsquo;s Aura Lighting RGB and it&rsquo;s clear that Asus revived the Matrix for discerning, deep-pocketed PC gamers. Asus hasn&rsquo;t officially disclosed pricing for the ROG Matrix RTX 4090, but considering that the RTX 4090 starts at $1,600 and previous Matrix GPUs cost $2,000 <em>without</em> all the fancy liquid metal and water cooling, expect this beast to put a dent in your savings account when it hits the streets next quarter.</p>

## Nvidia passes $1 trillion market cap as investors fall in love with AI

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Investors, perhaps searching for a foundation upon which to lay their AI investments, appear to have found one: Nvidia, whose market capitalization Tuesday makes it the first trillion-dollar chip maker.</p>



<p>At press time, Nvidia&rsquo;s stock price had jumped to $409.76 per share, giving it a market capitalization of $1.014 trillion.</p>



<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s fortunes soared last week, when the company reported net income of $2.04 billion on revenue of $7.192 billion. Surprisingly, revenues fell 13 percent from a year ago. Investors ignored that, however, as Nvidia estimated that the current quarter would bring in $11.0 billion in revenue, an almost unheard-of quarter-over-quarter increase. Wall Street sent shares soaring from about $303 to just under $380 overnight.</p>



<p>Although a number of chip companies, big and small, have invested in AI, Nvidia is seen as perhaps the largest and most viable vendor right now. Most AI functions require large amounts of repetitive computational power and memory to operate in&mdash;and Nvidia&rsquo;s GPUs are primarily the chief driver on the consumer side. At Microsoft Build, for example, Nvidia said that its RTX GPUs will add Max-Q low-power inferencing for AI workloads. Nvidia also announced a partnership with Mediatek to provide a graphics/AI chiplet, though just in the automotive space.</p>



<p>Nvidia spent most of Computex talking about its enterprise announcements, however, including that what Nvidia calls its GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip is in full production for AI workloads across the globe. </p>



<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a war going on out there in AI, and Nvidia today is the only arms dealer out there,&rdquo; Srini Pajjuri, a managing director at investment firm Raymond James,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-touches-1-trillion-market-cap-as-chipmaker-rides-ai-wave-133530381.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1935564-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">said</a> according to Yahoo Finance. &ldquo;So as a result we&rsquo;re seeing this huge jump in revenues.&rdquo;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily true, of course. Rival AMD is also trying to push into AI, with chief executive Dr. Lisa Su telling analysts that AI was the chief strategic priority at the company.<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1815008/why-amd-thinks-ryzen-xdna-ai-is-the-future.html">  AMD&rsquo;s Ryzn AI</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1076150/intel-confirms-ai-improvements-will-come-in-meteor-lake.html">Intel&rsquo;s Meteor Lake</a> will add AI, too.</p>



<p>For right now, however, investors don&rsquo;t care. Nvidia is pushing its chips into AI, and Wall Street is pushing its chips onto Nvidia.</p>

## Nvidia still cares about PC gamers, CEO says: DLSS AI came first

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Yes, PC gamers, Nvidia still cares about you. So said CEO Jensen Huang in a roundtable interview with reporters in Taipei.</p>



<p>After a week which saw Nvidia&rsquo;s value increase to $1 trillion on the back of AI data center hardware, followed by a Computex keynote that had barebones appeal to PC gamers, many were wondering if the company still cared about gaming anymore.</p>



<p>The answer, Nvidia&rsquo;s CEO says, is yes, yes indeed. In the company&rsquo;s eyes, that priority can be seen in the AI products that Nvidia focused on first.</p>



<p>In response to a question from PCWorld asking if gamers were right to feel like an older child jealous of the newborn AI baby, Jensen jokingly feigned insult.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>&ldquo;Number one, RTX was invented for gamers and for RTX, the technology, the most important technology is AI. Without AI, we could not do ray tracing in real time,&rdquo; Huang said. &ldquo;It was not even possible. And the first AI project in our company&mdash;the number one AI focus was Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). Deep learning. That is the pillar of RTX.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Number two, notice what we did with generative AI, the first application was ACE&mdash;Avatar Cloud Engine&mdash;you hurt my feeling so deeply,&rdquo; Huang responded jokingly. The newly revealed <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-ace-for-games-sparks-life-into-virtual-characters-with-generative-ai&amp;xcust=2-1-1935511-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">ACE for Games</a> is &ldquo;a custom AI model foundry service that transforms games by bringing intelligence to non-playable characters (NPCs) through AI-powered natural language interactions.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Huang&rsquo;s Q&amp;A largely addressed questions from the hundred international reporters focused on AI in enterprise applications but Huang did touch a little on the other hot button topic on gamer&rsquo;s minds: The 8GB of RAM in the recently launched <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html">GeForce RTX 4060 Ti graphics card</a>, which reviewers (including us here at PCWorld) have criticized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember the frame buffer is not the memory of the computer&mdash;it is a cache,&rdquo; Huang said. &ldquo;And how you manage the cache is a big deal. It is like any other cache. And yes, the bigger the cache is better. However, you&rsquo;re trading off against so many things,&rdquo; Huang said.</p>



<p>Likening it to an equation or even &ldquo;kung fu,&rdquo; Huang said it&rsquo;s a balancing act weighing cost, power and the cores that sometimes you have to feel your way through. In the end, Huang said the 8GB of RAM in the first iteration of the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti was the right amount.</p>

## Is your PC is tough enough for Street Fighter 6? Run Capcomâ€™s free benchmark

<p><em>Street Fighter 6</em> is here, and according to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDd1fksfE_U&amp;xcust=2-1-1935409-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">early reviews</a>, it kicks ass. [Hey boss, am I allowed to say &ldquo;ass&rdquo; in the intro?] But with a brand new game engine, high-poly character models, and some truly insane special movies and effects, you might need some beefy hardware in order to get all those beefy combatants looking their best. Fortunately, Capcom has released a free benchmarking tool to help you know if your PC is ready&hellip;or if you might be overdue for some upgrades. </p>



<p>The tool is available <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.streetfighter.com/6/benchmark/en/&amp;xcust=2-1-1935409-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">directly from StreetFighter.com</a>. It&rsquo;s an absolutely massive 15.7-gigabyte download, but then, it&rsquo;s basically running a full version of the game engine. After running, the tool gives you a score from zero to 100. Anything below 30 means you&rsquo;re busted, 31-70 means you need to ramp the settings down, and 70 or above means you&rsquo;re good to go. Capcom recommends tweaking your settings until you can hit 91 or above for the smoothest gameplay. </p>



<p>The benchmark runs through an action-packed bout between Ryu and the new guy Luke, then the overworld mode, then some outdoor cinematics and exploration in <em>Street Fighter</em>&lsquo;s knock-off NYC. At 1440p with the default settings, my PC with its RTX 3070 and dusty Core i5-9600K, my desktop breezed to a 100 score. That&rsquo;s based on a 60FPS target. Based on my results, the game should be pretty accessible for anyone with hardware from the last four to five years, with settings adjustments. </p>

<p>Incidentally, <em>Street Fighter 6</em> is going <em>hard </em>on a PC release, especially for a one-on-one fighter &mdash; traditionally a genre very focused on consoles. Capcom has partnered with Cooler Master for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://news.coolermaster.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1935409-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a series of licensed PC accessories</a>, including a full TD500 Mesh V2 desktop case, plus a themed keyboard, mouse, and headset.

<p>Today at Computex, in addition to the usual swathe of laptop reveals, MSI also announced a new partnership with race car company Mercedes-AMG Motorsport in a celebration of high performance machines. Honestly? When it comes to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1561127/msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-review.html">powerful gaming laptops</a>, MSI has it down to a science, so this partnership isn&rsquo;t all that surprising. </p>



<p>This collaboration is of course responsible for the metaphorical birth of the MSI Stealth 16 Mercedes AMG Motorsport, a special edition laptop with a &ldquo;Start engine&rdquo; power button. Is it ridiculous? Maybe. I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of it. It oozes luxury, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Are you in the market for a brand new gaming laptop? If so, check out PCWorld&rsquo;s roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407493/best-gaming-laptops.html">best gaming laptops</a> available today.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="msi-stealth-16-mercedes-amg">MSI Stealth 16 Mercedes AMG</h2>



<p>The MSI Stealth 16 features the latest 13th-gen Intel Core processors as well as Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 40-series GPUs. That&rsquo;s a powerful hardware combination right there, so this machine will more than likely chew through the most visually demanding games. You&rsquo;ll be able to upgrade it to a 4K OLED panel, too. In addition to the &ldquo;Start engine&rdquo; power button, which I find very funny, the air intake is also in the shape of the AMG logo. The chassis, which is made of magnesium alloy, has a unique Selentine Gray color scheme. </p>



<p>This laptop will come in a special edition package, too. This package includes a mouse and mouse pad, a USB drive, cable ties, postcards (insert shrug emoji here), and so on. Everything in this package will have the usual MSI branding as well as the AMG Motorsport logo. Go, team!</p>



<p>The MSI Stealth 16 Mercedes AMG Motorsport will become available later this year. No official word on pricing yet, though. If I had to guess based on the high-end specs alone, it&rsquo;ll likely cost a pretty penny.</p>



<h2 id="laptops-laptops-laptops">Laptops, laptops, laptops!</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="MSI Alpha 17" class="wp-image-1935301" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Untitled-design-19-21.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">MSI</p></div>



<p>MSI also unveiled a slew of other powerful gaming laptops such as the Alpha 17 (pictured above), the Prestige 16 Studio Evo, and the Commercial 14. </p>



<p>The Alpha 17 is one of the first laptops to include an AMD 7045HZ series processor, which is pretty rad! You&rsquo;re also getting an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of SSD storage. This thing has some serious hardware chops. There will be three configurations. They&rsquo;ll be available in mid-July with a starting price of $1,849.</p>



<p>The MSI Prestige 16 Studio Evo is designed with creative professionals in mind, however. The 16-inch display has a 16:10 aspect ratio, which is ideal for scrolling through documents. The laptop also has a full-size SD card reader and a full HD webcam with Windows Hello facial recognition. It&rsquo;s definitely more business-focused, which is an interesting departure from the usual gaming fare. It will become available in the second half of the year. We don&rsquo;t have pricing info yet.</p>



<p>Last but not least, we&rsquo;ve got the MSI Commercial 14. This one is a business laptop, through and through. It has a <em>ton </em>of connectivity options including three USB Type-A, HDMI, a headphone jack, and an SD card reader. You won&rsquo;t ever need an adaptor. Like the Prestige 16, the Commercial 14 will be available in the second half of the year. We also don&rsquo;t have any official pricing info yet.</p>

## Corsair, Hyteâ€™s next-gen cable systems synchronize and declutter PC builds

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>One of the hardest parts of building a PC is cable management, keeping all the power and data cables from cluttering up the internals and getting in the way of fans or heating components. It&rsquo;s gotten a lot better in the last few years &mdash; modular power supplies and M.2 storage drives, for example &mdash; but getting a clutter-free desktop build is still a ton of work, and it&rsquo;s not always possible. Two new systems from Corsair and Hyte are hoping to dramatically reduce the amount of cables you have to deal with. </p>



<p>Corsair&rsquo;s system is called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/s/icue-link&amp;xcust=2-1-1935290-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iCue Link</a>. The idea is basically creating a &ldquo;daisy chain&rdquo; for power and lighting across all the cooling components in a desktop. So theoretically, a single chain of cables could connect multiple cooling components &mdash; single fans, banks of fans connected to each other LEGO-style, and even all-in-one coolers &mdash; to a control cluster. You wouldn&rsquo;t need to connect each individual fan or AIO pump to the motherboard or power supply, and the hub can handle both cooling and lighting duties via software. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Corsair icue Link system GIF" class="wp-image-1935390" height="303" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/corsair-icue-link.gif" width="552" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>iCue Link uses a microcontroller in each fan, pump, reservoir, radiator, etc. to make the system fully modular, allowing you to add or subtract components as necessary. When finally assembled, more or less all of the cables could run along a PC&rsquo;s case and behind the motherboard to the hub, without the need to cross any other components. </p>



<p>Hyte is working on a similar hub-focused system, but its design is intended to fit into a 2.5-inch HDD drive bay, and work with both its own USB-C-powered components and standardized PWM fans. The NP50 Nexus Portal can connect up to three &ldquo;Powered By Nexus&rdquo; components, plus any more that are daisy chained over the USB-C interface, and a standard 3-pin ARGB output, all controllable via the Nexus desktop software. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Hyte Portal NP50 controller" class="wp-image-1935392" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HYTE_PORTAL-3-3840x2160-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Hyte</p></div>



<p>Corsair&rsquo;s system is definitely pushing for a more proprietary solution, since pretty much every cooling and lighting component in a PC would need to be connected and compatible with iCue Link in order for it all to work cohesively. Hyte is more open, thanks to USB-C connections and compatibility with third-party hardware (at least on paper), but also requires a bit more legwork for both initial installation and management. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Hyte Portal NP50 controller with cables" class="wp-image-1935394" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HYTE-PORTAL-4-3840x2160-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Hyte</p></div>



<p>Corsair iCue Link-enabled fans, AIO loops, GPU blocks, and reservoirs &mdash; everything you need for a super-fancy cooling system &mdash; will go on sale starting in June, along with the System Hub and extra cables. Expect to pay a hefty premium over Corsair&rsquo;s standard equipment. Hyte&rsquo;s NP50 Nexus Portal is set to launch in September for $60, along with compatible USB-C lighting products. </p>

## Nvidiaâ€™s ULMB 2 squashes motion blur on blisteringly fast monitors
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1935227/nvidias-new-motion-blur-tech-beefs-up-esports-displays.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1935227/nvidias-new-motion-blur-tech-beefs-up-esports-displays.html)

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Reducing motion blur is one of those things that improves gaming in a real but subtle way &mdash; you often need a live demonstration to see just how much better it makes things. Take Nvidia&rsquo;s ULMB (ultra low motion blur) system, which has been available for G-Sync displays since 2015. The company just took the wraps off of an advanced ULMB 2 implementation, and it&rsquo;s impressive&hellip;if you&rsquo;ve got a fast enough monitor to make use of it. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-sync-ultra-low-motion-blur-2/&amp;xcust=2-1-1935227-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">ULMB 2</a> works on G-Sync displays of 360Hz or higher, essentially limiting its implementation to high-end esports setups (at least for the moment). The improved system adds full refresh rate backlight strobing and has double the effective brightness, one of the weaknesses of high-refresh displays across the board. To demonstrate the improvement in a way that&rsquo;s visible on any display, Nvidia used super-slow motion to compare the movement of a <em>Fortnite</em> motorcycle with ULMB 2 on and off: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>It&rsquo;s an improvement over existing high-refresh displays, too. Here&rsquo;s a 120Hz panel without the backlight strobing feature compared to a 480Hz panel with the feature enabled: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The new ULMB 2 system relies on a technique Nvidia calls &ldquo;Vertical Dependent Overdrive,&rdquo; which syncs the LCD panel&rsquo;s backlight strobing with the portion of the image where pixels are actively in motion. This makes the vertical scan (the part of G-Sync that ensures the whole screen refreshes at once) timed perfectly to provide the smoothest motion. It&rsquo;s enough to make the effective motion clarity &ldquo;over 1000Hz&rdquo; while maintaining more brightness. </p>



<p>So far there are only two monitors on the market that are compatible with ULMB2, the Predator XB273U F from Acer (which PCWorld <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1478644/acer-predator-xb273u-f-monitor-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reviewed earlier this year</a>!) and the ROG Swift PG27AQN from Asus. (Two more are coming soon, from Asus and AOC, and more should be hitting the market in the latter part of the year.) If you happen to have one of these displays, you can enable ULMB 2 with a new firmware update available today. </p>

## Working Intel â€˜Meteor Lakeâ€™ prototype laptop spotted at Computex

<p>We&rsquo;re still months away at the least from an official reveal for Meteor Lake, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/876620/intel-meteor-lake-ucie-interconnect-chips.html">Intel&rsquo;s radical LEGO-like next-gen CPU architecture</a>. (That&rsquo;s 14th-generation Core, if you&rsquo;re keeping track.) But at Computex 2023, the world&rsquo;s biggest desktop-focused technology conference, the company may have let an unofficial preview sneak out the door. Gordon Ung gets the scoop from WCCFTech&rsquo;s Usman Pirzada, live in our latest YouTube video.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In short, the laptop actually running the Meteor Lake chip was set up for a closed-door demonstration, and definitely not ready for actual testing. (It wasn&rsquo;t even labeled as such at the meeting.) Even so, Pirzada snuck a peek at the Task Manager, and got presenters to confirm that it was the new generation of CPU. If you want the technical gossip, watch the video above. </p>



<p>Oh, and we hear that the Intel processor branding change leaked earlier this year, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1426371/intel-next-gen-meteor-lake-chip-tech-is-ready-now.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dropping the i from Core i3/i5/i7</a>, is a go.

<p>PCIe 5.0 graphics cards are awesomely powerful, but they&rsquo;re running into some teething troubles, specifically with the fancy new power cables required to deliver that power. The new 12+4 rail design, also known as 12VHPWR, has been shown to have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372988/heres-what-we-know-about-the-geforce-rtx-4090-12vhpwr-cables-melting.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">some design flaws that can cause an expensive, burning short</a> if the connection isn&rsquo;t maintained perfectly. MSI might have fixed the problem, and it&rsquo;s showing off the solution at Computex 2023. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>As PCWorld&rsquo;s Gordon Ung explains, it&rsquo;s about as simple a solution as they come: just a bit of colored plastic. On the new power supplies at the show, the 12VHPWR rail connections are colored yellow on the tips. Insert the cable in your power supply and your graphics card until you don&rsquo;t see the yellow any more, and you know you have a solid, safe connection. Easy peasy. If you can still see any of the yellow plastic, it needs to be shoved in a little more. </p>



<p>This is the sort of innovative thinking that can make building a PC a lot easier with a tiny tweak, especially when you&rsquo;re dealing with the cramped shadows of a high-powered PC case. Best of all, it&rsquo;s a solution that other manufacturers and cable makers could copy without any problems.

<p>Nothing revs a storage reviewer&rsquo;s engine more than a large jump in mainstream performance. Hitting that long skinny pedal for me was Crucial&rsquo;s T700 PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSD, which transferred data a full gigabyte-per-second faster than any SSD we&rsquo;ve tested to date. All I can say is, &ldquo;Yowser!&rdquo;</p>



<h2 id="crucial-t700-price-design-and-specs">Crucial T700 price, design, and specs</h2>



<p>The T700 is available in 1TB, 2TB (tested), and 4TB capacities. It&rsquo;s sold bare or with a rather beefy heatsink for $180/$210, $340/$370, $600/$620, respectively. Alas, that&rsquo;s nearly twice as expensive as some very good PCIe 4.0 competition, though you&rsquo;re paying for a genuine leap in performance (see below). Note that those are pre-release prices provided by Crucial, so you might find it cheaper after launch. Look around.</p>

<p>As to the optional heatsink, most users will be fine without it, but if you&rsquo;re going to pound on the drive in a system with lots of other heat-producing components, it couldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>



<p>The T700&rsquo;s 2280 (22mm wide, 80mm long) form factor uses the brand-new Phison PS5026-E26 controller and Micron&rsquo;s own 232-layer, TLC NAND. (Crucial is a Micron brand). There&rsquo;s 1GB of DDR4 primary cache for every 1TB of capacity.</p>



<p>The TBW (terabytes that may be written) rating for the T700 is 600TB per terabyte of capacity. If you weren&rsquo;t aware, TBW is the mitigating factor in SSD warranties, (five years in this case), as miles are to the years in an automobile warranty.</p>



<h2 id="how-does-the-crucial-t700-perform">How does the Crucial T700 perform?</h2>



<p>The T700 destroyed the field, including the recently reviewed, formerly fastest <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681210/gigabyte-aorus-gen5-10000-review.html">Gigabyte Gen5 10,000</a>. We&rsquo;re truly talking an entirely new level of performance, which held fast in the real-world tests to a far greater degree than the Gigabyte SSD. I could go on, but instead&mdash;check out the gold bars in the charts below.  </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1812143" height="524" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Crucial-T700-CDM8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>The T700 dominated the CrystalDiskMark 8 tests and it wasn&rsquo;t particularly close. Longer bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em>Note that the WD SN850X is a PCIe 4.0 drive included for comparison. It&rsquo;s among the fastest 4.0 SSDs we&rsquo;ve tested and was re-tested on our latest test bed. (See the &ldquo;How we test&rdquo; section at the end of this article.</em>)</p>



<p>One thing we observed is that formatting the T700 is a tad slow compared to many NVMe SSDs, regardless of PCIe revision. But who cares when you can shave the better part of a minute off a 48GB file transfer and 40 seconds off a 450GB write, as we found?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>We&rsquo;re truly talking an entirely new level of performance, which held fast in the real-world tests.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Crucial T700 48GB transfers" class="wp-image-1812897" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Crucial-T700-48GB-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The <p>Crucial T700&rsquo;s 48GB transfers showed great improvement in the real world, unlike the </p>Gigabyte. Shorter bars are better.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>



<p>Note that the 450GB write test is currently using a PCIe 4.0 drive to feed the file to the other drives. We&rsquo;ll be addressing this soon now that we have several PCIe 5.0 SSDs in house, but regardless, the T700 once again destroyed the competition by a good 40 seconds.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1812145" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Crucial-T700-450GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><br />The T700 shaved a full 40 seconds off the Gigabyte PCIe 5&rsquo;s 450GB write time. That&rsquo;s bookin&rsquo;. Shorter bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Because of the slightly insane numbers popping up, the test experience with the T700 was just a general hoot. So much so that I also installed a couple of operating systems on it, and they felt snappier. Not a huge difference, but noticeable. </p>



<h2 id="is-the-crucial-t700-worth-it">Is the Crucial T700 worth it?</h2>



<p>The T700 is absolutely the current king of the hill, and it&rsquo;s not even a particularly close contest. If you have the required PCIe 5.0 M.2 slot, it&rsquo;s the NVMe SSD you want&mdash;assuming you have the required monetary wherewithal to pay for the privilege. </p>



<p><em><strong>How we test</strong></em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Internal drive tests currently utilize Windows 11 (22H2) 64-bit running on an X790 (PCIe 5.0) motherboard/i5-12400 CPU combo with two Kingston Fury 32GB DDR5 modules (64GB of memory total). Intel integrated graphics are used. The 48GB transfer tests utilize an ImDisk RAM disk taking up 58GB of the 64GB total memory. The 450GB file is transferred from a Samsung 990 Pro 2TB, which also contains the operating system. </em></p><p><em>Each test is performed on a newly formatted and TRIM&rsquo;d drive so the results are optimal. Note that as any drive fills up, performance will decrease due to less NAND for secondary caching, and other factors.</em></p><p><em>The performance numbers shown apply only to the drive we were shipped as well as the capacity tested. SSD performance can vary by capacity due to more or fewer chips to read/write across and the amount of NAND available for secondary caching (writing TLC/QLC as SLC).</em> <em>Vendors also occasionally swap components. If you ever notice a large discrepancy between the performance you experience and that which we report (systems being roughly equal), by all means&mdash;let us know.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Trying to keep up with all of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1528312/windows-11-features-march-2023-quality-update-bing-ai-iphone.html">latest Windows 11 features</a> can be confusing, especially during the Microsoft Build rush in May when Microsoft releases new features, then announces others. This year was no different, with Microsoft unleashing a torrent of new Windows 11 features ranging from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1927896/microsoft-confirms-tweakable-widgets-will-arrive-in-windows.html">practical</a> to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930286/heres-what-windows-copilot-can-do-according-to-microsoft.html">fantastical</a>. But what&rsquo;s coming, and when? </p>



<p>Microsoft now releases new features in what are colloquially known as &ldquo;Moments.&rdquo; These Moments can occur at any time, which makes it even more confusing. Windows 11&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moment 3&rdquo; was unveiled at Build with a host of exciting new features coming very soon &mdash; but Microsoft also tipped off even more goodies that are due at a future date.  </p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll outline which new Windows features are arriving in the current &ldquo;Moment 3,&rdquo; and which will be sent to your PC later on.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930286/heres-what-windows-copilot-can-do-according-to-microsoft.html">5 ways Windows 11&rsquo;s new Copilot AI assistant will make your life easier</a></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="the-windows-11-moment-3-features">The Windows 11 &ldquo;Moment 3&rdquo; features</h2>



<p>The Moment 3 features, which we&rsquo;ll outline below, are considered optional and will not arrive until June <em>unless</em> you&rsquo;ve previously opted in to receiving new features early. They&rsquo;ll arrive in what&rsquo;s known as the &ldquo;June 2023 optional non-security preview release for Windows 11,&rdquo; probably due on &ldquo;Patch Tuesday,&rdquo; or June 13. They&rsquo;ll arrive without fanfare, but will almost certainly require a reboot after a background installation.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;d like these new features early, you can. Simply go to the Windows 11 Settings menu, then Windows Update. Select &ldquo;Get the latest updates as soon as they&rsquo;re available,&rdquo; and toggle the switch to &ldquo;on.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Microsoft has typically released smaller quality-of-life features as part of the individual Moments, and Moment 3 is no exception. Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1858854/new-windows-test-build-signals-key-changes-are-coming-for-your-pc.html">tested these features</a> publicly earlier this month as part of the Insider Preview 22621.1776 (Release Channel) beta, and now has published them as a final release. </p>



<p><strong>Wider Widgets:</strong>&nbsp;One of the more interesting additions to Windows 11 is a tweak to Widgets, which will allow more room for user-configured apps. Widgets will be wider &mdash; three columns, instead of two &mdash; and Microsoft promises a more personalized feed, too. Microsoft has shown off a new Widgets picker, which will provide a small preview of what the user-picked widget will look like, and guidance to find even more widgets. (The picker, though, may be delayed.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 February 2023 Update Widgets Facebook and more" class="wp-image-1523996" height="753" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Windows-11-Widgets-Facebook-and-more.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Widgets will widen within Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p><strong>Sensor settings:</strong>&nbsp;Some laptops have presence sensors, automatically dimming your screen when you walk away and locking your PC to secure it. A new setting in&nbsp;<em>Settings&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Privacy &amp; security&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Presence sensing</em>&nbsp;will allow you to manage this.</p>



<p><strong>VPN icon:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll see a small &ldquo;shield&rdquo; icon in the Taskbar when you&rsquo;re surfing on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">one of our best VPNs</a>. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 VPN icon" class="wp-image-1930353" height="711" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Windows-11-VPN-icon.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Windows 11 will add a small &ldquo;shield&rdquo; icon if you have a VPN enabled.</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2023/05/23/announcing-new-windows-11-innovation-with-features-for-secure-efficient-it-management-and-intuitive-user-experience/&amp;xcust=2-1-1930335-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft</a></div>



<p><strong>USB4 Hubs and Settings:</strong>&nbsp;Intel-based laptops usually connect to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">Thunderbolt docks</a>. USB4, though, is a nearly identical feature found mainly on AMD Ryzen laptops. Regardless, this new Windows Settings page provides information about the system&rsquo;s USB4 capabilities and the attached peripherals. </p>



<p><strong>Bluetooth expansion:</strong> Windows 11 will now support Bluetooth Low Energy Audio, a low-power audio standard supported by earbuds like the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579635/samsung-galaxy-buds2-review.html">Galaxy Buds2</a> and Buds2 Pro.</p>



<p><strong>Account badging:</strong> You may not like it, but you may see a small exclamation point (&ldquo;!&rdquo;) attached to your account name in the Start menu, alerting you for when your Microsoft account needs attention. This has been associated with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1668041/ads-in-the-windows-11-start-menu-are-definitely-coming.html">helpful reminders, aka ads</a>, for other Windows features. </p>



<p><strong>Live caption language expansion:</strong> Live captions are one of the handier new features of Windows 11, providing subtitles for content that don&rsquo;t always have it. Live Captions will now be provided in 10 additional languages, including Chinese, various English dialects, and French, German, Spanish, and more.</p>



<p>Based upon what Microsoft released in the earlier preview, we believe that you&rsquo;ll see the following smaller changes as part of the Moment 3 release, too:</p>



<ul><li><strong>New Print Screen shortcut:&nbsp;</strong>We documented how the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1784286/microsoft-is-changing-how-print-screen-works-within-windows.html">PrtScn key will now open the Snipping Tool app</a>.</li><li><strong>OneDrive storage indicator:&nbsp;</strong>You&rsquo;ll see the full amount of storage space allocated to all of your OneDrive subscriptions show up in the&nbsp;<em>Accounts</em>&nbsp;page within the Windows 11 Settings app.</li><li><strong>2FA copying:&nbsp;</strong> If you have a phone connected to your PC via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/628261/microsoft-is-updating-your-phone-and-calling-it-phone-link.html">Phone Link</a>, you can now automatically copy any two-factor authentication (2FA) codes you receive from other services.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Touch keyboard options:</strong>&nbsp;The new&nbsp;<em>Settings&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Time &amp; language&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Typing&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Touch keyboard</em>&nbsp;setting allows you to show the touch keyboard always, never, or only when you disconnect the hardware keyboard. This is handy for devices like the Microsoft Surface Pro lineup, which include detachable hardware keyboards.</li><li><strong>Clock seconds:</strong> Dying to see the actual seconds in the System Tray&rsquo;s clock app? Now you can.</li><li><strong>Bing Chat AI shortcut in search:</strong> Just like the Bing Chat shortcut in the search box after it&rsquo;s been clicked, you should now see a small Bing Chat icon in the search box. That should change to your corporation&rsquo;s icon if you&rsquo;re logged in with a corporate account. </li><li><strong>Content Adaptive Brightness Control:</strong> If you own a two-in-one or a laptop, this feature may light or dim regions of the display depending on the content. It&rsquo;s not quite HDR, but close.</li></ul>



<h2 id="new-windows-11-features-beyond-moment-3">New Windows 11 features beyond Moment 3</h2>



<p>Microsoft has also disclosed additional features that will be coming to Windows 11, but at an undisclosed future time. Some we&rsquo;ve seen or expect to see in Windows Insider beta code, while others may be pushed to Windows PCs via the Moments mechanisms.</p>



<p><strong>WinRAR support:</strong> WinRAR, 7-Zip, GZ and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1929635/windows-finally-gets-native-rar-and-7-zip-support.html">other compression formats are being integrated into Windows</a>, thankfully. Microsoft expects that this will be available to test soon, with a full Windows 11 release for decompressing these files in September. The company hopes to let you <em>create</em> rar, zip, and other archives sometime in 2024.</p>



<p><strong>Windows Copilot:</strong> The big new feature of Build, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html">Windows Copilot</a> will bring AI within Windows. Microsoft promises you&rsquo;ll see Windows Copilot in June, but hasn&rsquo;t said how. We&rsquo;d expect this to be a fairly major Windows Insider build.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Windows Copilot 4" class="wp-image-1930301" height="802" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/WIndows-Copilot-4.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Windows Copilot is an AI-powered sidebar for your PC.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p><strong>Taskbar app ungrouping:</strong> Windows 10 allows you to show multiple apps on the Windows taskbar, individually labeled. Windows 11 is gaining that back, too. This feature <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930130/windows-backup-app-debuts-alongside-a-taskbar-update-users-begged-for.html">debuted</a> in a Insider build (Dev Channel) release this week, hopefully meaning that we&rsquo;ll see this before long. </p>



<p><strong>Right-clicking to close a Taskbar app</strong>: A related Taskbar trick will allow you to right-click a Taskbar app and kill the process, as you would from Task Manager. </p>



<p><strong>Windows Backup</strong>: Microsoft is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930130/windows-backup-app-debuts-alongside-a-taskbar-update-users-begged-for.html">testing Windows Backup</a> in an Insider (Dev Channel) build. Windows Backup saves files, folders (and their layout locations on your desktop!), apps and more to the cloud, then reinstates them on a new PC. </p>



<p><strong>RGB lighting controls:</strong> You may not own a bunch of blinged-out PC peripherals with colored lights running up and down like a Christmas tree, but for those who do, we salute you. Microsoft said this week that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930130/windows-backup-app-debuts-alongside-a-taskbar-update-users-begged-for.html">it&rsquo;s adding RGB lighting controls to Windows</a>, providing <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/606964/hey-microsoft-you-know-whatd-make-windows-11-irresistible-universal-control-over-rgb.html">standardized settings for an industry badly in need of them</a>. </p>

## Getting true USB4 speed is still a huge headache

<p>How do you know if a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">fancy USB4 external storage drive</a> is really using the full speed of USB4? If you&rsquo;re just looking at a box on a shelf, the answer is, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p>



<p>As a standard, especially if you&rsquo;re looking for those fast file transfers, USB4 is still a confusing mess of techno-babble that makes it easy for manufacturers to label a substandard drive &ldquo;USB4&rdquo; without delivering the performance that this implies. Gordon breaks it down for you in the latest PCWorld video on YouTube. </p>



<p>To start with, did you know there&rsquo;s a difference between USB4 (no space, a copyrighted term referring to the specification from the USB Implementers Forum) and USB 4.0 (note the space)? Well there is, and it affects which controllers the circuit board inside than fancy drive is packing. To be brief, a drive labeled &ldquo;USB4&rdquo; (like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ziketech.com/products/zikedrive-worlds-first-and-fastest-usb4-ssd-drive?variant=42809341608097&amp;xcust=2-1-1933150-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ZikeDrive Z666 enclosure</a>) can&rsquo;t skimp out on older parts that are merely &ldquo;compatible&rdquo; with USB4, while backing up to older USB or Thunderbolt standards. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>But there&rsquo;s another element that might prevent you from getting maximum speed, and it&rsquo;s one you might have less control over. Little bitty drives aren&rsquo;t the only hardware that cheaps out on USB controllers, and even an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">expensive laptop</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html">motherboard</a> that&rsquo;s a generation or two old might not be able to hit USB4&rsquo;s maximum speed (even if it&rsquo;s certified for USB4). </p>



<p>Granted, we&rsquo;re not talking about the huge differences in speed we had back in the USB 1-to-2 days. The delta between a true, maxed-out USB4 drive and one that falls back on Thunderbolt 3 is about 20-25 percent &mdash; not great, but not the end of the world, either. But if that difference is important to you, check out some in-depth reviews of both the external drive you want and your own laptop, desktop, or motherboard to make sure you can hit maximum speed. (Our roundups of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">best external drives</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html">best gaming motherboards</a> can help you find great products quickly.)</p>
