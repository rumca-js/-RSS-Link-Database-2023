Prior to 2022, these drag shows with men who call themselves "queens" were meant to entertain middle-aged suburban women in bars at Bingo night. I guess one of those women sat on a school board and felt this entertainment was perfect for children. Drag queens became the measuring stick to determine if you are woke or just another solve for X-phobe.</p><p>One mother believes that these shows meant to entertain middle-aged suburban women in bars at Bingo night are NOT acceptable for children. Let alone, a captive audience of children in government run public school. To make her point, she showed up at a school board meeting dressed as one of these male performers. Welcome to Ankeny, Iowa. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">A high school in Ankeny, Iowa held an after-school drag performance for students.<br /><br />In response, a mother in the district named Kimberly Reicks showed up to a school board meeting dressed in the outfit that the drag performer wore in front of students. <a href="https://t.co/VK4OaM7jQl">pic.twitter.com/VK4OaM7jQl</a><br />— 1776 Project Pac (@1776ProjectPac) <a href="https://twitter.com/1776ProjectPac/status/1577447089860116480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Unlike when parents will attempt to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-chicago-summer-reading" target="_blank">read the pornography available in school libraries</a> that school board members believe is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/parent-silenced-for-reading-pornography" target="_blank">appropriate for children to hear</a> but <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-filthy-book" target="_blank">not adult school board members</a>, this mother was allowed to speak.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p><blockquote>Does this outfit make you turn your head? Does this outfit seem appropriate for anybody here to see? This is what the man dressed like in front of our kids. So if this makes your head spin — if this pisses you off in any way, shape, or form — it should. Because I’m embarrassed to stand here in the outfit that I am in today, but I have a point to prove — that this outfit should not be ever accepted in our schools anywhere.</blockquote><p>The mother, Kimberly Reicks, was drawing attention to a specific school performance first reported on by independent journalist Libs of TikTok. In one photo, it appears a student is handing a dancer money. Not unlike how adults will do to women who dress like women and take their clothes off, commonly referred to as "strippers."</p><p>As of this writing, I have yet to hear of any public school hiring strippers to entertain while educating children. But there are approximately 13,800 school boards throughout America, and I'm only one man.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I have obtained more footage of the drag show for students which took place at <a href="https://twitter.com/Ankeny_Hawks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Ankeny_Hawks</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/AnkenySchools?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AnkenySchools</a>. <a href="https://t.co/igVjy6zNxM">pic.twitter.com/igVjy6zNxM</a><br />— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1529209238353899520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Reicks tells <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/mom-blasts-school-board-over-drag-show-for-high-schoolers-while-wearing-the-same-outfit-the-drag-queen-wore" target="_blank">The Daily Wire</a> that the Ankeny Community School District is “notorious” for dismissing parental concerns.

## Two USA Today reporters gang up on lone ESPN host speaking out in defense of girls' sports: "Plain old bigotry"

SPOILER: Armour opposes saving women's sports and is on the wrong side of history and supports boys dominating in girls' sports if those boys claim to be girls. The one is Nancy's colleague chirped up with the dumbest analogy you'll hear. It's become a whole thing.</p><p>Last month Ponder, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11992599/ESPN-war-Networks-Samantha-Ponder-breaks-ranks-joins-Riley-Gaines-denouncing-Lia-Thomas.html" target="_blank">in defiance of her woke employers at ESPN</a>, tweeted against Joe Biden's changes to Title IX that would expand protections to boys who identify as girls instead of just girls. "This would take away so many opportunities for biological women and girls in sports. It is a shame that we are needing to fight for the integrity of Title IX in 2023 and the reason it was needed in the first place."</p><p>I had assumed<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/feeds/%22This%20would%20take%20away%20so%20many%20opportunities%20for%20biological%20women%20and%20girls%20in%20sports.%20It%20is%20a%20shame%20that%20we%20are%20needing%20to%20fight%20for%20the%20integrity%20of%20Title%20IX%20in%202023%20and%20the%20reason%20it%20was%20needed%20in%20the%20first%20place.%22" target="_blank"> Ponder would be forced into an apology by ESPN</a>. Instead, she doubled down, surprised by all the parents and female athletes who have thanked her for speaking out. After all, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out" target="_blank">they get told they'll have their lives destroyed if they do</a>. She again retweeted Riley Gaines, herself an advocate for both women's sports and NOT forcing girls to be exposed to penises in the girls' locker room. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-congressional-hearing" target="_blank">That shouldn't need to be said, yet here we are</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I barely said anything publicly abt this issue & I’ve had so many ppl msg me, stop me in the street to say thank you+ tell me stories abt girls who are afraid to speak up for fear of lost employment/being called hateful. It is not hateful to demand fairness in sports for girls <a href="https://t.co/teNoMDWNW4">https://t.co/teNoMDWNW4</a><br />— Samantha Steele Ponder (@samponder) <a href="https://twitter.com/samponder/status/1661771033320337417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The last tweet set Nancy Armour off. She refused to calm down, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2023/05/28/espn-sam-ponder-calls-bigotry-fairness-in-tweets-about-trans-women-sports/70262521007/" target="_blank">accusing Ponder of "plain old bigotry."</a> Armour is of the leftist belief this isn't about protecting girls' sports and providing especially girls in junior high and high school the opportunities to learn, grow, and develop they get in scholastic athletics. Not unlike the opportunities <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-biden-title-ix" target="_blank">Lia Thomas received when she was still competing as WIll Thomas</a>.</p><p>Nope. It's all about nothing other than hate, fear, and ignorance.</p><blockquote>Don’t be fooled by the people who screech about ‘fairness’ to cloak their bigotry toward transgender girls and women, the transgender girls and women who have the audacity to want to play sports, in particular.</blockquote><p>Then Lindsay Schnell, another USA Today reporter, chimed in with this bucket of derp.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Every time I hear someone say trans women competing in sports isn’t “fair” I think of these wise words from <a href="https://twitter.com/Layshiac?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Layshiac</a>: “Is LeBron ‘fair’? It’s sports! Nothing is fair.” <br /><br />(Which is to say — this is a really dumb argument.) <a href="https://t.co/koM57a546M">https://t.co/koM57a546M</a><br />— Lindsay Schnell (@Lindsay_Schnell) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lindsay_Schnell/status/1662871967907868672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>That's like asking if it's fair to LeBron James that he'll never be as good as Michael Jordan. Sports IS fair. Some people are better at it than others, sure. But as long as there are set rules for people to start off on, you have the same ability to excel based on your ability and how much work you put in.</p><p>Girls who went through puberty as boys -- because they are boys -- have an unfair advantage with bone density, testosterone, and a number of other biological factors. It's why a lot of these trans superstars her mediocre athletes when they competed as dudes. It's also why you don't hear about women who transitioned to men dominating in women's sports.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Pop-punk icon freaks out on Ron DeSantis, tells fans if you vote for him "you're f*cking dead" to her

Assuming 99.86% of the bands I listen to vote for different people than me is my default position. It's not surprising that Paramore leader <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paramore-hayley-williams-ron-desantis_n_647511fee4b0b4444c7a84bc" target="_blank">Hayley Williams doesn't like Ron DeSantis</a>. I was more surprised the band was touring, let alone still together. But it appears Williams thinks DeSantis is in the business of misery.</p><p>The band was playing a festival in <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paramore-hayley-williams-ron-desantis_n_647511fee4b0b4444c7a84bc" target="_blank">New Jersey</a> where the singer let her fans know if they vote for Ron DeSantis, they are, quote, "f*cking dead" to her. Not just dead, but f*cking dead. Her dissent was captured by a fan who I'm guessing will be making her account private as this video continues to blow up.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Bad news, Ron DeSantis fans.<br /><br />You're dead to Hayley Williams of Paramore. D-E-A-D! <a href="https://t.co/lESJ62mvP5">pic.twitter.com/lESJ62mvP5</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1663562062323220480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Williams was apparently in her feelings when she saw someone on the internet say she’s "too afraid to speak about politics on tour." This is her claiming "Nuh-uh." And it's not about being too afraid to discuss politics. But when fans are paying hundreds of dollars thanks to Ticketmaster premium seating, fans would prefer hearing the hits instead.</p><p>As I said, I assume the artists I listen to vote for different people. It only becomes an issue if a) they are douchebags about it, and/or b) they sound like they hate half the country that disagrees with them. My eyes are rolling too hard to render a verdict here.</p><p>Here's what I'm going to go out on a limb and say is Hayley Williams speaking out about politics. She thinks Ron DeSantis passed a law that makes it <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-rogan-dont-say-gay" target="_blank">illegal to say the word "gay" in Florida</a>. And that when elected president, he will ban America from saying the word "gay."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="6116e" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33769764&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>She'll also claim that Ron DeSantis is banning books. Because claiming <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-book-banning" target="_blank">glorified pornography is not suitable for school children is considered "banning" to some people</a>. Even though kids' parents can still purchase the books for their children if they feel exposing them to pornography is important.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="96f89" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33769780&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Williams may even be upset that, due to DeSantis passing laws to protect children, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12138121/Florida-furry-festival-supporters-say-DeSantis-sucked-pleasure-lifes-little-joys.html" target="_blank">they are no longer welcome at a Furry convention</a>. One can only guess at this point.</p><p>I'll have to go the rest of my life knowing that life no longer exists to Williams. That's ok. I'll be the bigger person and still acknowledge the banger after banger the band put out from 2005 to 2013.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

And right away, Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) want to you to blame <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-law-order" target="_blank">Ron DeSantis</a> for it.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gavin-newsom-florida-ad" target="_blank">Gavin Newsom</a> was <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1663369795943944192?s=20" target="_blank">the first to claim</a>: “DeSantis signed a permit-less carry bill in April that removes requirements for: background checks, instruction, training [and] oversight. Until our leaders have the courage to stop bowing down to the NRA and enact common sense gun safety this kind of senseless violence will continue."</p><p>Small problem. That law doesn’t go into effect until July 1. Meaning everyone illegally carrying before July 1st, are the same criminals they always have been. </p><p>Democrats and the media (again, repeating myself) are also eerily quiet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqymIrje-RI" target="_blank">about the Chicago shootings this weekend</a> that included at least FIFTY victims from age 2 to 77.</p><p>Crowder and the gang discuss why they think that is on today's show.</p><p><br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

## Watch: Fifty teens caught on video assaulting two Marines, all over some fireworks

	A group of reportedly FIFTY teenagers jumping two Marines is not the way to acknowledge <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/seal-meaning-memorial-day" target="_blank">Memorial Day</a>. At least not for you or me or anyone else who isn't a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/baseball-bat-man-street" target="_blank">sucker-punching little biyatch</a>. But it's what happened in -- surprise, surprise, surprise -- California this past weekend. All over some fireworks. And the fact the teens were setting off the fireworks in a crowd.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">2 Marines jumped by 50 "high schoolers" in San Clemente in California.<br />Article <a href="https://t.co/1dnyUJNVDx">https://t.co/1dnyUJNVDx</a> <a href="https://t.co/BsXfgxzHBA">pic.twitter.com/BsXfgxzHBA</a><br />— MRS WILKES PATTERN RECOGNITION LAB (@ItsMrsWilkes) <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsMrsWilkes/status/1663273412926554150?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Hunter Antonino, one of the Marines attacked, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1bkYKQFUM0" target="_blank">tells KCLA-TV</a> that the horde of teens was shooting fireworks on the beach and harassing other people. The two Marines asked them to stop. One of the Marine's was hit in the head with debris, and the other was hit from behind by one of the thugs. Then the beatdown started.</p><p>The Marines were overwhelmed and could only "turtle up" to protect their heads until two other bystanders ran in to break it up.</p><p><a href="https://www.sanclementetimes.com/police-investigating-assault-on-2-marines-in-pier-bowl-brawl/" target="_blank">The San Clemente Times reports</a> the two Marines only suffered minor injuries, and estimates between 10-30 teens were involved in the beatdown. Others, like one of the video embeds, estimate fifty.</p><p>No arrests have been made as of yet. The Orange County Sheriff's Department "will continue investigating this matter until all individuals responsible are identified and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."</p><p>Upon the capture of any of the assailants, I would not press charges. I would however force them to face one of the Marines and see how they do in a one-on-one situation, without 49 of their friends jumping in. It's a proportional response.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: MSNBC guest proclaims #BoycottTarget is "literal" economic terrorism

That is according to Economics Prof. Justin Wolfers on MSNBC. He literally used the word "literally."</p><p>To be clear, it is not literally economic terrorism for the left to boycott Hobby Lobby or the Salvation Army. Or boycott Major League Baseball unless <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/georgia-brian-kemp-biden-abrams" target="_blank">they move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta</a>. Or threaten companies <a href="https://twitter.com/philthatremains/status/1663516941879857153/photo/1" target="_blank">if they hire employees from a company they  don't like</a>. It is only literally economic terrorism is suburban mothers spend their money elsewhere.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">MSNBC pundit says boycotting Target is "economic terrorism." <br /><br />Call it whatever you like, we're done. <a href="https://t.co/HAdaCaTBlt">pic.twitter.com/HAdaCaTBlt</a><br />— Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) <a href="https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1663361943611248640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>If that's the case, when Target caves into this, then it says that the moment you threaten the employees of a large corporation you get to control its policies. This is economic terrorism. Literally terrorism. Creating fear among the workers and forcing the corporations to sell the things you want, not sell the things you don't, so I think it's very worrying.</blockquote><p>So, Poindexter claims the Target changes (moving clothes to a different part of the store) were in response to "employees being threatened." I don't know how many employees are actually being "threatened" versus corporate media cherry-picking one or two instances to distract their audience from what the issue really is. If anyone is legit threatening part-time employees who weren't even supposed to be here today, stop doing that. And if the gayest thing about your video "exposing Target" is you, you might want to finesse your message.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Target doesn't give a rat's patootie that their employees are being "threatened." After <a href="https://www.outkick.com/bud-light-sales-rebate-price-dylan-mulvaney/" target="_blank">seeing what happened to Bud Light</a>, they care that Americans are choosing a different corporation to spend their money at. What's genuine "very worrying" to leftists is that conservatives and apolitical voters are learning to vote with their dollars. That makes it difficult for the left to use corporations to impose their radical political agenda on people.</p><p>We're already seeing it. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/coca-cola-shareholders-vote" target="_blank">Coca-Cola rejected an ESG shareholder push</a> for the company to lash out at states that placed limits on abortion. They even wanted the company to pledge to pull out of those states unless the laws are changed. Coca-Cola, a company that was all about pandering to woke activists prior to Bud Light, overwhelmingly voted against it. That is not a coincidence.</p><p>Leftists bullying corporations into submission only works if they're the only side being loud. Now that the other side is telling brands they'll take their business elsewhere, corporations have a choice to make. Pander to the radical left, many of who don't shop at or support your company, or even like your customers. Or continue to make money by selling things and leaving the politics to MSNBC.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Lululemon fires two employees for calling the police on shoplifters and we think we know why

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33768748&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>News broke over the weekend that new Lululemon employees were fired for calling the police on shoplifters. AKA, people who stole from their Atlanta based store. Now, you may be asking to yourself, "Self...aren't you SUPPOSED to call the police when someone steals?" You would think so, and in the olden days -- a bygone era of 2019 -- that's what we did.</p><p>But apparently it goes against company policy.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">JUST IN: Lululemon employees confirm they were FIRED FOR CALLING THE POLICE on thieves ransacking store.<br /><br /> <a href="https://t.co/2uRyS6mCYm">pic.twitter.com/2uRyS6mCYm</a><br />— Mike Sperrazza (@MikeASperrazza) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeASperrazza/status/1662214477117370369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>“Chill, b*tch. Shut your ass up." - one of the bad guys.</p><p>The women watched the men leave, then called the Fayette County Police. Three men (only two are seen in the video) were charged with theft by shoplifting and theft by receiving stolen property. It sounds like the system worked. But the two employees were fired for violating the corporation's "zero tolerance" policy. Lululemon has zero tolerance for employees doing anything to stop shoplifting.</p><p>What are they supposed to do?</p><blockquote>After it’s over, you scan a QR code. And that’s that. We’ve been told not to put it in any notes, because that might scare other people. We’re not supposed to call the police, not really supposed to talk about it.</blockquote><p>Odd that a company would have a policy NOT to call the police when a crime happens. Then you <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/feeds/Environmental,%20social%20and%20governance" target="_blank">see that Lululemon's two biggest shareholders</a> are ESG (Environmental, social, and governance) pushers Vanguard and Blackrock. ESG is the "f<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/environmental-social-and-governance-ESG" target="_blank">ramework used to assess an organization's business practices and performance on various sustainability and ethical issues.</a>" One of those ethical issues is whether it is equity or not to arrest criminals for committing crime.</p><p>And in 2020, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8720815/Lululemon-fire-holding-class-resisting-capitalism-selling-yoga-pants-128.html" target="_blank">at the height of woke virtue signaling</a>, the company hosted a conference on how to "resist capitalism" and "decolonize gender." I'm not entirely sure how to "decolonize" "gender." What I do know is that these are the faces of the girls who got fired:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="d6077" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33768812&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>And this is the face of one of the shoplifters.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="337c3" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33768813&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>This is why while videos of bystanders getting fed up at shoplifters and taking matters into their own hands a fun content, it's inadvisable. If you are standing up for a small business struggling to make it, that's one thing. Not for corporate retail chains where the executives in charge have made it clear they don't care about you and will throw YOU under the bus no questions asked.</p><p>It goes criminal, progressive policies, shareholders, the homeless guy outside the store, whatever the issue du jour is that has nothing to do with the business, then at the bottom of the list... you, trying to do what's right.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
