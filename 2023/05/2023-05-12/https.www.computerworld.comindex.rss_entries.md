<p class="Body">Tech philosophers have been waxing verbose lately about the culture-shifting power of generative artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p class="Body">“Artificial intelligence is transforming the world,” said the Brookings Institute. “Generative AI changes everything,” the <i>Harvard Business Review</i> proclaimed.</p><p class="Body">And that’s true. But the biggest tech-driven culture change at the moment — far bigger than AI — is the move to remote work.</p><p class="Body">Here are the five biggest ways remote work is changing American culture.</p><h3 class="body">1. How cities work</h3>
<p class="Body">Experts have differing views about whether the remote work revolution <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/12/remote-work-is-poised-to-devastate-americas-cities.html" rel="nofollow">will destroy</a> or strengthen cities <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-work-from-home-cities-office-apocalypse-urban-doom-loop-2023-3" rel="nofollow">and urban living</a>. But surveys and studies do agree that remote work has <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/05/remote-work-suburbs-millennials-want-to-move-out-of-cities/" rel="nofollow">made America more suburban and exurban</a> (areas beyond suburbs) in the sense that, during the day, more people are <a href="https://eig.org/2022-county-population-trends/" rel="nofollow">staying at home</a> instead of commuting to cities.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3695742/how-remote-work-is-changing-american-culture.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p><em>Disclosure: IBM is a client of the author.</em></p><p>IBM this week announced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">watsonx</a> at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/events/think/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Think</a>, and it has the potential to be a generative AI standout. That’s important because generative AI has hit the tech industry like a Mack truck and appears to be advancing at an unbelievable rate. Just as quickly, well-founded concerns about the quality of the massive training set behind it have emerged. First, the technology is very new to most people and the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3692355/should-we-fear-the-rise-of-artificial-general-intelligence.html">risks surrounding it aren’t well known</a>. And second, we still don’t know how to ensure that what’s produced by generative AI tools is accurate.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3696275/ibms-watsonx-could-be-a-generative-ai-game-changer.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
