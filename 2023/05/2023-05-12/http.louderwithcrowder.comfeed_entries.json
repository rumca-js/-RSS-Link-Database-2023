So that now when individuals are apprehanded, they're given a court date sometime in the future. They're released. And everyone knows only a very small percentage will show up for that court date.</em><br /><br /><em>And third, probably most inexplicable, Joe Biden ended the \"Remain in Mexico\" international agreement. President Trump had negotiated with Mexico an agreement that individuals from Central America who are crossing illegally through Mexico would remain in Mexico while their asylum cases were proceeding in the United States.</em></blockquote><p>Ted Cruz and other Republicans have been clear on how to fix the border.

It paints a picture of someone who is the opposite of what Elon claims Twitter is supposed to be, but that doesn't necessarily mean she can't do her job under Elon's leadership. The WEF stuff is where this is a non-starter for me.</p><p>And you would think it would be a non-starter for Musk. In the past six months alone he's commented how <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/klaus-schwab-education\" target=\"_blank\">batsh*t crazy their global agenda is</a> and that, quote, \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-unelected-government\" target=\"_blank\">WEF is increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don\u2019t want.</a>\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jacinda-ardern-free-speech-un\" target=\"_blank\">WEF members</a> also <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wef-five-moments\" target=\"_blank\">don't hide</a> their <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brian-stelter-wef\" target=\"_blank\">disdain for free speech</a>. Something Elon claims is the most important thing in the world, and what Twitter is supposed to be -- <em>SUPPOSED to be</em> -- about.</p><p>As of this writing, Linda Yaccarino has NOT been announced as the new CEO yet. It's only being reported. But say she is. I want you to ponder something with me. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\">Tucker Carlson announced this week</a> he is bringing a version of his show to Twitter, a platform he calls the \"l<em>ast big [free speech platform] remaining in the world.\"</em></p><p>What are the odds a former executive for NBCUniversal and a CURRENT executive of the WEF allows that to happen? There is more of a chance new Twitter goes back to being old Twitter.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
