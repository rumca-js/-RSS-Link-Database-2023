[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Korg Berlin shows off a prototype 'acoustic synthesizer'", "description": "<p>The idea of an acoustic synthesizer might sound like an oxymoron, but it's exactly the sort of unexpected concepts that <a href=\"https://korg.berlin/\">Korg Berlin</a> was created to pursue. This independent, R&amp;D-focused division was cofounded in 2020 by Maximilian Rest and Tatsuya Takahashi, the man behind the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-17-korg-volca-modular-west-coast-synth-review-weird-affordable.html\">Volcas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-15-korg-minilogue-xd-review.html\">Minilogue</a> and countless other modern classics. But it has remained pretty quiet since its inception. That changed this week at Superbooth where the team showed off its first prototype the Acoustic Synthesis_phase5.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike a traditional synth that uses oscillators, the phase5 uses tuned metal forks. Those forks are specially designed to produce specific fundamental notes and overtones. And since the core sound generation here is an acoustic resonator, it has certain qualities a normal synth does not. For instance it will feedback like a guitar when held near an amp and ring when struck on its side. Takahashi told Fess Grandiose of Reverb, &quot;we're trying to kind of capture this rawness of instruments, while being at the same time, controllable like a synthesizer.&quot;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"2912a2b2889c42248ce718e7d21f211d\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>So that's the &quot;acoustic&quot; part: metal tines that ring, resonate and decay, almost like a Fender <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rhodes-electric-piano-mk8-000833332.html\">Rhodes</a>. The synth part comes from the magnets inside the phase5 that allow it to sustain just the fundamental note, or the fundamental and the overtones, or just the overtones. The overtones can also be modulated with an LFO creating a sound that can only be described as a sea sick bell.&nbsp;</p><p>In general the sound it generates in the short demo video above is quite unique. It does have a ringing, vaguely Rhodes-like quality to it. But it also kind of sounds like what you might expect of a singing bowl patch on a '90s sample-based synth. It's a touch otherworldly.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now the phase5 is just a prototype and it's likely to stay that way. Right now Korg Berlin is simply gauging interest in the technology. And if it seems like there's a market for this sort of strange hybrid acoustic synth, then it will explore ways to develop it further into a finished product.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"89e5a6236cac4f49944a9909926ccc25\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"border: 0; margin: 1px; padding: 0; width: 99.375%;\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsGGf5Uv8ky/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"><div style=\"display: flex;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div><div style=\"display: flex;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div><div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"><div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div><div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div><div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"><div style=\"width: 0px; border-right: 8px solid transparent;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12px; width: 16px;\"></div><div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 8px solid transparent;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsGGf5Uv8ky/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by KORG Germany GmbH (@korg_berlin)</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/korg-berlin-shows-off-a-prototype-acoustic-synthesizer-223023911.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/korg-berlin-shows-off-a-prototype-acoustic-synthesizer-223023911.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-12 22:30:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Former ByteDance exec claims company used bots to inflate TikTok engagement", "description": "<p>TikTok is still fighting to remain operational in the United States, but a new lawsuit could complicate things even further for the company.

At $550, the PS5 accessory is more expensive than the actual PS5. Sony has not disclosed any sales numbers for the headset but it did <a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sony-slashes-playstation-vr2-headset-output-after-pre-orders-disappoint-1.1877035\">halve sales expectation numbers</a> ahead of the February launch due to fewer-than-anticipated preorders.

China's market regulator has <a href=\"https://www-samr-gov-cn.translate.goog/zw/zh/202305/t20230512_355181.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=EN&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB\">ordered</a> a recall of over 1.1 million Tesla cars, or nearly all the vehicles it has sold in the country, over a reported flaw in the regenerative braking system. As drivers can't set the intensity of regenerative braking or receive alerts with a sustained press of the accelerator, officials believe there's a risk owners might misuse the pedals (as they can't hear a revving engine) and crash.</p><p>The EV maker will fix the issue through a software update that both tweaks the default regenerative braking level and lets users customize the system's strength. Tesla will also notify drivers who press the accelerator for a long time. The recall covers Model 3 and Model Y cars made in China between January 2019 and April this year, as well as some imported Model 3, Model S and Model X examples.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Tesla has disbanded its PR team and hasn't commented on the recall. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-12/tesla-recalls-1-1-million-cars-in-china-over-braking-defect?sref=10lNAhZ9#xj4y7vzkg\">points</a> out that Chinese drivers have complained multiple times about acceleration and braking issues. One driver used the 2021 Shanghai auto show to highlight a serious crash where her father nearly died after the brakes failed. Tesla apologized, but didn't acknowledge a glitch and noted the high speed before the collision.</p><p>As with most Tesla recalls, the software update won't significantly disrupt the company's business in the short term. However, it's not a good look for a brand that has had numerous recalls in recent years, including <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tesla-recall-china-model-s-x-3-153644099.html\">80,000 in China last fall</a> for software and seat belt problems.

On Friday, NBCU <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/nbcuniversal-mark-marshall-linda-yaccarino-twitter-1235611021/\">confirmed</a> that Yaccarino was leaving the company.

In the months after Musk assumed control of Twitter, reports suggested that many of the company's top advertisers had temporarily <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-advertisers-media-finances-185425994.html\">stopped spending ad dollars</a> on the platform. Some were said to have expressed concern about their ads appearing next to hate speech and misinformation under Musk's looser approach to content moderation.</p><p>Musk bought Twitter in October and his tenure has been chaotic, to say the least. From swiftly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html\">firing the former leadership team</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/80-percent-of-twitters-full-time-staff-has-evaporated-under-musk-234247201.html\">laying off thousands of workers</a> to moving forward with a plan to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-going-to-purge-and-archive-inactive-accounts-101557246.html\">purge inactive accounts</a> (including those of the deceased), it seems like barely a day has gone by over the last seven months without <em>something </em>happening around Elon Musk and Twitter.</p><p>Back in December, Musk posted a poll on Twitter, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-asks-twitter-users-to-decide-000451423.html\">asking users</a> if he should remain as CEO or bring someone else in. More than 17.5 million votes later, the majority (57.5 percent) <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hell-step-down-as-twitter-ceo-but-wont-sell-the-company-025701394.html\">voted in favor of Musk stepping down</a>. Musk promised to do just that and focus on the technical side of Twitter's operations as soon as he could find someone to take over. Five months later, it seems he has stuck by his word.</p><p>Shortly after Musk said he is stepping away from Twitter's top job, Tesla's share price jumped up.

After his wife goes to bed, the kids are asleep and there are no emails hitting his inbox, he has time to get creative. One of these evening brainstorming sessions was with Robert Crandell, a regional sales manager for Tonnellerie Radoux and Pronektar. Radoux is a French cooperage that has been making barrels for decades. The company has been operating in the US since 1994, based in wine country California. What\u2019s more, Radoux has conducted extensive research into the chemical composition and tannins of French oak.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Since 2008, Radoux has completed over 300 trials containing over 10 million analyses to observe polyphenols in the wood that can impact the appearance, taste and smell of wine. The result is a tool that can instantly measure these properties with Near Infrared Spectrometry, rather than using the time-consuming process of taking random samples from various batches of staves. The technology is called OakScan.</p><figure><img alt=\"OakScan\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/47e64a70-f0cd-11ed-a7b7-19b1d340e0c2\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Tonnellerie Radoux</div></figure><p>\u201cFrench oak can be wildly inconsistent,\u201d Crandell noted.</p><p>All of the variation in French oak can lead to unintended results without careful planning. Combine that in with the fact that the wood is more expensive than American oak and companies using it to age wines and spirits can greatly benefit from knowing how their liquid is going to react to the wood. It\u2019s long been known that trees from different forests that are made into barrels will have different chemical compositions (the concept of terroir), and thus different levels of tannins. There can also be significant variation in trees just a few feet apart or from staves made from different parts of the same tree. What\u2019s more, there can be distinctions in the grain width, which affects the extraction time for getting the tannins out of the wood.</p><p>\u201cEven if you\u2019ve gone to great lengths and you bought wood from the same forest, you still aren\u2019t getting the same sort of precision and consistency [as with OakScan],\u201d Crandell said. When Radoux uses OakScan to analyze staves bound for production, each piece of wood is assigned a barcode and a letter corresponding to its \u201ctannic potential,\u201d according to the cooperage. This not only helps with sorting, but it allows the company to build barrels with a specific polyphenolic index (PI), ensuring the wood is suitable for the style a winery or vineyard is trying to make. And since every stave is scanned, there\u2019s uniformity of the tannin content of each barrel and all the data makes the end result repeatable.</p><p>OakScan also allows customers to select wood from different forests, but not by sourcing actual staves from those places. Instead, Radoux can build the tannin profile and replicate the terroir in a much more consistent way.</p><p>\u201cIf someone wanted a Voges-style barrel, we could work that out based on tannin level,\u201d said Radoux national sales manager Craig Holme. \u201cWe can be more precise on what [the results are] going to be. Someone else will get a barrel that may be from two different trees [in that forest], and they might be completely different.\u201d According to Holme, Radoux can pull 100,000% extracts from the staves that they can then put in a sample of a prospective customer\u2019s product to show them what it\u2019s going to do.</p><p>Originally developed exclusively for wine making, OakScan was initially used to analyze the chemical characteristics of barrel staves. Once the system was developed and fine-tuned, Radoux began using the same technology for tank staves. Thinner than a barrel stave, these pieces of wood allow for a quicker extraction process, which at the time was intended for larger volumes of wine. Where barrels are only toasted on the inside, tank staves are finished on all six surfaces and they\u2019re designed to be completely submerged.</p><p>\u201cTypically, the toasting process for wine is much more precise than the charring process for spirits,\u201d Crandell explained. \u201cSo we came up with something very precise and very repeatable.\u201d However, OakScan hadn\u2019t really been used extensively in the spirits industry, he continued, except for a \u201csmall, experimental project\u201d he had done a few years ago. Eventually, Crandell said he started working with Penelope and another micro-distiller to see if the detailed analysis of French oak could work for spirits.</p><figure><img alt=\"Penelope Architect\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/6968c830-f0cd-11ed-977d-ccc24419cb04\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Penelope Bourbon</div></figure><p>Penelope isn\u2019t your traditional bourbon maker. The company doesn\u2019t actually distill anything. Instead, it sources aged bourbon from MGP: a producer of distilled spirits with operations in \u200b\u200bKansas, Missouri, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio, in addition to Mexico and Northern Ireland. MGP has its own brands of spirits (it actually <a href=\"https://www.mgpingredients.com/more-information/news-press/news-releases/mgp-ingredients-acquire-penelope-bourbon.html-0\"><ins>announced the acquisition of Penelope</ins></a> earlier this week), but it also sells bourbon, rye whiskey, gin and more to other companies to package and sell on their own. Penelope buys bourbon of various ages and mashbills from MGP and blends it to their specifications. Sometimes they\u2019ll bottle those blends as-in (Four Grain Bourbon and Barrel Strength Bourbon), while others undergo additional aging before they\u2019re packaged.</p><p>While Radoux primarily caters to vineyards in France, Italy, Spain, the US and more, its colleagues at Speyside Cooperage (both owned by TFF Group) typically work with breweries and distilleries. Paladini and Penelope COO and founder Daniel Polise initially worked with Crandell to secure Ros\u00e9 casks for secondary aging of its bourbon. They then collaborated with Speyside Cooperage to source toasted American oak barrels for a secondary finishing of its bourbon. For that treatment, Penelope would create a blend of aged bourbon and put it in barrels with varying char and toast levels for a period of time. In the end, Paladini and Polise discovered that even with the same bourbon in the same barrels, samples from each would be very different.</p><p>\u201cIt would go in completely different, wild directions,\u201d Paladini observed. \u201cWe found that to be great, and that\u2019s why that product was incredible.\u201d Indeed, Penelope Toasted Series Bourbon won gold at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition in 2022. The company leaned into the variation in the aging results, indicating the char and toast levels on the bottles of each batch. Of course, that means each batch is quite different.</p><p>Following the challenges of the Toasted Series, Polise tried using some of the OakScan staves in some samples. \u201cWe have so many different products that show up and people want us to try and use them,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI finally tried it and I was just shocked.\u201d Polise explained that the OakScan French oak \u201cstood out from the others greatly.\u201d</p><p>Thus the idea for Penelope\u2019s Architect Bourbon was hatched. The company was hoping to tap into the success of Toasted Series by once again being transparent about the types of wood they were using for secondary aging. But while OakScan can create the ultimate consistency batch to batch, Paladini says he and Polise weren\u2019t sure they really wanted that.</p><figure><img alt=\"Penelope OakScan\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/83539bd0-f0cd-11ed-bff9-b6dcd186af6d\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>\u201cOur first thought was to take an exploratory approach and highlight the actual flavor profile on the back of the label. That profile is coming directly from the oak engineer in France when they run the OakScan process,\u201d said Paladini. On each bottle of Architect, there\u2019s a spider graph that illustrates the characteristics of that particular \u201cbuild.\u201d The company is playing up the idea of constructing a flavor profile, so it calls each batch a \u201cbuild\u201d instead. Hence the name Architect.</p><p>With Architect, Penelope has created six different \u201cbuilds\u201d or stave selections and they\u2019re all different. However, they\u2019re still consistent, as Crandell explained. \u201cWe can make a build again, it\u2019s repeatable,\u201d he noted. And that\u2019s because OakScan allows for that consistency rather than the company hoping they can recreate a hit. They will, of course, need to replicate the blended bourbon from MGP that undergoes the secondary aging in order to do so. Even if they can\u2019t, the company can still give a new blend the same \u201cbuild\u201d as a previous version of Architect. Since the wood analysis gives them so much control over the end result, the combinations \u2013 and the creative potential \u2013 are seemingly endless.</p><p>\u201c[OakScan] not only gives you the ability to be precise, but it also gives you the ability to be creative,\u201d Crandell said. \u201cIf you know what the end result is going to be, you can change the end result \u2013 you can control the end result.\u201d</p><p>For Penelope, French oak that\u2019s been analyzed with OakScan is only being used in Architect right now. But, Paladini and Polise aren\u2019t ruling out using the staves for another product in the future.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re constantly playing with different woods and finishes,\u201d Polise noted. \u201cSo whatever matches next, we may release. It just works like that.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/penelope-bourbon-oakscan-150047828.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/penelope-bourbon-oakscan-150047828.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-12 15:00:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best gifts to upgrade your grad\u2019s tech setup", "description": "<p>Every spring, a new class of graduates is unleashed on the world, many of them carrying gadgets that have been put through the ringer over the years.

The ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 remains our favorite gaming laptop, one that combines relative portability (3.5 pounds and a 14-inch screen) with serious power. In our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-amd-ryzen-radeon-173016459.html\">review</a> we said that the laptop was incredibly compelling, even if it\u2019s more expensive than it used to be. It has a powerful AMD processor and graphics card coupled with a great display, comfortable keyboard, spacious trackpad and solid design. It\u2019s not a champ on battery life, but we got seven hours of non-gaming use out of it \u2013 pretty decent considering the specs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As is usually the case with ASUS products, you can get the Zephyrus G14 in a wide variety of configurations, but one we\u2019d recommend includes an AMD Ryzen 9 6000 series processor, Radeon RX 6700S graphics, 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD and a 2,560 x 1,600 display with a 120 hz refresh rate.

It feels more modern than the M1 Air it replaces, and has a number of noteworthy improvements like a better webcam, MagSafe charging, that M2 processor, plus a larger and nicer display. It still retains the hallmarks of an Air, though, it\u2019s extremely light and portable with a battery that lasts longer than almost any laptop out there.</p><p>Most people will probably want to opt for the $1,699 configuration that includes 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM and the M2 chip with a 10-core GPU. And while we think that the Air is enough computer for most people, if you have a keen interest in processor-intensive tasks like video editing, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJTSERWQlhaP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8teTQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc3OWYxOTlhLWM4MjEtNGZiMS05MzIxLTBmZTA4MGMyMGI0ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYdivIfXymzKM9ckiDAc_gqk7WOMRzBCt9vWKtTrKFFw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BSHDVBXZ%3Fth%3D1\">$1,999 MacBook Pro</a> is worth considering. It gives you an even more powerful M2 Pro chip with 16-core GPU along with other niceties like a gorgeous mini-LED display.</p><p>Given how dominant a force Chromebooks are in education, it\u2019s entirely possible that someone just finishing school might want to continue using Chrome OS. Fortunately, there are lots of premium Chromebooks that are well-designed and capable enough to last for years. One of our favorites is Acer\u2019s Chromebook Spin 714, which the company just updated with Intel\u2019s 13th-gen Core processors. It also has a 14-inch, 1,920 x 1,200 display that offers a little more vertical space than your average 1080p screen. Add in a solid keyboard and trackpad and you have a Chromebook that doesn\u2019t require many compromises. We haven\u2019t tested the latest configuration\u2019s battery life yet, but Acer\u2019s past Chromebook options have been solid if not spectacular in that department.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Tablets</h2><figure><img alt=\"Samsung's Galaxy Tab S8 with a pink and red screen on a white background.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/1ba85f60-c7da-11ec-973a-f855b43834de\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Samsung</div></figure><p>When thinking about tablets, put aside the question of whether or not they can replace laptops, and focus on what they do best. They can be a great option for getting work done, engaging your creative side with art and music-making apps or just enjoying movies and games. For the vast majority of people, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html\">Apple\u2019s iPad</a> is the only tablet worth considering, even if they don\u2019t otherwise use Apple products. That\u2019s thanks to time-tested, reliable hardware and a massive software library with hundreds of thousands of apps optimized for the iPad\u2019s larger screen.</p><p>As for which iPad is the best, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS8yMDIyLUFwcGxlLWlQYWQtMTAtOS1pbmNoLVdpLUZpL2RwL0IwOVYzSE4xS0M_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8teTQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc3OWYxOTlhLWM4MjEtNGZiMS05MzIxLTBmZTA4MGMyMGI0ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWv3Zqku2hsRaq5B12k8palSNJS_-6osAkTp71nL_phj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi%2Fdp%2FB09V3HN1KC%3F\">iPad Air</a> remains the right choice for most \u2013 especially if you\u2019re looking for a good graduation gift. While the basic iPad is a great value, you get a lot when you step up to the Air. Perhaps most importantly, the Air has Apple\u2019s M1 chip, a very powerful chip for a tablet that was in many Macs for years. This means the Air is extremely fast and fairly future-proof, though most of Apple\u2019s hardware is now moving on to the M2.</p><p>The rest of the iPad Air\u2019s hardware is also impressive for the price. It has a large 10.9-inch screen with thin bezels and an anti-reflective coating; the display is also laminated directly to the glass, so there\u2019s no distracting gap beneath the surface. The Air includes 64GB or 256GB of storage, 10 hours of battery life, support for the second-generation Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard and an improved 12-megapixel front-facing camera. For $599, you\u2019re getting almost everything that the iPad Pro offers without spending over $800.</p><p>However, if you\u2019re shopping for an Android diehard, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvdGFibGV0cy9nYWxheHktdGFiLXM4L2J1eS8_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3NzlmMTk5YS1jODIxLTRmYjEtOTMyMS0wZmUwODBjMjBiNGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARj_1U3PMfvkI6cH4-iAox9ONycCjH4smJvzN6hHKm0F&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftablets%2Fgalaxy-tab-s8%2Fbuy%2F%3F\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab S8</a> is an solid choice. It features a high-resolution 11-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, and has an S-Pen stylus included in the box. And while Android historically hasn\u2019t been the best option for large-screen devices, Samsung\u2019s Dex feature switches things up into a more desktop-like multi-window mode, which can be great for productivity. Samsung\u2019s built-in apps that take advantage of the S-Pen are solid as well. You might have a hard time finding apps that are designed for the Tab S8\u2019s larger screen, but if you\u2019re buying this for someone familiar with Android, they\u2019ll likely be aware of the trade-offs.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Smartphones</h2><figure><img alt=\"Six Google Pixel 6 Pro smartphones in various pastel colors on a gray table.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/30d7f4e0-c7da-11ec-bfdb-fd8817a76151\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Google</div></figure><p>As useful as a laptop or tablet can be, chances are good that the most important computer people own is their smartphone. And if you know someone who is still rocking the same device they brought to campus with them four years ago, they\u2019ll definitely appreciate an upgrade. The good news is that it\u2019s pretty easy to pick out a phone that\u2019ll satisfy just about anyone, regardless of whether they prefer Android or iPhone.</p><p>This year, we\u2019re recommending the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2lwaG9uZS0xNC1wcm8vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3NzlmMTk5YS1jODIxLTRmYjEtOTMyMS0wZmUwODBjMjBiNGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbtQbUklzOiNi1HfrNEMwUyocdrwgyj0HNb3h9KhsnxR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-14-pro%2F\">iPhone 14 Pro</a>. The standard iPhone 14 is an excellent model, but the differences between the standard and Pro models are more pronounced this year than usual. The 14 Pro has an always-on display with a 120Hz refresh rate that can show you notifications and data from lock-screen widgets, and it also has a much better main camera than the iPhone 14. The Pro uses a 48-megapixel sensor, compared to the 12-megapixel one on the standard 14. Finally, the iPhone 14 Pro uses Apple\u2019s latest A16 Bionic processor, while the iPhone 14 is stuck with last year\u2019s A15. It\u2019s not a cheap phone at $999, but its extremely fast processor and Apple\u2019s track record of delivering software support for years means this investment should last a long time.</p><p>Samsung\u2019s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vdXMvc21hcnRwaG9uZXMvZ2FsYXh5LXMyMy11bHRyYS9idXkvZ2FsYXh5LXMyMy11bHRyYS0xdGItdW5sb2NrZWQtc20tczkxOHVsaW54YWEvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3NzlmMTk5YS1jODIxLTRmYjEtOTMyMS0wZmUwODBjMjBiNGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX4Gs3buHSVG9rIp80RSlOSppaKzoPf3VUwvglOpgXZw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-s23-ultra%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-s23-ultra-1tb-unlocked-sm-s918ulinxaa%2F\">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smartphones-140004900.html\">our pick for Android users</a>. At $1,200, it\u2019s quite the pricey device, but it delivers everything you could ask for: a wonderful screen, improved cameras (including a wild 200-megapixel main sensor), excellent battery life and strong performance thanks to its Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip. Samsung worked with Qualcomm to create a custom version of that processor specifically for its Galaxy phones, and the end result is a phone that was up to 40 percent faster than its predecessor. Given how thoroughly Samsung dominates the Android space, this isn\u2019t a surprising recommendation, but it will make most Android fans happy.</p><p>If you want to save a little cash but still get a top-notch Android experience, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Hb29nbGUtUGl4ZWwtUHJvLVNtYXJ0cGhvbmUtVGVsZXBob3RvL2RwL0IwQkNRV1lSMlo_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8teTQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc3OWYxOTlhLWM4MjEtNGZiMS05MzIxLTBmZTA4MGMyMGI0ZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAActpz7tDLdIpOQ7KN8uo_UQwOTsIgoiH8Jh8uAKW8mPC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto%2Fdp%2FB0BCQWYR2Z\">Google\u2019s $899 Pixel 7 Pro</a> is definitely worth a look. It picks up where last year\u2019s Pixel 6 Pro left off, with the company\u2019s second-generation custom Tensor processor powering the whole affair. Performance and battery life remain excellent, although the smaller Pixel 7 gets slightly better battery life. The cameras are similar to those on the Pixel 6 Pro, which isn\u2019t a big problem, because Google consistently makes some of the best smartphone cameras out there. But the telephoto shooter got a big upgrade \u2013 it now offers 5x optical zoom. And the fact that this phone is built by Google means it\u2019ll get software updates before any other Android phone on the market.</p><p>Both of these phones are big (the Pixel 7 Pro\u2019s screen is 6.7 inches while the S23 Ultra has a 6.8-inch display), but the good news is that both Google and Samsung offer smaller-screened devices that keep most of the same features and specs as their larger siblings. You\u2019ll save some cash with a smaller device, too.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Headphones</h2><figure><img alt=\"WH-1000XM5 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-05/0cee3550-d205-11ec-bf1f-9b47cb9d42c7\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Almost anyone would benefit from a good pair of noise-canceling headphones, and once again Sony has made our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html\">top pick</a>. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LVdILTEwMDBYTTUtQ2FuY2VsaW5nLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMtSGFuZHMtRnJlZS9kcC9CMDlYUzdKV0hIP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXk0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3NzlmMTk5YS1jODIxLTRmYjEtOTMyMS0wZmUwODBjMjBiNGQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR_Pb8AP87g9WBL8URQWAwVLTees7Yr2Q6qukvQC37S5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free%2Fdp%2FB09XS7JWHH\">Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM5</a>, released about a year ago, is the best over-ear option on the market.

Sony also included a host of smart software features like Speak-to-Chat automatic pausing, Adaptive Sound Control adjustments based on movement or location, 360 Reality Audio and a customizable EQ.</p><p>If you\u2019re buying earbuds for an Apple user, though, consider the second-generation <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1HZW5lcmF0aW9uLUNhbmNlbGxpbmctVHJhbnNwYXJlbmN5LVBlcnNvbmFsaXplZC9kcC9CMEJESFdEUjEyLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby15NC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzc5ZjE5OWEtYzgyMS00ZmIxLTkzMjEtMGZlMDgwYzIwYjRkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAezHU8aid-suFqajn-21lZMlUjWzDdXLLVsJMVypn1zd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%2F\">AirPods Pro</a>. They don\u2019t quite beat Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM4 in sound quality or battery life, but there are a host of features that make them the best earbuds to use with an iPhone, iPad or Mac. The fast pairing tech Apple introduced with the first AirPods still makes it extremely easy to start using these earbuds, or to switch them seamlessly between different Apple devices. Both the case and buds are sweat and water resistant, making them a better option for workouts. These second-gen AirPods Pro also have big improvements in noise cancellation and sound quality, and the \u201ctransparency\u201d mode that lets in outside sound lets you have a conversation or hear the world around you in a totally natural way.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Monitors</h2><figure><img alt=\"LG 32UN650-W\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/44633e70-f02e-11ed-b95f-d5b827936068\" style=\"height: 982px; width: 1318px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LG</div></figure><p>There are a dizzying number of monitors on the market, at basically any price point you can think of, which makes recommending a single monitor a very difficult task.

The <a href=\"https://www.sfbags.com/collections/shoulder-messenger-bags/products/executive-leather-laptop-messenger\">Executive Leather Messenger</a> from Waterfield Designs is an expensive choice, but it\u2019s worth the cost. Waterfield makes everything by hand in its San Francisco shop, and the materials it uses are top notch. I\u2019ve owned a lot of their products over the years, and I can safely say this bag will last a decade or more, and the leather will only look more attractive as time goes on.</p><p>On the inside are two padded slots, one for a tablet and one for a laptop. There are also two pockets, one zippered, as well as a pen slot and a metal key fob. Finally, there are two easily-accessible hand pockets under the flap, both with an extremely soft plush lining. The Executive Leather Messenger comes in three different leather colors and costs either $399 or $419, depending on which size you choose. It\u2019s an investment, for sure, but it will last a long time.</p><p>Waterfield\u2019s bags are typically quite pricey, but in the last year they released a new line of \u201cessential\u201d options that offer the company\u2019s excellent construction and smart features at a lower price point. The $179 <a href=\"https://www.sfbags.com/products/essential-messenger-laptop-bag\">Essential Messenger</a> is a lightweight option that does away with the leather and uses tough textiles instead. But its magnetic closures are fast and easy to undo, the strap is easily removable for wearing over whichever shoulder you choose, and it has foam inserts to help it keep its structure. There\u2019s a built-in sleeve for a laptop up to 14 inches, and I can confirm you can shove a surprising amount of gear in it considering its smaller size.</p><p>If you\u2019d prefer a non-leather choice, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8747aed1-6586-46eb-856d-c95a5318901b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peak+Design&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4NzQ3YWVkMS02NTg2LTQ2ZWItODU2ZC1jOTVhNTMxODkwMWIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVha2Rlc2lnbi5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvZXZlcnlkYXktYmFncy9wcm9kdWN0cy9ldmVyeWRheS1tZXNzZW5nZXI_dmFyaWFudD0yOTc0MTQzOTE4OTAzNiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzc5ZjE5OWEtYzgyMS00ZmIxLTkzMjEtMGZlMDgwYzIwYjRkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYHFH4Yc63Xxc6fygpfyl99f_y9255EChvTQJM7ioBV7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fcollections%2Feveryday-bags%2Fproducts%2Feveryday-messenger%3Fvariant%3D29741439189036\">Peak Design\u2019s Everyday Messenger</a> is a great and more affordable option. The $230 bag was originally designed for photographers, but (as the name implies) it works as a tough, well-designed option for whatever you need to carry. It has a dedicated 13-inch laptop sleeve and \u201cstretchy\u201d pockets that make it easier to keep track of smaller items. The bag also comes with a few flexible interior dividers so you can customize it in any way you want. The recently-released V2 update boasts 100 percent recycled outer fabric, a redesigned shoulder strap that should be less prone to slippage, a \u201cMagLatch\u201d magnetic buckle and a more efficient design that makes it 24 percent lighter than the original.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-upgrades-laptops-tablets-headphones-smartphones-monitors-bags-for-graduates-150049903.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-upgrades-laptops-tablets-headphones-smartphones-monitors-bags-for-graduates-150049903.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-12 13:30:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Bose's QuietComfort Earbuds II are on sale for $249 right now", "description": "<p>Now's the time to go shopping if you've been tempted by Bose's QuietComfort Earbuds II but were put off by the high initial price.

Claude has gone from having a limit of 9,000 tokens to 100,000 tokens, which corresponds to roughly 75,000 words. That's a full novel. To put that into perspective, Claude now has the ability to easily read and finish Ernest Hemingway's <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> (74,240 words), Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em> (74,800 words) and Mark Twain's <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> (69,000 words). And, as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/12/23720964/chatbot-language-model-context-window-memory-anthropic-claude\"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, the company says Claude can read and analyze information from each book in under a minute.&nbsp;</p><p>Generative AIs like Claude are still limited by the number of &quot;tokens&quot; they can process. As OpenAI <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them\">explains</a> in its help page, you can think of tokens as pieces of words. The AI cuts up words for processing, and they're not always chopped up from the start to the end of each word, since spaces and other characters are also included. At the moment, OpenAI's standard GPT-4 model is <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7127966-what-is-the-difference-between-the-gpt-4-models\">capable</a> of processing 8,000 tokens, while an extended version can process 32,000 tokens. Meanwhile, its publicly available ChatGPT chatbot has <a href=\"https://medium.com/@russkohn/mastering-ai-token-limits-and-memory-ce920630349a\">a limit</a> of around 4,000 tokens.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Now Claude has a much wider context window than all of them. According to Anthropic, it loaded <em>Great Gatsby</em> onto the AI during testing and modified a single line to say Mr. Carraway was &quot;a software engineer that works on machine learning tooling at Anthropic.&quot; Claude was able to spot how the book was modified within 22 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>The AI's expanded context window is now available to Anthropic's business partners who are using its API. Anthropic says the capability will help businesses quickly digest and summarize lengthy financial statements and research papers, assess pieces of legislation, identify risks and arguments across legal documents and comb through dense developer documentation, among other possible tasks.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/anthropic-says-its-claude-ai-can-now-read-a-whole-book-in-under-a-minute-120114018.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/anthropic-says-its-claude-ai-can-now-read-a-whole-book-in-under-a-minute-120114018.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-12 12:01:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: The verdict on 'Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom'", "description": "<p>How do you follow up one of the most well-regarded and critically acclaimed games of the last decade?

Yaccarino is known for being an &quot;industry advocate for finding better ways to measure the effectiveness of advertising,&quot; according to <em>The Journal. </em>Sounds fun.

The Xperia 1 V has a new image sensor called Exmor T for Mobile, designed to be faster and work better with computational (AI) photography while offering &quot;approximately double&quot; the low-light performance of the Xperia 1 IV. For vloggers and content creators, it now features the same Product Showcase setting found on Sony's vlogging cameras, like the ZV-E1, which will keep items locked in focus while blurring out the background. The new sensor also promises improved skin tones, thanks to extra saturation available on the sensor. It also has a new voice priority mic near the rear camera. As with past Xperia models, the catch here is the price: The Xperia 1 V starts at $1,400.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonys-xperia-i-v-phone-is-a-photo-and-video-powerhouse-074625053.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/disney-and-hulu-will-merge-into-a-single-app-later-this-year-083536664.html https://www.engadget.com/...\">Disney+ and Hulu will merge into a single app later this year</a></h2><h3>But they\u2019ll still be available as 'standalone options.'</h3><h3></h3><p>A &quot;one-app experience&quot; that combines Disney+ and Hulu content will launch in late 2023, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced during the company's latest earnings call.

The company encourages users to report anyone violating the rule, but a quick bio share over messages might not motivate anyone to do so. Removing social handles also interferes with people who share them to circumvent swipe limits or remove the need to match. Plus, there's the issue of determining if a person is who they say they are. Alongside the social handles announcement, Tinder reminds people to be honest and not <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tinder-adds-video-selfies-to-photo-verification-062835070.html\">create fake personas</a>.
