The paraglider was an early key item in Breath of the Wild, but you can play for hours in Tears of the Kingdom without ever actually getting it, which we would not recommend, given that it's still a vital item for aerial exploration. In this video guide, we’ll show you exactly what to do the moment Link lands in Hyrule to ensure he gets his hands on the paraglider as early as possible in Zelda: TotK.

## Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania - Exclusive VFX Progression Clip (2023) Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors

Led by VFX Supervisors Malte Sarnes and Axel Bonami, the visual effects work for Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania was a collaborative effort between MPC’s Adelaide, Montreal, Bangalore, and LA teams. The VFX teams used the latest tools and artistry to create the film's breathtaking visuals, with over 1000 artists delivering more than 800 shots.

MPC Adelaide’s Concept Art team, under the supervision of Art Director Nicholas Pill, and MPC LA’s Concept Art team, led by Art Director Leandre Lagrange, were tasked with designing the background for a specific location in the Quantum Realm, Guerilla Village. To visualize this environment, the team researched microscopic, subatomic, and neural network references, as well as artists such as Gerard van Smirren. Since Guerilla Village is a hideout, the team’s designs conveyed a sense of protection and secrecy.
MPC Montreal’s artists worked on two large-scale full CG environments, the Guerilla Village and Chronopolis. Both sequences involved two large-scale battle sequences featuring CG crowds, an army of battle ants and hundreds of FX elements to seamlessly integrated into the plate. They were also tasked with creating the character Veb, voiced by actor David Dastmalchian. MPC’s Modelling and Texture artists researched creatures including jellyfish to create Veb’s translucent skin, while animators were faced with the challenge of how to convey the character’s emotion.

MPC Adelaide worked on multiple sequences within the Quantum Realm, including Hank and MODOK’s Aerial fight, Cassie’s Transmission, Janet’s Homestead, the Observation Deck sequence, and the Blight approach. The FX department created a variety of simulations including explosions, energy effects, laser beams, and refractive energy.

To create the Homestead environment, MPC’s Assets department built a library of detailed CG foliage and vegetation to distribute throughout the environment, added depth with multiple layers. The Quantum Realm environments built by MPC, spanned over 40 kilometers in diameter and included 20 kilometers of Quantum Skies. These skies include numerous effects such as slow-moving portals, stars, noise waves, and clouds.

The most challenging work was the Blight, which involved large-scale environment destruction, as well as the Blight retraction and its reversed environmental effects.

Another major task for MPC was Kang’s transformations, the look development for his mask, and powers including forcefields and laser beams. MPC also created various creatures including variations of Ants, including armored ants carrying objects on their backs and repairing Hank's ship using welding tools, snail-like horses named Snorses, digital doubles, and vehicles.

## What’s The Best Year In Modern Gaming? - Beyond Clips

Was 2007 the best game in modern gaming? It saw the launch of some hit franchises like Mass Effect, Assassin’s Creed, Uncharted, Bioshock, and Portal - plus Grand Theft Auto IV and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare both taking new approaches to existing series. It’s kind of hard to point to ONE definitive year, and honestly, 2015, 2017 and 2020 were all pretty solid on the game release front. Honorable mentions to 1998 and 2004, of course - though those might fall more into the “classic” bucket, rather than “modern.” But it’s all subjective and totally relative. Are you still reading this? Why would you do that, just watch the video. The stuff we put down here is to make the YouTube algorithm think we’re cool and try to make us more popular on the internet.

## Fast X - Official 'Gas Pump Explosion' Behind The Scenes Clip (2023) Vin Diesel

Check out this explosive behind-the-scenes look at Fast X in this new featurette for the upcoming film. Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious saga, stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jason Momoa, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Sung Kang, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior, Scott Eastwood, Leo Abelo Perry, with Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, and Rita Moreno.

Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever. 

In 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. 

Dante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. 

Fast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum, and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis, and Mark Bomback.

Fast X, directed by Louis Leterrier, opens in theaters on May 19, 2023.

Check out the trailer for Season 7 of Outlander. The series, inspired by Diana Gabaldon’s international best-selling books, stars Caitríona Balfe as “Claire Fraser,” Sam Heughan as “Jamie Fraser,” Sophie Skelton as “Brianna MacKenzie,” Richard Rankin as “Roger MacKenzie,” John Bell as “Young Ian,” David Berry as “Lord John Grey,” along with newcomers Charles Vandervaart as “William Ransom,” Izzy Meikle-Small as “Rachel Hunter” and Joey Phillips as “Denzell Hunter.” 

Season seven picks up from the harrowing events of the end of season six, with Jamie and Young Ian racing to rescue Claire before she’s tried and wrongfully convicted for the murder of Malva Christie. But their mission is complicated by the beginning of a geopolitical firestorm: The American Revolution has arrived. In the seventh season of Outlander, Jamie, Claire, and their family are caught in the violent birth pains of an emerging nation as armies march to war and British institutions crumble in the face of armed rebellion.

The land the Frasers call home is changing – and they must change with it. In order to protect what they’ve built, the Frasers have to navigate the perils of the Revolutionary War. They learn that sometimes to defend what you love, you have to leave it behind. As the conflict draws them out of North Carolina and into the heart of this fight for independence, Jamie, Claire, Brianna, and Roger are faced with impossible decisions that have the potential to tear their family apart.

Matthew B. Roberts, Ronald D. Moore, Maril Davis, Toni Graphia, Luke Schelhaas, Andy Harries, Jim Kohlberg, Caitríona Balfe and Sam Heughan serve as executive producers on Outlander. It is produced by Tall Ship Productions, Left Bank Pictures and Story Mining & Supply Company, in association with Sony Pictures Television.

The first half of the seventh season of Outlander returns on Friday, June 16 at midnight ET on the STARZ app, all STARZ streaming and on-demand platforms, and internationally on the LIONSGATE+ premium streaming platform in the U.K. On linear, it will debut on STARZ on Friday, June 16 at 8:00 PM ET/PT in the U.S. New episodes will be available to stream weekly on Fridays at midnight on the STARZ app, all STARZ streaming and on-demand platforms and will air weekly on the STARZ linear platform on Fridays at 8:00 pm ET/PT.

Darkest Dungeon 2 reviewed on PC by Jon Bolding.

Interesting turn-based RPG combat keeps Darkest Dungeon 2’s roguelite progression fresh for hours – if you can push past the early, intentionally punishing humps and like it for what it is, rather than the close retread of Darkest Dungeon that it isn't. Its structure may be frustratingly random at times, even so much as to feel meaningless or pointless, but a gambler's spirit can see you through those weird patches of bad luck or directionlessness. Besides, this game would have to be really bad to drag down the vibes of the moody lines and grumbling narration that live at the heart of Darkest Dungeon 2.
