<p>Lopez plays an ex-special forces parent aiming to rescues her kid from the bad guys in this formulaic and muddled Netflix caper</p><p>There’s some real ChatGPT film-making here in this abjectly formulaic and inert Netflix thriller from director Niki Caro, although ChatGPT would have made a better, clearer job of the muddled story. This one has Jennifer Lopez rescue her 12-year-old daughter from the bad guys on a number of separate occasions, with one villain (Gael García Bernal) vanishing from the plot about halfway in, presumably left on the cutting-room floor. It’s a script which shows every sign of having had plenty of rewrites, though perhaps it could have done with a few more.</p><p>Lopez is ex-special forces, skilled in guns and knives and unarmed combat, with what an official calls an impressive number of “confirmed kills”; she bitterly regretted being drawn into gun-running and people-trafficking after leaving the army, and getting involved with creepy bad guys Hector Álvarez (Bernal) and former SAS Brit Adrian Lovell (Joseph Fiennes). She gets pregnant by one of them – the identity of the father is a fantastically uninteresting mystery which the film shows no interest in solving – and this personal event, combined with the horror of what she’s doing induces Lopez’s character to try getting out of the filthy trade.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/12/the-mother-review-jennifer-lopez-netflix">Continue reading...</a>
