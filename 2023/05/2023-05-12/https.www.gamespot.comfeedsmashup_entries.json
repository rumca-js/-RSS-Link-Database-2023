And he apparently used some of that clout to very slightly expand Uncle Owen's role in last year's Obi-Wan Kenobi series: by getting him a bit of a fight scene with Moses Ingram's Inquisitor Reva.</p><p>While the character didn't get a ton of screen time back in the day in the original film when he was played by Phil Brown, it was impossible to forget Uncle Owen--he was one of the first Star Wars characters we ever met, and he and Aunt Beru were the characters who had to die so Luke Skywalker would have a reason not just to leave home but to fight against the Empire.</p><p>On the Obi-Wan Kenobi limited series, we got to spend more time with Uncle Owen than ever before, during his appearances in the premiere episode and the finale. During both episodes, Owen has to face down Inquisitor Reva--first in Mos Eisley, in public, and then in the finale when Reva is attempting to murder Luke Skywalker at the Lars homestead.

Among them is a wearable version of <strong>Majora's Mask</strong>, the titular headpiece from one of the series' most divisive entries, that fans will no doubt want to get their hands on. If you'd like to score Majora's Mask for yourself, read on.</p><h2>Where to get Majora's Mask in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p>Majora's Mask is found in the Floating Coliseum, which itself is located deep down under Hyrule in the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-depths-chasm-guide/1100-6514040/\">Depths</a>.

The first four will be relatively simple if you've fought any of these beasts elsewhere already, but the final Lynel sports some hefty armor that will require some bashing with heavy attacks from a big weapon.

Worse, since they're engaged in melee, you'll end up wading into the thick of the fray if ever you plan on activating their abilities, likely risking a brutal hit.

It was the year of The Stanley Parable and Papers, Please, of Hotline Miami and Don't Starve. Gone Home and Kentucky Route Zero were another two that were particularly notable, and lest we forget Rogue Legacy, Guacamelee, Surgeon Simulator, Antichamber, and Depression Quest. It was a year that was not solely defined by a new Grand Theft Auto, but in part by a growth in intimate and innovative titles. This of course makes it all the more interesting that one of the most critically-acclaimed games of that year--the one that took home the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the annual Independent Games Festival--is one that all but disappeared.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Richard Hofmeier's Cart Life is a simulation-adventure game that follows three cart vendors simply trying to make rent and get by. Back in 2013, it was praised for how its immersive mechanics forced players to experience similar frustrations to the vendors they play as, and for being an empathic ode to the working class. Yet for much of the last decade, it has been largely unplayable. Between delistings, bugs, and certain portions of the game being locked behind said bugs, the solo venture has teetered on the edge of remembrance. This is exactly why AdHoc Studio decided to contact Hofmeier and change that.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Earlier this year, GameSpot got the chance to sit down with AdHoc Studio co-founder Nick Herman, talk to him about the process of finishing and publishing Cart Life, and play the first 20 minutes. While the game was still far from finished, the experience of playing Cart Life and seeing firsthand what made it special all those years ago was exciting. Despite nearly a decade passing, the mechanics still feel impactful and unique, and the story remains poignant. However, even more enlightening was the conversation I had with Herman about the game, which is slated for release later this year.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-award-winning-game-you-likely-missed-vanished-and-why-its-coming-back-cart-life-preview/1100-6514121/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-award-winning-game-you-likely-missed-vanished-and-why-its-coming-back-cart-life-preview/1100-6514121/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-05-12 17:29:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Troubled Gone Home Studio's Next Game Now Being Made Without Its Involvement", "description": "<p>Development of narrative game Open Roads is now continuing without the involvement of Fullbright, after the company's co-founder Steve Gaynor stepped down.

Whether you're looking to go in with dual katanas and slice up your opponents with bleed damage, blast away at enemies with ranged spells, or go full knight mode and tank hits while dishing them out with heavy blows of your own--the possibilities are truly endless.</p><p>You'll also be tasked with deciding if you prefer to perfect your dodge rolling to evade enemies or wield a shield capable of blocking--or at least mitigating--the damage you take. If you choose the latter, you'll obviously want to be certain you're sporting the best you can get for your respective build and weight limitations.</p><p>We've compiled a list of some of Elden Ring's best shields. Some are excellent due to their weight-to-protection ratios, while others have cool extra features or skills that help them stand out. Finding the shield that works best for you should always be your goal, and hopefully, our list will provide you with a good starting point toward finding which one that will be.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Great Turtle Shell Shield</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4001656-eldenring%E2%84%A2_20220706204959.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Great Turtle Shell Shield is particularly notable for not only being, you know, a turtle shell, but also for providing a really solid weight-to-protection ratio. It can be snagged easily in Weeping Penninsula and should last you well into the mid-game.</p><p>This shield requires only 14 Strength to wield and doesn't weigh too much, but it only blocks 87% of physical damage, meaning a bit will still bleed through. But because it also boosts stamina recovery speed by 8%, it's a perfect option for those who tend to stay mobile but would like some decent protection in a pinch.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Visage Shield</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4001655-eldenring%E2%84%A2_20220706204355.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Visage Shield, which can be obtained easily in Caelid, is a pretty useful tool for crowd control and more. However, due to its high equip load, it is definitely focused towards character builds that prioritize tanking over all else.</p><p>This hulking shield requires 44 Strength to wield, so even though you can get it quite early in the game, don't expect to be able to use it until you've pumped those stats up a bit. It blocks 100% of physical damage and has high mitigation for most magic types, too. But what sets it apart is its Tongues of Fire skill, which allows you to spray flames from the shield even while walking, making it a helpful tool for pushing enemies back and garnering yourself some space.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dragonclaw Shield</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4001657-eldenring%E2%84%A2_20220706204201.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Though the Dragonclaw Shield may not be the very best of the greatshields, it more than earns its spot on this list due to its low weight requirements and intriguing utility options. If you're looking for some solid guard boosting, high protections, and low Endurance needs, pick this one up in Altus Plateau.</p><p>You'll have to hit the stat requirements of 28 Strength and 12 Dexterity to wield this greatshield, but it'll block 100% of physical damage and a respectable 76% of lightning damage. To make things even better, it definitely looks cooler than most shields in the game, and it can dish out some pretty gnarly lightning damage of its own if you're into using a shield in that manner.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Jellyfish Shield</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4001665-eldenring%E2%84%A2_20220707153030.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Jellyfish Shield can be obtained relatively early on in your adventure by advancing into Liurnia of the Lakes, and not only is it a great option for a multitude of situations, but it also looks unlike anything else in the game.</p><p>This unique shield requires 20 Strength and 14 Dexterity to wield, and it blocks 100% of incoming physical damage. Its best feature, though, is its Contagious Fury skill, which boosts your damage output by 20% for 30 seconds, making it an exceptional option to bring along into tough fights. Plenty of blocking power and that extra utility is a hard combo to beat.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Carian Knight's Shield</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4001666-eldenring%E2%84%A2_20220707152806.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Carian Knight's Shield is an exceptional choice for a variety of magic-based builds due to its fairly low weight requirements and fantastic protection. It's obtained quite early within Raya Lucaria Academy in Liurnia of the Lakes, making it easy to snag before getting too far into the game.</p><p>This shield requires 10 Strength, 10 Dexterity, and 15 Intelligence to wield, which means that it's best for sorcery and hybrid builds. It blocks 100% of physical damage and a whopping 71% of magic damage. Though unexceptional on paper, it's simply a good all-around medium shield that can provide plenty of protection while remaining useful for parrying.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Erdtree Greatshield</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4001668-eldenring%E2%84%A2_20220706204254.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Erdtree Greatshield may require you to take down two Tree Sentinels at once in Altus Plateau, but you may find that it's very much worth the hassle. With great protections and a unique skill, this one sits among the best shields in the game without question.</p><p>To wield this big shield, you'll need to have 30 Strength and 12 Faith. It blocks 100% of physical damage, and it has above-average holy and magic damage negation, too. Best of all, its Golden Retaliation skill allows you to parry magical attacks and retaliate with a holy blast of your own. It's a fun shield to use and doesn't weigh too much, so it's worth rocking in basically any fight.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Golden Greatshield</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4001669-eldenring%E2%84%A2_20220707152918.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Golden Greatshield drops relatively frequently in Leyndell, Royal Capital, and it's worth any time spent farming. This large, oval shield may not look particularly special, but its balanced stat requirements help it sit among the best choices in the game.</p><p>You'll need 34 Strength to wield this greatshield. It provides 100% physical damage negation and fantastic protection against all other damage types, too. Although there are shields with better overall guard boost, this one can hit 78 when fully upgraded despite having much more manageable stat and weight requirements, making it an absolute beast for tanky builds.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Brass Shield</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/679/6794662/4001693-eldenring%E2%84%A2_20220707160502.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Unless you're seeking one of the unique skills from another shield, the Brass Shield is among the best all-around choices in the game. It can be farmed off Godrick Soldiers very early on in Limgrave, and with upgrades, it'll last you the entirety of the game with few problems.</p><p>You'll only need 16 Strength to wield this shield, so nearly any build should be able to meet those stat requirements. It blocks 100% of physical attacks and has solid damage negation against all other elements. You can equip it with most Ashes of War for whatever type of utility you need, and once it's upgraded to max, it can reduce your stamina loss from blocking by over 65%. </p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-best-shields/2900-4206/", "date_published": "2023-05-12 16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom - Water Temple Puzzle Guide", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/\">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> Water Temple Puzzle is what you'll encounter once you're done with <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-clues-to-the-sky-quest-guide/1100-6514046/\"><strong>Clues to the Sky</strong></a>, as well as a few preliminary steps.
