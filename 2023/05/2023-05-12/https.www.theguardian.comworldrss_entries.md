<p>Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan says strikes are ‘government-led’ due to lack of compromise from ministers</p><p>Police have been forced to apologise to a royal fan after arresting and detaining her for 13 hours for standing near a group of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/just-stop-oil">Just Stop Oil</a> protesters at King Charles’s coronation, <strong>Tobi Thomas</strong> reports.</p><p>Here are some more lines from <strong>Mick Whelan</strong>’s interviews this morning.</p><p><strong>Whelan, the Aslef general secretary, rejected claims that today’s strike had been timed to target people trying to travel to Liverpool for Eurovision. </strong>When it was put to him on the Today programme that people would not believe the timing of the strike was a coincidence, he replied:</p><p>Strangely enough, I don’t really watch Eurovision, believe it or not. I didn’t even know they had semi-finals.</p><p>What happened to us was a direct reaction to that non-deal that came out. Under the legislation we had to give 14 days notice [for a strike].
