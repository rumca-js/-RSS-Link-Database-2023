Here are FIVE mistakes I try not to make in my miniature painting - I hope these can help.

Vince Venturella and I made a game! Check out Reign in Hell - Demonic Skirmish Combat at http://www.reigninhellgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
