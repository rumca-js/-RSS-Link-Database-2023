  <p id="1nNnoo">As a smart home reviewer of a certain age, all I’ve ever wanted for my home is a Rosie the Robot. <em>The Jetsons</em>’ mechanical housekeeper was the example I held Amazon’s Astro to when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23141966/amazon-astro-robot-review">I tested the company’s first home robot</a> — and it unsurprisingly failed. Not just because it had no arms, but because it couldn’t really do anything. </p>

Burnham is a secret new AI robot project Amazon is developing that, according to the documents, adds a layer of “intelligence and a conversational spoken interface” to a smart home robot, reports <em>Insider</em>. </p>

  <p id="f5rfMm">Garmin’s smartwatch lineup is getting a big upgrade. A set of leaked images <a href="https://winfuture.de/news,136185.html">shared by <em>WinFuture</em></a> gives us a detailed look at some of Garmin’s upcoming flagships, including the Epix Pro Gen 2, Fenix 7X Pro, and Fenix 7 Pro that are set to go toe-to-toe with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23363948/apple-watch-ultra-review-rugged-smartwatch-gps">the Apple Watch Ultra</a>.</p>
<p id="gpRKPw">It looks like the “Pro” version of the premium Epix Gen 2 watch will come in a few different display sizes: 42mm, 47mm, and 51mm, which is nice given that the standard Epix Gen only came in one 47mm size. There’s also the option for a sapphire crystal display that’s supposed to make it more scratch-resistant, along with several color variations, including white, black, and off-white.</p>

  <p id="DNkp1Y">The single most visited page on the internet is undergoing its most radical change in 25 years.<strong> </strong></p>
<p id="IJ55kG">On Wednesday, Google introduced a major overhaul of its search results page that infuses the screen with AI. Called the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23717120/google-search-ai-results-generated-experience-io">Search Generative Experience (SGE)</a>, the new interface makes it so that when you type a query into the search box, the so-called “10 blue links” that we’re all familiar with appear for only a brief moment before being pushed off the page by a colorful new shade with AI-generated information. The shade pushes the rest of Google’s links far down the page you’re looking at — and when I say far, I mean almost entirely off the screen.</p>

  <p id="MKxwtW">Tesla said that it would push an over-the-air software update to 1.1 million vehicles in China in response to a braking and acceleration problem, multiple outlets are reporting. </p>
<p id="ABay6T">China’s market regulator identified the issue as a “product recall,” though, as is typical with Tesla, the issue appears to be addressable with a software update. It isn’t clear whether Tesla wants customers to bring in their vehicles for any maintenance, nor whether there is a refund available to those who want to return their cars. </p>
<p id="7vIXD1">The recall covers all four of Tesla’s vehicle models — Model S, X, 3, and Y — both imported and made in China, that were manufactured between January 12th, 2019, and April 24th, 2023. In a statement,  the State Administration for...</p>

  <p id="C4LjaV">The arrival of ChatGPT last year sent a rare shiver through Google’s spine. For years the company had positioned itself as a leader in the development in artificial intelligence. Suddenly, though, a product from the upstart OpenAI rocketed to tens of millions of monthly users — and observers began asking whether Google had squandered its lead.</p>
<p id="uyhz1W">Within weeks, leaders at the company declared a “code red” — a signal that the time to begin shipping AI features was now. (It was widely reported that CEO Sundar Pichai declared the code red, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/podcasts/hard-fork-sundar.html?showTranscript=1">he later told me that it wasn’t the case</a>.)</p>

  <p id="H1A1iN">While Wednesday’s Google I/O event largely hyped the company’s biggest AI initiatives, the company also announced updates to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/mediapipe">machine learning suite</a> that powers Google Lens and Google Meet features like object tracking and recognition, gesture control, and of course, facial detection. The newest update enables app developers to, among other things, create Snapchat-like face filters and hand tracking, with the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/11/23720277/android-has-some-new-tools-for-face-filters">showing off a GIF that’s definitely not a Memoji</a>.</p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AbPiwt">It’s never easy to follow up a beloved device, especially when it’s one that managed to fuse ancient technology with a modern-day phablet. But the Purah Pad — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/7/14809872/sheikah-slate-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">a spiritual successor to the Sheikah Slate</a> — manages to add more utility to a device that already let you control physics. It still doesn’t have much in the way of entertainment options, but its new design and feature set are ideal for those traveling around Hyrule, particularly if you also have a wearable that gives you power over space and time.</p>
<p id="Udn2Xu">In terms of hardware, the Purah Pad has a slightly more streamlined setup than its predecessor, with a seven-inch display flanked by physical buttons and other controls on the sides and a USB Type-C port at the bottom. It has a rather...</p>

Ahead of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>’s release this week, Nintendo revealed that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23718375/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-dungeons-nintendo">classic dungeons would be making their return</a> all throughout the new game, and it was easy to get the impression that meant Link would be spending a lot of time in heavily-themed, cordoned-off fortresses scattered across Hyrule. </p>

It’s most likely going to be Linda Yaccarino, the current head of advertising and partnerships for NBCUniversal. </p>
<p id="fnd5ia">I wish I could say with certainty that it’s her, though the deal doesn’t seem to be totally done. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-twitter-ceo-elon-musk-7a006bb5"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> is reporting</a> that she’s “in talks” for the job, and Dylan Byers of <em>Puck</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanbyers/status/1656801802770354179?s=61&amp;t=Uh_TpxGxxXZBqrTQuGJiHQ">says Musk “plans” to give it to her</a>. Unfortunately, her spokesperson is ghosting me and Twitter has resorted to responding to press inquiries with a poop emoji.</p>
<p id="iKj251">I do know, however, that Yaccarino has been angling for the job and telling friends she wants it. The advertising world is certainly gossiping that it’s her. She recently hosted...</p>
