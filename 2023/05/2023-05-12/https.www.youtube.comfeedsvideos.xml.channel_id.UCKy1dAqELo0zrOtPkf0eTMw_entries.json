The VFX teams used the latest tools and artistry to create the film's breathtaking visuals, with over 1000 artists delivering more than 800 shots.\n\nMPC Adelaide\u2019s Concept Art team, under the supervision of Art Director Nicholas Pill, and MPC LA\u2019s Concept Art team, led by Art Director Leandre Lagrange, were tasked with designing the background for a specific location in the Quantum Realm, Guerilla Village. To visualize this environment, the team researched microscopic, subatomic, and neural network references, as well as artists such as Gerard van Smirren. Since Guerilla Village is a hideout, the team\u2019s designs conveyed a sense of protection and secrecy.\nMPC Montreal\u2019s artists worked on two large-scale full CG environments, the Guerilla Village and Chronopolis. Both sequences involved two large-scale battle sequences featuring CG crowds, an army of battle ants and hundreds of FX elements to seamlessly integrated into the plate. They were also tasked with creating the character Veb, voiced by actor David Dastmalchian. MPC\u2019s Modelling and Texture artists researched creatures including jellyfish to create Veb\u2019s translucent skin, while animators were faced with the challenge of how to convey the character\u2019s emotion.\n\nMPC Adelaide worked on multiple sequences within the Quantum Realm, including Hank and MODOK\u2019s Aerial fight, Cassie\u2019s Transmission, Janet\u2019s Homestead, the Observation Deck sequence, and the Blight approach. The FX department created a variety of simulations including explosions, energy effects, laser beams, and refractive energy.\n\nTo create the Homestead environment, MPC\u2019s Assets department built a library of detailed CG foliage and vegetation to distribute throughout the environment, added depth with multiple layers. The Quantum Realm environments built by MPC, spanned over 40 kilometers in diameter and included 20 kilometers of Quantum Skies. These skies include numerous effects such as slow-moving portals, stars, noise waves, and clouds.\n\nThe most challenging work was the Blight, which involved large-scale environment destruction, as well as the Blight retraction and its reversed environmental effects.\n\nAnother major task for MPC was Kang\u2019s transformations, the look development for his mask, and powers including forcefields and laser beams. MPC also created various creatures including variations of Ants, including armored ants carrying objects on their backs and repairing Hank's ship using welding tools, snail-like horses named Snorses, digital doubles, and vehicles.\n\n#IGN #Marvel #AntMan\n\nMarvel Studios\u2019 Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now on Digital and will be available on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD May 16.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1mrDIT4dpQ", "date_published": "2023-05-12 18:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 - Official Trailer", "description": "Here's your look at the latest Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 trailer.
