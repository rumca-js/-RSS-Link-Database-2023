The Moulin Rouge in Paris opened in 1889 in Paris’ Montmarte district as a place where people from all walks of life could come to mingle and enjoy music, dance, and comedy. It is credited for making the cancan dance famous, which is still performed over 130 years later. In the 20th century, the venue survived a fire, two world wars, and its share of criticism for the cancan dance. Despite it all, the Parisian theater remained an important cultural hub and has inspired Hollywood films and Broadway musicals. Their current show Féerie cost 8 million euros to create, and half of that went only to the costumes. The dancers wear 1,000 outfits adorned with feathers, rhinestones, and sequins. Féerie runs 365 days a year with 2 shows every night.
