Senior United Nations trade official Rebeca Grynspan has called on the U.S. Federal Reserve to slow its interest rate hikes because of how they impact the developing world.

“When the U.S. Federal Reserve increases interest rates, it means that these countries will be in trouble,” Grynspan told FRONTLINE’s James Jacoby in an interview filmed during the making of the March 2023 documentary Age of Easy Money.

Fed official Neel Kashkari also shares his perspective: “We pay a lot of attention into how the U.S. monetary policy impacts the world, because then it bounces back on the U.S. economy,” Kashkari says.
