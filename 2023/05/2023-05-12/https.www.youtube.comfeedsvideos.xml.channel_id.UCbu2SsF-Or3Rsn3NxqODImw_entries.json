While massive open-worlds can be fantastic when done well, games don't need them to stand out. \n\nThe two discuss how games like Breath of the Wild and Elden Ring have pushed open-world game design forward, and how some games like Far Cry 6 and Forspoken, are stuck in the past. \n\nSpot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into single topic as opposed to recapping al the news. Spot On airs each Friday.\n\nThank you to Crowsmack for providing the artwork used on the Spot On set.

So here are 14 spoiler-friendly things that I wish I knew while playing Tears of the Kingdom.\n\n#tearsofthekingdom #thelegendofzelda #gaming \n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 Intro\n0:23 Zonai Overcharge\n0:52 Torch 2.0\n1:11 Updraft Upgrades\n1:39 Learn to Throw\n1:50 Toss Items at Certain Enemies\n2:10 Careful When Fusing Certain Items\n3:09 No Durability Used\n3:24 Inventory Gets Crazy\n4:12 Icicles are Useful\n4:32 Ice Block Possibilities\n5:15 Shield Bomb Launching\n5:42 Windshield High Jump\n5:59 Glider Control\n6:20 Ability Combinations\n7:54 Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UHacX6tuMM", "date_published": "2023-05-12 15:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Starter Guide", "description": "From how to tackle the game's opening shrines, how to use the new Fuse, Ultrahand, Recall, and Ascend powers, what to see along the way, and things to make sure not to miss before setting out into Hyrule, including the paraglider, here's the definitive starter guide for Tears of the Kingdom.\n#gaming #TearsOfTheKingdom #gamespot \n\nTears of the Kingdom is a massive game, and like Breath of the Wild, after the tutorial area, you can head off in any direction which can be overwhelming and there are extra things you can miss. We\u2019re here to help you navigate the starting area and get you ready for exploring Hyrule worry-free. Just keep in mind this covers the first 2-3 hours of the game, so early game spoiler warning here.\n\nAfter the beginning scripted section where you can\u2019t really deviate from the path, you\u2019re plopped down in the Great Sky Islands. You\u2019re going to want to first pick up the broken Master Sword, push the switch to open the door, and make your way through the tunnels. This Decayed Master Sword has very low durability, and if it breaks, it doesn\u2019t recharge. But it's not a huge deal, you will pick up other equipment very soon. Right before seeing the outside world, there\u2019s a treasure chest with a piece of armor inside waiting for you here, it\u2019s easy to overlook. Since the starting area enemies aren\u2019t pushovers, having extra armor reduces damage taken from half a heart to quarter heart and you won\u2019t need to use as many healing items. So don\u2019t miss it.\n\nThen head out into the Great Sky Islands main area, diving into the large pond below. Get yourself acclimated to the controls, and explore this small island for a couple tree branches and mushrooms. If you beat the construct on the left down the stairs, you can nab it's more powerful Wooden Stick on the altar behind it. Head over to the right and grab the Purah Pad from the Steward Construct. Look around for more loot, then go out to the platform and dive off into the pond below.\n\nFrom here you can explore the immediate area for a bit, scrounging materials, cooking and getting yourself acclimated to combat if you\u2019d like. The end goal though is to approach the Temple of Time, so after you\u2019ve gotten your fill of exploring this area, you can run from or take out the guard with the shield, and go ahead and approach the main building.\n\nAfter a short cutscene, Rauru will point you in the right direction, towards your very first shrine. But let's first explain the layout of what's happening now. While the multiple islands and land formations can be disorienting, your path right now is in a counterclockwise trip to several shrines around the island going higher and higher, unlike the Great Plateau in Breath of the Wild which allowed shrines to be completed in any order. There are going to be several optional side areas along the way that you\u2019re welcome to explore and loot as well, but we\u2019ll be focusing on the main path and getting you finished on the Great Sky Island. Just remember everything here can be easily revisited later with better traversal options,so there\u2019s no massive rush to figure out this entire island if you\u2019d rather progress the story.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:30 Great Sky Island Full Guide\n11:01 Paraglider Guide\n12:35 You're ready!\n12:52 Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mCJH1J8BFQ", "date_published": "2023-05-12 13:00:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Our Zelda Expert Gives His Thoughts On Tears of the Kingdom | GameSpot After Dark Ep 192", "description": "GameSpot's Zelda expert Max Blumenthal joins to talk about the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\n\n#tearsofthekingdom #gamespot #podcast \n\nSubscribe to the audio version!\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gamespot-after-dark/id1476085691\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/5qmuPYfpj7R7yHXEtKBocG", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9pQ0mY-1Nk", "date_published": "2023-05-12 00:52:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
