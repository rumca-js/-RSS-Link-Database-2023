Lauren Underwood: \u201cI think it\u2019s so ironic that everybody in my office is like \u201cOh f**k George Santos\u201d but at least he\u2019s being honest about his corruption.\u201d  \n\nElmore: \u201cEverybody is a liar. Between you and me I feel like my Member is lying about being a nurse.\u201d \n\nElmore: \u201cBeing a nurse is like clearly a good image for her. Like, caring about healthcare and like the middle class and health and like Covid and sh*t like that.\u201d \n\nElmore: \u201cLike she has a degree, and she was a nurse but I think the republicans kept getting her being like \u201coh what\u2019s your actual background\u201d so it\u2019s like messy.\u201d \n\n[WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 May 12, 2023] Project Veritas released a new video today showing a Legislative Correspondent for Illinois Congresswoman Lauren Underwood making troubling claims about Underwood\u2019s nursing resume and the scandals unfolding against New York Republican Congressman George Santos.  \n\nIn the May 10th video recording, Rep. Lauren Underwood\u2019s Legislative Correspondent, Clay Connor Elmore, is seen candidly speaking about the current state of corruption in Washington D.C., including admissions about his own boss: \n\nVeritas Journalist: Did [George] Santos f**k up? Big time. Do democrats do the same thing? \n\nElmore: Absolutely. Everybody is a liar. Between you and me I feel like my member is lying about being a nurse.  \n\nVeritas Journalist: Really? What do you mean? \n\nElmore: So her biggest thing is that she\u2019s a nurse right like that\u2019s her background she cares about like healthcare and like a nurse is a good way\u2026 she was like first, I think, democrat to actually win in her seat and she was a black woman so it\u2019s like a really big thing and being a nurse is like clearly good image for her like caring about healthcare and like the middle class and health and like Covid and sh*t like that even though like she has a degree and she was a nurse but I think the republicans kept getting her being like \u2018oh what\u2019s your actual background\u2019 so it\u2019s like messy but I think it\u2019s so ironic that everybody in my office is like \u2018oh f**k George Santos\u2019 but at least he\u2019s being honest about his corruption and like Nicki Minaj said that too because he put out a bill with her name on it and sh*t but\u2026 whatever. \n\nElmore also told our undercover journalist that there is job security in compromising his values to work with Rep. Underwood:  \n\nVeritas Journalist: What is the difference between Santos and your Rep? \n\nElmore: The difference between Santos and my member is that I\u2019m willing to compromise a lot of my values for this woman who\u2019s there for other black women than George Santos who doesn\u2019t have a lot of black women in his district. He is there just to flip New York. And I hate him, and I will call him out. But I remain - I\u2019ve very much not called out my member and a lot of that has to do with the fact that my security is there.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMbRuTDJjbU", "date_published": "2023-05-12 17:32:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
