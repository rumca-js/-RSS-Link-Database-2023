In 1997 the amateur club from north-west London – later absorbed into Barnet and now known as London Bees – went on a fairytale run, beating Doncaster Belles and Arsenal on the way to the final at Upton Park. There they lost 1-0 to a goal from Millwall’s Louise Waller in front of 3,015 people. “Of course it would have been nice to play at Wembley Stadium,” their manager, John Jones, said at the time. “But we have to be realistic. The place would be half-empty.”</p><p>Two decades earlier, in 1977, Queens Park Rangers beat Southampton 1-0 in the final at Champion Hill, the home of Dulwich Hamlet. For the first few years of the competition’s existence it was still battling the overt hostility of the men’s football establishment, and no Football League ground would agree to host it. As the winning goalscorer Carrie Staley celebrated with the trophy, a male newspaper photographer asked if she would put some lipstick on and kiss the Cup for him.

<p>One of the last hurrahs of the fixture played out on Friday with the youngsters largely given the run of the place</p><p>They were the last hurrahs for Eton v Harrow at Lord’s, loud enough that you could hear them from way down Wellington Road. From that distance it sounded rather like the place had been taken over by a couple of hundred schoolboys shouting out Ten German Bombers, which wasn’t quite right; the bombers in this particular version of the song were actually from Harrow. It was one of a series of chants, along with, a little later in the day, renditions of “No noise from the strawberry boys”, which was apparently aimed at the Etonians, and was met with a retort of “Twenty prime ministers”.</p><p>The two schools have been playing their annual match here since, well, before here was even here. The first game between them, in 1805, was held at the old Lord’s ground, down in Dorset Square. More than two centuries later, its time is just about up. MCC actually cancelled it last February but was forced to backtrack when a handful of members kicked up a stink over not being consulted first. So the club ran a survey to get a sense of the opinion among the membership. Among the 8,907 members who responded, 44% were in favour of keeping it and 43% were opposed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/12/eton-v-harrow-father-time-draws-near-for-annual-schoolboy-lords-jolly">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Tory housing policy: profits ahead of people | Editorial

<p>No 10 blocked a vote-winning proposal to end leaseholding – wary of picking a fight with wealthy donors</p><p>The leasehold system of property ownership in England and Wales is a feudal relic, a hangover from the <a href="https://communities.lawsociety.org.uk/property-commentary/leasehold-a-feudal-system-/5064029.article" title="">middle ages</a> when powerful families wanted to retain ownership of their land while maximising their earnings from it. In recent years it had seen homes created merely to provide an income for whoever owns the freehold. These archaic laws ought to be reformed out of existence. It was heartening that Michael Gove, the cabinet minister with responsibility for housing, agreed. But Downing Street has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/10/plans-abolish-feudal-leasehold-system-england-wales" title="">blocked</a> his proposal, wary of picking a fight with wealthy donors ahead of a general election.</p><p>This is a shortsighted move that confirms the Conservatives as being out of touch with ordinary people’s concerns. About a fifth of homes in England are leasehold properties, many of them flats in cities. Under such contracts, homeowners enter into long-term leases in which they must pay a yearly ground rent to freeholders. The scandal is that ground rents and service charges for maintenance can rise quickly to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64836421" title="">ridiculously</a> high levels. <a href="https://capx.co/if-the-tories-are-really-the-party-of-homeownership-reforming-our-feudal-leasehold-system-shoud-be-a-top-priority/" title="">Renters</a> are exploited too, as landlords pass on the costs of such profiteering by increasing rent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-tory-housing-policy-profits-ahead-of-people">Continue reading...</a>

Children’s illustrator whose picture books with his wife, Elizabeth, and authors such as Ted Hughes, are enjoyed worldwide<p>The illustrator Gerald Rose, who has died aged 87, was the youngest winner of the Kate Greenaway medal for children’s book illustration, in 1960. Then still in his mid-20s and barely out of art school, he would go on, often in partnership with his wife, Elizabeth, a writer, to become an influential artist in the field of children’s picture books. His painterly, playful and gently anarchic artwork continues to be enjoyed around the world.</p><p>The Greenaway medal (now renamed the Carnegie medal) was awarded for Rose’s illustrations to Old Winkle and the Seagulls. Written by Elizabeth and published by Faber, the book exemplifies Rose’s graphic ebullience and flair. It also embodies one of his recurrent themes and motifs, the coastal town (in this case Lowestoft, Suffolk), reflecting his lifelong association with the sea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/12/gerald-rose-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Trump’s grip on his party remains firm, with none of his putative rivals coming close. Of course, the first round of primary voting is months away and much could change, but the shape of the race is already clear – and Trump is dominant.

But their makers are, 8 May</a>). But her choice of language about how to describe the mistakes that the new AI makes seems to suggest she is committed mainly to providing an ideological interpretation of the new technology.</p><p>Saying that mistakes are the results of glitches in the code rather than the tech hallucinating suggests the simulation is a simple one, involving a kind of power of the false rather than a more complex one that allows the possibility of some form of fabulation. This is important because it means that the technology can’t be seen simply as a control technology, like nuclear fusion or self-driving cars, but instead indicates a switch to an adaptive form of technology, ie, ones that are based on adapting what is already out there rather than trying to reinvent what exists, as in some form of innovation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/12/we-need-ai-to-help-us-face-the-challenges-of-the-future">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Japanese twist on the classic mojito </p><p>While thinking about how to devise a refreshing summer cocktail, I took as a starting point our head chef Daniel McGeorge’s menu, which draws a huge amount of inspiration from Japanese cuisine, but is all sourced locally and seasonally. This twist on the classic mojito was the result. The yuzu gives it a lovely, citrus kick that is smoothed by the syrup and soda. If you like, make a slightly tarter drink by replacing the yuzu sake with 12½ml bottled yuzu juice and 12½ml extra white rum.</p><p>Craig Macfarlane, bar and restaurant manager, <a href="https://www.rothaymanor.co.uk/">Rothay Manor</a>, Ambleside, Cumbria</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/12/cocktail-of-the-week-rothay-manor-yuzuito-recipe">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London<br /></strong>GöteborgsOperans Danskompani’s versatile dancers tumble, slide and climb in Damien Jalet’s vertiginous piece then switch to more measured movements by Sharon Eyal</p><p>The last time Sweden’s GöteborgsOperans Danskompani performed at Sadler’s Wells, in Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/02/icon-review-antony-gormley-clay-goteborgsoperans-danskompani-sidi-larbi-cherkaoui-sadlers-wells-london">Icon</a>, they had three and a half tonnes of clay on stage with them, so this bold, cool and accomplished company are not afraid of a statement prop. This time it’s a dancefloor inclined at 34 degrees in Damien Jalet’s Skid. That’s a pretty steep slope, with graceful scuff marks on its white surface like fissures in a sheet of ice. A body emerges over the top and cedes to gravity, very slowly sliding, through a thick, swelling wall of sound by experimental electronic artist Christian Fennesz and Japanese composer Marihiko Hara.</p><p>Skid is an exercise in what can be done in this particular inhospitable terrain. Speed gradually increases, dancers start to tumble more intentionally and slide through each other’s legs. Then there’s the upward climb, a crouching march, the squeak of rubber soles digging in. We even get a naked body suspended on the wall in a kind of amniotic sac (or trapped in a pair of tan tights if you’re being less poetic about it). The idea of struggling against or surrendering to natural forces is a strong concept, but that drama doesn’t particularly materialise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/12/skid-saaba-review-sadlers-wells-london">Continue reading...</a>

## Tooth transplants and pickled penises: inside the revamped Hunterian

<p>The new look museum still contains John Hunter’s curiosities – from giant skeletons to toad births – but now acknowledges the ethical issues they pose</p><p>When he wasn’t wrestling his pet bull, slicing open the corpses of freshly hanged criminals, or studying the seasonal changes in sparrow testicles, John Hunter could be found probing the nether regions of female silk moths. The 18th-century surgeon, anatomist and all-round polymath was keen to find out if he could artificially inseminate the moths’ eggs by smearing them with male moths’ semen, using a tiny camel hairbrush. He could, and he did: eight eggs hatched successfully, in the first known example of IVF. “Thus then I ascertained,” he wrote, “that the eggs could be impregnated by art.” Emboldened by his findings, he went on to apply the same principle to humans, completing the first recorded artificial insemination in 1790, paving the way for modern fertility treatments.</p><p>The tiny moth eggs and silkworms – along with several human foetuses – are now displayed in little glass jars on shelves in <a href="https://hunterianmuseum.org/">the Hunterian Museum</a>, one of London’s most extraordinary attractions, which finally reopens next week after a six-year revamp. The £4.6m project, part of a wider <a href="https://www.hawkinsbrown.com/projects/the-royal-college-of-surgeons/">£100m redevelopment of the Royal College of Surgeons</a> on Lincoln’s Inn Fields by Hawkins Brown architects, has reinstated the museum to its original footprint and breathed dazzling new life into this fascinating cabinet of curiosities.<br /><br />It is not a place for the squeamish. More than 2,000 jars of pickled body parts – from brains and bladders to tumours and toes – now line either side of a long, atmospherically lit gallery, from which other rooms break off to tell the life story of the eccentric scientist.<br /><br />We learn about Hunter’s country house in the then-rural area of Earl’s Court, where he kept an astonishing menagerie of creatures that he would conduct experiments on – and flay open at the end of their lives. “On the right of the house is the conservatory for his bees,” one visitor remarked. “On the left artificial rocks on which live eagles were chained.” It was a <a href="https://rbkclocalstudies.wordpress.com/2016/06/23/forgotten-buildings-earls-court-house-and-dr-hunters-menagerie/">ghoulish Noah’s Ark</a>, populated by geese, pigeons, rabbits, pigs, opossums, hedgehogs, buffaloes, leopards, dormice, bats, snakes, deer, fish, frogs, leeches, eels and mussels, as well as a jackal, a zebra and an ostrich – most of which would meet a sticky end in his preservation jars. A grassy mound at the bottom of the garden, meanwhile, housed two dens of lions. None seemed to intimidate the great scalpel-wielder. When a pair of leopards once broke loose, according to a contemporary account in the Times, “Hunter appeared on the scene and without a moment’s reflection, seized both animals and chained them up in their cages.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/12/tooth-transplants-and-pickled-penises-inside-the-revamped-hunterian">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s a wine to go with just about everything you care to snack on, from anchovies and pizza to cheese and fried chicken</p><p>I was in Greece the other week for what I appreciate few of you would regard as work, and every winery we visited offered some kind of food at our tastings – usually a selection of cheeses, a few olives, assorted dips and spreads, and addictive, sesame-coated breadsticks. It’s much the same in Spain, but rare in the UK, where you’d be lucky to get so much as a water biscuit at a professional wine tasting. The theory seems to be that food somehow detracts from your ability to assess a wine, but why taste it in isolation when almost every reader will probably drink it with food?</p><p>Even if you’re not having a full meal, it’s nice to sit down in the evening with a glass and a snack of some kind. The Greeks and Lebanese have their meze/mezze, Spain has its tapas, and Venetians their <em>cichetti</em>, while even the French generally run to a few slices of saucisson and a cornichon or two. Wine is just so much nicer with a nibble, after all.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/12/wines-that-work-with-snacks-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Before playoff final against Chesterfield the winger discusses battling back from three ACL injuries and getting Verratti’s shirt</p><p>It is hard not to smile as Jodi Jones recounts the night before he fired Notts County to Wembley in the final seconds of extra time, a timely moment to score his first goal for the club. “I kept practising my penalty in the front room with my son’s little soft ball,” he says. “I was driving my missus crazy. She was saying: ‘Can you stop now? Because it’s actually making me nervous.’ I was saying to her: ‘And it’s Jones, he takes Notts to Wembley!’ I visualise everything. I try to picture it and take into existence. If you don’t believe, you’re not going to achieve.”</p><p>Although his decisive strike did not arrive from the penalty spot, the real-life scenario was nothing short of intoxicating drama. At half-time County, edged out of the sole automatic promotion place by Wrexham after an absorbing season-long title race, trailed 2-0 at home to Boreham Wood in their playoff semi-final. Jones entered with County trailing 2-1 and assisted a 96th-minute equaliser for Aden Baldwin to force extra time. Then, with penalties looming, Jones darted inside the box and arrowed in an extraordinary winner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/12/notts-county-jodi-jones-winning-goal-playoff-final-national-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One of the best restaurants within 100 miles or more</p><p>This week’s restaurant has been on my to-do list for about three years now, not least because it sounded so intriguing. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/homedumfries/?locale=en_GB">Home</a> in Dumfries offers a tasting menu with puzzling dish names such as “messy mozzarella”, “steak and lasagne” and “cheese and potato”, which read a bit as if a child had written out the courses for a pretend dinner party, though online reviews and <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186513-d11848386-Reviews-Home_Restaurant-Dumfries_Dumfries_and_Galloway_Scotland.html">photographs</a> of the food suggest that the place is actually rather fancy, as well as much loved.</p><p>Still, it was sidelined in my rush to the shiny, new, big-city openings of Glasgow or Edinburgh. Or Aberdeen or Inverness or, well, anywhere apart from Dumfries. This Scottish town of 30,000 is not terribly far from England, so it tends to fly under the radar for both tourists and fellow Scots, who perhaps feel it’s “not Scottish enough”, which is is flagrant nonsense. Circa 1605, James I of England and VI of Scotland, ever the optimist, decreed that the vast border area taking in the likes of Cumberland, Dumfriesshire, Selkirkshire and Northumberland, should be called the Middle Shires. This new, inclusive, touchy-feely name for the Borders would reflect the cosy unity between the two countries he planned to usher in during the 17th century. Scotland? England? Who cares? Lines on maps wouldn’t matter – we could all come together as one!

Like the British reluctance to watch US commentary for football matches, no one’s first choice for the coronation was the American networks. Savannah Guthrie in London for NBC News wore a lace-effect top that – nothing like a royal event to flush out one’s most unacceptable opinions – I thought was frankly inappropriate, and the NBC correspondents ran around with huge grins (also inappropriate). Needs must, however, and as it became clear that the BBC, tugging its forelock practically out by the roots, was going to skimp on shots of Prince Harry, it was necessary to switch channels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/12/digested-week-trump-de-niro-not-helping-my-coronation-hangover">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this week’s newsletter: Ask anyone if they’ve seen Amazon’s fake trial mockumentary where everyone is acting except for one poor juror, and you’ll unfairly be met with blank stares</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://ablink.email.theguardian.com/ss/c/TBl-lE0k4WbTlFRn6v-lQXxTpTslqnvUsR2ofAkC00vqkHXqakTSxrykj9mrdACFM7X02zB_4eaUcPGwGF8aSd8qfug3UI-6On7SZ6NCb1bc8x_o5dndnbkzvJa5hUkQ9nhvD7IJSuyXeKbacJDYEqlFbAZ0vOIKsv3NFHydfPIzaUpYyjP0KfOAhLRYMW2yTAs6TBIgM3bi7aVl__6M8OuHfLZfd7xmigDS_KOnKuU_bc0LD-KQTnN7wlkHVqzvlJ18crhTOgngZzAlM4_3_SCUmWonlgL50tNfCaUIQQk/3hx/2l-ct5r6Q8CNEhlq1hSBIw/h15/kSGp0pNCsCxOwXsdDM-fI8ISkKBb6hYjBXPF16gxdC8">Don’t get the Guide delivered to your inbox?

I have been trying to figure this out ever since Jury Duty dropped in April, on Amazon Freevee (it’s like Prime but it’s free-with-adverts, so if you have Prime it’s just free, and if you don’t have Prime it’s free-with-adverts. Perhaps we have already peeled one layer of onion skin away from this problem).</p><p>Maybe it is the unassuming name of it: Jury Duty, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/10/couples-therapy-nothing-can-prepare-you-for-this-startling-fly-on-the-wall-tv">like Couples Therapy before it</a>, a title so straightforwardly descriptive dissimulates the jewel hidden within. Maybe it’s because it got bad reviews, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/05/jury-duty-review-james-marsden">like this one in the Guardian</a>. I say this as a critic: we really must stop listening to critics. There is another problem, I think: there is just <em>so much TV these days</em>, across a huge number of platforms and sub-platforms, and no one on Earth can watch all of them at once. Jury Duty – deeply unfairly, I think – seems to have fallen victim to that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/12/the-guide-jury-duty-amazon-freevee">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Should I sleep in my underwear? Do nice ‘sexy’ knickers exist? Are period pants worth a try? Our experts get to the bottom of your undie-related queries</p><p>Undies, smalls, panties. For something as universally worn as knickers, buying them is a strangely confusing experience. The main issue is sizing: you can’t try them on and, given there is no industry standardisation, it’s essentially pot luck.</p><p>But it’s also about what we need from them at any given time. Maybe you’ve just given birth, maybe you’ve got your period, or maybe you’ve finally got back into those jeans but don’t have anything to wear underneath. The idea of having a wardrobe of knicker styles for every occasion seems ludicrous but, equally, there is no one size fits all.

## Rapper NF: ‘In the Christian world everyone wants to pretend everything is OK’

<p>The Nashville-based artist has attracted a huge audience with his deeply personal rhymes about depression, trauma and ‘the Almighty’ – just don’t call him a Christian rapper</p><p>The week I meet Nashville-based rapper Nathan John Feuerstein, AKA NF, at his Tennessee home in April, his latest record – Hope – hits No 2 in both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK album chart, as well as in Australia, Canada and Norway, and No 1 in the Netherlands. He has form: his last two albums topped the US charts. This summer, he will embark on a 30-date North America arena tour; each show on its October European leg has already sold out. The walls of the home studio space in the outskirts of America’s Music City are lined with platinum records from across the globe. Yet, despite his evident success, the 32-year-old musician is something of an unknown entity; elusive, with little name recognition beyond his loyal fanbase. Rarely will you hear his music on the radio; his latest album received little by way of media fanfare or reviews. And, lying back on a large cream sofa, he says he likes it that way.</p><p>“In the music industry the perception of how big artists are, and how big they really are, is often really different,” Feuerstein says. “Most people would say I’m small. I might be under the radar, and rarely have my day-to-day life interrupted, but I can come to your city and sell 10,000 tickets, and release albums that sell. I’d rather have a touring business and a culty fanbase behind the scenes – be actually killing it – than have people <em>think</em> I’m killing it. The way I look at it, I have the best of both worlds.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/12/nf-rapper-interview">Continue reading...</a>

Stewart, whose left foot fired Ipswich into Europe, has lost grip in his left hand since being diagnosed with motor neurone disease last year. “I went on the bike this morning, but only indoors; I was on Zwift. I don’t have to brake, so it’s pretty good,” he says, smiling.</p><p>Stewart, who grew up in south Bristol, made his name across town at Rovers before fruitful spells at Huddersfield, Ipswich and Sunderland.

<p>The Harvard academic on writing while grieving – and where his country goes from here</p><p>Before my first reporting trip to Ukraine, one of my seasoned war correspondent colleagues had two pieces of advice. First, not to miss the delicious coffee and pastries you can find in Kyiv (which is a wonderfully reassuring thing to hear as you head off towards a conflict). Second, that it was absolutely necessary to read Serhii Plokhy’s 2015 book <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-gates-of-europe-9780141980614" title="">The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine</a>. I did, and it unwound 2,500 years of complex, fascinating and often tragic events, all the way from Herodotus’s accounts of the ancient Scythians to the Maidan protests in Kyiv a decade ago. Now Plokhy and I are speaking by Zoom – me from London, he from his home near Harvard, where he is professor of Ukrainian history. He’s in his study. There are globes on every surface, and antique maps of Ukraine hang on the walls.</p><p>Plokhy, 65, is a genial presence – calm, expansive, gently humorous, not given to grandstanding – exactly how you might imagine and want a history professor to be. However, his latest project is anything but conventional historiography. He begins <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-russo-ukrainian-war-9780241617359" title="">The Russo-Ukrainian War</a>, his new book, by recalling the moment he picked up his phone and checked his emails, early on 24 February last year. He was in Vienna. One email from a Harvard colleague, with whom he’d been discussing the prospect of an all-out invasion, hoped he was OK. “I was not OK,” he writes. Aside from anything, his sister and her family were in Zaporizhzhia, the south-eastern city where he’d grown up. By the time he called her, she could already hear the pounding of Russian artillery. He describes how he dressed carefully, that first morning, putting on a shirt and a blazer for a visit to some archives – “to show that I was collected and prepared to carry out my duties, whatever they might be”. The book ends with an afterword that pays heartbreaking tribute to his cousin, killed in October near Bakhmut.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/12/historian-serhii-plokhy-the-russo-ukrainian-war">Continue reading...</a>

Expect many more of these confessions – this one sneaked out under cover of loudly announced plans to try to improve access to GPs.</p><p>What chance of any significant cut before the next general election to the gigantic waiting list? Ask health economists and analysts, and the outlook is grim. “Vanishingly small,” says Anita Charlesworth, the director of research and economic analysis at the Health Foundation. “Close to zero,” says Nigel Edwards, head of the Nuffield Trust. “I have no doubt they will miss their targets, with more than 10% of the population waiting for treatment.”</p><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/12/nhs-waiting-lists-inflation-rishi-sunak-national-debt-tory">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Madmcferrin Music)</strong><br />The Brooklyn singer (and daughter of Bobby McFerrin) conjures moments of spine-tingling atmosphere, but struggles to truly distinguish herself</p><p>Nepo babies are all the rage, but few families have a business as niche as the McFerrins. Jazz vocalist Bobby is best known as the singer of Don’t Worry, Be Happy, the first a cappella song to top the US charts. More than three decades later, his daughter Madison picked up the baton, releasing two vocal-only EPs that looped and layered her voice into a faintly retro melange of soul and R&amp;B.</p><p>It’s fair to say that the younger McFerrin’s work is significantly less grating than the single that made her father’s name – a track widely considered to be among the most irritating of all time – yet she is no stranger to scorn: in 2016, her out-of-tune performance of the national anthem at a Hillary Clinton campaign rally was met with mockery online.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/12/madison-mcferrin-i-hope-you-can-forgive-me-review-an-elegant-and-intricate-debut-lp">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The team behind 30 Rock offer up a cartoon dystopia about an alien invasion that leaves the idiots ruling the Earth – but where are the gags? Frankly, this just won’t do</p><p>Mulligan is the answer to the question – what would happen if you took the film Idiocracy, added a dash of Will Forte’s The Last Man on Earth and made it an adult animated TV series and also worse? That it is a new project from the same stable as 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (co-created by Robert Carlock, the power with Tina Fey behind those phenomenal gagfests, and Sam Means – a writer on both – and executive produced by Fey herself) makes the disappointment all the greater.</p><p>The premise is fertile. Aliens attack Earth and are thwarted at the last moment by dumb jock Matty Mulligan (Nat Faxon) doing his best to emulate Independence Day’s solution to a similar problem by chucking a hand grenade into the main spaceship’s vent. Thus are the last 1,132 humans on Earth saved and faced with the question of how to rebuild civilisation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/12/mulligan-review-tina-fey-is-a-post-apocalypse-liz-lemon">Continue reading...</a>

It’s not lost on me that this is special.”</p><p>It’s been a long road for Lysette to her first role as a leading lady.

<p>Just three years ago Fairburn Tower, near Inverness, was a roofless wreck. Now it has been restored to its former renaissance glory and is available as a holiday let</p><p>“The day will come when the Mackenzies of Fairburn shall lose their entire possessions … Their castle shall become uninhabited, desolate and forsaken, and a cow shall give birth to a calf in the uppermost chamber of Fairburn Tower.” So prophesied Coinneach Odhar Fiosaiche, Scotland’s own Nostradamus, back in the 17th century.</p><p>Located amid farmland a pleasant five-mile stroll from Muir of Ord station in the Scottish Highlands – just half an hour’s drive north-west of Inverness – Fairburn Tower has had a remarkable turnaround in its fortunes. Only three years ago, it was just as Fiosaiche predicted: a roofless, floorless wreck, the cracks running up its walls threatening to bring the whole edifice crashing down once and for all. That’s when the building conservation charity the Landmark Trust intervened. A phalanx of highly skilled craftspeople set to work, restoring the tower to the time of the Stewarts and the glories of the Scottish renaissance. The walls were repaired; the floors, roof, casement windows and spiral staircase reinstalled; and the bartizans (overhanging turrets) reconstructed. Finally, a pink limed-based harl was applied, giving the whole structure the look of a rosy sunset (or, if you prefer, sunrise), as if it had leapt straight out of a Sir Walter Scott novel. Now available as a holiday let for four, it’s occasionally open to the public to visit too – for the first time this Sunday (and it’s free).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/12/how-a-derelict-scottish-tower-was-turned-into-a-sumptuous-retreat">Continue reading...</a>

She is telling me about lockdown in Ibiza, where she lives with her partner and two children. “It was lovely to have the island so clean and quiet, driving along the salt flats, nobody around. Except they sent the Guardia Civil [Spain’s national gendarmerie] to Ibiza – they really clamped down. You couldn’t walk your dogs, you couldn’t smoke on the street. There were policemen with machine guns. So you were between this magical place with no people in it and this background feedback, like white noise, of authoritarianism.”</p><p>The experience was, she says, “like living in a JG Ballard book”.

<p>There’s a rock-solid plot to this New York-set thriller about a college student’s shooting. It’s full of great performances that plunge you into the city’s myriad possibilities for good – and evil</p><p>Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, the creators of Apple TV+’s new drama, City on Fire, have applied brutal but almost certainly correct methods to adapting their source material. They have ruthlessly carved out the thriller that was embedded in Garth Risk Hallberg’s self-indulgently baggy 2015 novel of the same name. They have also relocated the action from Christmas 1976 – eve of the New York blackout on 12 July 1977 and the festival of looting and arson that transpired – to 18 months after 9/11, the volatility of the 70s replaced by the jittery aftermath of the terrorist attack. I suspect this is because it is a time that Schwartz and Savage (best known for their work on Gossip Girl and The OC) knew better and felt more comfortable recreating. Or maybe it was cheaper and even Apple TV+ doesn’t have an unlimited budget.</p><p>Whatever the reason, it works well as the backdrop to a story that centres round the shooting of a college student in Central Park and gradually opens up to involve disparate characters from a cross-section of New York society. As detectives pursue leads on multiple suspects, it gives us an An Inspector Calls-on-steroids look at the interconnectedness of people and their actions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/12/city-on-fire-review-like-an-inspector-calls-on-steroids">Continue reading...</a>
