It's the cresting of a wave, in a sense, but no more inherently vital than the accumulating swell period, or the ensuing glide. For Aftab and her equal partners in the project, every musical offering arises from a slow-motion flutter of collective actions, which renders each passing moment unique.\n\nThat's a fanciful way of saying what the music invites you to understand at gut level: this group makes music strictly for the moment, creating a shared language in real time. As its members explained this spring, before the release of their entrancing self-titled debut, this highwire creative model is rooted in acute listening and mutual trust. Whatever the gesture \u2014 when Iyer plays a somber, strobing figure on Fender Rhodes piano, for example, or Ismaily wobbles a line on electric bass \u2014 it can be seen as an invitation. This performance, a marvel of concision by Love in Exile standards, extends a similar courtesy to any receptive ear.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Eyes Of The Endless\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nVijay Iyer: Fender Rhodes, piano\nArooj Aftab: vocals \nShahzad Ismaily: bass, Moog\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen \nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Kara Frame, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Joshua Bryant, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galv\u00e1n, Jill Britton\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #vijayiyer #aroojaftab #shahzadismaily", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6QNNxCf-3s", "date_published": "2023-05-12 09:00:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
