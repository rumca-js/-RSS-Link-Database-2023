Luton returned to the top flight for the first time since 1992 courtesy of a 6-5 shootout victory in the Championship playoff final against Coventry.</p><p>Jordan Clark opened the scoring in the first half before Gus Hamer, who was later forced off with injury, scored a fine equaliser. But the game went to penalties after a nervy period of extra time. Luton had one of the smallest budgets in the Championship – smaller than some League One clubs – but promotion caps an extraordinary and unprecedented rise. If Luton were to survive in their first season back in the top flight, promotion is estimated to be worth £270m.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/27/luton-fans-have-seen-some-dark-times-so-its-great-we-can-give-them-a-smile">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After 14 years, Polly was a part of Robert Dessaix’s family. One day after her death, the writer grapples with grief and what it is to love a dog</p><p>We are a threesome. The most wonderful thing in the world for me – the most joyful, vivifying, meaningful, precious thing in the world – is my tiny family: Peter Timms, the dog and me. We are the only family any of us has. The dog is not a child, of course, nor a mere companion, nor even our “best friend”. The dog is our dog. The dog is our anchor. We love each other, Peter and I, anchored by our dog (we’ve had four). I can see that now. It has taken me all my life to see this. And I held out my arms in front of me in utter impotence with my fingers touching to try to hold us all in.</p><p>Polly died yesterday, you see. It is unbearable. I am not saying this for the sake of it: I cannot bear the acute sadness. I cannot bear the memories of yesterday before three o’clock or last week or ten years ago or 15. I cannot bear saying goodbye to Polly Timms forever. That’s the point, as it is when we kiss or wave or say goodbye to any loved being: it’s for the rest of time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/28/what-is-a-dog-then-on-the-unbearable-death-of-my-dog-polly">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This time Rob Edwards could celebrate. The Luton manager had hared off down the touchline with four minutes of extra time to go to celebrate what he thought was the winning goal in front of the Luton supporters, eating up 45 yards of Wembley turf, only to retreat to his technical area ashen-faced after glancing up at the big screen confirming Joseph Taylor’s strike, which would have been his first for the club, had been disallowed for handball. Jonathan Panzo, on cold as a substitute, dawdled on the ball and Taylor, a 20-year-old on his sixth appearance, nicked it from the Coventry defender, but surged through on goal with the help of his right hand.</p><p>Edwards covered his face in embarrassment but an agonising penalty shootout followed and Fankaty Dabo missed the crucial spot-kick as Luton won promotion to the Premier League at Coventry’s expense, winning 6-5 on penalties. Up in the stands, there were tears of joy for Luton’s chief executive, among many at the club who have been on their journey from non-league until this point. Until Dabo’s miss, the penalties had been immaculate. Dabo was inconsolable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/27/luton-promoted-to-premier-league-after-shootout-victory-against-coventry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Irish novelist on his wife’s response to his darkly comic new book, the ghosts that haunt his country, his love of Thomas Pynchon and distrust of Dickens</p><p>Paul Murray was born in 1975 and raised in south Dublin. He finished his first novel, <em>An Evening of Long Goodbyes</em>, while doing a creative writing MA at the University of East Anglia. He followed this with the blackly comic <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/28/skippy-dies-by-paul-murray-review">Skippy Dies</a></em>, longlisted for the Booker prize in 2010, and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/22/the-mark-and-the-void-by-paul-murray-review">The Mark and the Void</a></em> five years later. His latest novel, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-bee-sting-9780241353950">The Bee Sting</a></em>, tracks the unravelling of a family in Ireland’s Midlands – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/neelmukherjee">Neel Mukherjee</a> has described it as “generous, expansive and glorious as a cathedral”. It is also darkly hilarious. Murray spoke to me from Dublin, where he lives with his wife and son.</p><p><strong>Reading </strong><em><strong>The Bee Sting</strong></em><strong>, I was impressed by your knowledge of Midlands car dealerships, gay clubs, survivalists and the interior life of teenage girls, among many other things. Which was hardest to come by?<br /></strong>They were all difficult in their own ways. One thing I’ve got better at as I get older is just listening to people. People have crazy lives. The stuff that happens to – quote-unquote – ordinary folks is very operatic. So I gathered stories as I went along. I’ve got a couple of friends who have connections to car dealerships – it’s a big deal to own a car dealership in the Midlands. In the 90s, when I was in college, gay clubs were starting up. Some of my gay friends were still in the closet, so for them that was a very powerful experience. It was really exciting, the idea that you could be transformed as a person.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/27/paul-murray-i-just-dumped-all-my-sadness-into-the-book-the-bee-sting">Continue reading...</a>

A reworked Victorian house in the Irish capital pairs minimalism with glamour<p>Maria Abou Khalife is a linguist who describes her home as having two styles – perhaps, like herself, it is multilingual. One style speaks to her sleek and minimalist side, influenced by the years she spent living in Copenhagen, the other style is full-on glamour, articulated with the help of interior designer <a href="https://www.suziemcadam.com/" title="">Suzie McAdam</a>. The glamorous drawing room is the room that sold the property to Maria. She describes it as a jewel box: “The detailed cornicing on the high ceiling is beautiful. It needed a complete overhaul, but the Victorian property had what we were looking for.” The couple, while reticent, could envisage the potential.</p><p>The room is painted in Farrow &amp; Ball Calamine Pink now, with an impressive Il Pezzo Mancante chandelier at its centre and matching wall lights that contrast playfully with the traditional elements. It also features a distinctive stained glass window that they’re particularly pleased with. “We are the only house on the street with this bird design and we were told it had been a wedding present the original owner had received.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/27/style-languages-combine-in-a-dublin-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To understand how ChatGPT will infiltrate the world, cast your mind back to Google’s decision to map the entire planet</p><p>Cheered by the news that OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, had released <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios">a free iPhone app</a> for the language model, I went to the Apple app store to download it, only to find that it was nowhere to be found. This is because – as I belatedly discovered – it’s currently only available via the US app store and will be rolled out to other jurisdictions in due course. Despite that, though, the UK store was positively groaning with “ChatGPT” apps – of which I counted 25 before losing the will to live.</p><p>For example, there’s AI Chat – Chatbot AI Assistant (“Experience the power of AI! Create Essays, Emails, Resumes or Any Text!”). Or how about ChatGPro (“The Best AI Chat of 2023”)? Or Chat AI – Ask Open Chatbot (“The ultimate AI chat app that can assist you with anything and everything you need”)? Anything and everything, eh? And so on, <em>ad infinitum</em>. Interestingly, while the official OpenAI app is free, all of these cheery parasites, though free to download, require in-app purchases once you are enmeshed in their clutches. Same thing over in the Android universe, where something similar is under way, except that you find even more AI wannabes there than on the rarefied heights of the Apple store.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/27/ai-will-be-everywhere-but-its-rise-will-be-mundane-not-apocalyptic-chatgpt">Continue reading...</a>

That’s according to a new study, which found that between 25% and 70% of California beaches might be washed away by the end of the century, leaving only cliffs or coastal infrastructure in their wake.</p><p>The study used satellite data collected over the past two decades to examine California’s 1,100-mile-long coast. Researchers from the US Geological Survey (USGS) used those satellite images, combined with models of climate crisis-driven sea level rise ranging from 1.6 to 10ft, to estimate the shape and position of the state’s coastline by 2100. The amount of sea level rise will depend on how much carbon is pumped into the atmosphere now and in the future.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/27/california-beaches-erosion-2100-study">Continue reading...</a>

## The Little Mermaid review – bland but good-natured Disney remake

<p>It doesn’t have the magic of the original, but Halle Bailey gives a winning performance, backed by a strong supporting cast </p><p>News that Disney’s live-action(ish) remake of its 1989 animated hit <em>The Little Mermaid</em> would star African American musician and actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/halle-bailey-the-little-mermaid-interview-as-a-child-seeing-a-black-ariel-would-have-changed-my-life">Halle Bailey</a> provoked the racist #NotMyAriel hashtag, with Fox News-fed “replacement theory” wingnuts philosophically frottering themselves into a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/15/little-mermaid-disney-trailer-culture-war-ariel-black-white">frenzy of fear and loathing</a>.</p><p>Yet now that the film is finally upon us, it’s hard to imagine how something so utterly innocuous – not to say bland – could have caused such upset. OK, so this doesn’t have the timeless cartoon magic of the original (be honest, what “live-action” Disney remake <em>does</em>?), and the two-and-a-quarter hour running time is stretching a point. It’s functionally good-natured rehash fare, bogged down by some watery CG and a few uncomfortable dips into “uncanny valley”, yet buoyed up by Bailey’s winning titular performance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/27/the-little-mermaid-review-bland-but-good-natured-disney-remake-halle-bailey">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Retreating further and further behind the baseline to return serve on clay has become a notable trend in men’s tennis</p><p>As Alejandro Davidovich Fokina took to the court last month to face his fellow Spaniard, Albert Ramos Viñolas, at the Madrid Open it soon became clear he had a slight problem.</p><p>Between the lines, all modern tennis courts measure the same, but the distances beyond them vary dramatically. The outside courts in Madrid had very little room behind the baseline and were narrow, a problem for a player such as Davidovich Fokina who enjoys returning serve from deep on clay. His attempts to return serve left the linesmen diving out of the way and led to numerous near misses with the back fence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/27/rolling-in-the-deep-why-tennis-players-are-backing-off-against-serve">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Pryzm, Kingston upon Thames<br /></strong>In a low-key gig ahead of her highly anticipated second album, the Mercury-winning singer-songwriter reaffirms her gift for observation – but her words deserve richer musical backing</p><p>We hear <a href="https://www.arloparksofficial.com/">Arlo Parks</a> before we see her. The singer-songwriter emerges from the gloom at the back of this south-west London club’s stage words-first, speaking more than singing – her soft tones recognisable, even before we glimpse her Nine Inch Nails <em>The Downward Spiral</em> T-shirt and red-tinged, close-cropped hair. “I wish I was bruiseless,” Parks begins. Her band add some loose breakbeats and an intriguing jazzy thrum to a track that is the opening to her new album, <em>My Soft Machine</em>. “Almost everyone I love has been abused/ And I am included.”</p><p>Parks has been out of sight for some time, putting the finishing touches to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYiOV8yRRE4">her highly anticipated second full-length outing,</a> released this week. But the first few seconds of her re-emergence at this low-key gig could not be a more succinct reminder of her appeal: the way she plants emotional depth charges inside a deceptively easygoing musical manner. We learn, too, as Bruiseless spools out, that she is “listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASg275COMjg">Loomer</a>” (by My Bloody Valentine) – and that “the person I love is feeding me cheese, and I’m happy”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/27/arlo-parks-pryzm-kingston-upon-thames-review-sharp-eyes-but-soft-sounds-my-soft-machine">Continue reading...</a>

In the event’s closing stage it’s overtaken by others. How long does this last? What time does it end? As the clock ticks towards midnight, the invited guests start to flag. The heart remains willing but the flesh is now weak.</p><p>If the ticket holders outside the Palais have begun to move in the manner of tired pensioners, they find kindred spirits of sorts in many of the event’s biggest names. Octogenarians dominated the red carpet this year, from Harrison Ford to Martin Scorsese, Marco Bellocchio to Ken Loach, while the average age of Ruben Östlund’s jury is nearly 20 years younger than that of the directors at work in the main competition.

<p>It has been the TV drama of our time – a brutal, hilarious unpicking of how power works. As the series comes to an end, its creator looks back at its origin and the unholy trinity of men who helped inspire Logan Roy</p><p>My first vivid memory of the project that would develop into Succession was trying to get out of it. It was about 2008 and I was on location for the filming of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/apr/16/peepshowisthebestcomedyo" title="">Peep Show</a>, the UK sitcom my longtime writing partner Sam Bain and I wrote together. Between that show and my work on The Thick of It and In the Loop, and a bunch of other things, I was feeling overcommitted. That particular day we were pretending a very normal field in Hertfordshire was a safari park. I sloped off from set and, hiding from imaginary lions, tried to elegantly step away from the project.</p><p>I failed. And in the following months as I wrote, slowly, I became certain the script was a dud. It was stodgy and odd. The original idea, a faux-documentary laying out Rupert Murdoch’s business secrets, with them delivered straight to camera, evolved as I worked into a sort of TV play, set at the media owner’s 80th birthday party. Channel 4 were supportive, but it was an odd form, this docudrama/TV-play, and difficult to make happen. Around 2011, after a read-through in London where John Hurt played Rupert, the project essentially died.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/27/jesse-armstrong-on-the-roots-of-succession-bum-rush-trump-presidency">Continue reading...</a>

## The week in classical: Wozzeck; Don Giovanni – Christian Gerhaher and Anja Kampe thrill in five-star Berg

<p><strong>Royal Opera House, London; Glyndebourne, East Sussex</strong><br />Direction and music are as one in Deborah Warner’s gripping new Royal Opera production, while a fine young cast redeems thoughtful if low-key Mozart</p><p>Spinning in its own orbit, as it seems on every fresh encounter, Alban Berg’s <strong><a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/wozzeck-by-deborah-warner-details">Wozzeck</a></strong> (1925) resembles no other opera. Voices sing, speak, shout in myriad ways, exactingly specified by the composer. The score flickers through every style, a lurching waltz or honky-tonk piano parachuting in to save you when Berg’s atonal harmonies have left you stranded. Based on Georg Büchner’s play <em>Woyzeck</em>, the plot is blunt and brutal. A soldier murders the mother of his child, then drowns himself.</p><p>Bad stagings of the opera are rare, but some reach different levels of expression. The new production at the Royal Opera House, conducted by Antonio Pappano, directed by Deborah Warner, is in that category. On first night cast, chorus, orchestra, sounded faultless. From onstage bands to section solos to the voluptuous interludes that shape the work, every aspect was compulsive, shadowy, glinting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/27/wozzeck-royal-opera-deborah-warner-christian-gerhaher-anje-kampe-pappano-review-don-giovanni-glyndebourne">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The musician and writer on bringing ‘devil art’ to the home counties – and learning to embrace his dad’s legacy</p><p></p><p>Born in 1971, Baxter Dury is a musician and author of the memoir Chaise Longue. The son of the Blockheads’ frontman Ian Dury and artist Betty Rathmell, Baxter released his first EP in 2002, 25 years after appearing on the cover of his father’s hit debut solo album, New Boots and Panties!! He has since put out seven albums of sharply observed experimental indie, including I Thought I Was Better Than You, released on 2 June. He plays at the Roundhouse in London on 18 October.</p><p><strong>I have a ghostly</strong>, tunnel-visioned impression of the moment this photograph was taken for the album cover. I was quite a curious kid with hybrid interests, so I’m in flares and what look like football boots. There’s a fair bit of mythology generated around the shot because Dad was a bullshitter, and consequently so am I, but the recollection I have of that day is that he said: “I’m getting my picture taken. Come along with me.” Being bored, I went. I walked into the shot and said: “Can we go now?” There were four frames taken, and he decided it would become the album cover. That was that. It’s my only memory of being five, which is weird. (The images shown here feature the original album cover photograph retouched to include a portrait by Sir Peter Blake for a tribute album released in 2001 after Ian Dury’s death.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/27/baxter-dury-on-making-the-cover-of-ian-durys-new-boots-and-panties-i-walked-into-the-shot-and-said-can-we-go-now">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Contrasting works by Glass, Heggie, Turnage and Tan Dun provide a fine showcase for Hope and his ensemble, while Benjamin Baker and Daniel Lebhardt explore the turbulent 1910s</p><p>• <strong><a href="https://danielhope.com/">Daniel Hope</a></strong>, violinist and music director of the <strong>New Century Chamber Orchestra</strong>, calls his new album with the orchestra, <strong><a href="https://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/catalogue/products/music-for-a-new-century-hope-12979">Music for a New Century</a></strong> (Deutsche Grammophon), “a portrait of composition in postmodern times”. This is a deft way of explaining why four wholly diverse works have been programmed together, all commissioned or co-commissioned by Hope and his ensemble.</p><p>Philip Glass’s Piano Concerto No 3, soloist Alexey Botvinov, shows the composer at his most (or perhaps too) liquid and mellifluous. Overture, by Glass’s compatriot Jake Heggie, explores jaunty strings lines and syncopations in the tradition of an American predecessor, Aaron Copland. Tan Dun’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh7GG0Qgyg">Double Concerto</a> – a scaling down of his triple concerto, now for violin, piano, strings and percussion – is invigorating and evocative in its mixing of Chinese and western musical styles. Mark-Anthony Turnage’s Lament, as melancholy as its title suggest, provides a powerful vehicle for Hope’s virtuosity. You could object to the narrowness of the choices – it is, inevitably, a partial portrait of a vast subject – or you could enjoy it on its own terms, which I did.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/27/daniel-hope-music-for-a-new-century-new-century-chamber-orchestra-botvinov-review-1919-coda-janacek-boulanger-debussy-elgar-benjamin-baker-daniel-lebhardt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From a youthful hook-up with the Rolling Stones to crafting his bleakly brilliant final album, three extracts from an exhaustive new biography offer the most nuanced portrait to date of the 70s singer-songwriter</p><p>For a singer-songwriter who only made three albums, Nick Drake continues to cast a long shadow. A mixture of extreme shyness and difficulties with mental health meant that his beautiful, meditative and deeply melancholic take on mystical English folk slipped through the commercial cracks during his lifetime. There is no known footage of him performing live and very few interviews exist. Drake died from an overdose of antidepressants in 1974, aged just 26, but since his death, his music has found new audiences as successive generations have discovered an enigmatic but immaculate body of work.</p><p>Now a new biography of Drake, by the journalist Richard Morton Jack, offers a definitive version of a life story previously shrouded in mystery and, eventually, clouded by tragedy. Containing unseen photos, previously unreleased correspondence and the insights of the people who knew Drake best, it provides a rounded portrait of an artist whose recorded works continue to beguile and resonate. In these exclusive extracts, we see the light and shade of Drake: his problems are laid bare, but so is his exquisite artistry. <strong>Phil Harrison</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/27/nick-drake-the-life-richard-morton-jack-biography-extracts">Continue reading...</a>

Stabbed by ghosts, lanced by knights, or executed by gangsters. You fall down mineshafts, off cliffs, into wormholes, and perish in every conceivable natural catastrophe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/27/how-choose-your-own-adventures-helped-me-win-the-booker-prize">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ham radio users, from teenagers to eightysomethings, are ready to communicate in the next crisis – be it a wildfire, pandemic or ‘the big one’</p><p>There’s an ancient fable that Glenn Morrison, a pony-tailed, 75-year-old who lives in the California desert, likes to tell to prove a point. As the lesson goes, one industrious ant readies for winter by stocking up on food and supplies, while an aimless grasshopper wastes time and doesn’t plan ahead. When the cold weather finally arrives, the ant is “fat and happy”, but the grasshopper starves.</p><p>In this telling, Morrison is the ant, and those who don’t brace themselves for future emergencies – they’re the grasshoppers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/27/ham-radio-emergency-natural-disaster-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

## The Wembley Point mystery: who was the woman who jumped to her death?

<p>One October morning in 2004, a woman took the lift to the 21st floor of an office block in north-west London, bought a coffee in the cafe there – then opened a window and jumped out. No one knew who she was. Do they now?</p><p>On 29 October 2004, a young woman walked into Wembley Point, a distinctive triangular office block in the outer reaches of north-west London. The 21-storey tower slices into the sky, a lattice of windows and white and bronze panelling. More than double the height of any other building in the vicinity, it is surrounded by a large car park and situated on an intersection: the roaring traffic of the North Circular on one side, the off-licences and chicken shops of Harrow Road on the other. Below, next to the tower, the dull water of the River Brent flows past, edged by graffitied walls and crossed by two concrete footbridges. There is not much nearby: a couple of office buildings, a carpet shop, Stonebridge Park underground station. It is not the kind of place you visit unless you have a reason.</p><p>The woman was black, petite – somewhere between 5ft 1in and 5ft 3in, police would later say – and dressed smartly in a thin black polo neck under a claret crew neck and a maroon bomber jacket. The autumn weather was starting to bite and she wore tights under her black trousers, with a pair of black Skechers shoes. On her wrist was a simple silver watch, which offset her two silver rings, one of which had a shell shape. She had with her a plastic carrier bag and a large oil painting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/27/the-wembley-point-mystery-who-was-the-woman-who-jumped-to-her-death">Continue reading...</a>

The chicken comes out of the pot all golden and tender with an intoxicating scent of garlic and herbs floating through the air. If you invest in a good chicken, the bones will make a killer stock.

Unlike most professions, where a person and their work can neatly coexist, being a writer involves stepping into an occupation that all but demands self-exposure and a heaping dose of vulnerability.

How could anybody put their work out there for Goodreads evisceration and not find themselves feeling thin-skinned? And then there are the other professional circles of hell to endure: the rejections and iffy reviews, the degradation of self-promotion, the unsettling quiet of an un-buzzy publication.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/27/you-hurt-my-feelings-movie-writing">Continue reading...</a>

## Want fuller groomed, lifted, brows? Lamination treatments are a real eye-opener  | Sali Hughes

<p>It takes about 15 minutes, lasts for a month, and makes you feel ‘made up’ without the effort.</p><p>Some time ago, a girlfriend’s new job brought forward her working day to a 5am start. She asked me which beauty treatments might make her look effortful and feel “made up” while maximising every last minute of time in bed. Brow lamination, the results of which last a month, was my first instinct and, a few years on, she’s never been late for work.</p><p>It’s a beauty cliche now, but well-shaped, fluffed-up eyebrows really do frame the entire face, making the most immediate and striking difference. What brow lamination involves is relaxing the structure of each hair, allowing it to be combed into a full up-and-out arch rather than poking stubbornly and slightly in an across or downwards direction.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/may/27/want-fuller-groomed-lifted-brows-lamination-treatments-are-a-real-eye-opener">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A step up from steamed greens: load your steamer basket with sticky rice, pork and prawn balls; steamed aubergine with cashew rayu; and, for pudding, a banana sponge with anise butter syrup</p><p>In the kitchen, as in life, there are some things I simply rarely get around to doing, or cooking, or using all that much. So much so, in fact, that I often forget just how satisfying and delicious they can be. Cooking food with steam is a good example: I know I love it, but it sometimes takes a whole steamed meal to remind myself of the fact. Today’s recipes are unashamedly a few steps up from a simple plate of steamed greens, but they make a satisfying<em> </em>and<em> </em>delicious bank holiday project.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/27/yotam-ottolenghi-on-cooking-with-steam-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

## There’s another invisible injustice for working women – the gender pension gap | Rajiv Prabhakar

<p>It’s partly the inevitable result of the gender pay gap, but the sums are much bigger. This urgently needs to be fixed</p><p>The reality of a gender pay gap – where women are paid less than men for similar work – is well known. Much less well known is the gender pension gap – a gap in retirement outcomes between men and women.</p><p>Outside the state pension, pensions come in roughly two forms, private and workplace, and women are being let down in both areas. The trade union Prospect estimates that the percentage difference in retirement income for females and males between 2020-21 is <a href="https://prospect.org.uk/news/new-figures-show-gender-pension-gap-remains-stubbornly-high">40.5%</a>. That’s significantly larger than the gender pay gap, which came in at around <a href="https://library.prospect.org.uk/download/2023/00254">15.4%</a> in 2021. A <a href="https://www.pensionspolicyinstitute.org.uk/media/3227/20190711-understanding-the-gender-pensions-gap.pdf">report</a> from the Pensions Policy Institute states that by their 60s, the median women’s pension wealth is £51,100.

<p>The author of a monumental biography of Muhammad Ali uses new material to flesh out the story of the civil rights giant</p><p>Who was the Rev Martin Luther King Jr? In America, the civil rights activist and Baptist minister is now embraced <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/19/us/mlk-conservative/index.html" title="">across the political spectrum</a> even as the teaching of the history of discrimination and segregation that shaped him is being actively <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/14/african-american-studies-history-repression-resistance-republicans" title="">suppressed</a> in many parts of the country. Beyond the US, he is widely celebrated in nations confronting difficult questions about their own <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3915926" title="">racial pasts</a>.</p><p>At the time of his assassination in 1968, however, most Americans had a negative view of him, and the National Security Agency had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-anti-vietnam-muhammad-ali-mlk" title="">tapped his overseas phone calls</a>. As late as the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan could state that it was still an open question whether he had been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/22/us/reagan-s-doubts-on-dr-king-disclosed.html" title="">communist dupe</a>, as King’s enemies at J Edgar Hoover’s FBI had long alleged. By the end of that decade, however, with a national holiday in his honour (reluctantly assented to by Reagan) and prize-winning biographies by <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Parting-the-Waters/Taylor-Branch/9780671687427" title="">Taylor Branch</a> and <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/bearing-the-cross-david-garrow?variant=32116818968610" title="">David Garrow</a> in print, King’s image had undergone a remarkable transformation. Scholars now argue about how much Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas influenced him, though the public often embraces a simpler image of King that renders his more radical racial and economic pronouncements in <a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/forum/brandon-m-terry-mlk-now/" title="">anodyne terms</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/27/king-the-life-of-martin-luther-king-by-jonathan-eig-review-a-story-that-speaks-to-our-times">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Woody Harrelson and Justin Theroux lead an all-star production with a gigantic budget. But why do the two leads seem to be acting in totally different shows?</p><p>Here is a list of things I love (incomplete), all of which are pertinent to HBO’s new dazzlingly cast hour-long White House Plumbers (30 May, 9pm, Sky Atlantic): Justin Theroux’s huge performance in Maniac, truly one of the best shows Netflix has ever produced and worthy of an annual rewatch if you haven’t already; Woody Harrelson’s performance in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/feb/12/hbo-true-detective-bizarre-entertaining-harrelson-mcconaughey">True Detective</a>, which is worthy of a biannual rewatch even if that finale is still … well, still like that; HBO shows that absolutely commit to one slightly annoying TV-making tic, such as the turning-to-camera thing in last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/04/winning-time-review-lakers-adam-mckay-john-c-reilly">Winning Time</a>. I love really stacked casts and I love period-set pieces that lampoon the moment they are set in while still being lovingly immersive. A list of things I don’t love (also incomplete): White House Plumbers.</p><p>The set-up is this – Americans are still obsessed with Watergate. It’s absurd how much I have heard about Watergate when it happened in a country I don’t live in 15 years before I was born and basically amounted to a bit of sticky tape over some door locks and some badly concealed tape recorders. (The main leaker, who had a universe of nicknames to anoint themselves with, chose Deep Throat? Come on!) But for some reason America is still convinced it’s one of the most fascinating moments in espionage history and should be retold, yet again, even though we already have All the President’s Men. And so: five episodes, Woody Harrelson opposite Justin Theroux, an enormous production budget and a supporting cast so stacked as to be almost unbelievable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/27/white-house-plumbers-this-watergate-dramas-cast-is-dazzling-unfortunately-its-terrible">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a cacophonous, intoxicating place full of vibrant colours and smells, shoppers jostling, and the dissonant sounds of city traffic, competing hawkers and many languages. It makes a great introduction to Turin because historically it has been where many of the city’s new arrivals – in previous centuries from the south of the country and more recently from Africa and Asia – have begun their new lives in this one-time capital of Italy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/27/grand-torino-italy-turin-city-break">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From sweary nicknames to sarcastic putdowns, the Roys have cornered the market in sick burns. Here are 40 of the best – but which is your favourite?</p><p>One of the chief pleasures of Succession is how the scripts are stuffed to the staples with quotable insults, savage putdowns and sick, sick burns. And no wonder. Showrunner Jesse Armstrong cut his teeth in comedy: he co-created cult sitcom Peep Show, and collaborated with Armando Iannucci on The Thick of It, with Chris Morris on Four Lions and with Charlie Brooker on Black Mirror. And now he oversees a writer’s room staffed by A-list playwrights and screenwriters. As a result, the volatile Roy family and their extended circle often seem to speak entirely in vicious verbal barbs. It’s profane poetry. It’s potty-mouthed music to viewers’ ears.</p><p>We’ve hand-picked 40 of our favourite lines. Let us know any we’ve missed in the comments section below.

## Country diary: The osprey is low in her nest – she’s incubating eggs | Merryn Glover

<p><strong>Badenoch, Cairngorms:</strong> Only her head is visible, turning sharply to and fro, golden eyes surveying the land</p><p>Every year we wait and wonder. Will they come back? Will they reunite and mate? Will the chicks survive? This agonising starts in late March as we scan the skies above the loch for the return of the ospreys from Africa. One normally arrives in late March or early April, usually the male, with a mate soon after. For 14 years, the female was the beloved “Green DY”, known by her plastic leg ring, which successfully fledged chicks in all but one year of her tenure. That was 2012, when she was defeated by torrential rain.</p><p>But last year she never appeared, and there was a sigh of loss across the internet. A new female came, however, partnering with DY’s old mate, and produced three chicks. The same pair are back, proving nature’s cycles of renewal, given a chance. Persecuted to extinction in Britain by 1916, ospreys returned to Speyside in the Cairngorms in 1954 and, gradually, to other sites across the UK. A pair built the nest here in Badenoch exactly 30 years ago, and it has yielded 59 young. This is especially impressive when most years the happy couple must endure winter’s departing kick of a snowstorm in April.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/27/country-diary-the-osprey-is-low-in-her-nest-shes-incubating-eggs">Continue reading...</a>
