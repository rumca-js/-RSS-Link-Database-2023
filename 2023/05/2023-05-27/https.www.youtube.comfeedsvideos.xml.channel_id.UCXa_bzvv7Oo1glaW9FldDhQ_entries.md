Every time when a new console comes along, there’s always a transition phase where games tend to come out for both the new generation as well as the last generation platforms. While there’s nothing wrong with this practice since it’s consumer-friendly for the most part, it so happens that sometimes the old versions suffer from a variety of both technical and non-technical problems which makes playing on these platforms frustrating at best and unplayable at worst. 

In addition to this, cross-gen releases also tend to hold back developers from completely realizing the potential of the new hardware since they have to account for the weaker hardware while making these games. As such, there’s a case to be had for such games to not be cross generation, and here are 10 such examples.

Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 can best be described as more of the same - so if that description excites you, this sequel should be right up your alley. On the other hand, if you didn’t have a good time playing the original, it’s unlikely that Melodies of Steel 2 will change that viewpoint. 

But looking at it in a vacuum, Melodies of Steel 2 is a surprisingly solid tactical RPG that strikes a good balance between accessibility and skill. The story is hampered by weak writing and inconsistent characters, but apart from that there isn’t much to complain about.
