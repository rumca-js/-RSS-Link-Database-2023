She means employees, but I'll bet you a dollar <a href=\"https://thepostmillennial.com/revealed-target-tells-employees-only-extremists-are-concerned-with-sexualization-of-children\" target=\"_blank\">the sentiment extends to customers as well</a>.

The fact that a majority of that half is their customer base? They don't seem to care.

Controversy erupted when Adeline Johnson, a girl and has only ever been a girl, gave a thumbs down after finishing fourth and missing out on the state championship opportunity. It was believed the thumbs down was due to the unfair competitor, but according to a statement by the school, the gesture was taken out of context.</p><p>The second no-showing athlete is Lorelei Barrett, according to the New York Post. </p><p>Welcome to America in 2023. One side of the debate, the side that believes in biology, feels that because boys are born with certain biological advantages in strength and athletics, it is unfair for them to compete against girls. Effectively rob girls of opportunities like scholarships and being able to discover themselves as they learn, grow, and develop. Also, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/locker-room-vermont-speaks-out\" target=\"_self\">forcing young girls to change with classmates who have male body parts</a> is weird and people who support forcing them to do so should feel disgusted with themselves because you're a gross person.</p><p>The other side of the argument -- the side that controls the White House, Hollywood, and 99.86% of the media. -- thinks you're a homophobic transphobe.</p><p>Controversy over mediocre male runners who compete as males after going through puberty as males, then decide to be girls and compete against girls, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/transwomen-sprinters-win-girls-100m-dash-the-looks-on-the-girls-faces-says-it-all\" target=\"_blank\">has been a cornerstone of that debate since 2018</a>.
