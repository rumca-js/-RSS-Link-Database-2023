<p>The sport remains niche in Australia but the national team is heading to the US this month there is even talk of Olympic inclusion</p><p>Footgolf, as the name suggests, is a sport combining elements of football and golf. “The easiest way to explain it,” says Steve Senyard, captain of the Australian national footgolf team, “is that it’s an offshoot of golf using a soccer ball. We’re basically kicking the ball, instead of using the club. The holes are larger, so the ball can fit. But otherwise it’s played using golf rules.”</p><p>This week, Senyard and a 12-strong national team arrived in Orlando, Florida, for the 2023 Footgolf World Cup. Following a weekend of practice, the tournament will begin on Monday and run for over a week. The event is the fourth edition of the Footgolf World Cup; the first tournament was held in Hungary just over a decade ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/28/what-is-this-footgolf-on-the-rise-with-world-cup-on-horizon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For female football players in 1988, getting Fifa to trial a tournament was a big win. The next battle was getting there</p><p>At the 1986 Fifa Congress in Mexico City, the “mother of Norwegian football” Ellen Wille asked Fifa for a Women’s World Cup.</p><p>Wille had strategised her speech before heading to Mexico, including the fact that it would best be delivered by a woman. It wasn’t good enough that women’s football wasn’t considered or mentioned in Fifa’s documents, Wille argued when she addressed the room full of more than 100 men: it was, she said, time for women to have their own tournament.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/28/the-matilda-effect-fiona-crawford-book-extract-australia-matildas-football-team-fifa-womens-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Emma Hayes’s side’s ability to pick up points when playing their closest challengers helped them win a tight race</p><p>You could be forgiven for assuming the Women’s Super League is a one-club show. Four league titles in a row, seven of the past nine (if you include the mini Spring Series of 2017), and three back-to-back doubles suggest a somewhat crushing dominance by Emma Hayes’s Chelsea.</p><p>To an extent that is true, the silverware doesn’t lie. However, cut a little below the surface and Chelsea’s dominance has been chipped away at. “This isn’t Arsenal Ladies from 10 to 25 years ago,” said Hayes when asked whether Chelsea’s winning run is good for the league. “This is a different situation. Leagues are not being won five, six, seven games in advance, they’re being won on the last day three years running. As much as it might look like that, it’s a league of margins and we’re the team that has narrowly managed to win it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/27/the-story-of-chelseas-remarkable-fourth-consecutive-wsl-title-triumph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is something magnificent about the Roma manager’s Europa Cup final date with Sevilla on Wednesday</p><p>Perhaps it’s different if you live in Italy or if Serie A is the league you follow most closely.

He’s still doing it! He hasn’t changed! 28% possession. One shot on target to Leverkusen’s 23. The ball in play for just 54 minutes, despite 14 minutes of injury time. An xG of 0.03. This was a celebration of <em>mourinhismo</em>, a Camp Nou 2010 for the modern age. He had a lead from the first leg, so why should he attack?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/27/jose-mourinho-the-anti-barca-may-have-gone-out-of-style-but-he-still-matters">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Twickenham triumph completes club’s rehabilitation three years after being found guilty of breaching salary cap</p><p>The rehabilitation is complete.

Expelled from the Premiership in disgrace three years ago, found guilty of breaches of the salary cap, they returned to the final in their first season back, but the last step to triumph proved one too far on that occasion. Here they rode multiple disruptions to take it in some style.</p><p>Whether Saracens are a byword for all that is unholy or convenient scapegoats for a salary- cap process that had failed on multiple occasions in the preceding 20 years or so will depend on one’s allegiance and/or opinion of the state of English rugby, an enterprise that certainly seems to be creaking at the seams. Whether within the cap or not, salaries in recent times have patently been too high, as the scourge of Covid and its fallout has been mercilessly exposing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/27/saracens-emerge-from-ignominy-to-reclaim-their-place-at-the-summit">Continue reading...</a>
