Recently, leading actor Vin Diesel suggested that the conclusion of the film series might be extended to three films. Now he added to this and revealed that after \"Fast X\" and parts 11 and 12, the franchise would by no means be over\u2026\nhttps://kinocheck.com/news/g8qkt\n\n01:54 Alien vs. Predator Anime\nThere is currently a lot going on in the \"Alien\" franchise: For example, a new film is currently being shot in Budapest, and one or possibly even two series are in the works. The last installment, \"Alien: Covenant\" from 2017, was received with mixed feelings\u2026\nhttps://kinocheck.com/news/88zzkk\n\n03:50 Venom 3\nOne of the most popular characters from Sony's Spider-Man Universe is certainly the anti-hero Venom. The last time lead actor Tom Hardy was able to show what he can get out of the character was in 2021 in \"Venom 2: Let There Be Carnage\". This makes the new information about \"Venom 3\", which recently became public, all the more exciting\u2026\nhttps://kinocheck.com/news/gfy83k\n\n04:57 Deadpool 3\nNews about \"Deadpool 3\" never ceases: Not only have more characters been confirmed to return in the sequel once again, but the start of filming is also ill-fated due to the writers' strike in the United States\u2026https://kinocheck.com/news/86ipo6\n\n06:51 Bullet Train 2\nThe action movie \"Bullet Train\" by director David Leitch, which was released last year, delivered fast-paced action and a top cast. As Giant Freaking Robot now reported with reference to insider information, there will probably soon be a sequel to the action spectacle. A new cast member from Australia is attracting a lot of attention\u2026\nhttps://kinocheck.com/news/s7ustv\n\n08:14 Mortal Kombat 2\nReleased in 2021, \"Mortal Kombat\" was anything but a success with fans and critics. In part, the action film had to take harsh criticism and was even dubbed a \"B-movie\" by The Hollywood Reporter. The prerequisite for a successful sequel is therefore not necessarily given. Nevertheless, it has been known since April 2021 that Warner was planning a total of four sequels\u2026\nhttps://kinocheck.com/news/zshoo8\n\nMost popular movies right now \u27a4 https://amzo.in/bestsellermovies | Most wanted movies of all time \u27a4 https://amzo.in/wishlistmovies\n\nNote | News with courtesy of all involved publishers. | All Rights Reserved. | https://amzo.in are affiliate-links.
