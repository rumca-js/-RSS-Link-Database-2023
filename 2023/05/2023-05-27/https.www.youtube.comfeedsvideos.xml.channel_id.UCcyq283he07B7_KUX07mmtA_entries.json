The most expensive kind, made with polished grains of rice, is called junmai daiginjo. One bottle can easily cost over $100. And the more the rice is polished, the more expensive the sake. Niizawa Brewery, in Japan's Miyagi Prefecture, brews sake with rice polished to less than 1% of its original size. The most expensive bottles of this sake cost almost $10,000. We followed a master sake brewer to find out how sake is made and why some bottles can be so expensive.\n\nChapters\nIntro 0:00\nOne of Japan\u2019s youngest brewmasters 0:40\nStarting work at 5 a.m. 1:22\nRice polishing 2:37\nWashing rice 3:45\nSteaming rice 5:00\nPromoting Nanami to brewmaster 5:48\nSake rice 6:47\nKoji mold 8:23\nFermentation 10:06\nTasting sake 12:21\nNiizawa brewery history 15:23\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE FOOD VIDEOS:\nSo Expensive Food Season 2 Marathon | So Expensive Food | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/AkOkPs555kQ\nWhy Royal Jelly is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/L4cth57-66k\nWhy Bilona Ghee (A2 Desi Ghee) Is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/59w2G_L1OMo\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Sake #SoExpensiveFood #InsiderBusiness\n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nInsider Business on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness\nInsider Business on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nInsider Business on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider\n\nWhy 1% Polished Rice Sake Is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Insider Business", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bFJZZNp4Bg", "date_published": "2023-05-27 15:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
