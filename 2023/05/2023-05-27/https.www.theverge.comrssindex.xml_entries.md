  <p id="2q3Pzw">The $50 million settlement over Apple’s bad butterfly keyboard design got final approval by a federal court judge in California, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rejects-challenges-apples-50-mln-keyboard-settlement-2023-05-26/"><em>Reuters</em> reported yesterday</a>. </p>
<p id="vnph7A">US District Court Judge Edward Davila denied an attempt to amend the agreement, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23826765-macbook-keyboard-settlement-final-2023-05-25?responsive=1&amp;title=1">writing in his ruling</a> that 86,000 people filed claims. That finally puts a figure on the number of people affected who will get compensation for repairs they’d paid for. Or at least the number who heard about the lawsuit and followed it to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/19/23270157/apple-butterfly-keyboard-settlement-class-action-lawsuit">settlement agreement that was reached last July</a>.</p>
<p id="h4exhO">The original suit came about because Apple laptops from 2015 to 2019 had a new keyboard design that just didn’t hold up under normal use; crumbs and dirt, or even just accumulated dust, could cause keys to fail or...</p>

  <p id="4kjbYn">Lawyers suing the Columbian airline Avianca submitted a brief full of previous cases that were just <em>made up</em> by ChatGPT, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur"><em>The New York Times</em> reported today</a>. After opposing counsel pointed out the nonexistent cases, US District Judge Kevin Castel confirmed, “Six of the submitted cases appear to be bogus judicial decisions with bogus quotes and bogus internal citations,” and set up a hearing as he considers sanctions for the plaintiff’s lawyers.</p>

<p id="FN8L92">As for who created the software, nobody in the subreddit post knows, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/windowsxp/comments/wwjy5j/windows_xp_web_activation_is_finally_dead/jksrr7p/">including user retroreviewyt</a>, who first shared it and isn’t even sure where <em>they</em> got it from, speculating it came from from a torrent somewhere. </p>
