While there\u2019s nothing wrong with this practice since it\u2019s consumer-friendly for the most part, it so happens that sometimes the old versions suffer from a variety of both technical and non-technical problems which makes playing on these platforms frustrating at best and unplayable at worst. \n\nIn addition to this, cross-gen releases also tend to hold back developers from completely realizing the potential of the new hardware since they have to account for the weaker hardware while making these games. As such, there\u2019s a case to be had for such games to not be cross generation, and here are 10 such examples.\n\nThumbnail credit: Nexusmod User: VenomRaven", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEcXOzBEeFc", "date_published": "2023-05-27 15:30:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 NEW GRAPHICALLY STUNNING Horror Games In Unreal Engine 5", "description": "Epic\u2019s real-time 3D creation tool Unreal Engine is now up to version 5.2, and with it a capability for developers to harness tactile film quality textures, dynamic global lighting, and realistic facial animations \u2013 all vital ingredients for immersive, terrifying horror experiences. \n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of 15 nerve-shredding horror games currently in development in Unreal Engine 5.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nEO1ZXSfNA", "date_published": "2023-05-27 13:30:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 can best be described as more of the same - so if that description excites you, this sequel should be right up your alley.
