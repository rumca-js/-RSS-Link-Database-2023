<p>Apple plans to shut down its My Photo Stream service on July 26th, 2023, the company <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzL0hUMjEwNzA1IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNzA3MWUyZS1hMjk0LTRkNDgtYjM2Zi00YTdlZjVlMzk3NGMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVtYMRxUBOazngJgL90p6uDNFq0LdN19CMUKFXGZqjgg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT210705"><ins>announced on Friday</ins></a>. The free service has been available since the release of iCloud in 2011. You can use My Photo Stream to upload the last 30 days of images and videos – up to a limit of 1,000 – from your Apple devices to iCloud. My Photo Stream predates <a href="https://www.icloud.com/photos"><ins>iCloud Photos</ins></a> and gave Apple users a way to access their images and video clips on more than one device. Notably, content uploaded to iCloud through My Photo Stream do not count against your iCloud storage cap, though they’re not saved at full resolution.</p><p>In a support document spotted by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/26/my-photo-stream-july-2023-shutdown/"><em><ins>MacRumors</ins></em></a>, Apple says My Photo Stream will stop automatically uploading photos to the company’s servers on June 26th, 2023. At that point, your photos and videos will remain on iCloud for 30 days until the official shutdown on July 26th. Since every image and video uploaded to iCloud through My Photo Stream is stored in its original format and resolution on at least one of your Apple devices, you won’t lose any cherished memories as part of the shutdown process. That said, if you want to have access to a specific image on a particular device, Apple recommends you save it to that device’s Photo Library before July 26th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On iPhone and iPad, you can save an image from your My Photo Stream by opening the Photos app, navigating to the My Photo Stream album, selecting the photo you want to save and then tapping the Share button to save it to your Library. Apple ends the support document by noting, “iCloud Photos is the best way to keep the photos and videos you take up to date across all your devices and safely stored in iCloud.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-free-my-photo-stream-service-will-shut-down-on-july-26th-211650923.html?src=rss

## Dolphin emulator Steam release delayed indefinitely following Nintendo DMCA notice

<p>Valve has delisted Dolphin from Steam after receiving a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice from Nintendo. In late March, the developers of Dolphin, an open source emulator that can run most GameCube and Wii titles, said they were planning to bring the free app to Valve’s storefront <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dolphin-is-releasing-its-gamecube-and-wii-emulator-on-steam-193356400.html'"><ins>later this year</ins></a>. In a May 26th legal notice seen by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nintendo-sends-valve-dmca-notice-to-block-steam-release-of-wii-emulator-dolphin/"><em><ins>PC Gamer</ins></em></a>, Nintendo's legal team asked Valve to remove Dolphin from Steam, claiming the emulator violates the company’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>&quot;Because the Dolphin emulator violates Nintendo’s intellectual property rights, including but not limited to its rights under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)’s Anti-Circumvention and AntiTrafficking provisions, 17 U.S.C. § 1201, we provide this notice to you of your obligation to remove the offering of the Dolphin emulator from the Steam store,&quot; the document states.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the notice, the Dolphin team has two options on how to move forward. It can either file a counter-claim with Valve, arguing the emulator doesn’t violate the DMCA as claimed by Nintendo, or it can choose to comply with the takedown notice. If the team files a counter-notice, Nintendo would have two weeks to decide whether to file a lawsuit. As <em>PC Gamer</em> notes, it’s unclear if the company actually intends to pursue legal action against Dolphin. However, if a case were to go to court, it could have far-reaching implications for emulators. For the time being, the Dolphin team says it’s deciding what to do next.</p><p>“It is with much disappointment that we have to announce that the Dolphin on Steam release has been indefinitely postponed,” the Dolphin Emulation Project <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/05/27/dolphin-steam-indefinitely-postponed/"><ins>said Friday</ins></a>. “We were notified by Valve that Nintendo has issued a cease and desist citing the DMCA against Dolphin's Steam page, and have removed Dolphin from Steam until the matter is settled. We are currently investigating our options and will have a more in-depth response in the near future.” As of the writing of this story, you can still download the Dolphin emulator from the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/"><ins>project’s website</ins></a> and GitHub page. The Dolphin team did not receive a direct takedown notice from Nintendo.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/dolphin-emulator-steam-release-delayed-indefinitely-following-nintendo-dmca-notice-194601894.html?src=rss

## Twitter pulls out of EU’s voluntary Code of Practice against disinformation

<p>Twitter has withdrawn from a voluntary European Union agreement to combat online disinformation. In a tweet spotted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/27/elon-musk-twitter-eu-disinformation-code/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>, Thierry Breton, the bloc’s internal market commissioner, said Twitter had pulled out of the EU’s “<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/code-practice-disinformation"><ins>Code of Practice</ins></a>” against disinformation. “You can run but you can’t hide. Our teams are ready for enforcement,” Breton said, referring to the EU’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-union-digital-markets-services-acts-131818075.html"><ins>Digital Services Act</ins></a>. As of August 25th, the DSA will require “very large online platforms” like Twitter to be more proactive with content moderation.</p><div id="61e614c3343348a39a04a49d2dc0ad95"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Twitter leaves EU voluntary Code of Practice against disinformation.<br /><br />But obligations remain. You can run but you can’t hide. <br /><br />Beyond voluntary commitments, fighting disinformation will be legal obligation under <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DSA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DSA</a> as of August 25.<br /><br />Our teams will be ready for enforcement.</p>— Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1662194595755704321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Twitter does not operate a communications department Engadget could contact for comment. Before Elon Musk's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-011047797.html">takeover last October</a>, Twitter signed onto the EU’s Code of Practice against disinformation in 2018, alongside companies like Facebook parent Meta, Google and TikTok. While the Code is voluntary, the EU <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/16/eu-disinformation-code-reboot/"><ins>announced in June 2022</ins></a> that sticking to the agreement would count towards DSA compliance. As <em>TechCrunch </em>notes,  Twitter’s decision to withdraw from the deal just three months before the EU starts enforcing the DSA would appear to suggest the company plans to skirt the bloc’s rules on content moderation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, ignoring the DSA could turn into an expensive fight for Twitter and Elon Musk. The legislation allows EU officials to hand out penalties of up to 10 percent of global annual turnover for infractions, with the potential for fines of up to 20 percent of worldwide turnover for repeat instances of non-compliance. The European Commission has also said that repeat non-compliance could lead to the EU blocking access to offending services.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-pulls-out-of-eus-voluntary-code-of-practice-against-disinformation-183726045.html?src=rss

That beats a $200 discount we saw <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobots-roomba-combo-j7-plus-vacuum-and-mop-is-200-off-right-now-140029588.html">earlier this year</a> and represents an all-time low for a gadget that "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-combo-j7plus-hands-on-150010629.html">earned its place</a>" in on of our senior editors' smart home.  Wellbots has a few other vacs on sale too, also with discount codes, listed below.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Unlike some combo machines, in which you have to program where to mop and where to use the vacuum, the Roomba Combo j7+ senses when it's rolling over hard floors and drops down the on-board mop pad accordingly. It comes with a clean base, which sucks out the dry debris after a run, but you'll have to take care of adding and emptying the mop water yourself. iRobot machines continually top our lists, in part thanks to the accurate room mapping, easy-to-use app and excellent obstacle avoidance — qualities it shares with the vac-only sibling.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Wellbots is currently discounting the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f14f6b23-c078-4e53-8011-5b872f886d6b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Wellbots&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmMTRmNmIyMy1jMDc4LTRlNTMtODAxMS01Yjg3MmY4ODZkNmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2VsbGJvdHMuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2lyb2JvdC1yb29tYmEtajctc2VsZi1lbXB0eWluZy1yb2JvdC12YWN1dW0iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIzNzgzZmQ2LWU5M2YtNDY3Ni04OTM2LWI1MzhiNzYwNTFjOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXqrgyHSK94vWCeEF6nwSx_dMd9CulrYJB7yvjLok93G&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Firobot-roomba-j7-self-emptying-robot-vacuum">Roomba j7+</a> by $220 when you use the code 220ENGADGET.

The standard (non-combo) Roomba j7 is the runner up mid-range vac in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html">guide</a> and this version simply includes a clean base to suck out the dirt after it runs.

## Japan's ispace says Hakuto-R crashed because it got confused by a crater rim

<p>ispace is done analyzing data from its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/japans-ispace-confirms-that-hakuto-r-failed-its-lunar-landing-110531710.html">failed Hakuto-R lunar landing</a>, and it sounds like tricky terrain and a late change in the landing site are to blame. Apparently, Hakuto-R was able to complete the whole deceleration process in preparation of touching down on lunar soil. The spacecraft activated its descent sequence when it reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers (62 miles) and was able to slow down until it was only moving at a speed of less than 1 m/s.&nbsp;</p><p>However, its software had mistakenly estimated its altitude to be zero when it was still hovering around 5 kilometers (3 miles) above the ground. In other words, it thought it had already landed when it hasn't yet, and it continued descending at a very slow speed near the surface until its propulsion system ran out of fuel. ispace wasn't able to establish contact with the spacecraft again, but it believes it went on a free fall and ultimately crashed on the moon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That's the how, but what about the why? Well, the company thinks the most likely reason why Hakuto-R's software suffered from an altitude estimation issue was because it got confused. While it was flying to its landing site, it passed over a large cliff that was determined to be the rim of a crater. The spacecraft's onboard sensor got an altitude reading of 3 kilometers when it passed by the elevated terrain, and that was apparently larger than the estimated altitude value the Hakuto-R team set in advance.&nbsp;</p><p>The spacecraft's software erroneously thought that the sensor reported an abnormal value, and it kept filtering out its altitude measurements afterward. ispace built the ability to reject abnormal altitude measurements into the lander as a safety measure in the event of a hardware issue with the sensor. However, it backfired for Mission 1 because simulations of the landing sequence failed to incorporate the lunar environment on the spacecraft's route. ispace made the decision to change Hakuto-R's landing site after its critical design review was already completed in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hakuto-R Mission 1 was poised to become the first successful moon landing by a private company and the first Japanese lunar landing overall. While it didn't get to land on the moon, ispace will use the data from the mission to design preparatory landing sequences for Mission 2 and 3, which are scheduled for launch in 2024 and 2025, respectively.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/japans-ispace-says-hakuto-r-crashed-because-it-got-confused-by-a-crater-rim-113115803.html?src=rss
