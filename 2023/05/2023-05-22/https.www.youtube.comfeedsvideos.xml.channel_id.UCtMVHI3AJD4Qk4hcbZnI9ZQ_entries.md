Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! Activision has apparantly issued a cease and desist against "Xlabs" and iW4x. Activision has also issued the same notice against "COD Sm2" and it seems they don't quite appreciate their fanbase playing their legacy titles with a couple mods installed. They've taken down a game that I love and it's sad to see. Thanks for watching!
