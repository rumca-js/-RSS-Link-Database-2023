It may have seemed all was lost when Abraham Alexander’s college soccer career was ended by an ACL injury. But it was during his recuperation that someone handed Alexander a guitar — and the next chapter of his life began. “I could express myself in ways that I never knew I could before," Alexander recalls. “It was like one of those moments where the light shines … It just made so much sense.”

Drawing inspiration from artists like Gary Clark Jr. and Leon Bridges, Alexander set about writing songs and road-testing them at open mics. All the effort has paid off, and Alexander is now touring in support of his debut album, SEA/SONS (pronounced “seasons”), which released April 14.

Abraham Alexander recently visited The Current studio to perform songs from SEA/SONS and to chat with host Bill DeVille. Watch the complete session above.
