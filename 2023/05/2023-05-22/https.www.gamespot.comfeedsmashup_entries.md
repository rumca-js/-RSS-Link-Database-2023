<p>Insomniac Games has confirmed that the upcoming Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is purely a single-player game, and it will not feature any co-op.</p><p>On Twitter, a user asked the studio if the game was going to have co-op, and Insomniac replied, "Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!" This dashes any hopes for those who were hoping to swing around Manhattan with a friend together. Co-op certainly made some sort of sense given that there are two Spider-Man characters in Miles Morales and Peter Parker, but it looks like that won't be the case.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Nope!

## Nintendo Faces Lawsuit Over Mario Kart Tour's "Immoral" Loot Boxes
 - [https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-faces-lawsuit-over-mario-kart-tours-immoral-loot-boxes/1100-6514440/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-faces-lawsuit-over-mario-kart-tours-immoral-loot-boxes/1100-6514440/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

<p dir="ltr">These days, video game loot boxes aren't quite as ubiquitous as they once were, but that hasn't stopped one young player from suing Nintendo over their inclusion in the mobile game Mario Kart Tour. The suit claims that the game's loot boxes (known as Spotlight Pipes) are a form of trickery that encourages "addictive behaviors akin to gambling."</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/22/nintendo-mario-kart-lootboxes-lawsuit">Axios</a>, these Spotlight Pipes are loot boxes with undisclosed odds, and players used to be able to spend real money to activate the pipes again and again to obtain useful upgrades. (That functionality was removed last year.) The suit's plaintiff apparently spent more than $170 on microtransactions in Mario Kart Tour. The suit alleges that Nintendo intentionally steered players towards Spotlight Pipes in order to progress in the game, a practice known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern">dark patterns</a>" that has been made illegal in Washington and California in recent years.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo replaced Spotlight Pipes with an in-game shop where players can buy the items directly last year. We've reached out to Nintendo for comment, and we'll update this piece if we hear back. The Tokyo giant is far from the only company to face legal scrutiny due to loot boxes; last year, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-finalizes-order-making-fortnite-dev-pay-245-million-in-refunds/1100-6510151/">FTC fined Epic Games</a> more than $500 million for using "dark patterns" to encourage Fortnite players to make purchases in its online store. It's likely that suits like these are a major part of why big games have largely replaced loot box systems with battle passes, a trend perhaps exemplified by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-co-op-content-teased-pve-changes-and-mmo-aspirations-further-discussed/1100-6514403/">Overwatch 2</a>.</p>

## Discord's Controversial New Policy Has Prevented A Dev From Claiming Its Own Name

<p dir="ltr">Discord is one of the most popular gaming apps out there, but a new change in how the service's usernames work has led to a significant amount of controversy in recent days. Recently, notable indie studio Rusty Lake noted on social media that it now can't claim its own name on Discord, which is an inconvenience to say the least.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">A warning for all the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/indiedevs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#indiedevs</a> waiting to claim their own username <a href="https://twitter.com/discord?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@discord</a>;<br />We just received an email that we, as Verified Owners, could finally submit a new username and wow... ‘rustylake’ is already taken!

Discord has apparently decided to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-is-making-everyone-pick-new-usernames-this-year/1100-6513818/">forgo this system</a>, replacing it with unique static usernames that can be made up of lowercase characters, numbers, and the period and underscore symbols. That rollout is happening slowly over the next few months, with the service's oldest users getting first dibs at their new names.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, though we're still early on in the process, it seems that the username "rustylake" is already taken. As Rusty Lake says, this is a significant issue for the developer, as that account might be used as an impersonator, and it might even require legal fees to file paperwork to get the account changed.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discords-controversial-new-policy-has-prevented-a-dev-from-claiming-its-own-name/1100-6514438/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Destiny 2 will soon get crossover armor and cosmetics from PlayStation franchises like God of War, The Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima. Bungie teased the news on social media.</p><p>An image posted on the official Destiny 2 Twitter account shows three Guardians. The figure on the left wears God of War-inspired armor, with Kratos's signature face paint. The middle Guardian wears Horizon Zero Dawn threads. The rightmost figure dons a Ghost of Tsushima-style outfit, complete with katana and hair bun. In between two of the Guardians is a ghost with The Last of Us' zombie fungus growing out of it. The crossover is a natural fit as Sony now owns Destiny 2 developer Bungie.</p><figure style="width: 900px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4141450-playstationxdestiny2.jpg"><img alt="The promotional image for the PlayStation/Destiny 2 crossover." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4141450-playstationxdestiny2.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The promotional image for the PlayStation/Destiny 2 crossover.</figcaption></figure><p>The announcement teases the new armor will release on May 23, the same day that Season of the Deep begins. No pricing was announced, but these armor sets will likely take the form of armor ornaments (meaning the look can be applied to other, non-Exotic pieces of armor). Similar crossovers in the past, including the Assassin's Creed-inspired set, cost $20 each. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-adding-playstation-crossover-armor-including-god-of-war/1100-6514437/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## You Can Now Find Out How Many Hours You've Played Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom

<p dir="ltr">Are you curious how many hours you've put into The Legend Of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Well, we have good news: Though the game doesn't have a traditional hour count, your Switch does keep a tally of the time you put into it, though accessing that information is not exactly intuitive.</p><p dir="ltr">Before we go on, it's important to note that at least 10 days have to elapse after you first play the game in order to see this hour count, so keep that in mind. To access it, go to the home screen of your Switch, and then navigate to your profile in the top-left corner. Then select Profile, and look for Tears of the Kingdom under "Play Activity." If it's been 10 days, it'll give you an estimated figure for playtime, such as "20 hours or more."</p><p dir="ltr">If you want more detailed hour logging from your Switch, you should register the console with the Parental Controls app. However, keep in mind that it'll only start logging time once you register the console, so it won't be retroactive to your previous play sessions. It's also worth noting that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6514064/">play time required to finish</a> this latest Zelda seems to vary a lot, with many players notching dozens of hours without doing much of the main story.

It's an effort to return to what many fans love most about the series, and a response to what was lacking in the previous entry in the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">"We put our main focus, even more than action, on that story," Yoshida said. "And you look back at the previous games, at FFXV - they have their story, but it wasn't complete. And then they try to make it complete, and then they promise more story, but then they don't give us the story…and so you had a lot of people that went into the series wanting us to give them a great story, and they didn't get that."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-focus-on-story-is-a-direct-response-to-ff15-lackluster-one/1100-6514432/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Leaker Uncovers Evidence That Internal Bloodborne PC Build Has Existed For Years

<p dir="ltr">Bloodborne fans have been clamoring for a PC release of the classic PS4 game for years, but it seems that the game's developers have been playing it on that platform for a while now. Prolific Souls leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1660129358235996161/photo/1">Lance McDonald</a> noticed that screenshots posted to the Bloodborne Fandom wiki were put there by a From Software employee who seemingly took them with a Windows build of the game.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Bloodborne: The Old Hunters Edition running on PC spotted. <a href="https://t.co/dbtdkVvUVg">pic.twitter.com/dbtdkVvUVg</a></p>  — Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1660129358235996161?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">May 21, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">As McDonald notes in the above tweet, the file name of the screenshot indicates that it was taken using the game's debug camera in a Windows 64-bit build of the game. Said screenshot has existed on the game's wiki for years now. Given the modern realities of game development, it's not shocking that From Software has a build of the game that works on PC. Today's video game consoles are essentially just PCs on a technological level. What is surprising here is that the screenshots are from the Fishing Hamlet, which is the last area of Bloodborne's DLC. This indicates that the PC build is the finished retail release of the game, including The Old Hunters, and it's existed for years now.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we don't know how much work would have to be done to that PC build to get it into a releasable state, but that's not really the point. As I <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-2022-its-still-baffling-that-bloodborne-isnt-on-pc-yet/1100-6509218/">wrote late last year</a>, we know that From Software is more than capable of delivering more-than-acceptable PC versions of its games, it just seems that Bloodborne is doomed to remain on the PS4 for the foreseeable future. We can speculate on what those reasons are, but ultimately it's out of our hands. That won't stop hardcore Yharnam-heads like myself from crossing our fingers during every <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-may-2023-start-time-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6514429/">PlayStation Showcase</a> or press event, but at a certain point, you know not to get your hopes up.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaker-uncovers-evidence-that-internal-bloodborne-pc-build-has-existed-for-years/1100-6514431/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Could Final Fantasy XVI be the last numbered title in the beloved RPG franchise? That's unknown, though game producer Naoki Yoshida has brought the issue up with Square Enix executives.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/final-fantasy-16-interview">GQ</a> (and spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1660662732474167298">Twitter user Wario64</a>), Yoshida touched on how the number format for Final Fantasy mainline games can be confusing for audiences. "A lot of players are going to come in and they're going to look at it like a comic book where you have to read from the beginning to know what's going on now," the Final Fantasy XVI producer said. Yoshida added that marketing has to ensure audiences know that playing every game in the franchise isn't necessary.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about removing numbers altogether--similar to the God of War and Legend of Zelda franchises--Yoshida noted he's broached the topic with Square Enix. "That's actually something that I've discussed with the higher-ups," he said. "Maybe it's about time we removed the numbers from the title.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-dev-discusses-dropping-final-fantasys-numbers/1100-6514430/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Mortal Kombat 1's Minimum And Recommended PC Specs Revealed

<p dir="ltr">We've learned a lot about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-2023-release-date-roster-characters-everything-we-know/1100-6514365/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> in the past few days, and we now know what its minimum and recommended PC specs are. As revealed by the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/">Steam page</a>, it seems that the specs required for the game are quite modest, at least compared to other new 2023 games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1-minimum-pc-specs-and-other-features-revealed/1100-6512203/">The Last Of Us Part 1</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As you can see in the below list, the minimum specs for the game include an Intel Core i5-6600 or a AMD Ryzen 3 3100 for the CPU, and it lists the Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 (along with AMD RX 470 and the Intel Arc A750) as the GPU you need. The recommended specs are understandably more demanding, with a Intel Core i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600X CPU fitting the bill, and a Nvidia GeForce 1080 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT or Intel Arc A770 filling in the GPU side of things. However, it will require 100 GB of hard drive space, which is sadly the norm for most big games these days.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering that the GeForce 1080 Ti is now three generations old, these specs are extremely achievable for even gamers with aging rigs. Compared to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-launch-pc-system-requirements-revealed/1100-6513508/">Diablo 4's specs</a>, which recommend at least an Intel i7-8700k and a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 for ultra 4K requirements. Of course, you'll almost certainly need a stouter rig to play Mortal Kombat 1 in 4K, and we don't know what its ultra requirements are, but it's fair to conclude that you can play the game with decent settings even if your PC is a few years old.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-minimum-and-recommended-pc-specs-revealed/1100-6514427/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The Star Wars franchise continues to mine characters and events from the past for new shows and movies. Yet, actress Natalie Portman--who portrayed Padme Amidala in the prequel film trilogy--says she's never been asked to reprise her role since filming Revenge of the Sith.</p><p dir="ltr">Portman took part in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk0mlv6rx-M">Actually Me episode for GQ</a>, responding to fans on the internet in a YouTube video. When she saw a Reddit question about Padme showing up in a future Star Wars project, the actress said, "I have no information on this.

McGregor returned to the character after originally appearing in the prequel trilogy, like Portman. That said, Padme died in Revenge of the Sith, meaning a new story about Luke and Leia's mother would have to precede that event.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/natalie-portman-is-open-to-returning-to-star-wars/1100-6514426/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4056457-inzonelineup%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>PC and PS5 gamers who are looking for a new gaming headset should absolutely take a look at the deals on the Sony Inzone lineup. The trio of headsets are featured in <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&amp;deals-widget={">Amazon&#039;s Gaming Week</a> </span> sale. The best deals can be found on the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Wireless-Headset-Over-ear-Headphones/dp/B0B1S4RXQB?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Inzone H7 wireless headset</a></strong>, which is seeing more than an $80 discount, and the budget-minded <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Headset-Over-ear-Headphones-MDR-G300/dp/B0B1SXW7LB?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Inzone H3</a></strong>. The latter is a terrific value at its new low price of $58 (down from $100).</p><p>The Inzone headsets released last year and serve as multiplatform devices that works on both PC and PS5. Note that these carry the Sony logo, not the PlayStation logo, and they're arguably a better fit for PC than PS5 (since you'll gain access to the 360 Spatial Sound to customize your listening experience). That being said, you'll get a lot of cool features regardless of what platform you hook these up to, including Tempest 3D audio support on PS5. Here’s a closer look at all three to help you determine if one is a good fit for your gaming needs.</p><p>It's worth noting that you can also grab the high-end Inzone H9 as part of a <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Canceling-Over-Ear-Headphones/dp/B0BM8ZVYWC?tag=gamespot-promos-20">bundle deal</a></strong> with the Inzone M9 4K gaming monitor for $998 (down from $1,200). Alternatively, you can get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-promos-20">M9 27-inch gaming monitor</a> for $798 on its own, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-NVIDIA/dp/B0B6KHVR3K?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sony's M3 gaming monitor</a> for $468</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sony Inzone H7 Wireless Gaming Headset</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4056446-h7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>$148 ($<del>230</del>)</strong></p><p>Discounted by $80, at this price the Inzone H7 is a great bargain. It has most of the high-end features of the H9--the H7 has fabric earcups and lacks active noise-canceling tech--while saving you a nice chunk of change. You’ll also be treated to a premium design that takes strong cues from the new-gen console, up to 40 hours of runtime on a single charge, and a convenient, wireless connection that works via a USB dongle and Bluetooth. There’s also a Discord-certified microphone that makes it easy to communicate with your teammates.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Wireless-Headset-Over-ear-Headphones/dp/B0B1S4RXQB?tag=gamespot-promos-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sony Inzone H3 Wired Gaming Headset</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4056447-h3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><strong>$58 ($<del>100</del>)</strong></p><p>Few headsets in the sub-$100 range offer the features found on the H3.

<p>Konami is reportedly working on a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and a new report claims this title will not be exclusive to PlayStation as had been rumored.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-exclusive/">Insider Gaming</a> reported this, citing unnamed sources. The game will reportedly release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. An announcement of the game is expected at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-showcase-2023-coming-may-24-with-ps5-reveals/1100-6514266/">PlayStation Showcase event on May 24</a>, but nothing is certain.</p><p>If the Snake Eater remake is real and not exclusive to PlayStation, it could still have a close connection to Sony's console through marketing rights or DLC. Activision's Call of Duty series is not exclusive to any platform, but Sony pays Activision for timed-exclusive content and other perks. But as of yet, there is no reason to believe the rumored Snake Eater remake--again, which remains unofficial and unannounced--is connected in any way to PlayStation.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-wont-be-exclusive-to-playstation-report-says/1100-6514424/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Lego has officially unveiled its next set, a retro-themed recreation of a Pac-Man arcade cabinet that includes several innovative features. Out of the box, you can use the 2,651 included pieces to construct the arcade cabinet, Pac-Man, his eternal maze, and the iconic ghosts who are always chasing him down.</p><p>Once completed, some of the features on this set include a light brick that illuminates the--thankfully non-functional--coin slot, a crank that allows you to simulate the classic gameplay and even a removable back panel that can be used to reveal the inner mechanics. As an additional and cute bonus, you can even build a mini-arcade that comes with a mini-figure and can be stored inside of the cabinet.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=13923&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/pac-man-arcade-10323">See on Lego Store</a> </div><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141298-legopacman%282%29.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141298-legopacman%282%29.jpg" /></a></figure><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141299-legopacman%281%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4141299-legopacman%281%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141300-legopacman%283%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4141300-legopacman%283%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141301-legopacman%284%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4141301-legopacman%284%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141302-legopacman%285%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 4" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4141302-legopacman%285%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141303-legopacman%286%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 5" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4141303-legopacman%286%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141304-legopacman%287%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 6" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4141304-legopacman%287%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141305-legopacman%288%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 7" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4141305-legopacman%288%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141306-legopacman%289%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 8" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4141306-legopacman%289%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141307-legopacman%2810%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 9" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4141307-legopacman%2810%29.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4141308-legopacman%2811%29.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 10" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4141308-legopacman%2811%29.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p>Pac-Man, Blinky, and Clyde form part of a miniature diorama that rests on top of the cabinet, showing off Bandai Namco's favorite mascot on the run from the ghosts.

<p>Fast X hit theaters this past weekend, and as expected, the latest chapter in the Fast and Furious franchise had the third-best opening--$319 million worldwide--behind The Fate of the Furious and Furious 7. Out of that total number, $251.4 million came from an international market of petrolheads in 84 markets, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/fast-x-opening-china-global-international-box-office-1235370276/">Deadline</a>.

## The Opening Hours Of Final Fantasy XVI Are Brutal - Hands-On Story Preview

<p>Valisthea, the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi/">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, is a dark place. Not just in the muted color palette of grays and browns that paint the castle keeps and bloodied landscapes, but in the ruthlessness of the story within. A history of betrayal, death, conquest, war, oppression--and whatever else comes to mind when you think of a violent medieval setting--are integral to this new entry in the iconic RPG franchise from Square Enix. While these themes have been present in the series in some form, Final Fantasy XVI's opening makes it abundantly clear that it's working in a much more grim context.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently got hands-on time with what's roughly the first four hours of Final Fantasy XVI during a preview event, and saw how the story begins. It's heavy with cutscenes and cinematic flair, using all the dazzling visuals expected of a PlayStation 5 exclusive, to deliver an opening act akin to a prestige drama.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo included sequences of the main protagonist, Clive, in his teenage years to show how tragedy and his royal family's business fed into a widespread war that carries into his adulthood. It was a vastly different experience to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/final-fantasy-xvi-hands-on-preview-a-stark-break-from-series-tradition/">my first preview which was gameplay-focused</a> to showcase the depth and intricacies of the game's stylish-action combat system.

<p>Writer-director James Gunn is known for responding to rumors about his movies on Twitter, but the filmmaker will stop doing that as much in the time ahead.</p><p>Posting on Twitter, Gunn said he has been getting "barraged with bullsh** DC rumors..." Going forward, Gunn said he is going to "slow down" on responding to rumors via social media, "unless it's especially egregious," he said.</p><p>Some rumors are true, or partially true, but Gunn isn't planning to keep responding.
