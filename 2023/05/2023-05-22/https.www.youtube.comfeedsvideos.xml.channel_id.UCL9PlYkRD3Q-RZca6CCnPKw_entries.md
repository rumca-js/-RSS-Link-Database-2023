• Montgomery: “Am I scared of the legal implications? Obviously, yes. I don’t want to go through any legal ramifications for trying to do a good thing [by exposing pedophiles]. I had no bad intentions. I was trying to help children.”

[NEW YORK – May 22, 2023] Project Veritas released a new video today exposing an underground online pedophile network -- which was brought forth by Data Security Expert, Ryan Montgomery.

Montgomery sat down with Veritas to detail how he uncovered a wide-ranging network of individuals who view and share child pornography by using random emails and usernames to avoid law enforcement detection.

“I saw that there were pedophiles, self-proclaimed serial killers, rapists, every single type of horrible human being you can imagine [on this website],” Montgomery said.

Veritas journalists followed up on the information provided by Montgomery and tracked down one of the individuals listed as a member of the website, Rapey.To, named Jonathan.

Upon being confronted with data from Rapey.To, Jonathan admitted to being a member and engaging in questionable activities in the dark web:

Veritas Journalist: This website ‘Rapey.To,’ were you a member of this website?

Jonathan: I was…That sort of thing is connected to my addiction.

Veritas Journalist: Right. What is your addiction?

Jonathan: Porn.

…

Veritas Journalist: It’s safe to assume that you’re attracted to children?

Jonathan: I did have a fetish. I have therapy to help me get over that addiction.

Jonathan also described an occasion in which he attempted to obtain child pornography:

Veritas Journalist: From your account it says, “Make a video I f**ked a little girl in the school basement.” I just wanted to ask you what that was, what you meant by it. Like... were you telling the truth?

Jonathan: No, that was just a bluff. It was a lie. And I only did that to kind of lure her. Lure the female pedophile for her -- kind of -- just to tempt her into sending something.

Veritas Journalist: So, you were trying to receive child porn at that time?

Jonathan: I was. Yeah, through making a lie about that.

Montgomery told Veritas that he came forward because he trusted Veritas’ journalism. He believes that exposing potential pedophiles to protect children is a worthwhile endeavor.

“Am I scared of the legal implications? Obviously, yes. I don’t want to go through any legal ramifications for trying to do a good thing [by exposing pedophiles]. I had no bad intentions. I was trying to help children.”
