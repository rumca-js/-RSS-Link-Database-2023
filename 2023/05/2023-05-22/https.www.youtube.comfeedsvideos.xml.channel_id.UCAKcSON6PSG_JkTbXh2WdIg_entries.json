But it was during his recuperation that someone handed Alexander a guitar \u2014\u00a0and the next chapter of his life began. \u201cI could express myself in ways that I never knew I could before,\" Alexander recalls. \u201cIt was like one of those moments where the light shines \u2026 It just made so much sense.\u201d\n\nDrawing inspiration from artists like Gary Clark Jr. and Leon Bridges, Alexander set about writing songs and road-testing them at open mics. All the effort has paid off, and Alexander is now touring in support of his debut album, SEA/SONS (pronounced \u201cseasons\u201d), which released April 14.\n\nAbraham Alexander recently visited The Current studio to perform songs from SEA/SONS and to chat with host Bill DeVille.
