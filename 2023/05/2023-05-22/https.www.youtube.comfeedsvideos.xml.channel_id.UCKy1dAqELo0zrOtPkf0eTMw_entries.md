Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse sees Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) catapulted across the Multiverse, where he encounters the Spider Society, a team of Spider-People charged with protecting the Multiverse’s very existence. But when the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles finds himself pitted against the other Spiders and must set out on his own to save those he loves most.

In IGN’s exclusive clip, Miles is pursued by dozens of other Spideys, including Spider-Man 2099 (voiced by Oscar Isaac), Spider-Man 2211, and Web-Man, with the scene also featuring an epic riff on the iconic Spider-Man Pointing Meme. Not all of the Spideys seen in this clip are even human, with both the dinosaur incarnation Spider-Rex and Spider-Cat popping up at different points.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse hits theaters on June 2nd.

## The Little Mermaid Review

The Little Mermaid was reviewed by Alyssa Mora. In theaters May 26, 2023.

Halle Bailey’s brilliantly vulnerable performance as Ariel is the star of the show in Disney’s live-action remake of The Little Mermaid. Melissa McCarthy follows closely behind with a magnetic performance as Ursula. As a whole, however, this version sometimes struggles to keep itself above water. Its problems lie in lackluster underwater sequences, realistic sea creatures missing cartoonish charm, and additions to the story that are quaint but not necessarily memorable. What works best are the elements it takes from the original, highlighted best by a show-stopping rendition of Part of Your World. While this version doesn’t always find its sea legs, there’s enough of those original ideas recreated here that it can’t go too far wrong.
