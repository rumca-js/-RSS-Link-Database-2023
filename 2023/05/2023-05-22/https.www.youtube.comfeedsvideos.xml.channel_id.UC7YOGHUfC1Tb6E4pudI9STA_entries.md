In this video I discuss how YouTube is becomming more agressive with ads and blocking ad blockers on their platform, aswell as YouTube's new strategy to reduce bandwidth costs by putting higher resolution and more bandwidth intensive videos like 4k or 1080p with enhanced bitrate behind a paywall to offset the costs of this expensive to serve content.  I also discuss an alternative solution to serving high quality content (decentralized hosting)
