<p>From women howling with grief to teenage soldiers, this documentary about the Troubles is full of grim footage but manages to shape it into a deeply human, lyrical and profound story</p><p>James Bluemel has said that his new project, Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland, is not intended to be comprehensive in its analysis of the Troubles, since it comprises five hour-long episodes – not enough time to untangle decades of hurt, resentment and eventual reconciliation. Instead, it hunts, successfully, for the telling details that come from first-hand recollections and deftly chosen archive clips.</p><p>The series runs chronologically, the interviewees returning across multiple episodes, their stories taking time to develop and interlock. Episode one covers 1968-72, a formative period during which most of the personal narratives barely begin; it’s often not clear even what role the person speaking played. What the opening instalment <em>does</em> offer is a strong impression of how quickly injustice and difference can descend into extreme violence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/once-upon-a-time-in-northern-ireland-review-civil-war-rages-before-your-very-eyes">Continue reading...</a>

## Maryland review – no one is more moving than Suranne Jones

<p>Jones and Eve Best star in this joyful and incredibly affecting drama about two sisters forced to confront their mother’s mysterious death and double life</p><p>The ascendance of Suranne Jones from Coronation Street star to a creative force to be reckoned with over the last couple of decades has provided food for the soul as well as a feast of entertainment. Now the indefatigable Jones returns to the small screen (between the last series of Gentleman Jack and the second series of Vigil, arriving shortly) in the new ITV drama Maryland, directed by another former soap star, Susan Tully (Michelle Fowler, from the days when EastEnders was great in every way). Jones, who co-created Maryland with writer Anne Marie O’Connor, co-stars with Eve Best, who is one of the many faces here (Hugh Quarshie and Dean Lennox Kelly foremost among them) who make you cry: “Oh my God – yes! Why is this person not on my television more?!”</p><p>Maryland opens like a thriller, with a dead body discovered on a lonely stretch of beach on the Isle of Man and, soon after that, a woman taking delivery of a large package of smuggled drugs. This is a slightly unfortunate misdirection because it is not a thriller at all, but a chamber piece about family dynamics, female identity and ways of finding freedom before it is too late. The period of expectation-adjustment is a waste, but once get your eye in, it is a joy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/22/maryland-review-no-one-is-more-moving-than-suranne-jones">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jessica Hausner’s film, which avoids spelling out its obvious subject, focuses on a group of schoolgirls encouraged to live without food</p><p>Jessica Hausner is the Austrian director whose elegant, refrigerated style has made her a Cannes favourite and <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/25/lourdes-review">her 2009 film Lourdes</a>, about the ordinary world of miracles, is a 21st-century classic.

The “trigger warning” at the beginning of the film about these issues is fatuous, whether intended ironically or not. The deadpan mannerisms are glib, the line readings are torpid in the wrong way and the laborious drama leads us round and round and round like an Escher staircase. But it is certainly well shot by Martin Gschlacht and punctiliously designed by Beck Rainford.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/22/club-zero-review-not-much-to-chew-on-in-this-baffling-non-satire">Continue reading...</a>

That is in keeping with his prerogative powers to organise the composition of the government as he sees fit.

Her departure had been a long time coming. Ms Braverman had publicly contradicted her government’s more liberal stance on immigration. She left office a day before the Truss administration fell. Mr Sunak reappointed Ms Braverman to the Home Office less than a week later. Last December, MPs on the public administration and constitutional affairs committee <a href="https://twitter.com/CommonsPACAC/status/1598609885297451008?s=20" title="">warned</a> that this dishonourable affair set a “dangerous” precedent: “To allow this to take place does not inspire confidence in the integrity of government, nor offer much incentive to proper conduct in future”.

<p>A handsome victory for the centre-right is dismal news for those who have suffered from years of austerity</p><p>On Sunday night, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, triumphantly described his country’s general election result as an “earthquake”. After a remarkable <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/21/greeces-general-election-centre-right-party-far-ahead-as-votes-are-counted" title="">victory</a>, this piece of political hyperbole seemed almost justified.</p><p>Prior to the weekend, no ruling party had increased its vote share in Greece for more than 40 years. It had been predicted that a state <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/greeces-leader-faces-elections-amid-rule-of-law-concerns-7197d7fd" title="">wiretapping</a> scandal, and the background to a catastrophic rail accident in February, could damage Mr Mitsotakis’s prospects. Yet polls predicting a relatively close race proved wildly out, as the centre-right New Democracy party gained more than double the votes of its leftwing rival, Syriza. Having fractionally failed to win an absolute majority, Mr Mitsotakis may now trigger a second election – to be held under a different proportional system – which would be likely to hand him a handsome mandate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-greek-election-the-new-hegemony">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Another grim episode in Spain unfolded on Sunday night, but in confronting this, there is hope that it is inescapable now</p><p>This Sunday, for the first time in 1,285 games as a coach and 47 years in football, Carlo Ancelotti refused to talk about the game. He had just seen Real Madrid lose 1-0 to Valencia but, standing in the cramped, narrow tunnel that leads to the Mestalla dressing room where he said his best player sat “angry and sad”, he didn’t care about that and couldn’t comprehend anyone else caring either. So when the standard post-match interview began with the standard post-match question, an enquiry as to his thoughts on another defeat, he decided that, actually, no, this wasn’t going to be standard any more. Instead, he shot back: “You want to talk about football?! Or shall we talk about the other thing? That’s more important than a loss, don’t you think?”</p><p>Maybe this time, at last, some might begin to think so. If the Madrid manager didn’t feel much like talking about football, it was because Vinícius Júnior, the kid in his care, the 22-year-old winger who is probably the most electric, most exciting player in the Spanish league, a genuine superstar for a new generation, didn’t feel much like playing it any more. Why would he, why should he, when as he arrived at Mestalla a group of fans gathered outside had chanted: “Vinícius, you’re a monkey?” When from the south stand he had been told the same? When he had been told that he, a “<em>puto negro</em>”, was an idiot, an imbecile. When he had heard the <em>oooh ooohs</em>? When he had <em>seen</em> them?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/22/vinicius-junior-why-its-time-to-talk-about-anything-other-than-football">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Generations of fastmen have come and gone as the Manxman’s wins have increased and he approaches the end of an era as one of a kind</p><p>The words “end of an era” should not be lightly used, but when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/22/mark-cavendish-retire-from-professional-cycling-end-of-2023-season">Mark Cavendish hangs up his wheels</a> later this season the term will apply, absolutely. The Manxman’s glittering career has lasted nigh on 20 years, if his first world title in 2005 is taken as a starting point. In bike racing, he is almost unique for a sprinter, both in terms of longevity, and the depth and breadth of his results. Generations of fastmen have come and gone as Cavendish’s list of wins has lengthened over the years, and all the while, from a brash, motormouthed youth, ready for anything, “Cav” has morphed into an elder statesman, a fixture in the sport, if occasionally a slightly terse one.</p><p>The intensity of sprinters’ careers, as well as the frequent crashes, mean that as a breed of cyclist they rarely last long. To take just one example, the German powerhouse Marcel Kittel managed eight years, quitting at the age of 31. Cavendish’s absolute peak, the period where if he started a sprint stage of a major race it was virtually a given that he would win, lasted, arguably, from 2009 until 2012, when he became the only sprinter to win the iconic stage finish on the Champs-Élysées in four successive Tours de France, and was named by the newspaper L’Équipe as the best sprinter of all time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/22/mark-cavendish-cycling-manxman-tour-de-france">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Finnish film-maker’s sweet-natured odd-couple romance fills you with a feelgood glow and laughs in the face of Putin’s threat to the country</p><p>Aki Kaurismäki is the Finnish director who is notable for being not simply one of the directors who is always welcome in the Cannes competition, but also is one of the rarer subset who actually makes funny films; that is, actually-funny and not just arthouse-funny. Fallen Leaves is another of Kaurismäki’s beguiling and delightful cinephile comedies, featuring foot-tapping rock’n’roll. It’s romantic and sweet-natured, in a deadpan style that in no way undermines or ironises the emotions involved and with some sharp things to say about contemporary politics.</p><p>I found myself rooting for the hero and heroine here in an uncomplicated way that I hadn’t for any other film at Cannes. It’s something which should be adored by Finnish film fanciers – who will incidentally savour the silent cameo from Finnish director and Cannes competition veteran Juho Kuosmanen – but it’s really for everyone and despite the title, this is a movie with springtime in its heart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/22/fallen-leaves-review-deadpan-aki-kaurismaki-comedy-with-springtime-in-its-heart">Continue reading...</a>

I wish to highlight two dimensions to this cruel and unusual punishment that were prevalent when I interviewed men serving the sentence as part of doctoral research I conducted as a (now former) prison chaplain.</p><p>First, the risk they pose to the public is an important consideration to a parole board – rightly so. But the effect that indeterminate incarceration has on their wellbeing is not given proportionate weight. The deterioration in mental health with associated increased self-harm and suicide risks are well documented.

I was at school in the 1970s and a much-needed recipient of free school meals. Like Katriona, the teachers who “saw” me helped me to see past the shame I felt at being an outsider. I lived with an alcoholic mother and her abusive partner, and at the age of 12 I slept with my bedroom window unlocked so that I could jump from my first-floor room if needed, the insidious fear that her partner might rape me ever present. Shame kept me from ever telling anyone what was happening at home.</p><p>My mother kicked me out when I was 15, after her partner asked her to choose between us. I left school at 16, going straight into low-paid work. I took advantage of being able to retake my O-levels while claiming benefits and then did an access course that enabled me to complete a degree. I rewrote my story to a certain extent, but only because funding gave me that opportunity. The reference to there being a middle class “uniform” resonated; people assume so much because of how one dresses or speaks – they assume a set of shared values, and political and cultural beliefs. This is an important reminder and account of how wrong and outdated those assumptions are. I wish Katriona all the success and happiness she has fought for.<br /><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/saved-from-a-life-of-shame-by-teachers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nintendo’s new record-setting Zelda game allows players to get creative and make madcap vehicles and contraptions. Readers share their favourite experiences so far</p><p>The best thing is doing something random in the game – climbing up something, fighting something big and boss-like – before you’re actually supposed to in the story. I have been playing games since I was four, and I’ve always loved Zelda games for the freedom you get and the feeling you’ve done something you’re not supposed to that isn’t found in many other titles. I’d say so far – and I’m only a few hours in – there are two favourite moments for me. One is when cooking and hearing Link humming music from the series. The other was climbing a Skyview Tower, assuming I had to so I could see the world map, and reaching the top only to find ... nothing. Then moving along in the story and finding out what it was actually for! As always, pre-empting what I’m supposed to do in a Zelda game. <strong>Tom Fogden, 43, France </strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/22/readers-favourite-moments-from-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The home secretary could have sat in a room full of shamed drivers and no one would have recognised her. That’s how alienating these courses are</p><p>My Mr and I waste a lot of argument capital circling around the probable consequences of politicians’ misdemeanours. He thinks we’re in last-days-of-Rome territory, and all it will take is a revelation that Grant Shapps yelled at a waiter and the whole thing will come down like a Jenga tower. I, conversely, think the last days of Rome went on for a long time and, in a post-Johnson world, the bar is so low for probity and whatnot that a minister would have to commit murder for the consequences to even ricochet into the next week.</p><p>So I don’t think Suella Braverman has torched her own career if she did ask Whitehall officials to fix it for her to do a speed awareness course in private (although <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/suella-braverman-should-go-if-she-broke-ministerial-rules-says-starmer">she says she did “nothing untoward”</a>). But in the fanciful event that Mr Z is right and I am wrong, that Braverman’s trivial but telling act dispatches her to the wilderness of her party, it will have been the dumbest imaginable thing to lose a portfolio over.

<p>It is the most uncomfortable activity imaginable – yet mermaiding is booming. Say ‘shello!’ to the magical merfolk whose lives have been transformed by the addition of a shimmering tail</p><p>In a Las Vegas casino, a man lifts up his phone to film the creatures swimming in the 117,000-gallon aquarium at the Silverton hotel. Most have tails – but he is interested in the two women doing backflips underwater. Their colourful tails look thick and as if they might feel rubbery to touch. When one raises a hand to smile and wave, a little girl stares at her: could that actually <em>be</em> a mermaid?</p><p>These women are part of the <a href="https://circussirenpod.com/">Circus Siren Pod</a>, a performance group from Washington DC run by Morgana Alba, a no-nonsense, ex-military former circus performer who is its founder.

## ‘Rural life is being written out’: Gauri Gill on photographing India’s forgotten people

<p>From cobra-headed deities behind tills to the farmers who invaded Delhi, set up camp and stayed for a year, these uncompromising images reveal a side to the country that is rarely seen</p><p>Gauri Gill started out in her 20s, a Delhi-based photojournalist covering stories right across India. She’d drop in, drop back out, then later find herself wondering what had happened to all the people she had photographed. “In India, as across the world,” says Gill, “the rural is being written out. The city – and AI is an extreme extension of the city – leads us to think we can do everything through machines. But the actual people on the ground – the farmers, the peasants, the Adivasis [the term given to India’s indigenous peoples], the forest-dwellers, who have lived so beautifully and so sustainably on the earth and from whom we should be learning – are being crushed.”</p><p>In 1999, Gill saw a young girl being beaten by her teacher at a school near Jodhpur and decided this was something she needed to spend longer on. She pitched a story on village schools. When no commission came, Gill quit her job at a magazine and made her way back to the farthest reaches of Rajasthan, to the Thar desert. She wanted to record what life there was like, especially for women and girls. She could not look away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/22/rural-life-written-out-cobra-farmers-delhi-gauri-gill-on-photographing-indias-forgotten-people">Continue reading...</a>

But assuming Guardiola isn’t tempted to walk off into the sunset like Kwai Chang Caine at the end of an episode of Kung Fu if his side wins Big Cup, there is every reason to believe that with a bit of tinkering he will further soup-up and fine-tune his already relentless winning machine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/22/football-daily-email-manchester-city-champions">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Industry wants accountability to cover putting sewage spills right, not firms’ previous compliance</p><p>“We want to be held to account …” said Ruth Kelly, the new public face of the English water companies, last week, briefly raising hopes of a moment of reckoning for the industry’s past (and current) sewage spills. Then the chair of Water UK clarified what her version of accountability covers. The companies wish to be held to account “… for putting it right”.</p><p>The past 30 years, we were invited to think, should be considered an unfortunate chapter in which the industry, terribly unfortunately, didn’t give sewage spills enough attention while other investments were prioritised.

<ul><li>Koepka’s US PGA victory means he has five majors</li><li>Pete Cowen: ‘I think he will go another four’</li></ul><p>Pete Cowen, the English coach of Brooks Koepka, believes the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/21/brooks-koepka-becomes-first-liv-golfer-to-win-major-with-us-pga-triumph">newly crowned US PGA champion</a> can match the major-winning tallies of legends such as Ben Hogan and Gary Player. Koepka’s two-stroke success at Oak Hill means he has five majors to his name, including three US PGA titles.</p><p>Cowen, who coaches Koepka primarily on his short game, sees no reason for the 33-year-old to stop there. Hogan and Player won nine majors apiece. “He will win a lot more,” he said. “I certainly think he will go another four and he would obviously like a grand slam. Look at how many times he has been second or just missed out already. I thought he was an unbelievable player in 2018-2019 and he has got stronger.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/22/brooks-koepka-rival-greats-for-majors-pete-cowen-us-pga-golf">Continue reading...</a>

In a country where huge numbers of people are struggling every day, with almost a third of the population estimated to be at <a href="https://www.eapn.eu/poverty-watch-greece-poverty-watches-overview-2021/">risk of poverty</a>, the prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s rightwing New Democracy party managed to secure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/21/greeces-general-election-centre-right-party-far-ahead-as-votes-are-counted">40% of the vote</a> – a remarkable victory that no polling agency predicted.</p><p>The runner-up was the former prime minister Alexis Tsipras of the centre-left Syriza party, best known for its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/15/alexis-tsipras-bailout-greece-debt-crisis">turbulent confrontation</a> with the EU’s economic centres of power in 2015.

<p>After grieving for the late Taylor Hawkins, the Foos’ Preparing Music for Concerts livestream showcased new songs and new drummer Josh Freese with typical good humour</p><p>Were he not already a singer, multi-instrumentalist, writer and occasional actor, Dave Grohl could earn a living making life’s lemons into lemonade. The ex-Nirvana drummer started fronting Foo Fighters in the fallout of Kurt Cobain’s death; nearly 30 years later, they’re earnestly promoting themselves as “the last great American rock band”. A similar sense of answering immeasurable grief with tireless forward motion permeates the band’s latest return to the spotlight, a live stream to unveil their next phase.</p><p>Just over a year ago, in March 2022, Taylor Hawkins, the band’s drummer of 25 years, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/27/taylor-hawkins-drugs-found-in-body-of-foo-fighters-drummer">died of a sudden cardiac arrest</a> caused by an overdose of heroin, antidepressants and benzodiazepines. He was 50 years old. Fans mourned a musician so skilled that he somehow made the kit his own while sharing stages with Gen X’s favourite drummer; his bandmates publicly celebrated his life by playing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/04/taylor-hawkins-tribute-concert-review-stars-unite-to-honour-the-late-foo-fighters-drummer">two stadium-sized tribute shows</a> featuring guest appearances from everyone from Lars Ulrich to Kesha. But tonight’s live stream, titled Preparing Music for Concerts, is firmly focused on the present and future. The footage fades into view in black and white and begins with a scene of innocuous band banter: “Have you ever gotten into a fight with someone in your own band on stage?” Grohl randomly asks his four surviving cohorts. Their subsequent smiley reminiscences mark the first sign of normality in the Foos camp in more than a year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/22/swagger-power-and-all-star-cameos-foo-fighters-roar-back-with-new-drummer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Composer Brendan Angelides was cautious about agreeing to write the soundtrack for the latest edition of Ubisoft’s blockbuster. But then he met  Palestinian composer and orchestrator Akram Haddad</p><p>“I think, initially, Ubisoft approached me because of my electronic music background – my live career, my albums, my touring. But I didn’t know if I was the right person for the job, you know?”</p><p>Composer Brendan Angelides has never worked in video game music before. You might know him better as Eskmo or Welder, or perhaps as the mind behind the music of TV shows 13 Reasons Why or Billions. When Ubisoft approached him to be the composer for its sort-of reboot of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, Mirage, he had doubts. The game is set at the height of the Islamic golden age, and centres around Baghdad: a hub flowing with the lifeblood of a changing world, a cultural centre of art and science, old and new.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/22/assassins-creed-mirage-soundtrack-composer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Veteran jockey in positive mood after riding his ‘big horse’ around Tattenham Corner without a second thought</p><p>“It’s a lot of lasts,” Frankie Dettori said at Epsom on Monday morning, shortly after giving Arrest, his final Derby ride, a spin around Tattenham Corner before the Classic on Saturday week. “I went to Rome yesterday for my last Derby there.

<p>Far from being the preserve of weirdos, fandoms offer a model of community and wellbeing</p><p>Of the many films that dramatise the deranged behaviour of celebrity fans, one of the most popular is Der Fan, a German production from 1982 about a teenage girl obsessed with a pop singer. It begins predictably enough – she writes him dozens of letters – but the ending is a little less orthodox. When he doesn’t reply she intercepts him outside one of his gigs, hangs out in his dressing room, has sex with him, kills him with a statue, chops him up and puts the dismembered body parts in a freezer. Unsurprisingly, it has become a cult classic.</p><p>Like most works of its genre, Der Fan taps into a stereotype that fans have had to endure since the emergence of popular culture. Characterised as hysterics, fantasists, psychopaths, geeks, misfits or mindless consumers, they are feared either as obsessive loners who spend their lives fretting in their bedrooms (like the protagonists of most fan movies) or as members of a frenzied mob (screaming teenagers at a Harry Styles gig). The word is still associated with “fanatic” in the public consciousness. We assume that anyone with a consuming interest in a celebrity or fictional universe is this way inclined (unless they are a sports fan, in which case their behaviour is likely to be applauded).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/22/the-big-idea-why-you-should-embrace-your-inner-fan">Continue reading...</a>

He was getting a ride home from his coach, when their car was pulled over. Raised in a predominantly Black neighborhood of Queens, New York, Smith had a wary view of the police. He worried about the traffic stop of two Black men by a white officer. In the end, nothing happened, thanks to the unflappability of his coach – Hall of Famer Bill Russell, who told the cop he could give a ticket or a lecture, but not both. The officer recognized the 11-time NBA champion and let him go on his way.</p><p>“It was the first time, as an African American young man, that I had seen someone question authority that fast, that deliberate,” says Smith.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/22/kenny-smith-interview-charles-barkley-inside-the-nba">Continue reading...</a>

Chelsea manager Emma Hayes said of her departing captain: “Magda has been so pivotal to our success. For her to get that moment in her final home game, in front of the fans she loves, nothing will mean more to her. Everybody wanted that fairytale for her. She has been our captain and leader. I know the work that has gone on behind the scenes to get the team to where it is.” <strong>SR</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/22/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

With its two main characters Bramble and Briar, adorable bears who were abandoned by their mother in a forest fire, this environmentally conscious adventure is an entertaining, if rather formulaic, ride.</p><p>For lovers of cute animals, the CGI designs of the brothers are quite lovely and detailed, though not exactly distinctive. Goofy and optimistic Bramble believes that their mother is out there searching for them, but Briar holds no such hope. However, a chance encounter with Charlotte, an aspiring scientist, promises a new clue that would lead the pair to their long-lost mummy. What follows is an extravaganza of good versus evil, bears versus bots.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/22/boonie-bears-guardian-code-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘A cross between a flapjack, a Hobnob and multi-cereal, and dead easy to make’</p><p>“Would you like a biscuit?” Twice a day, mid-morning and mid-afternoon, Veronica pushed her trolley down the corridor and around the various departments serving tea, coffee and biscuits. Along with the boardroom drinks cabinet and stationery cupboard, Veronica was the best thing about Dad’s work. Despite manoeuvring a not-small trolley covered with warm cups and pots of boiling water, she seemed to move with more ease than anyone else in the building. Welcome everywhere, she knew everyone and what they needed, be that strong tea with milk and one sugar, or black with two pills of sweetener and a chocolate digestive.</p><p>While it was communal, the small kitchen was Veronica’s, and immaculate. She took the tea towels home, and made sure the biscuit tins were always full. When we visited as kids, those tins were hugely important. Like my grandma’s tin, they were filled with different combinations of the good ones: chocolate digestives, plain digestives, custard creams, bourbons, ginger nuts (Dad’s favourite, and not only because he, too, was ginger). I want to remember Hobnobs, too, which launched in 1985, the same year as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eastenders">EastEnders</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/20/in-praise-of-anglo-irish-agreement">Anglo-Irish agreement</a>.

<p>She’d snooze on me, and ask for treats whenever the fridge door was opened. How could I have denied her medical treatment, no matter what it cost?</p><p>The people who are most horrified that I spent about £2,000 on a hysterectomy for my guinea pig Ruby are usually dog owners who would spend 10 times that, if they could, on their dog. “Why didn’t you just get another one?” said a terrier owner I mentioned it to recently. “Would you just get another dog?” I asked. Most people are speciesist – it’s why we eat some animals but not others, and why many believe, in the pet hierarchy, the small ones are disposable.</p><p>Anyway, Ruby was like a little dog. Even though it was 20 years ago, I can picture buying her (from an open-farm attraction with – my dream! – a guinea pig village) more clearly than the births of my children. She was scampering around, a flash of smooth, shiny brown fur, and looked so much less inscrutable than the other guinea pigs for sale; I’ve had several in my life, and she was by far the most intelligent and engaging.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/the-pet-ill-never-forget-i-spent-2000-on-ruby-the-guinea-pigs-hysterectomy-and-i-dont-regret-a-penny">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Shakespeare’s Globe, London<br /></strong>Amped-up visual gags and a cast that brings its own distinctive comic gifts to the Bard’s dialogue ensure a contemporary feel to the classic comedy</p><p>Sean Holmes is associate artistic director at the Globe and there’s a lightness and ease about his Shakespeare productions that’s not to be scoffed at. The props and costumes here, wittily designed by <a href="https://www.paulwillsdesign.com/">Paul Wills</a>, have just the right amount of pizazz to raise a chuckle (who knew a gold chain could be genuinely funny?).

The use of this term – with its clear links to antisemitism – is just the latest example</p><p>This week, London played host to the National Conservatism conference, an orgy of rightwing anxieties about threats to the west and the future of Conservatism. The lineup saw an eclectic coalition of rightwing firebrands raising the alarm about the left’s purported plans for world domination via a “woke revolution”.</p><p>The fascistic undertones of this conspiratory narrative – which effectively calls on conservatives to save their country from an insidious alliance between progressives and minorities – sounded particularly pronounced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/15/low-birthrate-is-uk-top-priority-tory-mp-tells-rightwing-conference-miriam-cates">during a speech</a> by Tory MP Miriam Cates.

<p>A cautionary Bulgarian tale of nostalgia, an anarchic story set in South Korea and novels exploring motherhood are among this year’s contenders. But it’s hard to look beyond an account of undocumented migrants working as security guards…</p><p>The International Booker prize is the UK’s most prestigious award for translated fiction, with previous winners including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/11/greek-lessons-by-han-kang-review-loss-forges-an-intimate-connection">Han Kang</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/olga-tokarczuk">Olga Tokarczuk</a>. The prize money of £50,000 is divided equally between author and translator. This year’s winner will be announced on 23 May and the judging panel have produced a strong shortlist with a distinctive flavour: four brightly coloured, zestful novels and two, more restrained stories on the theme of motherhood.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/whale-9781787704336">Whale</a></strong></em> by <strong>Cheon Myeong-kwan</strong>, translated by Chi-Young Kim (Europa Editions, £14.99), is the South Korean author’s debut novel, first published in 2004. It’s an anarchic, often gruesome book – death by anvil, fire in a crowded theatre, a gangster who woos his beloved by sending her severed fingers – that succeeds through sheer charm. Central to his story is Geumbok, an ambitious young woman who dreams of building a cinema, and her daughter, Chunhui, a tall, muscular brick-maker. There’s so much going on that almost every subsection of each chapter could be a novella in itself, filled with old crones, physical grotesques and cartoonish violence. It’s not always easy to see whether the creaky descriptions of women – Geumbok’s “exceptionally wide rump”, Chunhui being “fat and unattractive, so unlike her mother” – are a satire of sexist attitudes or an enactment of them (Cheong cites Updike and Bukowski as key influences). Still, it is never, ever boring, even if the relentlessness is occasionally exhausting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/22/international-booker-prize-2023-cheon-myeong-kwan-gauz-eva-baltasar-georgi-gospodinov-guadalupe-nettel-maryse-conde">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Karima Saïdi’s documentary movingly tries to shore up memories from her mother’s life, but the ethics of the process are uneasy</p><p>While caring for her mother Aïcha who has Alzheimer’s, film-maker Karima Saïdi often asks her the simple yet loaded question: “Where do you live?” At one point, her mother replies: “In a handkerchief”; a strangely poetic answer that encapsulates the mental haze of her condition. At other times she speaks of her childhood in Tangier, or the family home in Brussels where she saw her children grow up. As Aïcha’s mind wanders, Saïdi’s documentary transforms into a haven for her memories, which are fading fast.</p><p>This cinematic nest is built from old home videos and photographs, which tell of a turbulent immigrant life in Belgium. Saïdi’s older sister Amina was forced into marriage at the age of 15, and her brothers Jamal and Mohamed both died relatively young. Told through Saïdi’s sombre voiceover, these tragic events also incur questions for Aïcha, who is urged for confirmation as well as further details.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/22/a-way-home-review-immigration-and-alzheimers-in-portrait-of-a-disappearing-past">Continue reading...</a>

Surely there are few characters who embody the spirit of that genre less than Tom Hanks’s slow-witted sprinter?

But you don’t really know who he is.”</p><p>This sobriquet, given to Ross by Black Thought, lead rapper of the Roots, is one of many endorsements that grace the cover of Ross’s new memoir, Son of the City, which details his career as one of the most successful industry executives of 90s hip-hop. The roster of rap royalty that fill the rest of the cover is a testament to Ross’s status: from Chuck D and Mike D to Questlove and Queen Latifah.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/22/dante-ross-hip-hop-de-la-soul-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The cramped stadium – like Luton the town – attracts ridicule but Saturday’s playoff final is a huge sliding doors moment</p><p>Shortly before 8pm last Tuesday, a remarkable act of transfiguration took place at Kenilworth Road. At that precise moment, Luton’s cramped and crumbling old stadium, with a capacity barely above 10,000, became a raging, roaring, hot-headed monster. The noise barely stopped for the next 90 minutes, at which point <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/16/luton-sunderland-championship-playoff-semi-final" title="">Luton’s players had seen off Sunderland</a> and were heading to a playoff final at Wembley – and the jokes and sneers about their old ground had resurfaced again on social media.</p><p>Does Kenilworth Road deserve to grace the Premier League? If Luton can get past <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/17/middlesbrough-coventry-championship-play-off-semi-final-match-report" title="">Coventry</a> on Saturday, the only answer is a punchy and unqualified yes. Sure it is no looker. Unlike Craven Cottage, also built in 1905, it will never attract the love of the blue plaque heritage brigade. The wooden main stand is so tight in places that you have to duck your head when you go to the toilet, while the away fans’ entrance in the Oak Road End looks down on residents’ gardens. Yet give me it over any soulless, out-of-town ground any day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/22/luton-kenilworth-road-premier-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pep Guardiola has two finals to plan for after City clinched the title while Unai Emery’s experience has lifted Villa</p><p>It barely mattered what happened on the pitch on Sunday, but another league win for City, their 12th in a row, maintained another ludicrous title-snaffling run. Now, though, Pep Guardiola needs to plot tactics for two very different finals – in the FA Cup against Manchester United, the local rivals whose treble they’re trying to emulate, and in the Champions League against Internazionale, who won’t leave them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/17/manchester-city-real-madrid-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report">the kind of spaces Real Madrid did</a> – while keeping his players fresh but in rhythm. This is not an exact science, as different personalities and different body types need different conditions to keep ticking along at their maximum – and the fear of missing out on history through injury will surely be present in the minds of some. So with Premier League games at Brighton and Brentford to come, expect to see those players who’ve not been starting regularly, with cameo appearances for regulars. Don’t be surprised if they then start slowly in either final … or be even less surprised if they blow both opponents away early. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/21/manchester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">Manchester City 1-0 Chelsea</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/nottingham-forest-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Nottingham Forest 1-0 Arsenal</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/liverpool-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Liverpool 1-1 Aston Villa</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/20/tottenham-brentford-premier-league-match-report">Tottenham 1-3 Brentford</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/22/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

## Why I stopped arguing about the climate emergency and tried the silent treatment instead | Helena Echlin

<p>The sensible methods didn’t work, so I became a member of the Red Rebel Brigade. Now I feel I’m doing something useful</p><p>My clown-white facepaint makes my skin feel tight and I’m scared my elaborate headdress is going to slip. It’s my first outing with the <a href="http://redrebelbrigade.com/">Red Rebel Brigade</a>, the silent climate activist performance group. About a dozen of us are clad in robes, veils and evening gloves – all a bright blood-red. We glide to our local <a href="https://sharklays.co.uk/">Barclays bank</a> to stand in a tableau of grief. We are meant to aim for the faraway stare of “a watcher through the ages”, but I’m afraid I look more like someone stuck in a slow queue at Sainsbury’s. I suddenly catch the eye of someone I know as they walk past, staring at me like I’m bonkers. But I’ve tried the sensible ways of doing something about the climate crisis. I’ve written letters to politicians, carried placards and had endless conversations. At best, I just put people’s backs up. So I’ve decided to shut up and wrap myself in a red sheet instead.</p><p>Two years before this, on the morning of 9 September 2020, I woke in my home in Berkeley, California, to a Plutonian twilight. Smoke from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/30/california-wildfires-north-complex-record">latest wildfire</a> had mixed with the fog in a blanket that shorter wavelengths of light couldn’t penetrate. I tried to explain away the darkness to my kids but I felt like a parent in biblical Egypt, claiming everything was fine while frogs rained from the sky. My husband and I had worried about California’s escalating drought and wildfires for years, but after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Skies_Day#cite_note-3">Orange Skies Day</a> we decided we’d had enough. Time to move back to my native UK.

I first met him in 1969, in Paris, when we both found ourselves staying in the same apartment on the Île Saint-Louis for a few days. I was 17, Martin was 20. I only realised who this Martin guy was four years later when his first novel, The Rachel Papers, appeared. In a strange but real sense, he was the first writer I had ever met. And thus began an acquaintance as an avid reader and later as a friend.</p><p>The remarkable thing about that first novel was the utter confidence and distinctiveness of the narrative voice. Martin found his style at the very beginning of his career as a writer and it never changed. That voice he had defined and charged everything else he wrote – fiction, essays, journalism, memoirs. Very few writers can be instantly identified by a sentence or two of their prose – Laurence Sterne, Charles Dickens, James Joyce, DH Lawrence, Vladimir Nabokov – and Martin precociously joined that elite group and stayed there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/22/william-boyd-martin-amis-ferociously-intelligent-very-funny">Continue reading...</a>

But there’s an unsettling ambivalence to his help, expressed in their fraught confrontations and intense embraces; an incestuous undertone that younger brother Dakko (Khetag Bibilov), who tries to climb into Ada’s bed like a small child, is also subject to.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/22/unclenching-the-fists-review-claustrophobic-drama-full-of-trauma-and-tenderness">Continue reading...</a>

## This tiny Channel Island – population 65 – feels like a place cut adrift: exploring car-free Herm

<p>A short ferry ride from Guernsey takes you to the tranquil beauty of an island where time moves slowly and nature is embraced </p><p>At 6.30am, I walk to the empty beach at Belvoir Bay. The sand is soft, the sky is pink, Normandy lines the horizon. The only sounds are the murmur of the waves and the piping of oystercatchers. I plunge into the sea. Immediately, the cove is filled with terrible swearwords: I force myself to stay in the water, spluttering and cursing but growing less cold with each swimming stroke. Hours later, sipping coffee while overlooking another deserted beach, my skin is still zinging and my mood is irritatingly smug.</p><p>A dunking in the bay is an apt way to start the day on Herm. The tiny, comma-shaped Channel Island – stretching just under 1.5 miles from top to bottom, and less than half a mile across – feels like a place cut adrift. This is emphatically a good thing. The island has a permanent population of 65 and a history that yawns back to the Neolithic era. Puffins breed on its southern cliffs; rabbits nibble in its flower meadows; migrant <a href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/warbler-family/">warblers</a> cluster in its pine groves. You’ll find no cars, or even bikes, and the primary school has four pupils. The island’s name sounds like a hesitation, but its pretty hills, woods and beaches demand to be savoured in the here and now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/22/herm-channel-islands-car-free">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Young adults stranded in the family home have been abandoned by politicians who view them as an afterthought</p><p>A huge social shift is happening that has barely been noticed, let alone understood. Earlier this month, the Office for National Statistics <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/moreadultslivingwiththeirparents/2023-05-10#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20around%201%20in,4.9%20million%20in%20Census%202021">revealed data</a> from the 2021 census about the number of adults in England and Wales living with their parents: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/10/number-adults-living-parents-england-wales-up-700000-decade">4.9 million of them</a>, up nearly 15% on the figure for 2011. The fact that the stats were collected in the midst of the Covid crisis may suggest a blip, but the ONS is adamant that the rise “appears to be a continuing trend rather than a result of the pandemic”.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/21/record-levels-young-adults-living-home-ons">Ten years ago</a>, it reported record levels of such living arrangements, and the latest numbers are even more striking. Men outnumber women by three to two. The share of 20- to 24-year-olds living in the family home is 51.2%, up from 44.5% 10 years ago, and for those aged 30 to 34, the figure is nearly 12%. Almost half of single-parent families now have adult children at home. In London, one in four households had at least one adult child in the home, and in five London boroughs, the average age of what the ONS calls “adult children living with their parents” is 26. The numbers in more rural places are often almost as remarkable: in Dorset, for example, that description applies to <a href="https://planetradio.co.uk/greatest-hits/dorset/news/almost-2-in-10-young-adults-in-dorset-live-at-home/">nearly 20%</a> of the grownup population.</p><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/22/generation-living-parents-tory-housebuilding-young-adults">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He exploded into the tweedy world of literature, a young, pouting and outrageously brash crusader for prose. Our writer remembers her encounters with the novelist, whose smarts and chutzpah confounded his peers</p><p>‘You’ll be reading me every now and then at least until about 2080, weather permitting. And when you go, maybe my afterlife, too, will come to an end, my afterlife of words.” So wrote Martin Amis in his heavily autobiographical final novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/19/inside-story-by-martin-amis-review-a-curious-mashup-of-fiction-and-memoir">Inside Story</a> in 2020. With a body of work spanning 50 years, he leaves 15 novels, two short-story collections, one memoir and seven book-length works of journalism and history. Did posterity matter to him? Hell, yes. “There is only one value judgment in literature: time,” he insisted.</p><p>Back in 2009, I called Amis – as editors all over the world would have been calling or emailing leading writers on Saturday night – to ask if he might write a tribute to the American novelist John Updike, who had just died. Time was tight and we were aiming high, but as with every major (and not so major) event at that time, Amis was the writer everyone was after. And on Updike, the last postwar American literary giant? It had to be him. Happily, he felt a duty to contribute to what Gore Vidal called “book chat”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/22/martin-amis-literature-crusader-peers-chutzpah">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Ethiopian-born computer scientist lost her job after pointing out the inequalities built into AI. But after decades working with technology companies, she knows all too much about discrimination</p><p>‘It feels like a gold rush,” says Timnit Gebru. “In fact, it <em>is</em> a gold rush. And a lot of the people who are making money are not the people actually in the midst of it. But it’s humans who decide whether all this should be done or not. We should remember that we have the agency to do that.”</p><p>Gebru is talking about her specialised field: artificial intelligence. On the day we speak via a video call, she is in Kigali, Rwanda, preparing to host a workshop and chair a panel at an international conference on AI. It will address the huge growth in AI’s capabilities, as well as something that the frenzied conversation about AI misses out: the fact that many of its systems may well be built on a huge mess of biases, inequalities and imbalances of power.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/22/there-was-all-sorts-of-toxic-behaviour-timnit-gebru-on-her-sacking-by-google-ais-dangers-and-big-techs-biases">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After decades locked alone in small cages in California’s San Quentin prison, men sentenced to die for their crimes are being moved off death row. Sam Levin investigates</p><p>For decades, the notorious San Quentin prison in California has been home to some of the US’s most dangerous criminals, sentenced to die for their offences. But California has not had an execution since 2006. In March, the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, announced he would be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/16/california-san-quentin-prison-rehabilitation-center-reform-gavin-newsom">transforming San Quentin</a> into a “rehabilitation centre” modelled after facilities in Norway, which have few restrictions and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/18/halden-most-humane-prison-in-world">prioritise</a> comfortable conditions and preparing people to come home.</p><p>Newsom, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/12/california-governor-to-place-moratorium-on-death-penalty">halted executions</a> in 2019, has pledged to close the housing units that make up death row, the largest in the country, to make way for the “pre-eminent restorative justice facility in the world”. As <strong>Sam Levin </strong>tells <strong>Hannah Moore, </strong>the 546 San Quentin residents on death row will continue to have<strong> </strong>death sentences but will be transferred to the general population of<strong> </strong>prisons across the state – which is likely to give them some basic amenities and small freedoms of movement they’ve been denied for decades.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/may/22/why-california-is-dismantling-death-row-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
