What is your addiction?\n\nJonathan: Porn.\n\n\u2026\n\nVeritas Journalist: It\u2019s safe to assume that you\u2019re attracted to children?\n\nJonathan: I did have a fetish. I have therapy to help me get over that addiction.\n\nJonathan also described an occasion in which he attempted to obtain child pornography:\n\nVeritas Journalist: From your account it says, \u201cMake a video I f**ked a little girl in the school basement.\u201d I just wanted to ask you what that was, what you meant by it. Like... were you telling the truth?\n\nJonathan: No, that was just a bluff. It was a lie. And I only did that to kind of lure her. Lure the female pedophile for her -- kind of -- just to tempt her into sending something.\n\nVeritas Journalist: So, you were trying to receive child porn at that time?\n\nJonathan: I was. Yeah, through making a lie about that.\n\nMontgomery told Veritas that he came forward because he trusted Veritas\u2019 journalism. He believes that exposing potential pedophiles to protect children is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\n\u201cAm I scared of the legal implications? Obviously, yes. I don\u2019t want to go through any legal ramifications for trying to do a good thing [by exposing pedophiles]. I had no bad intentions.
