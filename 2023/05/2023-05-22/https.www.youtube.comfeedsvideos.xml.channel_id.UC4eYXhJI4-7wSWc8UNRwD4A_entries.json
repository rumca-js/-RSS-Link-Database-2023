As the keyboardist Galen Clark adds grace notes supporting gently unyielding guitar, Tivel sings of a young bystander who, because of the way he looks, is transfigured from witness to a crime to alleged perpetrator and, finally, its most tragic victim. \u201cBlack Umbrella\u201d is the epic at the broken heart of Tivel\u2019s exquisite 2022 album Outsiders, which like all of her music chronicles the lives of the overlooked, misunderstood and vulnerable. As always, Tivel\u2019s remarkable empathy elevates her folk-based, jazz-touched compositions from mere stories to secular prayers.\n\nSometimes Tivel is the vulnerable one. \u201cWhat if flying doesn\u2019t take, and we\u2019re alive only to ache?\u201d she sings in the closer \u201cRoyal Blue,\u201d a song to a best friend that\u2019s as unguarded as it is hopeful. Her ease here with Clark and the drummer Micah Hummel, whose gentle embellishments complement Tivel\u2019s modest ways, comes from much time in their van, crossing continents. Inside their swirling arrangements, Tivel\u2019s portraits of pain and resilience become hypnotic, like dreams, like reality as we cope with it, always unfolding. \u201cIs there something that you want to say?\u201d she intones in the new and unreleased song \u201cFluorescence in the Future.\u201d Thing is, Anna\u2019s already said it. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cFluorescence in the Future\u201d\n\u201cBlack Umbrella\u201d\n\u201cHeroes\u201d\n\u201cRoyal Blue\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nAnna Tivel: vocals, acoustic guitar, \nGalen Clark: keyboards \nMicah Hummel: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen \nDirector/Editor: Sofia Seidel \nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter \nVideographers: Sofia Seidel, Maia Stern, Michael Zamora \nAudio Assistant: Neil Tevault\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Hazel Cills, Marissa Lorusso, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galv\u00e1n, Jill Britton\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #annativel", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bALUVyGZh0", "date_published": "2023-05-22 09:00:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
