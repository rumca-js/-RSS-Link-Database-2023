  <p id="5xlzWp">Feel like an article is clickbait-y? Artifact, the AI-powered news app from Instagram’s co-founders, now has a tool that lets you feel like you can do something about it. In the latest version of the app, which is now available, you can flag articles you think are clickbait. The feedback will be used as “a signal in ranking so we can better prioritize helpful articles over misleading ones for the community,” <a href="https://medium.com/artifact-news/new-features-on-artifact-launching-today-de9047ce2bb">Artifact writes in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p id="euAlsv">To start, Artifact will be monitoring the most reported articles and then deciding what it might want to do in response. That includes options like reducing an article’s distribution in feeds or even modifying the headline in some way to be less misleading, Artifact’s Kevin Systrom tells <em>The Verge</em> over...</p>

  <p id="ugFfUj">Paramount Plus will go up in price on June 27th. That’s when the company plans on launching its new Paramount Plus with Showtime integration, bringing the price of its existing ad-supported essential plan from $4.99 to $5.99 per month and its premium plan from $9.99 to $11.99, the latter of which will now include Showtime.</p>
<p id="aN71Ae">Previously, Paramount Plus had two separate premium plans: one without Showtime, for $9.99 per month, and another with Showtime, for $11.99 per month. These changes do away with that intermediate plan, which offered just Paramount Plus content and ad-free streaming <em>without</em> Showtime. The service will continue to offer its essential plan without Showtime and with ads.</p>
<p id="03h0Qa">Paramount also says it will sunset its Showtime app...</p>

  <p id="WlxS3w">The race to cram heavier and heavier batteries into bigger and bigger electric vehicles hit a speed bump today when a major automaker CEO finally threw up his hands and asked why. </p>

<p id="3oU4hd">The lawsuit comes less than a week after Montana Governor Greg Gianforte signed SB 419, the first state bill to ban the popular video app. The law, set to go into effect January 2024, would prohibit TikTok from operating “within the territorial jurisdiction of Montana” and would force mobile app stores to make the app unavailable for download within the state. </p>

  <p id="0qW8Gg">Netflix is making improvements to its My List feature so that you can more easily sort through the shows and movies you’ve bookmarked. Starting first on Android, you’ll be able to filter your list by movies, TV shows, “Haven’t Started,” “Started,” and sort by options like when you added something to your list, release dates, and alphabetically, Netflix spokesperson Layal Brown tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p>
<p id="aY6eGX">The new tools should be really handy. Depending on how much of a bookmarker you might be (welcome to the club!), the sorting options could be a really clutch way to sift through the potentially many things you’ve added to the list. Brown says this will roll out first on Android beginning Monday, and it will come to iOS over “the next few weeks.”</p>

  <p id="CnoXa9">GM has announced it’s <a href="https://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2023/may/0522-escalade.html">working on an all-electric version</a> of the luxury full-size Cadillac Escalade SUV, called the Escalade IQ.</p>
<p id="dtnyyi">The Escalade IQ joins Cadillac’s other EVs, which include the ultra-luxury and limited Celestiq and the more attainable Lyriq SUV, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23522467/cadillac-lyriq-ev-review-specs-photos-price">starts at $64,000</a>. It’s all part of GM’s plan to make the luxury brand exclusively an EV label by 2030.</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="RJ345t"><div></div></aside></div>
<p id="lsnpgv">GM’s Ultium platform is the basis for its current and upcoming electric vehicles, including the Chevy Equinox EV, Silverado, and even the GMC Hummer EV — and presumably this one as well. Many of the electric vehicles from multiple automakers are leaning into larger SUVs in the US market as demand for them increases. Kia’s EV9 is one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23659267/kia-ev9-full-size-suv-pics-specs-battery-range-lidar-adas">hotly anticipated three-row</a> SUV that...</p>

  <p id="AXxKvg">Tevina Willis taped up her windows as Superstorm Sandy neared her Red Hook, Brooklyn, home. Outside her apartment, hurricane winds pushed a wall of water into the city. The storm surge swept boats from the harbor onto streets turned into rivers. Willis rode it out. “I had been through hurricanes in the projects when I was a child,” she says. “I knew just to be calm and sit away from the windows, away from glass.”</p>
<p id="zXjZgB">Two days later, the storm subsided. But for Willis and others in Red Hook, the disaster was just the beginning. New York City’s infrastructure was mangled. Power and telecommunications lines — even cellphone networks — had gone down. Her building inside the Red Hook Houses, a public housing complex where she lived, was left...</p>

  <p id="IA9gaT">Venmo is introducing a new service that allows parents to open a Venmo account for children between the ages of 13-17 to send and receive money via the app. Venmo Teen accounts also come with a debit card and controls for parents to monitor transactions and manage their child’s privacy settings — important because Venmo has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22459163/venmo-privacy-controls-friends-list-joe-biden">routinely criticized</a> for its lack of privacy protections in the past.</p>
<p id="oXaM3S">Parents or legal guardians must sign up for a Venmo Teen account on behalf of their children. Each Venmo Teen account is connected to the parent’s personal Venmo account, which allows guardians to send money to their teen, monitor their account balance and transactions, and manage their privacy settings. Up to five Venmo Teen accounts can be...</p>

  <p id="y6L0hc">Earlier this year on the 8th of May I deleted all my tweets, just under 5,000 of them. I know the exact day because I <a href="https://twitter.com/jjvincent/status/1655572613157068809">tweeted about it</a>.</p>
<p id="6mkzvC">This morning, though, I discovered that Twitter has restored a handful of my old re-tweets; interactions I <em>know</em> I scrubbed from my profile. Those re-tweets were gone. I remember surveying my bare timeline with satisfaction before thinking, “great, time to draw attention to myself.” But now they’re back. You can see them by scrolling down my timeline past May 8th, with even more appearing if you select “<a href="https://twitter.com/jjvincent/with_replies">tweets with replies</a>.” </p>

## Meta hit with record-breaking $1.3 billion fine over Facebook data transfers to the US

  <p id="m0nmBg">Meta has been hit with a record-breaking $1.3 billion fine (€1.2 billion) by EU data regulators, and ordered to stop transferring the Facebook data of EU citizens to the US, according to reports from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-22/meta-fined-record-1-3-billion-in-eu-over-us-data-transfers?srnd=premium&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-hits-meta-with-record-e1-2b-privacy-fine/"><em>Politico</em></a>. EU courts believe such data transfers expose EU citizens to privacy violations — a complaint that stems back to 2013 and revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about US mass surveillance programs.</p>
<p id="yaWYsv">The ruling was made by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), which said that that the current legal framework for data transfers to the US “did not address the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms” of Facebook’s EU users, reports <em>Politico</em>. The fine exceeds the previous EU record of €746 million levied...</p>

  <p id="Tnelhw">Lego has announced a new premium set based on 1980s arcade classic Pac-Man. The 2,650-piece set is designed to recreate a Pac-Man arcade cabinet, complete with an illuminating coin-slot, four-way joystick, and a mechanical chase. </p>
<p id="8PfwS1">There’s a crank on the side of the cabinet which you can turn to move the characters around the game’s maze, and the set comes with a diorama of a figurine playing a smaller version of the arcade cabinet. On top of the cabinet sit rotating versions of Pac-Man and the ghosts Blinky and Clyde.</p>
