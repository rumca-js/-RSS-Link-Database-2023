	Chadwick Moore is working on a biography of Tucker Carlson. I don't know if you know this or not, but <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-elon-musk" target="_blank">Tucker was recently fired from Fox News</a>. The <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/megyn-kelly-tucker-carlson-fox" target="_blank">network's ratings are in the toilet</a>. It's a whole thing.
</p><p>
	What no one knows is WHY Tucker was fired. Moore -- who is working on a BIOGRAPHY of Carlson, in case you missed that -- has an inside source on what led to the #1 media personality being shit-canned.

	Two big revelations. One is that the day he was fired, Tucker was planning to talk about<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/who-ray-epps" target="_blank"> Ray Epps and January 6th</a>. Moore had seen a draft of Tucker's monologue for what would have been that Monday's show.
</p><blockquote>
	That monologue dealt with, among other things, investigations around January 6th, and particularly Ray Epps, the only person captured on video inciting people to violence at the Capitol that day, and allegedly an FBI informant.
</blockquote><p>
	Also, there was a double secret condition with the Dominion settlement that Carlson had to be wished well in his future endeavors.
</p><blockquote>
	His firing was a condition demanded by Dominion as part of the settlement with Fox. Although Dominion has denied this, my sources have intimate knowledge of the situation and they have assured me even before this news leaked that that is in fact the truth.
</blockquote><p>
	Here's the thing. Everyone has their theories about why Tucker was ousted. You have theories. I have theories. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-vanity-fair-show" target="_blank">Alex Jones has theories</a>. That's what makes this next tweet very interesting.

## Watch: Former ESPN host goes scorched Earth on "mediocre men" competing in girls' sports, calls Lia Thomas a bigot

That's at least how I know her best. She left the WWE for ESPN. Then she realized that ESPN only allows people to have one opinion and it wasn't an opinion she agrees with. Now she is with the crew at Outkick. One of the opinions she was not allowed to have at the Disney-owned sports channel is that girls are girls and boys are boys.</p><p>That is not an issue at her current employer if this Daily Mail interview is any indication.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><blockquote>'We're getting mediocre males who want to cross over into women's competition."</blockquote><p>Speaking of which, few were more mediocre than Will Thomas, who <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/her-rankings-have-bounced-from-462-as-a-male-to-1-as-a-female-16-lia-thomas-teammates-sign-letter-asking-penn-not-to-sue-ncaa-bar-thomas-from-competing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only ranked #462 as a male swimmer</a>. Upon completing male puberty, Will transitioned to Lia Thomas and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-ncaa-victory" target="_self">crushed the competition in the 500-meter girls' freestyle</a> becoming an NCAA champion. Where Lia, <a href="https://meaww.com/lia-thomas-women-uncomfortable-changing-in-locker-room-with-trans-u-penn-swimmer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who still had Will's genitalia, and still dated women</a> just like those who were born male and went through puberty as males with male genitalia have been traditionally known to do, was allowed to walk around balls out in the girls' locker room.  Allegedly. Girls <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-congressional-hearing" target="_blank">who allegedly had a problem with it</a> were told <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out" target="_blank">their lives would allegedly be over if they said anything</a>.</p><p>Charly thinks Lia is a bigot, and she makes a convincing argument.</p><blockquote>I think she's the biggest bigot that I have encountered in recent times because she is forcing her own beliefs onto other people and saying that if you don't believe in this, then you're a hateful person.<br /><br />You were a mediocre athlete in terms of male competition, and then you decided that you wanted to jump up the ladder and enter into the women's competition.<br /></blockquote><p>Arnolt comes across as a stickler for "science" and "biology" and "facts" in that boys are built differently than girls and some of those differences give anyone born a boy certain athletic advantages. Look no further than the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-track-star-california" target="_blank">California state track championships</a>. Or the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/skateboarding-29-year-old" target="_blank">29-year-old skateboarder crushing the dreams of a 13-year-old</a>.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how honest Arnolt is allowed to continue to get. Outkick is owned by Fox News, <a href="https://redstate.com/bonchie/2023/05/22/shocking-fox-news-employee-handbook-on-gender-transition-leaks-shows-what-tucker-carlson-was-up-against-n749702" target="_blank">which we're finding out today is protective of its ESG score</a>. Some of this trans talk might be as "spicy" as shotgunning beers with Dylan Mulvaney.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Mike Rowe delivers 'college commencement address' that drops a steaming deuce all over college

You have taken on a massive amount of debt for a piece of paper that may or may not help you get a job. Now you get to sit through a commencement address from a leftist politician or celebrity to tell you how much anyone who disagrees with them on any single issue. There will be a party. You'll be drunk all summer. Then you have to figure out the rest of your life while finding out the hard way that your humanities degree is worthless.</p><p>That's why Mike Rowe's commencement address from a few years ago is required viewing every year. A salute to those students who came to the proper conclusion instead of wasting money, they'd like to make money instead.</p><p>Yes, this commencement address does serve as a commercial for his <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mike-rowe-attacked-scholarship" target="_blank">controversial work ethic scholarship</a> (assuming you don't know what the word controversial means), but like most of Rowe's videos, he makes important points in a humorous way.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The only college commencement address you need. <a href="https://t.co/u0RcNqa9Mx">pic.twitter.com/u0RcNqa9Mx</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1660673750323396611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><em>"As you advance in the skilled trades, don't completely dismiss the liberal arts just because the cost of a degree has become scandalous. Fact is, universities are no longer the sole repositories of worthwhile information. If you have a smartphone and a connection to the internet, then you have access to every single thing currently for sale in the classrooms and lecture halls of America's finest universities FOR FREE!"</em><br /></p><p>On behalf of the class of 1998, who is in a career that didn't exist when he went to college and who went to community and state college for a grand total of under $10,000, a four-year university degree isn't everything it's advertised to be. Especially seeing how for most of the people I know IRL who are doing something they love and/or are successful at, it's something they didn't go to school for. What's more important is your work ethic and being able to identify opportunity when it reveals itself to you so that you don't waste it. </p><p>But that's just me. If you want a crippling amount of debt for a liberal arts degree that you're going to find out four years later is worthless, that's cool too.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Adeline Johnson, who is a girl and has only ever been a girl, finished fourth and will be missing out on the state championship opportunity.</p><p>Not everyone felt it was fair that Athena -- who raced as a boy in the first half of xir high school career -- was allowed to race and take opportunities from lifelong girls.

## The new sign you might be a white supremacist dropped, and it's if you wake up early in the morning

Starting today I was up at 4:30 AM to hit the gym before work. Imagine my surprise to discover I'm a tool for white supremacy! This is according to a tool who claims <a href="https://medium.com/@anthonybernardi/why-waking-up-early-is-rooted-in-white-supremacy-f487b04376f1" target="_blank">waking up early is so totally rooted in it</a>.</p><p>I have no idea why this random Medium post is trending (shout out <a href="https://notthebee.com/article/why-waking-up-early-is-rooted-in-white-supremacy" target="_blank">Not the Bee</a>), but I also didn't know Medium was still a thing. And I never know why things trend. I'm just here to mock.</p><p>You'll be happy to know the early-rising "ideology" -- yes, getting up early is its own ideology -- is NOT inherently racist. But if you are a Rise-n-Grindist, you have to examining the broader historical and social contexts. Historical and social context so broad, it is more or less anything that has happened in history ever. </p><p>However, it's the soft bigotry of low expectations where this post signals its virtue so bright you'll burn your retina.</p><blockquote>It places the blame for economic disparities on the individual, rather than acknowledging the systemic barriers that hinder the success of marginalized communities. By promoting the notion that anyone can achieve success if they simply work hard and wake up early, it ignores the structural racism that has created and maintained these inequalities.</blockquote><p>Anyone who works hard <em><strong>CAN</strong></em> achieve success. White progressives are the ones signaling out a group and telling them they can't succeed on their own without white progressive help.</p><p>Also, does my man not think black people have alarm clocks? Because while I was out there banging and clanging away at 4:58 this morning, the gym was already full of people getting at it -- half of them with more melanin in their skin than me.</p><p>It was when I read the words "school-to-prison pipeline" that I realized what was going on here. The author is looking to launch a career as a social justice writer, so he's picking random things to call raaaaaacist. The suburbs and public schools, per the writer,  are also signs of white supremacy. Basically, if it is something this kid doesn't like, it has roots in raaaaacism.</p><p>And of course, there's this after his "get up early" post went viral:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Is Alt-Right still a thing? I thought we were all insurrectionists and/or MAGA extremists now. Someone may want to upload an update to whatever AI program he's using.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## AP circles the wagons, celebrates John Fetterman dressing like a slob: "Redefining fashion"

The Associated Press leaped into action, caping for the unintelligible senator with claims his dressing like a slob is part of his mental recovery. Suddenly, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/john-fetterman-msnbc" target="_blank">NBC News launching the John Fetterman Presidential Exploratory Committee</a> seems less pathetic.</p><p>And look, my man. I get it. Hoodies and shorts season is the best season. That's my work uniform. I'm also a blogger who doesn't view his dressing like a slob as a virtue to signal.

So Fetterman is a six-year-old whose mommy made him get dressed up for a family party.<br /></p><p>Or, he's the next Kim Kardashian.

<p>When I was in college, a friend of mine wanted to cut a hole in the front and back of a t-shirt and wear it sideways. He wanted to see if it would trend. We both also smoked a lot of pot back then. Now I want someone to dress Fetterman up like that. Tell him it's how the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mexico-philadelphia-ad" target="_blank">unhoused homeless people in Philadelphia (of which there are many)</a> are dressing and say it would stand in solidarity. Let's see THAT celebrated in the press.</p><p>It would take conservatives making fun of him first. But let's be honest. The AP will write whatever a Democrat staffer asks them to.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
