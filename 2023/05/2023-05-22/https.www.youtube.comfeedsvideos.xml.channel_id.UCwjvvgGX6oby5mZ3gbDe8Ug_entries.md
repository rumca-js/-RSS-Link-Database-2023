It can be said that the Philippines is one of the few countries in Southeast Asia that is not included in the economic track of China. The Chinese government has been "luring" the Philippines, but the latter hasn't really tasted much of the sweetness. 
In recent years, one of the notable practices of the CCP has been to hound the Philippines from time to time not to follow the U.S. on the Taiwan Strait issue. The sudden Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 should have made the Philippines believe that war is actually not too far away.
