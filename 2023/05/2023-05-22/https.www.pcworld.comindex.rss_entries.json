An update released in early May has been bricking select HP OfficeJet printers&mdash;and the fix still isn&rsquo;t available yet, leaving owners to stare at a blue error-code screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/hp-rushes-to-fix-bricked-printers-after-faulty-firmware-update/&amp;xcust=2-2-1925926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bleeping Computer</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.engadget.com/hp-officejet-printers-are-bricking-following-a-recent-software-update-223559237.html&amp;xcust=2-2-1925926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Engadget</a>, pleas for help have poured into the HP support forums since the second week of May about error code 83C0000B, which appears on affected printers&rsquo; touchscreens. With no other way to interact with the printer (and attempt a factory reset), customers worldwide have been stuck with nonfunctioning devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Printers susceptible to this issue include OfficeJet 9020e series models like the Pro 9022e, Pro 9025e, Pro 9020e All-in-One, and Pro 9025e All-in-One. HP said in a statement to Bleeping Computer that only a &ldquo;limited number&rdquo; of users have been hit by this error, and that it is &ldquo;diligently&rdquo; working on a fix. If your printer is still operational, keep it offline (that is, disconnect it from the internet) so that it doesn&rsquo;t download the bad software update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those experiencing the issue should contact customer support via the support website <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.hp.com&amp;xcust=2-2-1925926-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://support.hp.com</a>. In the forums, customers have reported that sending in the printer for service is the only tangible resolution available at the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, the main issue with HP printer firmware has been the steady spread of the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;dynamic security&rdquo; policy, which blocked use of third-party ink cartridges. Though workarounds exist for some models (as <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1656073/these-hp-printers-can-be-upgraded-to-allow-third-party-printer-ink.html\">we detailed in a recent article</a>), this additional debacle won&rsquo;t leave positive associations with HP&rsquo;s firmware updates&mdash;a problem in and of itself, given how many people don&rsquo;t concern themselves with the <em>actual</em> security and feature improvements that firmware (as a general concept) addresses.</p>\n\nPrinters</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925926/an-hp-firmware-update-is-bricking-printers-and-theres-no-fix-yet.html", "date_published": "2023-05-22 18:34:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "A Twitter bug is reviving deleted tweets and retweets", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, Twitter. What a trash fire. There&rsquo;s now a Twitter bug that&rsquo;s resorting deleted tweets and retweets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On May 8th, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/22/23732497/twitter-bug-restoring-deleted-tweets-retweets&amp;xcust=2-2-1925563-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Verge</a>&lsquo;s senior reporter James Vincent deleted around 5,000 of his tweets. Today, he discovered that the social media platform reinstated a bunch of those tweets and retweets. In fact, Twitter restored an old video Vincent had posted about the George Floyd protests, which is three-years-old at this point. Several other users also reported seeing the issue. What the actual heck, Twitter? </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">A Twitter bug is restoring deleted tweets and retweets &mdash; including my own <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/KvEs8dI3D0&amp;xcust=2-2-1925563-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://t.co/KvEs8dI3D0</a> via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/verge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-2-1925563-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Verge</a></p>&mdash; Eliot Higgins (@EliotHiggins) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/EliotHiggins/status/1660626830741716992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-2-1925563-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">May 22, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Twitter has yet to offer up an explanation or (even better) a solution. It&rsquo;s also not immediately clear how many users are impacted by this bug. A former Twitter employee believes the bug occurred when <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://infosec.exchange/@atax1a/110384568880884030&amp;xcust=2-2-1925563-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter was moving its servers around</a>, thus accidentally resorting the old data. Whatever the case may be, the social media platform has yet to offer up an explanation or (even better) a solution. It&rsquo;s a pain in the neck, that&rsquo;s for sure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This bug shines a harsh, blinding light on personal data and the control we may or may not have over it. Personally, I don&rsquo;t care much for social media, so my posts are pretty vanilla as far as spiciness goes. That said, I like having control over what I post. This bug is honestly making me reconsider having a semi-active Twitter account. If Twitter can whip up some kind of miracle elixir to fix this bug (sooner rather than later would be preferred), then maybe I&rsquo;ll stick around. </p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925563/1925563.html", "date_published": "2023-05-22 15:42:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "3 tweaks that help your laptop battery last longer", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you&rsquo;ve got a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html\">long-lasting notebook</a>, sometimes you need to preserve every last bit of your laptop&rsquo;s battery to help it survive the day.

But these three tips deliver the most bang for most people&rsquo;s bucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/699203/the-best-laptops-under-500-best-overall-best-for-oled-fans-and-more.html\">The best laptops under $500</a></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"change-your-windows-power-profile\">Change your Windows power profile</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows 10 and 11 ship with several power profiles available, ranging from a setting that maximizes performance to another than prioritizes battery life. Obviously, if your laptop is on its last legs, you&rsquo;ll want to use the latter. Most laptops use a Balanced power plan that splits the difference, however, and some gaming-focused laptops default to the Performance mode even when you&rsquo;re not plugged in.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/battery-settings-100879651-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"battery settings\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/battery-settings-100879651-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></a><figcaption>\n<p>Windows 10&rsquo;s Power Mode slider.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to switch between power profiles. Simply click the battery icon in your laptop&rsquo;s system tray, at the bottom-right edge of your screen. You&rsquo;ll see a slider of various power profiles appear: The leftmost side prioritizes power, while the rightmost side prioritizes performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help your laptop last longer, simply drag the slider all the way to the left. Note that doing so puts Windows into power saver mode, which might prevent some background tasks&mdash;such as uploading files to OneDrive&mdash;from occurring until you switch back to a more balanced profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lower-your-screen-brightness\">Lower your screen brightness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing chews through battery life faster than a bright screen. Your laptop&rsquo;s display should automatically become dimmer when you change the Windows power profile to battery saver, but it <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> become as dark as possible. Enabling battery saver mode on my HP Envy 15 laptop, for example, drops the screen brightness to 20 percent, but when I&rsquo;m inside I can see the screen just fine even at lower levels.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/battery-display-brightness-100879649-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"battery display brightness\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/battery-display-brightness-100879649-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></a><figcaption>\n<p>I&rsquo;m fine using this laptop with the brightness set as low as 6 percent while inside.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Search for &ldquo;Display settings&rdquo; or navigate to <em>Start button &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display</em>. At the very top, you&rsquo;ll see yet another slider that manages your screen brightness. Reduce it as much as possible to squeeze out as much battery life as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"airplane-mode\">Airplane Mode</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a more drastic measure, but one that helps a <em>ton</em> if you&rsquo;re able to work offline&mdash;in a Word document or Excel spreadsheet, say, or if you&rsquo;ve configured your email client to be available with no Internet connection. By default, your laptop is constantly pinging for Wi-Fi (and likely Bluetooth) signals to connect to other devices, and that scanning can use a surprising amount of power. Activating  Airplane Mode shuts it all down and prolongs your battery life.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/battery-airplane-mode-100879650-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"battery airplane mode\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/battery-airplane-mode-100879650-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></a><figcaption>\n<p>The buttons you need to turn on Airplane Mode. (Click to enlarge.)</p>\n</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Turning on Airplane Mode is easy-peasy. Click the Notifications button all the way on the right edge of your taskbar. It looks like a text bubble from a comic book. A pop-out screen with some options will appear. Click the tiny blue &ldquo;Expand&rdquo; text to reveal even more. Airplane Mode will be one of them. Click that button to turn on Airplane Mode and shut down your wireless signals. Your battery will thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that besides Airplane Mode, the Quick Actions portion of the Notifications interface includes individual options to turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth separately. If you can&rsquo;t work without Wi-Fi active, at least disable Bluetooth (assuming your laptop supports Bluetooth). This near-range wireless technology can use a surprising amount of battery by constantly pinging for other Bluetooth devices to connect to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"hardware-that-helps\">Hardware that helps</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"give-your-battery-a-boost\">\n\t\t\t\t\tGive your battery a boost\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"powercore-26800-pd\">Powercore+ 26800 PD</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Powercore+ 26800 PD\" class=\"product-widget__image\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41o7eSO6AGL.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407227/anker-powercore-26800-pd-review-everything-you-want-in-a-battery-pack.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>If you battle your laptop&rsquo;s battery life on a daily basis, it might be worth considering an upgrade to a longer-lasting notebook.

If those numbers are indeed accurate, then visuals should be crisp and vibrant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This machine was a sterling value even at full price. With this hefty discount in place it&rsquo;s a no-brainer.

It comes with a silver spoon price of $229.99 USD, which admittedly is a tough pill to swallow, but we think serious gamers aren&rsquo;t going to be too fussed about the price once they get a taste of what&rsquo;s on offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406235/best-gaming-keyboard.html\">best gaming keyboards</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"razer-blackwidow-v4-pro-design-and-build\">Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro design and build </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The V4 Pro is a hefty full-sized battle station of a keyboard. Measuring 1.7 x 18.25 x 9.25 (HWD) inches with the wrist rest attached, it was so big I needed lots of free space around me just to use it. For size comparison, it&rsquo;s half an inch wider than its predecessor the Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro. It also weighs 2.40 pounds (again with the wrist rest attached), which may make some gamers who like to carry their keyboards to LAN parties wince at the prospect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, if you do have the room to house it, it&rsquo;s a luxury that you&rsquo;ll enjoy for just about anything you do on your computer&mdash;be that gaming, mucking about in Windows, or even for those long hours of recreational spreadsheeting you like to do each night after work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because Razer has poured its very best technologies into the V4 Pro and it really shows. Take the keys for instance: They feature delicately carved concave tops so your fingertips sit neatly in place without sliding off. Per-key RGB lighting also shines brightly though each key cap, which incidentally, are made Doubleshot, which means the lettering is sealed beneath a coating so it&rsquo;s virtually impossible to rub off.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Razer has poured its very best technologies into the V4 Pro and it really shows. </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro\" class=\"wp-image-1917593\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Middle-shot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro&rsquo;s key caps are concave shaped to prevent slippage.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the switches, the V4 Pro comes with the very best Razer has to offer&mdash;either Green (Clicky) or Yellow (Linear) full-sized mechanical switches, each rated for an exceptionally hardy 100 million presses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The switch variants do differ slightly in how they respond and feel. For instance, the Yellow switches are said to be quieter and smoother. They have an actuation point situated 1.2mm above the keyboard and provide 45g of actuation force. Green, on the other hand, have a higher 1.9mm actuation point and deliver 50g of force, so they&rsquo;re a little more tailored for preventing accidental keystrokes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For layout, the V4 Pro is very thorough, with just about everything but the kitchen sink thrown in for keys, including an array of four media buttons and eight macro keys&mdash;the latter of which weren&rsquo;t included in the V3 Pro and which will undoubtedly prove very popular with MMO gamers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five of these macros are located as a neat row numbered M1-M5 on the keyboard&rsquo;s far left flank, while another three can be found on the left side of the chassis. The V4 Pro&rsquo;s Command Dial is also a winner. It&rsquo;s very tall and joystick-like and located in the top-left corner, the opposite of where it was in the V3 Pro. It supports up to eight programmable functions, four of which are ready to use in the default setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"razer-blackwidow-v4-pro-software\">Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro software </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Razer&rsquo;s downloadable Synapse software allows you to customize the BlackWidow&rsquo;s functionality by assigning or changing the commands and modifying what the keyboard&rsquo;s Command Dial can do. You can&rsquo;t remap the Command Dial, but you can turn on an additional four functions that are switched off in the default setting. You can also personalize the dial&rsquo;s RGB indicator colors so that you can more easily identify each function. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Synapse you can also set up and edit the five onboard profiles or swap between saved configurations. All the profiles will, however, remain locked into Synapse itself, so you won&rsquo;t be able to export them out elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro\" class=\"wp-image-1917597\" height=\"732\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>You assign a set number of functions and colors to the V4 Pro&rsquo;s Command Dial in Razer Synapse.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With all its glorious RGB lighting zones the BlackWidow V4 Pro makes an ideal candidate for tweaking in Razer&rsquo;s Chroma Studio, where you can create unique lighting effects and colors for keys or even assign specific effects or color combinations to individual games. If you&rsquo;ve collected other Razer Chroma RGB products, you can also synchronize your RGB lighting across these devices to create some dazzling light shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"razer-blackwidow-v4-pro-gaming-performance\">Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro gaming performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Throwing down $229.99 for a keyboard&mdash;the V4&rsquo;s current price&mdash;is no small feat these days, so I was super keen to see if it performed well enough to make me want to pay that much. However, what&rsquo;s on offer seems to match the reality of the keyboard&rsquo;s stiff price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had plenty of key options for all my various gaming and working needs. But I also really enjoyed using the Command Dial, which proved invaluable for zooming into Microsoft Word pages when my eyes got a little blurry from staring at my screen for too long. The Command Dial also felt a lot taller and easier to use than the equivalent control dial in the V4 Pro&rsquo;s near rival, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357631/corsair-k100-air-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-review.html\">Corsair K100</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard&rsquo;s big size also allowed me to locate keys a little more naturally than some smaller keyboards, and I really enjoyed the extra space I had to stretch out and relax into my games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the RGB lighting was always a stunning sight to see, and the media controls, which do a better job separating out individual commands than in the V3 Pro, made controlling my various media programs much easier and quicker than normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among all the V4 Pro&rsquo;s various features, however, the highlight for me was definitely the macro keys. Indeed, the V4 Pro&rsquo;s macros are like the keyboard equivalent of the Razer <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1654724/razer-naga-v2-pro-gaming-mouse-review.html\">Naga V3 Pro</a>&rsquo;s mouse buttons&mdash;both offer so many options to assign spells or commands for skills that they&rsquo;ve quickly became invaluable to my gameplay. In fact, so useful were these eight keys for binding essential actions in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, they actually allowed me to finish quests in half the time I normally do.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro \" class=\"wp-image-1917598\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BlackWidow-V4-411-1_R2.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro features per-key RGB lighting and an RGB underglow.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Razer</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to say the V4 Pro doesn&rsquo;t have lots to offer gamers of other game types too. With an incredibly quick 8,000Hz hyperpolling rate, you get virtually instantaneous key actuation, which is ideal for frantic FPS gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, in games like <em>Insurgency</em> or those belonging to the <em>Rainbow Six</em>, <em>Battlefield</em>, or <em>Call of Duty </em>franchises, you&rsquo;ll really want to take my advice and go and bind your flashbang or grenade actions to your keyboard, because you may not see a faster deployment than you will with the V4 Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found the configuration to my liking too, although changing from my ROCCAT Magma keyboard to the V4 Pro did take some getting used to at first. In fact, I found myself miss-hitting keys quite a lot in the beginning. That&rsquo;s simply because keys like: Left Shift, Left Tab, Caps, and Left Ctrl are located further to the right than in most conventional keyboards, so I had to somewhat reorient myself quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my Green switch variant, the keys were exceptionally quick and nippy too. They made a fair amount of noise, although it was a deeply satisfying sort&mdash;each press sounding like a clean snip cut by an exceptionally sharp pair of scissors, that had me wanting to press them more and more.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"also-consider\">\n\t\t\t\t\tAlso consider&hellip;\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"corsair-k100-air-keyboard\">Corsair K100 Air Keyboard</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Corsair K100 Air Keyboard\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/71YTiSoOeUL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357631/corsair-k100-air-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fcorsair-k100-air-wireless-full-size-bluetooth-rgb-mechanical-cherry-mx-ultra-low-profile-tactile-switch-gaming-keyboard-black%2F6518230.p%3FskuId%3D6518230%26%23038%3Bref%3D212%26%23038%3Bloc%3D1%26%23038%3BextStoreId%3D457&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$279.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Gaming-Keyboards/K100-AIR-WIRELESS-RGB-Ultra-Thin-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard---CHERRY-MX-Ultra-Low-Profile-Tactile/p/CH-913A01U-NA?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=shopping&amp;utm_term=%22keyword%22&amp;utm_content=corsair&amp;xcust=2-1-1916318-5-1357647-9957&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$279.99 at  Corsair</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microcenter.com/product/653858/K100_AIR_WIRELESS_RGB_Ultra-Thin_Mechanical_Gaming_Keyboard_-_Black;_Backlit_RGB_LED;_CHERRY_MX_Ultra_Low_Profile_Tactile_Keyswitches&amp;xcust=2-1-1916318-5-1357647-9957&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$279.99 at  Micro Center</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Yet it must be said that for long typing stints, like writing this review, the Green switches didn&rsquo;t quite have enough cushioning to be anywhere near as comfortable as I&rsquo;ve found the Yellow switches in my <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1438527/razer-deathstalker-v2-pro-review-big-keyboards-are-thin-again.html\">Razer DeathStalker V2 Pro</a> keyboard to be. That isn&rsquo;t a big deal&mdash;it just meant I had to mainly stick to gaming on my review unit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the V4 Pro&rsquo;s chassis is just ideal for gaming no matter what switches you have loaded. The outside of the chassis feels incredibly robust thanks to its immovable aluminum alloy plate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the plush leatherette wrist rest was another experience I savored in the V4 Pro. It felt remarkably soft, but also lit up my desktop with more of that immersive RGB underglow&mdash;a nice touch that really lifted the overall aesthetic of my gaming den.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"best-low-profile-gaming-keyboard\">\n\t\t\t\t\tbest low-profile gaming keyboard\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"razer-deathstalker-v2-pro-keyboard\">Razer Deathstalker V2 Pro keyboard</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Razer Deathstalker V2 Pro keyboard\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/deathstalker-v2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1079\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1438527/razer-deathstalker-v2-pro-review-big-keyboards-are-thin-again.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5FNM5K8/&amp;xcust=2-1-1916318-5-1438540-10700&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$249.00 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/Razer-DeathStalker-V2-Pro/RZ03-04360200-R3U1&amp;xcust=2-1-1916318-5-1438540-10700&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$249.00 at  Razer</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Frazer-deathstalker-v2-pro-full-size-wireless-optical-linear-switch-gaming-keyboard-with-low-profile-design-black%2F6512386.p%3FskuId%3D6512386&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$249.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h3 id=\"should-you-buy-the-razer-blackwidow-v4-pro\">Should you buy the Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take brain surgery to see that the BlackWidow V4 Pro is a very capable premium gaming keyboard. A more appropriate question is: Would you spend $230 on it? I was already leaning that way, but just to make sure, I did a very quick comparison with near-rival the Corsair K100 RGB mechanical keyboard, which currently retails for $159.76 on Amazon. It also comes with additional macro keys and a multi-function dial. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On its own merits the K100 actually measures up pretty well against the V4 Pro, despite being $70 cheaper. However, there are a few reasons why I&rsquo;d still choose the V4 Pro over it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first factor is the macro keys&mdash;the K100 has six while the V4 Pro has a full eight. Admittedly, that doesn&rsquo;t sound like much but even a few more macros can make a big difference in MMOs with high command loads. Having those extra options also means I don&rsquo;t have to cannibalize keys elsewhere and jeopardize an even flow to my key mapping&mdash;which in turn saves unnecessary mucking around in Synapse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, while both keyboards feature RGB, only Razer&rsquo;s wrist pad complements the board with its own dazzling RGB, so on the whole it looks a little more premium than the K100&rsquo;s palm rest. The Razer to me also appears a lot less cluttered in terms of its layout too, which at the end of the day, makes finding keys a more organic and enjoyable experience. </p>\n\nGaming, Keyboards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1916318/razer-blackwidow-v4-pro-keyboard-review.html", "date_published": "2023-05-22 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "How to upgrade from Windows 11 Home to Pro (and why you\u2019d want to)", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>More expensive software isn&rsquo;t always better software.

But only those on a Windows 11 Pro PC can serve as the host (the being logged into part).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you think you&rsquo;d want to log into your PC <em>from</em> another one, like if you&rsquo;re traveling and want to access your computer from the road, then a Pro license is what you&rsquo;ll need. Same if you think you&rsquo;ll often be getting help from someone else (i.e., a friend or family member), where they&rsquo;ll be logging into <em>your</em> computer to help troubleshoot your problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bitlocker\">BitLocker</h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Pro BitLocker settings\" class=\"wp-image-1916058\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-2-1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows 11 Home enables device encryption by default on compatible devices for a baseline level of protection. But Windows 11 Pro unlocks BitLocker as a feature, which offers far more flexible control and tighter security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, device encryption automatically backs up a copy of your recovery key to your Microsoft account associated with your PC&mdash;and that&rsquo;s it. With BitLocker, you can manually save your recovery key in a few different ways (including backing up to your Microsoft account), and make as many copies as you&rsquo;d like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Device encryption also does just that&mdash;encrypts your <em>whole</em> device. Meanwhile, with BitLocker, you can choose to encrypt drives and/or partitions individually.&nbsp;Our guide to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/549444/how-to-encrypt-files-in-windows.html\">encrypting files in Windows</a> goes into greater detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"windows-sandbox\">Windows Sandbox</h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows Sandbox open within Windows 11 Pro\" class=\"wp-image-1916067\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-4.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While Windows 11 Pro lets you create virtual machines, they can require more resources than you might have (or want to invest in them). It&rsquo;s not just hardware&mdash;as with a physical PC, you need to buy separate licenses for your virtual machines if you&rsquo;re running Windows on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you still want the protection of a virtual machine to test software of unknown or questionable origin, or to open potentially sketchy emails without risking the rest of your machine, Windows Sandbox can be a reasonable middle-ground alternative. Instead of creating a virtual machine, Sandbox reserves part of Windows&rsquo; resources to run your app. However, you will still need to download the file to your PC, so it won&rsquo;t be quarantined as in a virtual machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"hyper-v\">Hyper-V</h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Pro Hyper-V\" class=\"wp-image-1916057\" height=\"642\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hyper-v.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure if software is potential malware or otherwise dodgy, you protect your PC by running the file in a virtual machine&mdash;basically, another PC you create within software. But instead of buying a program like VMware for this, you can upgrade to Windows 11 Pro for Hyper-V. Hyper-V lets you set up self-contained testing environments; you&rsquo;ll download and run apps within each virtual machine you spin up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that if you plan to run Windows in a Hyper-V instance, you&rsquo;ll need a license for each one. Also, virtual machines aren&rsquo;t malware-proof. They&rsquo;re <em>generally </em>able to quarantine nasty software, but some viruses can escape the confines of a virtual machine.
