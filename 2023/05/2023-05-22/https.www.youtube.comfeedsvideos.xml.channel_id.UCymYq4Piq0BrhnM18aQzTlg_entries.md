Buy one on Amazon: https://lon.tv/9x861 (compensated affiliate link) - 8bitdo's Ultimate C offers a lot of value for people looking for a decent low lag game controller. It lacks the customization and compatibiltiy features of their more expensive controllers but for PCs and Raspberry Pi's it's a great controller for the price point.
