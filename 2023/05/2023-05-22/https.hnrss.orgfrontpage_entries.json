company\u2019s first OAuth integrations, so we know a lot about how data moves between companies.<p>For example, we know that the pain of building new API integrations scales with the fragmentation in the industry. In the current meta, we see this pain with a lot of AI startups who invariably need to connect to their customers data, but have to support 50+ integrations before they even scale to 50+ customers.<p>This is the process for an AI startup to add a new integration for a customer:<p>- Pore over the API docs for each source application and write a connector for each\n- Play email tag to find the right stakeholders and get them to share sensitive API keys, or give them an OAuth app. It can take 6+ weeks for some platforms to review new OAuth apps\n- Normalize data that arrives in a different formats from each source (HTML, XML, text dumps, 3 different flavors of markdown, JSON, etc)\n- Figure out what data should be vectorized, what should be stored as SQL, and what should be discarded\n- Detect when data has been updated and synchronize it\n- Monitor when pipelines break so data doesn\u2019t go stale<p>This is a LOT of work for something that doesn\u2019t move the needle on product quality, so it\u2019s no wonder that most startups are still relying on file uploads to onboard their early customers. The problem is file uploads are slow and insecure and don't scale.<p>That\u2019s why we built Psychic.dev to be the fastest and most secure way for startups to connect to their customer\u2019s data. You integrate once with our universal APIs and get N integrations with CRMs, knowledge bases, ticketing systems and more with no incremental engineering effort.<p>We abstract away the quirks of each data source into Document and Conversation data models, and try to find a good balance to allow deep integrations while preserving general purpose utility. Since it\u2019s open source, we encourage founders to fork and extend our data models to fit their needs as they evolve, even if it means migrating off our paid version.<p>To see an example in action, check out our demo repo here: <a href=\"https://github.com/psychic-api/psychic-langchain-tutorial/\">https://github.com/psychic-api/psychic-langchain-tutorial/</a><p>We are also open source and open to contributions, learn more at docs.psychic.dev or by emailing us at founders@psychic.dev!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36032081\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36032081</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://github.com/psychic-api/psychic", "date_published": "2023-05-22 14:41:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Stippling and Blue Noise", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.joesfer.com/?p=108\">https://www.joesfer.com/?p=108</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36032039\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36032039</a></p>\n<p>Points: 2</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://www.joesfer.com/?p=108", "date_published": "2023-05-22 14:38:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Roblox: Ten-year-old spent \u00a32,500 of mum's money without her knowing", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65659896\">https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65659896</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36031933\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36031933</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65659896", "date_published": "2023-05-22 14:30:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Some Neural Networks Learn Language Like Humans", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/some-neural-networks-learn-language-like-humans-20230522/\">https://www.quantamagazine.org/some-neural-networks-learn-language-like-humans-20230522/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36031446\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36031446</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://www.quantamagazine.org/some-neural-networks-learn-language-like-humans-20230522/", "date_published": "2023-05-22 13:48:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Black holes might be defects in spacetime", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2023-05-black-holes-defects-spacetime.html\">https://phys.org/news/2023-05-black-holes-defects-spacetime.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030959\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030959</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-05-black-holes-defects-spacetime.html", "date_published": "2023-05-22 13:08:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Io Uring", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php/Io_uring\">https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php/Io_uring</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030958\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030958</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php/Io_uring", "date_published": "2023-05-22 13:07:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "The Culture: The Drawings by Iain M.

Visually it looks like swipeable stacks of comments and it offers several advantages over traditional interfaces:<p>- Comment width doesn't get narrower no matter how deep in the comment tree you are<p>- You always see the parent of the comment you're currently reading<p>- Swiping allows you to move in and out of subtrees with animated transitions that you fully control<p>- You can easily skip subtrees that don't interest you by scrolling<p>As a result it's easier to maintain the context and to keep track of where you are in the discussion tree. The app is fully featured, it does all the things that you would expect it to do, and there's extra: custom boards, search, in-thread search, anchors, reading list, recent items.<p>Video preview: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/tzBdpXw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://imgur.com/a/tzBdpXw</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030350\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030350</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hackernewt-for-hacker-news/id6448201970", "date_published": "2023-05-22 12:10:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "UK's GDPR replacement could wipe out oversight of live facial recognition", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/19/dpib_2_surveillance_oversight/\">https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/19/dpib_2_surveillance_oversight/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030337\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030337</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/19/dpib_2_surveillance_oversight/", "date_published": "2023-05-22 12:09:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: I built a web app for learning Vim from the browser as a 17-year-old", "description": "<p>Hey HN!<p>After my own experiences with learning Vim, I wanted to skip the frustrating process of configuring a new tool before even learning how to use it. In an attempt to solve this problem, I started working on Vim Ninja, a web app that would allow developers to learn Vim through interactive lessons in the browser. It\u2019s been a couple of months, and I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019ve finally released <a href=\"https://VimNinja.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://VimNinja.com</a>!<p>Check out a demo of the app here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/reukQHKqMZE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/reukQHKqMZE</a>.<p>On the technical side of things, I used SvelteKit to build the entire app and Tailwind, which turned out to be an amazing decision. I actually really like SvelteKit\u2019s filesystem-based router as well as Svelte\u2019s brevity, and Tailwind actually makes styling a fun task for me. I\u2019m using CodeMirror 6 as a base for Vim Ninja\u2019s code editor, and I really prefer it over more feature-packed alternatives like the Monaco Editor, which is what I started out with but soon abandoned due to its worse performance when compared to alternatives like CM6 and the sheer amount of bells and whistles that I just didn\u2019t need.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030282\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030282</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>", "link": "https://www.vimninja.com/", "date_published": "2023-05-22 12:03:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "PSA: Cancelling HP Instant Ink subscription prevents cartridges from being used", "description": "<p>I bought an HP printer that came with an HP Instant Ink subscription a year ago. The subscription promises to send you ink when you're running low as long as you print within the designated number of pages.<p>I recently changed my card and figured I would let the subscription expire.<p>Fast forward to today. I go to print something and find that the printer is \"unable to print\" even though there is ample ink left in the cartridges. I press a button on the printer and it spits out a report that states the printer is unable to print, except for printer reports (!).<p>I dig a little (since the error message they show provides no additional information beyond not being able to print) and find this thread [0] in their support forum. It turns out that once the subscription is cancelled or suspended, you are no longer able to use the ink that has been sent to you. Some even report not being able to print with cartridges they bought independently.<p>It turns out that their terms state that you're buying the ability to print x pages and the ink is actually always owned by HP, even when in your possession.<p>This has to be one shadiest and just overall worst product experiences I've come across in a while.<p>Printers have always been a bit of a pain but since when did they have to be near permanently connected to the internet else threaten to cut you off from all of their capabilities.<p>[0] https://web.archive.org/web/20230522114823/https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printers-Knowledge-Base/Cancelled-Instant-Ink-service-and-now-I-can-t-print/ta-p/7037780</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030156\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030156</a></p>\n<p>Points: 54</p>\n<p># Comments: 37</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36030156", "date_published": "2023-05-22 11:50:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Ki Programming Language", "description": "<p>Alpha preview for the ki programming language.

achieved almost everything I wanted as a frontend developer (even moved from just working with UI/react/etc to pure R&amp;D, researching and working with browser api for innovarive/obscure tasks) and while backend looks  interesting for me, I know that I will have to take a paycut if I would move there.\nBecoming a team leader or moving to other management position looks more promising from salary and work enjoyment (for me) purposes, so what are my next steps are?<p>Is there any good reads, courses, videos, lectures etc I should know of? I work in small startup for the past year so I don't have anything to take example of nor I have any opportunity to lead a team (except one guy I'm mentoring)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a
