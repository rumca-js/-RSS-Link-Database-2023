I was at school in the 1970s and a much-needed recipient of free school meals. Like Katriona, the teachers who \u201csaw\u201d me helped me to see past the shame I felt at being an outsider. I lived with an alcoholic mother and her abusive partner, and at the age of 12 I slept with my bedroom window unlocked so that I could jump from my first-floor room if needed, the insidious fear that her partner might rape me ever present. Shame kept me from ever telling anyone what was happening at home.</p><p>My mother kicked me out when I was 15, after her partner asked her to choose between us. I left school at 16, going straight into low-paid work. I took advantage of being able to retake my O-levels while claiming benefits and then did an access course that enabled me to complete a degree. I rewrote my story to a certain extent, but only because funding gave me that opportunity. The reference to there being a middle class \u201cuniform\u201d resonated; people assume so much because of how one dresses or speaks \u2013 they assume a set of shared values, and political and cultural beliefs.
