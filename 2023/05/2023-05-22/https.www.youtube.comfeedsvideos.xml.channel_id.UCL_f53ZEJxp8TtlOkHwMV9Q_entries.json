Peterson and Dr. Nigel Biggar break down his new publication, \u201cColonialism: A Moral Reckoning,\u201d and parse out the truths and falsehoods from the modern day revisionist movement. They explore the ethics of imperialism, the motivations for the British colonies, their role in the slave trade, bringing modernity to much of the world, and looking back on history with a balanced lens.\n\nDr. Nigel Biggar is a prominent British theologian, academic and author. He is known for his work in the fields of ethics, philosophy, and theology, particularly in the context of war, peace, and historical reverence. Biggar has made significant contributions to the study of Christian ethics and has written extensively on topics such as \u201cjust war theory,\u201d moral responsibility, and the role of forgiveness in conflict resolution. He has been involved in various academic institutions, including the University of Oxford, where he held the Regius Professorship of Moral and Pastoral Theology. \n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBirch Gold: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\nBulletproof Everyone: FREE IIIA backpack with IIIA clothing purchase.
