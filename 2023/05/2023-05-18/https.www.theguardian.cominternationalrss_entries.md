<p>Beneath the mental fragility that led to the Sixers’ humiliating playoff exit is a gutless, joyless organization that is betraying their devoted fans. Only a scorched-earth rebuild will do</p><p>Sixers fans, answer me this: are you better off today than you were 10 years ago? It’s the same question posed by out-party politicians since time immemorial, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/14/tatums-game-7-record-51-points-power-celtics-into-eastern-conference-finals">Sunday’s spectacular face-plant</a> against the Boston Celtics that prompted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/16/philadelphia-76ers-reportedly-fire-doc-rivers-after-latest-playoff-exit">Tuesday’s sacking of head coach Doc Rivers</a> demands a far more wholesale inquest of Philadelphia’s once-proud basketball team. And the picture is not a pleasant one.</p><p>With a three-games-to-two lead over their archrivals in the Eastern Conference semi-finals – needing one win from two cracks for the team’s first trip to the NBA’s final four in more than two decades – the Sixers let the Celtics off the hook in Game 6 and were blown out of the gym in Sunday’s decider. Boston star Jayson Tatum, whom Philadelphia passed over after trading up for Markelle Fultz in the 2017 draft, gored them for 51 points – the most in a Game 7 in NBA history. In a city where sports famously mean a little too much, the Mother’s Day Massacre will leave scars.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/18/philadelphia-76ers-rebuild-owners-joel-embiid-trade">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Champions League hammering at Manchester City could usher manager towards Brazil job and hasten transition to youth</p><p>“We have to tell the truth,” Toni Kroos said, and the truth hurt. There was no escaping it, not this time. “This defeat was very, very deserved,” the midfielder admitted when at last it was over, which by then was all Real Madrid could aspire to. The night before the Champions League semi-final second leg, Carlo Ancelotti had gathered his players at the Etihad Stadium and told them there would be moments they would have to hang on: 20 minutes, 25, maybe 30. It is their way, and Manchester City had made them suffer before, after all. Just not quite like this. Even half an hour turned out to be hopelessly optimistic.</p><p>That mark had just been passed when Kroos crashed a shot against the bar. It was Real Madrid’s first, and the first time they had anything resembling possession. In the opening quarter of an hour they had averaged less than a pass a minute and it hadn’t got much better. City had taken nine shots, and if they only led 1-0 it was because Thibaut Courtois had made two extraordinary saves. And yet in that moment, as the goal shook, you couldn’t help wondering whether Madrid were going to go and do it again. Two minutes later, Bernardo Silva made it 2-0. That’ll be a no, then.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/18/hammering-at-manchester-city-may-prompt-a-rebuild-at-real-madrid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The flavour of the competition will never be the same and it remains to be seen if Australia and New Zealand teams can fill the gap</p><p>For 26 years club rugby in the southern hemisphere had a distinctive flavour profile. There have been some interesting garnishes, with produce from Japan, Argentina and, more recently, the Pacific Islands enriching the plate. But from the dawn of the professional age in 1996 until the Covid-enforced hiatus in 2020, the three main ingredients have come from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.</p><p>But now Super Rugby has “lost a bit of spice”, at least according to John Plumtree, the now Durban-based Sharks coach and former All Blacks assistant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/19/south-african-teams-are-happy-post-divorce-but-has-super-rugby-lost-its-bite">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Beczała/Gerhaher/Huber<br />(Sony Classical)</strong><br />Heard in a less usual male-voice pairing and with a piano reduction of the full orchestral score, there are more gains than losses to be found here</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/29/mahler-where-to-start-with-his-music">Mahler</a> died in 1911, Das Lied von der Erde was one of the two masterpieces that he left completed but unperformed. The score does suggest tenor and baritone as alternative soloists to the preferred tenor and contralto, but very few of the outstanding recordings of the work have opted for that all-male pairing; of the 20th century’s outstanding Mahler conductors only Leonard Bernstein recorded Das Lied with a baritone, the great Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.</p><p>But it’s understandable that a Lieder baritone of <a href="https://www.gerhaher.de/index.php/en/menu/biography">Christian Gerhaher’s</a> inquiring intelligence would also want to tackle this transcendent music, and to follow the example of Fischer-Dieskau, with whom he is so regularly compared. In fact <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/03/mahler-das-lied-von-der-erde-vogt">Gerhaher did record Das Lied von der Erde in its orchestral form in 2009</a>, with Kent Nagano conducting, but though his own contribution is exemplary, the performance as a whole is deeply disappointing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/18/mahler-das-lied-von-der-erde-review-gerhaher-and-beczala-give-late-masterpiece-new-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fire breaks out at business in Darnytskyi district amid series of attacks ‘unprecedented in their power, intensity and variety’, says Kyiv City Military Administration</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance">Russia-Ukraine war at a glance</a></strong></li></ul><p>This morning’s strikes on Kyiv are the ninth in a series of recent raids by Russia that are “unprecedented in their power, intensity and variety,” the Kyiv City Regional City Administration (KMBA) wrote a short while ago on Telegram.</p><p>Air raid alerts are still in place for Kyiv.</p><p><strong>The Black Sea grain deal has been extended for two more months,</strong> in what the UN secretary general, António Guterres, hailed as “good news for the world”. It comes a day before Russia might have quit the pact over obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told a top Chinese envoy at talks in Kyiv on Wednesday that <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a></strong> <strong>would not accept any proposals to end the war that involved losing territory or freezing the conflict, </strong>the Ukrainian foreign ministry said. Li Hui, China’s special representative for Eurasian affairs and former ambassador to Russia, visited Ukraine on 16-17 May.</p><p><strong>China has notified several foreign missions in Beijing not to display “politicised propaganda” on their buildings,</strong> diplomats have told Reuters, adding the request appeared aimed at Ukrainian flags flown since Russia’s invasion.</p><p><strong>The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has asked EU governments to add €3.5bn (US$3.85bn) to the European Peace Facility (EPF), a fund used to finance military aid for Ukraine,</strong> EU sources have said. The EPF has already allocated €4.6bn in military aid for Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Hungary, though, said it would block the next tranche of EU military support and any new sanctions against Russia</strong> unless Ukraine removes Hungarian bank OTP from its list of war sponsors.</p><p><strong>Britain can support Ukraine’s military by enabling other countries that wish to supply fighter jets and other military equipment to do so, </strong>the British defence minister has said. “What we can obviously contribute is training and support, again, within limits, because we don’t have F16 pilots,” Ben Wallace said at a press conference in Berlin with his German counterpart when asked about international plans to send jets to Ukraine.</p><p><strong>The Dutch foreign minister said there was no progress to report in international talks on the possible delivery of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. </strong>“We haven’t reached a solution yet,” Wopke Hoekstra said on Wednesday in response to questions about earlier announced talks of the Dutch with the UK, Denmark, Belgium and other <strong>partners.</strong></p><p><strong>The German government is looking into mechanisms to secure war damages for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,</strong> including the possibility of using Russian assets, a government spokesperson said. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was among European leaders who agreed to set up a register of damages during a meeting in Reykjavik, Reuters reported.</p><p><strong>Belarus, one of Russia’s closest allies, has partially restored controls on their border, </strong>Belarusian foreign minister Sergei Aleinik said on Wednesday. This is the first time in 28 years there have been checks at the 770-mile border, AP reported. According to Aleinik, it is to avoid the entry of third-country nationals into Belarus, ahead of the implementation of an intergovernmental agreement on the mutual recognition of visas.</p><p><strong>The number of Kazakhs who believe neighbouring Russia may invade the former Soviet republic has doubled over the past six months, </strong>an opinion poll by Kazakh researchers showed on Wednesday. The central Asian country of 20 million has close ties with Moscow but has maintained neutrality in the Ukrainian conflict, refusing to recognise Russia’s annexations.</p><p><strong>Ukraine denied on Wednesday that a Russian hypersonic missile had destroyed a US-made Patriot missile defence system</strong> during an airstrike on Kyiv.<strong> </strong>Two US officials said a Patriot system had probably been damaged but did not appear to have been destroyed.</p><p><strong>The Ukrainian military spokesperson Serhiy Cherevatyi has claimed Ukrainians have made new advances in Bakhmut. </strong>Reuters quotes Cherevatyi saying: “We are successfully conducting a defensive operation, counterattacking and during this day our units have penetrated up to 500 metres in some parts of the Bakhmut front.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/18/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-kyiv-missile-strikes-attack">Continue reading...</a>
