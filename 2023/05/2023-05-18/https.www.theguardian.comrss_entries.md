<p>Fresh-faced rookie Tye Sheridan is led through a world of medical grimness by a grizzled Penn in a tale full of lifeless cliche</p><p>There are some strident cliches alongside redundant self-harming machismo in this sub-Schraderesque movie about New York paramedics, directed by Jean-Stéphane Sauvaire and adapted from the novel by Shannon Burke. Sirens screaming and faces emoting, they battle through another dark-night-of-the-soul as they deal with gang shootings, domestic assaults, homeless people dying and crack addicts giving birth in hovels. They are often assigned the futile chore of attending to corpses discovered in decaying buildings, surrounded by black flies – but aren’t all the other patients just corpses in waiting? And so the black flies of horror start buzzing into their brains.</p><p>Tye Sheridan co-stars as Ollie, the standard-issue Hollywood rookie, a fresh-faced young ambulance guy from Colorado (of all the poignantly innocent places) paired in time-honoured style with a grizzled old-timer. This is the seen-it-all Gene Rutkovsky, appropriately nicknamed “Rut”, a veteran of a million horrors, including 9/11, played by Sean Penn. Fights break out among the guys back at the station house and Mike Tyson has a cameo as the grouchy chief who has to keep everyone in line.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/18/black-flies-review-sean-penn-paramedic-drama-tries-to-grapple-the-horror">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Northern Ireland’s elections: a pivotal moment | Editorial

<p>This week’s voting could have consequences for power sharing and for Britain’s attempt to rebuild credibility in Europe</p><p>All politics is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_politics_is_local#:~:text=The%20phrase%20%22all%20politics%20is,he%20did%20not%20originate%20it." title="">local</a>, or so it used to be said. But there was not much sign of that supposed neighbourhood granularity in England’s local elections on 4 May. Instead, a majority of English voters appear to have gone to the polls determined to register a national protest against Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government at Westminster. There has been even less deference to the parish pump in this week’s local elections in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/18/ni-local-elections-could-influence-stormont-stalemate" title="">Northern Ireland</a>. The 11 so-called super district <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland" title="">councils</a>, all proportionally elected, were up for grabs on Thursday for only the third time since the reform of local government in 2014. However, the Northern Ireland campaign has been overwhelmingly focused on a bigger political picture too, in this case the future of power sharing at Stormont and the wider tensions caused by Brexit.</p><p>None of this should imply that the Northern Ireland elections do not matter, despite an extremely <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2023/05/18/north-council-elections-its-very-slow-northern-ireland-is-very-slow-to-change/" title="">lacklustre campaign</a>. The results, which are due to be announced on Friday and Saturday, will at least produce local councils that are able to carry out their government functions in spite of the standoff at Stormont. Local democracy of that kind remains genuinely important. The results will also be studied, as ever, for what they say about the balances of political power within and between the two main traditions in Northern Ireland. They may also have something important to say about the health of the country’s <a href="https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/comment/mothballed-stormont-institutions-no-longer-accurately-reflect-our-three-way-politics/1871260054.html" title="">third tradition</a>, the non-aligned. This group may outpoll both unionists and nationalists this week, yet it is blocked by the Democratic Unionist party’s boycott of power sharing from putting its willingness to govern into practice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2023/may/18/the-guardian-view-on-northern-irelands-elections-a-pivotal-moment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing imperil contact between citizens, but also make it more important</p><p>Richer and more complex stories lie behind dominant narratives, as the British Museum’s fascinating new exhibition, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/16/chinas-hidden-century-british-museum" title="">China’s Hidden Century</a>, reminds us. It challenges the conventional wisdom that the country’s “long 19th century” was solely a time of decay and decline. It documents <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/131825/autumn-in-the-heavenly-kingdom-by-stephen-r-platt/" title="">domestic turmoil</a> and aggression and plunder by foreign powers – notably Britain – but also resilience and innovation. By looking beyond the Qing court, it includes individuals, ideas and possibilities that complicate our understanding of China’s identity and trajectory. Alongside splendid imperial robes, visitors see a cook’s uniform. They hear not only Empress Dowager Cixi’s words, but those of the feminist and revolutionary martyr <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/obituaries/overlooked-qiu-jin.html" title="">Qiu Jin</a>.</p><p>At a time when hostility towards the west and especially the US is growing in China, and vice versa, looking beyond headlines and politicians to other parts of the story is crucial. When intergovernmental relations hit the rocks, the contacts between societies and individuals – whether through tourism, academic discussion or shared cultural interests – are even more important. They can offer a less pressured and public space for exploring options. They can help to build understanding and prevent escalation. Conversely, domestic nationalism can make it harder for governments to pull back in a crisis even if they wish to. As the American and Chinese scholars Scott Kennedy and Wang Jisi warn in a recent report on academic exchange, <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/breaking-ice" title="">Breaking the Ice</a>: “Less connectivity is not only a product of worsening ties, it also has contributed to the decline of relations ...

Is there such a thing as “Liberal Democratism”? It is now 35 years since the Liberal party voted to merge with the SDP. It is surely time to examine whether or not it was worthwhile.</p><p>At the 1987 election, just one year before the parties merged, their combined vote was 22.6%. Now, opinion polls since the party’s recent local election successes show a voting intention of around 10%. The party’s overall gains in the 4 May elections in England were certainly very noteworthy, but they hid poor results in the 16 largest cities; in these councils, the Liberal Democrats gained just six seats and only hold 113 out of 1,193 councillors. The difference is quite simply that to make and sustain a significant vote in the large wards involved in these cities requires a high core vote rather than just incessant local campaigning. The Liberal Democrats simply do not have a viable core vote.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/18/ed-davey-impresses-but-are-the-lib-dems-a-viable-electoral-force">Continue reading...</a>

But it makes me sad that very few of our European partners took the trouble to understand our nation’s hesitation. British voices especially were only too happy to rehash the old song about the unloved Germany, the eternally handicapped decision-maker.</p><p>Born in the postwar Germany of 1947, and having lived just a few kilometres away from the barbed wire and minefields of the East German border, and experienced all the awful fears of another war of everyone around us – deep in the bones of our families and teachers – I understand how this has made us a careful people. Sandwiched between two ideologies, West Germany and East Germany represented the arrowheads of two opposing systems, a situation that overshadowed our lives every day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/18/the-view-from-germany-on-its-change-of-heart-about-military-aid-for-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(<strong>Parlophone</strong>)<br />The first single from upcoming album The Ballad of Darren chugs along to a motorik beat, rising to an anthemic chorus that seems to be reflecting on the band’s career path</p><p>There are two sides to Blur’s sporadic reunions. There are the live shows – Glastonbury in 2009, a trawl around the world’s festivals in 2012, a global arena tour in 2015, an unexpected one-off performance at one of Damon Albarn’s Africa Express events in 2019 – which are reliably rapturously received: a chance, as Graham Coxon recently put it to “revisit all those great songs”, complete with a distinct emotional charge driven by nostalgia and the evidence that the once-fractured relationships within the band have been mended. And then there is the issue of recording and releasing new material.</p><p>By far the most adventurous band among Britpop’s big league, willing to change and push forward in a way their peers seldom were, it doesn’t fit Blur’s profile to reconstitute purely as a heartwarming exercise in nostalgia. But their actual recording process has been fraught since re-forming in 2008. Blur were reported to have made three attempts to record a new album, but only three songs emerged, as limited edition singles; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/24/blur-album-sessions-william-orbit">Albarn apparently called time on album sessions in 2012</a> midway through recording, much to the chagrin of producer William Orbit. Albarn likewise suggested that the tracks recorded at impromptu 2013 sessions in Hong Kong would constitute “one of those records that never comes out”, before Coxon completed the music in secret and invited the singer to add lyrics: Albarn looked faintly surprised to be at the hastily arranged press conference that announced 2015’s acclaimed The Magic Whip.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/18/blur-the-narcissist-review-a-band-finally-at-ease-with-themselves">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wang Bing’s moving documentary follows young workers as they laugh, fight and question their bosses while undertaking a season of brutally hard work</p><p>Charlie Chaplin’s frantic production-line factory worker in Modern Times is a ghostly presence in this giant, immersive documentary from Chinese director Wang Bing, the movie equivalent of a wall-sized tapestry; it is about the sweatshop capital of China, the <a href="https://www.tellerreport.com/business/2021-07-14-visit-zhili--the-largest-children-s-clothing-production-base-in-china.BkHwSQbhp_.html">northern town of Zhili</a> in Huzhou, Zhejiang province, known as the “city of children’s clothing”. Thousands of workshops turn out mountains of cheap garments and every year vast numbers of young people from about 16 to 22 come from outlying cities to do a season of brutally hard work in return for cash in hand.</p><p>This is China’s hop picking or kibbutzim, the young workers often staying in the grim dorms the bosses offer rent free to justify low pay. There are bricks of cash to be seen in this film, no question of internet bank transfers and perhaps the whole thing happens without the involvement of the tax collector.<br /><br />Wang has already made a similar film about migrant factory workers called Bitter Money, and there are some spectacularly grim vistas in Youth: the main street of Zhili is a brutalist concrete avenue which eerily extends to the far horizon like something from a sci-fi movie (or perhaps something by Roy Andersson). The dorms themselves are squalid and cramped. But the first thing that strikes you about the workers is their energy, verve, humour and their hopefulness. Their “youth”, as in the film’s title, is not ironic: they are not, as I suspected they might be, prematurely aged by work (although the incessant wrangling about piecemeal rates of pay is clearly taking its toll by the end).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/18/youth-review-heart-stopping-stories-in-chinas-sweatshop-capital">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If Pedro Almodóvar and Eric Rohmer teamed up to compose a meanderingly long crime caper it might look like this</p><p>Very few films make you ask “what just happened?” at the end – and also in fact “what is happening right now?” at various points during the running time. But this is what I said, out loud, in the course of this deeply strange, utterly distinctive, beguiling and fantastical shaggy-dog story about a bank robbery in Buenos Aires, from Argentinian director Rodrigo Moreno. If Pedro Almodóvar and Eric Rohmer teamed up to compose a meanderingly long heist movie it might look like this, but something in the film’s waywardness makes it very difficult to fit into the heist genre – or any genre.</p><p>The scene is a bank in the city, where Moran (Daniel Elías) has been joylessly working for years as a cashier; his long service and palpable dullness mean that he is entrusted with carrying large amounts from the tills to the safe. But Moran has worked out that he can with relative ease transfer sizeable sums into the strongboxes stored in cabinets behind the customer area, and from there into a humble backpack to take them home with him. Moran arranges to meet his similarly boring colleague Román (Esteban Bigliardi) for a drink in a bar and calmly makes him an offer, dumping a backpack bulging with cash at his feet: he will turn himself in to a police station, confess and do what he calculates will be a modest stretch of three-and-a-half years, while Román looks after the money. Afterwards, they will split the cash, enough to retire and quit the rat race. But if Román snitches, Moran tells him, he will tell the authorities they were in it together. Astonished, Román feels he has no choice but to take the bag of money home and hide it in the modest flat he shares with his music-teacher girlfriend, and begin his new secret life of crime.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/18/the-delinquents-review-beguilingly-surreal-slow-motion-buenos-aires-heist-tale">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch; Visual Concepts/2K Games</strong><br />The open world racer where beautiful environments are crammed with delightfully destructible Lego goodies, will have kids smiling while they play</p><p>You know you’re at the mid-point of a console generation when the family-friendly racing titles start to arrive. Developed by veteran studio Visual Concepts, Lego 2K Drive is essentially Burnout Paradise mixed with Lego City Undercover, an open world drive ’em up providing four environments to race through, all crammed with Lego buildings, scuttling minifigs, and of course, a lot of zany vehicles. In a clever play on the endless remouldability of Lego models, your vehicle can instantly transform, so circuits quickly swap between road, offroad and water sections. There are even jetpacks later on.</p><p>The career mode puts you into the fireproof boots of a rookie driver competing in a series of competitions to eventually claim the golden Sky Cup Trophy. Each of the locations provides a world crammed with mini-quests and driving challenges, and between circuit competitions you can choose to, say, battle skeleton armies, destroy invading robots, deliver flowers to a character’s crush or see how far you can jump from a mountain ledge. Wherever you drive, there is a little task or challenge to discover; most are diverting and pleasingly silly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/18/lego-2k-drive-review-a-wonderful-first-racing-game">Continue reading...</a>

## White Men Can’t Jump review – comedy remake fumbles the shot

<p>Sinqua Walls and Jack Harlow fail to recall the magic of the 1992 hit in a shallow and mostly unfunny nostalgia play</p><p>White Men Can’t Jump did not need remaking. Rosie Perez, queen of the scene stealers, made sure of that in 1992. “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8mQlT9loAU">Listening versus hearing</a>” remains among the all-time on-screen debates. Even the title encapsulated a time when basketball fandom in the 80s and 90s really was a black-and-white issue. The A-story about the mobsters hunting for their vigorish? Completely incidental. The R-rating for a comedy? No argument there.</p><p>That’s not to say the update, which premieres on Hulu, is an airball. Power’s Sinqua Walls certainly looks the part of Kamal, the hoops prodigy, to the point where the script even makes fun of his uncanny resemblance to the Miami Heat great Dwyane Wade. Teyana Taylor brings her true life experience as <a href="https://people.com/music/teyana-taylor-iman-shumpert-relationship-timeline/">an NBA wife</a> to the part of Kamal’s partner, Imani. Vince Staples and Myles Bullock are the best couple on screen, even when their chemistry is short-circuited at the end by a long-anticipated third wheel. Director of photography Tommy Maddox-Upshaw captures LA vistas in full golden-hour splendor. Marcelo Zarvos’s score is an unspoiled mix of old school and new. But none of it saves a film that undermines its own premise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/18/white-men-cant-jump-movie-review-jack-harlow">Continue reading...</a>

## Once on This Island review – stirring Little Mermaid musical in colonial Haiti

<p><strong>Regent’s Park Open Air theatre, London<br /></strong>A young woman offers her life to save an unworthy aristocrat in a passionately sung fable of Caribbean history</p><p>A tragic tale rollicking with positive energy, the 1990 musical Once on This Island gives the Little Mermaid and its sacrificial heroine a twist of Romeo and Juliet’s star-crossed conflict. Ola Ince’s forceful new production identifies its Caribbean setting with Haiti – an implicit reminder of a fragile natural world.<br /><br />Ti Moune (a storming Gabrielle Brooks), a resourceful orphan rescued from a flood by a peasant couple, saves the life of Daniel, one of the island’s snooty aristocrats (the pale-skinned <em>grands hommes</em>). She offers the gods her own life in exchange for his.</p><p>Two young girls are on stage throughout (except for the sexy bit) to hear this legend of their island’s origins. There’s an innocence to the storytelling: the unassuming chime of Lynn Ahrens’ lyrics and Stephen Flaherty’s emotive melodies, piqued by what the era called “world music”. Yet in their adaptation of Rosa Guy’s 1985 novel My Love, My Love, the divide between the lovers’ worlds is sharpened by class, colourism and the long tail of colonial rule: “What can a peasant do for a <em>grand homme</em> but shine his shoes?”<br /><br />Ince’s fluid, forward-facing production confronts the story’s cruelty and channels some terrific choreography by Kenrick “H20” Sandy. A tangled throng will suddenly snap into patterns, or hymn nature with curving hips and circling arms. On Georgia Lowe’s undecorated stage, it’s the cast that summon the environment – carolling like birds, waving like trees. Only gradually is the stage licked by flame or filled with the gods’ own tears.</p><p>At <a href="https://openairtheatre.com/production/once-on-this-island">Regent’s Park Open Air theatre, London</a>, until 10 June</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/18/once-on-this-island-review-regents-park-open-air-theatre-london-little-mermaid">Continue reading...</a>

Moisés Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister have been at the centre of Brighton’s impressive season, driving them up to sixth in the table. Brighton look likely to play in the Europa League next season, but the clubs trying to sign Caicedo and Mac Allister can offer Champions League football – or much higher wages.

## Sarah Sze: The Waiting Room review – astonishing kaleidoscopic slideshow for the smartphone age

<p><strong>Peckham Rye station, London</strong><br />Like an experiment in time travel and a vision of things to come, Sze’s exhilarating video sculpture gives the sensation of a brain fried by information overload</p><p>Sarah Sze’s The Waiting Room is an astonishing phantasmagoria, filling the gloom of a long abandoned and forgotten interior in Peckham Rye railway station in London with sound and images. Built in 1865, the station included an especially vast, high-ceilinged waiting room, which closed more than a century ago. All but forgotten for more than 50 years, few who use the station know it is there, up a flight of stairs near the station entrance. Old-fashioned hand-painted signage on the stairs points up to the billiard hall which replaced the waiting room in 1922, though that too was closed down at the end of the 1950s. Since then, the room has been empty. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artangel">Artangel</a>, which commissioned Sze’s project, has once again married an artist and a space. It is more than a venue. The whole thing feels like an experiment in time travel, a vision of things to come created in the slipstream of a bygone age.</p><p>Visitors might be forgiven for thinking they had found themselves pitched into the kind of sci-fi world imagined by HG Wells, or confronted by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/08/steampunk-lincoln">steampunk </a>technological apparition which has suddenly materialised from another dimension. Sze’s work fills the space with projections that travel the ruined walls and are cast on numerous larger and smaller screens set into the concave face of a huge hemispherical structure in the centre of the space. Each little screen is a piece of deckle-edged paper. They are like pages from a 19th-century notebook. All are mounted on a supporting structure of slender stainless steel rods and clamps. The whole arrangement creates the illusion of a sphere or globe hanging magically in space. A projected puddle of water pools on the floor beneath this structure. It is as if the world were leaking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/18/sarah-sze-the-waiting-room-review-peckham-rye-station-london">Continue reading...</a>

How can I improve my chances?</p><p><strong>I left the UK </strong><strong>to move</strong><strong> abroad in early 2020, leaving behind (geographically speaking) the close friendships I had made </strong><strong>in my formative years. Now</strong>,<strong> in my 30s, </strong><strong>I am struggling to convert casual acquaintances into meaningful friendships. I work </strong><strong>from home and I </strong><strong>live alone, so to compensate I attend various social events and regular activities</strong><strong>. I have met people</strong><strong> I like and who</strong><strong> seem to like me, but </strong><strong>it</strong><strong> never gets past the fledgling friendship stage</strong><strong> – </strong><strong>hanging out a couple of times before it fizzles out and we lose touch. The lack of close friendships is making me feel lonely and unfulfilled</strong><strong>; something I once had is missing from my adult life. What can I do to improve my chances of building better, closer </strong><strong>friendships</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p>There is a sense of yearning in your letter to which many people will relate.

## Lewis Capaldi: Broken By Desire to Be Heavenly Sent review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week

<p><strong>(EMI)</strong><br />The follow-up to one of this century’s most successful albums offers more of the same – a powerful voice and insight into heartbreak. But the wounded choruses can merge into one</p><p>Last month, the 90-minute documentary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/lewis-capaldi">Lewis Capaldi</a>: How I’m Feeling Now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/31/lewis-capaldi-how-im-feeling-now-review-self-aware-star-struggling-with-weight-of-expectation">premiered on Netflix</a>. Its effect on the singer’s sales figures was almost instantaneous. Singles that were dropping out of the charts suddenly reversed their course. When his latest, Wish You the Best, came in at No 1, Capaldi had three singles in the Top 20. For good measure, he also had a Top 5 album, 2019’s deathless Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent having also enjoyed its umpteenth surge in sales and streams.</p><p>Well, of course it did. If there was a lesson to be learned from the unexpected, Stranger Things-fuelled ascent of Kate Bush’s Running Up That Hill, it’s that, in the 2020s, nothing drives sales and streaming figures quite like telly. Nevertheless, it seems a little odd in the case of How I’m Feeling Now, a harrowing study of the weight of responsibility that comes with selling 10m albums – the moment, as Capaldi puts it, when you realise an array of people are “depending” on your continued success. It’s filled with haunting images – the ashen faces of Capaldi’s parents when he attempts to brush off a twitch later diagnosed as Tourette syndrome; the distressing footage of the singer having a panic attack midway through a gig at Wembley Arena; the sight of Capaldi, tics raging as his manager lectures him on the necessity to not “fuck it up” – that linger in the mind far longer than the apparently happy ending: Capaldi back at No 1, his mental health in check, everyone wreathed in smiles. You find yourself wondering whether another huge hit album is what he needs – whether it might not be better in the long run if he was just left in peace to enjoy the fruits of his debut album’s success.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/18/lewis-capaldi-broken-by-desire-to-be-heavenly-sent-review-hits-and-grit-from-the-new-pope-of-mope">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hosting the Southeast Asian games was a step in the right direction in a country whose football has suffered for years</p><p>The big European teams summer in Asia on a regular basis but never make it to Cambodia despite the fact that Phnom Penh is a more passionate football hotbed than sleek megacities such as Shanghai, Singapore and Seoul. Cambodia is, however, slowly emerging in football with big crowds, young talent and, just this month, the hosting of the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games. This mini-Olympics for a region of 650 million has been a sign that the country can not only stage major sporting events but can challenge bigger regional rivals such as Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia on the pitch too.</p><p>It has been a long time coming but then few countries have had a harder journey. Three years after achieving independence from French Indochina in 1953, the Angkor Warriors played their first ever international against Malaysia.

## I have unsavoury habits in the kitchen – but don’t we all? | Jay Rayner

<p>At home I double dip. And triple dip. And lick the spoon again. I’m sure I’m in good company</p><p>I have filthy habits. They’re not unusual habits, or even unusually filthy. You probably have them too. But in the right environment, they can look so terribly, terribly wrong. That environment is a TV studio. Recently, for reasons I must for the moment remain coy about, I found myself cooking against the clock before a phalanx of TV cameras. I should have been focused solely on the tasks at hand. Instead, the words banging around inside my head were: whatever you do don’t lick your fingers. And don’t lick that spoon you’re stirring the pot with. And for god’s sake wash your hands after handling ingredients.</p><p>At home, that voice is never in my head.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/12/jay-rayner-a-pest-in-the-kitchen"> I break all these rules while cooking</a>, and more. While I know newspaper columnists often mistakenly think they are merely giving voice to something that is a shared experience when it really isn’t, on this I’m sure I’m in very good and very extensive company. The fact is, home cooks are not the same as the people who get paid for it, and hooray for that. Professional kitchens have important personal hygiene rules, and 19 different colour-coded plastic chopping boards. In those places it’s a new spoon every time. Or, at least, it should be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/18/i-have-unsavoury-habits-in-the-kitchen-but-dont-we-all-jay-rayner">Continue reading...</a>

Even people who I didn’t even know were into video games have asked me if it’s as good as they were hoping. I was on the BBC News at Six talking about it, which delighted me because, for many, many years, the BBC didn’t pay attention to video games unless someone had claimed they were destroying children’s lives or deemed them opaquely responsible for a violent event. I had a fun conversation about it on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/12/1175893490/the-new-zelda-game-tears-of-the-kingdom-lives-up-to-the-hype">NPR’s Consider This</a>. I’ve written about five articles about it in the past week and, apparently, I still haven’t exhausted the topic.</p><p>It is pleasantly surprising that the world at large has taken such an interest in Tears of the Kingdom, because for most of the 30-odd years that I’ve been playing Zelda games, they have been the nerdy connoisseur’s choice from the Nintendo canon. When I was a teenager, the only other people I knew who loved Zelda were fellow geeky kids who were into fantasy novels. A huge proportion of game developers and critics love Zelda, but the games have never been bestsellers. Indeed, before Breath of the Wild, the leading Zelda game was the 2006 emo-era classic Twilight Princess (my least favourite, don’t @ me), which sold around 9m copies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/17/pushing-buttons-tears-of-the-kingdom">Continue reading...</a>

## It’s time to guarantee healthcare to all Americans as a human right | Bernie Sanders

<p>It is time to end the international embarrassment of the US being the only major country that does not guarantee healthcare</p><p>Let’s be clear. The current healthcare system in the United States is totally broken, dysfunctional and cruel. It is a system which spends twice as much per capita as any other major country, while 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, one out of four Americans cannot afford the cost of the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe, and where over 60,000 die each year because they don’t get to a doctor on time.</p><p>It is a system in which our life expectancy is lower than almost all other major countries and is actually declining, a system in which working class and low-income Americans die at least ten years younger than wealthier Americans.</p><p>Bernie Sanders is a US Senator and the ranking member of the Senate budget committee.

<p>Blend of intelligence and power should see off Inter in final and confirm petrostate clubs have finally surpassed traditional elite</p><p>For 15 years, Manchester City have had one ambition above all others. Since Sheikh Mansour acquired the club, the Champions League has been their goal. They’ve quested over high mountains and through dark forests. They’ve lost in quarter-finals and semi-finals, once <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/29/manchester-city-chelsea-champions-league-final-match-report-kai-havertz">in the final</a> itself, thwarted by heroes and monsters, undone often as much by themselves as by external opponents. And now at last, they stand again just one game from glory, and in their way stands the ultimate test: Inter, the team lying third in Europe’s fourth-best league.</p><p>It’s often said at particularly dramatic moments in sport that you couldn’t write the script. Well, you wouldn’t write this one. The narrative demands that the final stage, the apotheosis of Abu Dhabi’s City project, should have a finale rather grander than this, that the final boss to be overcome should be rather more intimidating than a ragtag squad of things that were popular in England several years ago: Edin Dzeko, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Romelu Lukaku, Goldie the Blue Peter dog and social democracy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/18/manchester-city-real-madrid-era-defining-triumph-inter-final-champions-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Has a bad breakup made you lose faith in romance – or even yourself? Are you fed up with scouring the apps? Here, relationship experts explain the healthiest ways to look for love</p><p>Since she separated from her partner five years ago, Sarah has been on two dates. “Every time I think about it, I recoil at the idea of trusting someone like I did before,” she says. On the rare occasion she looks at a dating app – the last time, she deleted it after 24 hours – she scours the profiles for warning signs. “It’s very hard for me to see positives in people’s profiles. Would I like to meet someone again? Absolutely. But I think my trust levels are damaged. I struggle trying to make any sort of connection.”</p><p>Sarah, 44, and her partner had been together for eight years. They had agreed they would try for children in the future, but, over the years, she says, her partner became selfish and used her financially. When they finally broke up, he told her he had never had any intention of starting a family. “When that imploded, everything felt like it had ended, because I’d lost my sense of self during that time. It was a catastrophic change for me, even though I needed to be out of that relationship.” At the time, it felt as if she had “failed as a human being”, she says. “It’s not just trusting other people; it’s trusting myself. I let myself get into a situation before and now I don’t trust my own judgment; will I see it next time?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/18/all-of-us-are-worthy-of-love-how-to-start-dating-again-after-heartbreak">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Artists are hitting No 1, then dropping out of the Top 100 the following week. Industry figures ponder whether the chart is still a barometer of taste – or just a marketing ploy</p><p>Last week, Ed Sheeran secured the fastest-selling album of the year so far with his latest release, – (Subtract). The achievement comes as little surprise. Indeed, after six consecutive No 1 albums (a combined total of 46 weeks at the top spot) – and prompting the Official Charts Company (OCC) to rewrite the singles chart rules after he landed 16 songs from ÷ in the Top 20 in 2017 – he’s no stranger to storming the charts.</p><p>But elsewhere in the official albums chart, things are much less secure. It’s increasingly common for artists to break into the Top 10 for one week before suddenly plummeting or disappearing altogether. Last month, Ellie Goulding reached No 1 with her new record, Higher Than Heaven; but in its second week, it dropped to No 84. Meanwhile, a confusing mix of plucky indie acts with loyal fanbases, decades-old releases and greatest hits compilations sit side by side in the chart, prompting questions about what they actually represent in 2023.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/18/its-not-a-pop-the-champagne-moment-any-more-is-the-uk-album-chart-broken">Continue reading...</a>

The show centers around Forest Lawn’s Hall of Crucifixion-Resurrection – which has displayed two enormous panoramas for decades – and it also offers other enormous works, like the Panorama of the Valley of the Smokes, made by artist Sara Velas in 2000. In addition, the show provides a rich assortment of broadsides, rare objects and ephemera from the 19th-century world of panoramas that help audiences truly get inside the creation and exhibition of these massive pieces.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/18/panorama-paintings-grand-views-exhibition-california">Continue reading...</a>

## Is This OK? by Harriet Gibsone review – second life

<p>A woman comes of age on the internet in a memoir that swings between funny and profound</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/06/harriet-the-spy-helped-me-come-to-terms-with-my-queer-identity" title="">Harriet the Spy</a> is a 1964 childrens’ book about a little girl who snoops relentlessly on her neighbours. Harriet Gibsone did the same thing when she was young. Now in her late 30s, she still shares with the fictional Harriet a powerful imagination and endless fascination with others. Harriet the Spy was banned in a number of American schools; apparently morally upright people didn’t approve of watchful girls trying to figure out the world on their own terms. I love these characters, nurturing as they do some feeling of control in a world where they do not have any.</p><p>Is This OK? is a memoir, full of finely told stories that were once secrets existing only in the writer’s mind; addictions, obsessions, weirdnesses. Gibsone came of age at the same time as the internet, her own development shaped by its strange currents. She chooses episodes from her life and makes some of them funny – laugh-out-loud-on-the-train funny; some of them are frightening and sad. Many illuminate a bigger truth about living at this peculiar time and in the grey area between the online and offline worlds. That is, of course, where many of us spend hours each day, without fully realising it, even as researchers warn us of the negative impact on self-esteem and mental health.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/18/is-this-ok-by-harriet-gibsone-review-second-life">Continue reading...</a>

## Rolf Harris: Hiding in Plain Sight review – the awful truth behind the abuse that shocked a nation

<p>This two-part ITV documentary lets the presenter’s victims tell their stories with sensitivity, as well as asking wider questions – about the people who enabled his sexual assaults</p><p>There can be few people who, when the outpouring of allegations of historic child sexual abuse against the late Jimmy Savile began in 2012, did not at least acknowledge that there had always been something unsettling about the man, even if their only exposure to him was a few seconds of Jim’ll Fix It. Those who followed him more closely would have read the clues to his monstrousness scattered in his autobiography, the hints he gave to interviewers that his apparent philanthropy was a front to allow him to get away with things, or the casual jokes he made about sex with young girls (“My case comes up next Thursday!”). Of course those who worked in the prisons and hospitals that allowed him free access to patients knew far more – from the nurses who would refuse to leave vulnerable patients alone with him to the higher-ups to whom those nurses did not feel able to complain.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rolf-harris">Rolf Harris</a> was different. When he was arrested in 2013 and charged as a result of the Operation Yewtree police investigation (leading to a conviction on 12 counts of indecent assault – one later overturned – and a nearly six-year sentence, of which he served half), there was genuine shock and disbelief. Nobody saw it coming, I don’t think. Except his many victims, of course, whose years of silent suffering are firmly attested to in this two-part documentary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/18/rolf-harris-hiding-in-plain-sight-review-the-awful-truth-behind-the-abuse-that-shocked-a-nation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 10-part spin-off from the streamer’s hit To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before trilogy is a messy but mostly entertaining endeavor</p><p>The first episode of the new Netflix romcom XO, Kitty runs through its exposition like a sprint.</p><p>It starts with our 16-year-old biracial Korean American protagonist Kitty Song Covey (Anna Cathcart) hopping a plane from her home in Portland to the Korean Independent School of Seoul, or Kiss, her late mother’s alma mater. It’s also the current school of her long-distance boyfriend, Dae (Minyeong Choi), and she’s just enrolled without telling him – an unannounced romantic gesture that, to no adult viewer’s surprise, ends in utter disaster. Kitty soon finds out that Yuri, the teen hotel heiress who gives her a ride on their first day of school, is actually Dae’s girlfriend. And throughout his relationship with Kitty, Dae’s also been lying about his family’s economic status: he’s struggling to afford tuition, and his father is Yuri’s family driver. Yuri’s mother, Jin (Yunjin Kim), meanwhile, is the principal of Kiss, and for reasons unknown chooses to lie about having been friends with Kitty’s mother, despite a 20-year-old photograph featuring the two of them together. Yuri’s got her own secret, too: she’s been paying Dae to be her boyfriend, using their fake relationship to cover up her real love for a girl named Juliana.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/18/xo-kitty-review-to-all-the-boys-netflix-spinoff">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ahead of a historic survey of her work at Margate’s Turner Contemporary, the Brazilian artist discusses her global inspirations, shape-shifting patterns, and why she’s still an optimist</p><p>Navigating Beatriz Milhazes’ febrile reinvention of geometric abstraction can feel like trying to make headway through a carnival crowd. Hoops, mandalas, flowers and other circular motifs spin like dancers across her canvases, their bright colours slamming into each other. With its erupting forms, which have evolved from tumbly, lacy arabesques to hard-edged grids, sprouting leaves and flowing waves, the Rio de Janeiro-based artist’s work has the excess of a street party, a baroque church, a jungle.</p><p>“I’ve tried to bring new possibilities to the course of abstraction,” she says while getting ready for her first UK institutional show in more than two decades: a survey, at Margate’s Turner Contemporary, of 20 key paintings spanning her 30-plus year career as one of the world’s leading abstract painters. “My challenge is how to work with geometry and life.

<p>Water affects a family’s fate in this enthralling epic from the physician-author, set across three generations</p><p>The physician-writer Abraham Verghese’s riveting, sprawling epic opens with a mother and her 12-year-old daughter crying. It is 1900 in Travancore, south India, today part of Kerala, and in the morning, the frightened girl is to marry a man who is 40 and a widower. She will do as she is told but she cannot imagine the future ahead. Her mother reassures her but soon her voice ebbs, her breathing slows, and then she is asleep, leaving her daughter awake. The body’s need for rest overtakes the mother’s anguish. And we are thus ushered into the next day and the girl’s journey on a boat far from her childhood home.</p><p>Big Ammachi, as the girl will come to be known, will grow to love her husband; he, in turn, will treat her like the child she is for several more years. By the time she is 17, she will give birth to her first child, a daughter named Baby Mol. They live on their estate, Parambil, the labour handled dutifully by a man named Shamuel, who is part of the landless caste called the <em>pulayan</em>. Big Ammachi eventually has a son, Philipose, and he and Shamuel’s young son, Joppan, are playmates, but when a school official prohibits Joppan from attending class, Big Ammachi finds herself struggling to explain the caste system that is forcing the friends to live increasingly segregated lives. “Its roots are deep and so ancient that it feels like a law of nature, like rivers going to the sea. But the pain in those innocent eyes reminds her of what is so easy to forget: the caste system is an abomination.” Decades later, Philipose and Joppan will have uncomfortable conversations about what is owed by landowners to the <em>pulayan,</em> but any lingering anger that Joppan might have is put off for another generation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/18/the-covenant-of-water-by-abraham-verghese-review-a-curse-in-kerala">Continue reading...</a>

## No, ADHD is not a con. If that’s the message you got from Panorama’s exposé, you weren’t paying attention or watching properly | Adrian Chiles

<p>Until I got a diagnosis, ADHD made my life heart-stoppingly, nerve-shreddingly difficult. Many of those affected still struggle to get the treatment they need</p><p>‘Turns out it’s all a con, then,” someone said to me. This was attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) they were talking about, in reference to Monday evening’s BBC Panorama, which showed what looked like the decidedly doubtful practices of some reassuringly expensive private providers of psychiatry. So brilliant were some of the clinicians at the places featured that with the benefit of but a short questionnaire and a brief online chat, we were told they were able to diagnose ADHD and prescribe potent medication. Great! What service! And what a marvellous business plan: dosh for diagnoses, money for meds.</p><p>Panorama could hardly have made it clearer that while a handful of private clinics may be guilty of misdiagnosing ADHD, that doesn’t mean that ADHD itself isn’t a serious, debilitating condition. But if you’ve been a sceptic all along, or weren’t watching carefully enough, or you didn’t watch at all and merely half-heard or half-read something about the BBC programme, then you might well be the person who says to me: “Turns out it’s all a con, then.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2023/may/18/no-adhd-is-not-a-con-if-thats-the-message-you-got-from-panoramas-expose-you-werent-paying-attention">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘The music moved me to tears’: falling in love with Albania

<p>After visiting 17 countries for his latest book, our writer leaves his heart in Albania – ‘a country of knotty history, boundless hospitality and infinite surprises’</p><p>Over the past four years, I have travelled to 17 countries for my book Goodbye Eastern Europe. In it, I try to chart a vanished eastern Europe, one in which cultural multiplicity and religious tolerance were the rule, rather than the exception. Albania was one of only a few places in which that legacy was not a memory but a living reality. Seeing it in action gave me hope, not just for the Balkans, but for Europe as a whole.</p><p>I felt trepidation before my first visit there in 2019. You could chalk that up to what the Bulgarian scholar <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maria-todorova">Maria Todorova</a> called “nested Balkanisms”: the tendency of every eastern European country to regard itself as the golden mean, and look at its neighbours (especially to the south and east) with suspicion. I’m Polish, and I’ve been travelling through the region long enough to have experienced every kind of basic material discomfort. But I’m also old enough to remember images broadcast from Albania after the fall of communism and the civil war that swept over the country in 1997. Even though much time has passed since then, I wasn’t sure what I would find.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/18/albania-holiday-culture-tirana-walking-mountains">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Landfill sites have swallowed many a beauty spot along the Thames estuary in the past 50 years. Now, as those dumps start to disgorge tonnes of mouldering detritus into the river, it truly feels like the Age of Consequences</p><p>In 1971, the Angling Times sent reporter Dave Nash to document a disaster in Ockendon, Essex. The resulting article described the extinction of a local beauty spot, hundreds of hectares of open space where former gravel pits had become popular fishing lakes. “In less than a decade, what was one of the best fisheries in Essex has been savagely raped and despoiled. Seven hundred tons of household garbage is deposited into the pits every day, along with a similar undisclosed amount of industrial refuse.” The article was accompanied by a striking picture, taken by Nash, showing two men attempting to catch a pike between the scrap cars that lined the bank of Arisdale lake. “If it’s not the water level dropping,” said Jerry Hulbert, the vice-president of the Moor Hall and Belhus Angling Society, “then it’s the rubbish encroaching a few feet every day.”</p><p>I came across this story via my father-in-law, Cliff Hatton, who had sent me the newspaper cutting in the post. He would often tell me how the gravel pits, clay pits and sand pits of South Ockendon – initially dug out by the Ham River Grit company to feed the post-second world war hunger for concrete in south-east England – became, in his own excited words, “a nirvana” once they had naturally filled with water. “You dig a hole in Thurrock, leave it a few years and there are fish in it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/18/the-rubbishscapes-of-essex-why-our-buried-trash-is-back-to-haunt-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anyone with an internet connection knows that Sylvester Stallone had marriage troubles while filming this reality show about his family. So why does this series ignore it?</p><p>It’s been a long time since reality TV was a truly embarrassing thing to appear on. Ever since the 1988 writers’ strike, when the genre was introduced to fill gaps in schedules, it has been popular with viewers. Plus, the Apprentice host managed to become the US president, and there have been reality shows starring bona fide movie stars such as Clint Eastwood and Mark Wahlberg. So The Family Stallone, Sylvester Stallone’s brazen attempt to turn his kids into reality stars, may come across as a little thirsty, but it doesn’t feel like an egregious betrayal of his Hollywood legacy.</p><p>We are introduced to him on the set of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/15/tulsa-king-review-sylvester-stallone-mobster-paramount">Tulsa King</a>, the crime drama he has been filming in Oklahoma for the past six months. We see him return to his stunning Hidden Hills estate in LA and his wife of 25 years, Jennifer Flavin – though they frequently remind us that they first fell in love 35 years prior. A quick bit of maths reveals that she was about 19 and he was 41, but hey ho, it was the 80s. Also waiting for him are their three gorgeous daughters: it is not clear if they live there or have jobs or ambitions beyond being Sly’s offspring, but in the two episodes provided for review, being his daughter looks pretty fun.</p><p>The Family Stallone is on Paramount+.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/18/the-family-stallone-review-what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-this-bizarre-editing-of-slys-life">Continue reading...</a>

Who or what is to blame, apart from Putin, feed prices, the supermarkets … ?</p><p>In a field outside the village of Kehelland, near Camborne in Cornwall, a brood of hens are doing their thing – clucking, scratching, pecking at the ground, ranging freely among the grasses, crimson clover and kale. “All right, girls?” says Pete Olds, picking one up and cradling her fondly. They are bovans brown laying hens and he has 14,000 of them, which sounds a lot but is actually quite small in poultry farm terms.</p><p>Cornhill Farm has been in his family for four generations, though they have only kept poultry for a couple of decades.

<p>A first-of-its-kind non-hormonal drug to treat hot flushes has been approved in the US. Targeting connections in the brain that change during menopause, the drug, called fezolinetant, could provide relief for those who aren’t able to take hormonal replacement therapy. Madeleine Finlay speaks to endocrinologist and menopause specialist Prof Annice Mukherjee to find out what we know about the mechanism that causes hot flushes, how this new drug works, and what it might mean for those experiencing menopause in the future.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2023/may/18/menopause-could-a-new-brain-based-treatment-cure-hot-flushes-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Triumphal arch in Cinquantenaire park ‘linked to exploitation of Congo’, says cultural group in Belgian capital</p><p>For many Belgians, the Cinquantenaire park in Brussels evokes memories of childhood visits to see the stuffed horses of the military history museum, or vintage cars at Autoworld, two institutions on the edge of the park.</p><p>The much-loved green space’s cheerful flowers and whimsical follies contrast with the steel canyons and beeping traffic of the adjacent EU quarter, but above all it is an expression of national pride, with a giant Belgian tricolour often suspended underneath a massive triumphal arch. Built in 1880 to mark 50 years of the Belgian state, Belgium’s federal government last month launched a redevelopment plan for the 200th anniversary in 2030.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/18/renovation-of-brussels-park-ignites-debate-on-decolonisation">Continue reading...</a>

With Khan’s home surrounded by police yesterday, has he picked a battle he’s destined to lose?</p><p>Pakistan has been in uproar since the arrest of Imran Khan, the former prime minister, by paramilitary officers who smashed their way into a courthouse last week.
