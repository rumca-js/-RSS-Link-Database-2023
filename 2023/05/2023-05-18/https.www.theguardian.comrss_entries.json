Now, opinion polls since the party\u2019s recent local election successes show a voting intention of around 10%. The party\u2019s overall gains in the 4 May elections in England were certainly very noteworthy, but they hid poor results in the 16 largest cities; in these councils, the Liberal Democrats gained just six seats and only hold 113 out of 1,193 councillors. The difference is quite simply that to make and sustain a significant vote in the large wards involved in these cities requires a high core vote rather than just incessant local campaigning. The Liberal Democrats simply do not have a viable core vote.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/18/ed-davey-impresses-but-are-the-lib-dems-a-viable-electoral-force\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/18/ed-davey-impresses-but-are-the-lib-dems-a-viable-electoral-force", "date_published": "2023-05-18 17:01:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The view from Germany on its change of heart about military aid for Ukraine | Letters", "description": "<p><strong>Marrie Powell</strong> and <strong>Renata von Toerne</strong> respond to John Kampfner\u2019s article about Germany\u2019s pivotal role in the war</p><p>Thanks to John Kampfner for his article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/15/germany-war-in-ukraine-olaf-scholz-volodymyr-zelenskiy-military-aid-policy\" title=\"\">Germany\u2019s change of heart is now pivotal to the war in Ukraine.

There are bricks of cash to be seen in this film, no question of internet bank transfers and perhaps the whole thing happens without the involvement of the tax collector.<br /><br />Wang has already made a similar film about migrant factory workers called Bitter Money, and there are some spectacularly grim vistas in Youth: the main street of Zhili is a brutalist concrete avenue which eerily extends to the far horizon like something from a sci-fi movie (or perhaps something by Roy Andersson). The dorms themselves are squalid and cramped. But the first thing that strikes you about the workers is their energy, verve, humour and their hopefulness. Their \u201cyouth\u201d, as in the film\u2019s title, is not ironic: they are not, as I suspected they might be, prematurely aged by work (although the incessant wrangling about piecemeal rates of pay is clearly taking its toll by the end).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/18/youth-review-heart-stopping-stories-in-chinas-sweatshop-capital\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/18/youth-review-heart-stopping-stories-in-chinas-sweatshop-capital", "date_published": "2023-05-18 16:02:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene claims white supremacist label is same as N-word", "description": "<p>Far-right Republican congresswoman makes remarks after confrontation with Democratic congressman Jamaal Bowman</p><p>The far-right Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene told reporters being called a white supremacist was the same as a Black person being called the N-word.</p><p>Speaking on Thursday about a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keithedwards/status/1658978336167583754\">confrontation outside the Capitol</a> the day before with the Democratic congressman Jamaal Bowman, Greene <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1659193009521696768\">said</a>: \u201cJamaal Bowman [was] shouting at the top of his lungs, cursing, calling me a horrible \u2026 calling me a white supremacist which I take great offense to that.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/18/marjorie-taylor-greene-white-supremacist-label-n-word\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/18/marjorie-taylor-greene-white-supremacist-label-n-word", "date_published": "2023-05-18 16:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Wim Wenders: cinema today \u2018makes me nauseous\u2019", "description": "<p>Director who won Palme d\u2019Or for Paris, Texas and has two films at Cannes this year bemoans lack of new stories in mainstream film</p><p>Wim Wenders, the revered German director who has two major premieres at Cannes this year, has spoken of his \u201cdisappointment\u201d at the dominance of mainstream remakes and \u201crepetitive\u201d film franchises.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me nauseous,\u201d said Wenders, now 77, who is best-known for dramas Paris, Texas (1984) and Wings of Desire (1987), as well as music documentary Buena Vista Social Club (1999).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/18/wim-wenders-cinema-today-makes-me-nauseous\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/18/wim-wenders-cinema-today-makes-me-nauseous", "date_published": "2023-05-18 16:00:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Football authorities in talks to clamp down on dissent amid rise in incidents", "description": "<ul><li>Premier League, FA, EFL and PGMOL have met to tackle issue</li><li>534 cards shown for dissent in top four divisions this season</li></ul><p>English football\u2019s governing bodies are in talks to bring in measures to clamp down on dissent due to concern over the rise in bad behaviour towards officials.</p><p>With two weeks of the season remaining, 534 cards have been issued to players for dissent in the top four flights of English football, according to Opta \u2013 easily surpassing last season\u2019s tally of 477, as well as the 421 cards shown in 2020-21.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/18/football-authorities-in-talks-to-clamp-down-on-dissent-amid-rise-in-incidents\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/18/football-authorities-in-talks-to-clamp-down-on-dissent-amid-rise-in-incidents", "date_published": "2023-05-18 16:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "US supreme court avoids ruling on immunity for social media companies", "description": "<p>Justices refuse to weigh in on whether immunity under 1996 law that shields internet companies for what users post is too broad</p><p>The US supreme court has sidestepped a case against Google that might have allowed more lawsuits against social media companies.</p><p>The justices\u2019 decision returns to a lower court the case of a family of an American college student who was killed in an Islamic State terrorist attack in Paris.

Sze\u2019s work fills the space with projections that travel the ruined walls and are cast on numerous larger and smaller screens set into the concave face of a huge hemispherical structure in the centre of the space. Each little screen is a piece of deckle-edged paper. They are like pages from a 19th-century notebook. All are mounted on a supporting structure of slender stainless steel rods and clamps. The whole arrangement creates the illusion of a sphere or globe hanging magically in space. A projected puddle of water pools on the floor beneath this structure.
