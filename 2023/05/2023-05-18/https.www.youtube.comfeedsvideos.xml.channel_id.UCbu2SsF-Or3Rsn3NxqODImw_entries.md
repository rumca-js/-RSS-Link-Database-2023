Today we're asking Billy Billingham, an ex member of the SAS Special Forces to react to the missions of CoD: Modern Warfare 2 (2022), as he uses his extensive experience to break down some of the game's iconic missions.

Mark “Billy” Billingham served in the British SAS for over 20 years, has been responsible for planning and executing strategic operations across the world, is a certified counter terrorism instructor, has led countless hostage rescues, as well as much more.

Previously he worked as an A-list bodyguard for Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, and now acts as Chief Instructor on hit show SAS: Who Dares Wins as well as putting celebrities through gruelling challenges in Fox TV's Special Forces: World's Toughest Test.

But what does he think of the banter between Ghost and Soap in "Alone"? How realistic is Call of Duty's sniping? How does Modern Warfare 2's interrogation scenes match up to reality?
