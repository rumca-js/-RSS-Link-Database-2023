Steph Snow had an idea. “I really wanted to form a band that was all women,” she recalls. “I think there's a really good place for it here.”

After some social media posts and an informal meeting at the Como Tap in Minneapolis, the Foxgloves were formed. Ready though they were by March 2020, the band’s plans were put on hold for a couple of years. But then things really took off when the Foxgloves performed at the Blue Ox Festival in 2022. Just three years in, the six-piece Foxgloves have released an EP and a full-length album, and there’s plenty more where that came from.

The Foxgloves recently visited The Current studio to record a session with Radio Heartland’s Mike Pengra. Watch and listen to the full session above.

Cowboys in the Campfire is the latest project from revered musician Tommy Stinson and his friend and collaborator, Philadelphia guitarist Chip Roberts. "Wronger," the album from Cowboys in the Campfire, is set to release on June 2, 2023, on Cobraside Records. 

Back in April, while in town for a show at the Turf Club in St. Paul, Stinson visited The Current to play acoustic versions of a couple of songs from "Wronger," including this song, "Karma's Bitch."
