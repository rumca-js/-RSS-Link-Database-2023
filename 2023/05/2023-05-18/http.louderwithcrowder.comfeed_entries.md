There‚Äôs something eminently satisfying about watching someone who feels comfortable performing an action that everyone knows is wrong only to be swiftly dealt a huge helping of well-deserved retribution.</p><p>Who better to deal out such righteous justice than a United States Marine, who has had more than enough of people stealing his packages from his porch. I‚Äôm not saying he handled the situation in the most legal fashion, nor will I say this is the best way to deal with porch thieves. However, I will say that I‚Äôm glad he went about it the way he did because it‚Äôs hilarious.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Dude shits himself after trying to steal package <a href="https://t.co/2qweWxFeQN">pic.twitter.com/2qweWxFeQN</a><br />‚Äî Detect Fights üíï (@detectfights) <a href="https://twitter.com/detectfights/status/1655238393142341636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>‚ÄúMarine Corps, n****!‚Äù<br /></p><p>I don‚Äôt know what makes this video funnier: the initial explosion of the flashbang sending the thief to the ground, the fact that he sh*t himself, or the marine who continues to yell from inside.

## NYPD calls bullplop that Harry and Meghan almost got Princess Diana'd by paparazzi in New York City

And if that sounds like bullplop to you, it does to the NYPD as well.</p><p>The story we're told, via their publicist, is that the couple was leaving the Ziegfeld Ballroom in Midtown on Tuesday night. When an angry mom of paparazzi attacked the usual camera-shy, now former-royal, couple. This, ahem,  "ring of highly aggressive paparazzi" was in hot pursuit of the couple in a way that made it sound like a Fast and Furious movie. In New York City. </p><p>Though Harry could learn a thing or two from Dom Toretto <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/primce-harry-60-minutes" target="_blank">about not turning your back on family</a>.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúThis relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers,‚Äù the spokesperson said.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="0004b" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33699049&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Comparisons were drawn to Harry's mother Princess Diana, who was killed in a car accident after an actual relentless pursuit by paparazzi. Emphasis on "actual."</p><p>Set aside that it would defy logic that there would be ANY hot pursuit in Manhattan, what with the city's notorious traffic and congestion. The NYPD is now calling into question how "in peril" the former-royal couple was, <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/05/17/harry-meghan-car-chase-definitely-not-two-hours-source/" target="_blank">according to the New York Post</a>.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúThe NYPD assisted the private security team protecting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex,‚Äù a spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. ‚ÄúThere were numerous photographers that made their transport challenging. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries, or arrests in regard.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote>A high-ranking source added that there were ‚Äúno collision reports or 911 calls‚Äù and that the chase ‚Äúdefinitely wasn‚Äôt two hours.‚Äù</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="038f2" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33699045&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Turns out the couple was being over dramatic. Shocking, I know. Because the couple hates attention. So much so that Meghan Markle wanted to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/south-park-meghan-markle-harry" target="_blank">sue South Park for mocking them as attention whores</a>.</p><p>No paparazzi were injured in this incident. Somewhere in England, the King let out a chuckle.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>Ketch tells The Daily Signal she doesn't know what "information" the FBI had that needed to be discussed with her. But she has a guess:</p><blockquote>"My colleague at Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, Lauren Handy, is indicted under the FACE Act and is being prosecuted by the federal government. It‚Äôs plausible that these FBI agents aimed to collect information from me to help build their case against her."</blockquote><p>The FACE Act (Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances) is the law used by the left to make peacefully protesting outside of abortion clinics illegal. It is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/prayer-army-vet-fined" target="_blank">similar to the laws in England</a> where <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/buffer-zones-prayer-uk" target="_blank">they can arrest you for praying</a>. When the Adminstration <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mark-houck-video-arrest" target="_blank">went after Mark Rourk and had him arrested at his home</a>, it was under the FACE Act.</p><p><em>NOTE: <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/doj-activist-catholic-church" target="_blank">Biden's deplorable DOJ won't seek jail time for the trans activist who attacked a church over Roe v Wade</a>.</em></p><p>Ketch feels the FBI showing up at her mother's house was an attempt to intimidate HER. It's difficult to see it as anything other than that.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Woke 2023 progressives want Howard Stern canceled over this "sexist" 1990s video, and I can't with these people

There is a good chance Howard Stern is on air apologizing for EVERYTHING that made him Howard Stern and begging his <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/howard-stern-kirstie-alley" target="_blank">new progressive audience</a> for forgiveness. It would be sad if that's the case. But someone discovered prior to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/howard-stern-baba-booey-son" target="_blank">Howard becoming a corporate sellout</a>, he used to be fun. They spliced together some of his "problematic" comments to women from the 90s.</p><p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lmpsluvbot/video/7231644138972663067" target="_blank">Someone who appears to run a Lisa Marie Pressley stan account </a>-- talk about a niche audience -- posted this video of Howard talking about thongs and boobies with the caption: "this man is so disgusting, i dont even understand how he still has a job?!"</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">TikTok just discovered before Howard Stern became a corporate sellout, he used to be fun.<br /><br />Wait until they learn he has a movie... <a href="https://t.co/1CgT0FSx2B">pic.twitter.com/1CgT0FSx2B</a><br />‚Äî Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1659151308551516160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Stern was recently the subject of a now-viral TikTok video that shows him making inappropriate and offensive comments toward a slew of female show guests, including Anna Nicole Smith, Lisa Marie Presley, Mariah Carey, Sof√≠a Vergara and Courtney Love. They‚Äôre indicative of Stern‚Äôs often lewd and sexually charged banter with women on his show over the decades ‚Äî a style that became one of Stern‚Äôs calling cards.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/howard-stern-backlash-women-guests-compilation-video/" target="_blank">The comments and tweets that followed</a> are like a parody of what you would assume they would be:</p><p>"‚ÄúHoward stern is the world‚Äôs worst interviewer. such a sick twisted individual especially when it comes to women."</p><p>‚ÄúMR.STERN, INSTEAD OF WORRYING WHY MEN DONT APPROACH YOU WHEN SITTING COURTSIDE CLEAN YOUR NAME UP WITH THESE WOMEN.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúAll these poor women fml."</p><p><span></span>‚ÄúWho does he think he is‚Ä¶ they all deserve better"</p><p><span></span>‚ÄúWith cancel culture, how did they never go after Stern."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>What we have here is yet another example of chuckleheaded zoomers and millennials not realizing there was life before the day they were born. "How did they never go after Stern?" THEY WENT AFTER STERN ALL THROUGHOUT THE 80S AND 90S. IT'S WHAT MADE HIM STERN! THERE ARE TWO BOOKS AND A MOVIE ABOUT IT!</p><p>If people thought this was offensive, wait until the "lesbians equal ratings" compilation drops. Leftists will really get their panties in a wad over that one. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gender-scotland-comedy-club" target="_blank">If they still cared</a> what <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-twenty-quotes" target="_blank">lesbians thought</a>.<br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="3a8db" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33692039&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Stern may be a corporate sellout now, but for a lot of us he was our "Richard Prior." He was the guy your dads let you listen to as long as you didn't tell your mom. I used to listen with my dad before little league practice when Stern was on WNNNNNNNBC.</p><p>And all the women in that video were FRIENDS with Howard. They were regulars on the show. They were in on it. They knew who Howard was because we were allowed to laugh and have a sense of humor back in the day.</p><p>But as I said upfront, there is a chance he is on air apologizing for everything and announcing to his audience he's going to go "educate" himself to atone for the only reason any of us know who he is. That would be such a 2023 to happen.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
