<p>If you're working your way through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s main quest, you'll eventually work alongside the Zora and find yourself high above Hyrule on Wellspring Island. It's here that you'll find Igoshon Shrine--and we hope you like water. Here's how to complete this shrine full of water orbs.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to solve the Igoshon Shrine puzzle in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p>When you first enter Igoshon Shrine, simply head forward, step into the water orb here, and ride it up to the next level. At the top, look immediately to your left to see a <strong>chest</strong> that keeps dropping over and over. Using your Ultrahand, grab the nearby water orb and hold it under the chest. It will get stuck in the water orb, letting you bring it to solid land and open it up for a Large Zonai Charge.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4139699-fwydk2baaaiayhg.jpg"><img alt="Use the water orb to catch the chest, then bring it to solid land to open it." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4139699-fwydk2baaaiayhg.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Use the water orb to catch the chest, then bring it to solid land to open it.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, take note that the water orb on the right side of this platform is moving in reverse.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> Iun-Orok Shrine puzzle, The Right Roll, can be somewhat confusing.

But none of them harken back to being a kid as much as Mayaumekis Shrine, reminding us all of what it was like bouncing on a trampoline (or a bed, perhaps) by asking you to do the same along some ship sails.

If you look up and to the left, you'll spot a small platform jutting out from the wall in the corner, which is where you'll find this shrine's <strong>chest</strong>. Bounce on the moving ship when it's closest to that platform, then glide over to the chest for some arrows.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-mayaumekis-shrine-puzzle-guide/1100-6514301/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Disney Cancels Plans For $1 Billion Florida Expansion Amid Fight With DeSantis

<p>Media giant Disney has canceled plans to create a $1 billion office park in Florida that the company estimated would have brought 2,000 jobs to the state amid its fight with governor Ron DeSantis. Disney CEO Bob Iger said on an earnings call recently that, in fighting Disney, DeSantis was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-ceo-comments-on-fight-with-florida-governor-ron-desantis/1100-6514055/">potentially jeopardizing further investment</a> from the House of Mouse. And on Thursday, the company showed that it was not bluffing.</p><p>The Florida project, known as Lake Nona Town Center, would have included a massive new complex. 1,000 workers from Disney's Southern California offices were due to relocate, and a further 1,000 would join to work on Imagineering projects.</p><p>Some workers complained and threatened to quit over the prospect of being relocated (and some 200 reportedly already relocated).

<p dir="ltr">Lucasfilm has rolled out a new featurette for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, providing fans with a glimpse into the character's final chapter. The film is set to hit theaters on June 30.</p><p dir="ltr">The featurette includes interviews with the cast and crew, who emphasize that the film was approached as the concluding chapter in Indiana Jones' saga, rather than an attempt to pave the way for future installments. Harrison Ford reprises his role as the legendary hero archaeologist, accompanied by a stellar cast including Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies, Shaunette Renee Wilson, Thomas Kretschmann, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook, Oliver Richters, Ethann Isidore, and Mads Mikkelsen. Check it out below.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Directed by James Mangold (Logan, Ford v Ferrari) and produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall, and Simon Emanuel, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny marks the first entry in the franchise not directed by Steven Spielberg. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steven-spielberg-regrets-controversial-change-to-e-t/1100-6513600/">at the Time 100 Summit last month</a> Spielberg himself has expressed his admiration for Mangold's handling of the material, sharing his surprise at discovering another capable filmmaker who could bring the Indiana Jones adventure to life.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dial-of-destiny-video-reflects-on-indiana-jones-final-chapter/1100-6514351/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2 Season Of The Deep Artifact Perks Sound Like A Shockingly Good Time

<p dir="ltr">Bungie has revealed another key piece of information about the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-deep-release-date-armor-story-and-everything-we-know/1100-6513865/">Season of the Deep</a> for Destiny 2. The full list of Artifact perks for Season 21 is now available, and it sounds like running Arc will be particularly fun next season.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of the way they can dictate what weapons and subclasses you'll want to use, Artifact perks are a key component of the game, keeping things fresh from season to season. (However, it'll be immeasurably sad to see Bricks From Beyond and Volatile Flow leave.) While these aren't entirely Arc-focused in Season of the Deep, there are a number of reasons you'll want to run an Arc subclass. That includes the Show and Awe perk: While Amplified, Arc final blows will cause a burst of lightning that damages and jolts enemies. There's also Lightning Strikes Twice, which causes your Arc grenade to recharge faster after throwing one, with the duration of that buff being extended by Arc final blows.</p><p dir="ltr">Other Arc-focused perks include Amped Up, which grants damage resistance while Amplified; Thunderous Retort, which grants bonus damage to your Arc Super if you activate it while Amplified or critically wounded; and Electric Armor, which allows you to stay Amplified for longer--which will be key with so many perks relying on that buff being active.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-deep-artifact-perks-sound-like-a-shockingly-good-time/1100-6514349/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/">Diablo Immortal</a> is turning one June 2, and Blizzard is looking to celebrate the game's first anniversary by reminding players that they could be playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV</a> instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo-immortal/23954931/we-re-raising-hell-diablo-immortal-is-turning-one">announced</a> that a Diablo IV launch celebration event will arrive in Diablo Immortal in early June, around the same time Diablo IV arrives. Though additional details haven't been released, it will revolve around an event titled Merciless Monstrosity and add a Lilith-themed battle pass into the free-to-play mobile ARPG. It will additionally introduce the Hatred's Heritage Phantom Market, all of which Blizzard says will be "experienceable expressions of Sanctuary's matriarch."</p><p dir="ltr">But while the Diablo IV crossover event may seem like it's encouraging players to step away from Diablo Immortal to experience the new main entry in the franchise, Diablo Immortal will be receiving something Diablo IV won't likely have for quite some time: a brand-new class.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-is-celebrating-its-one-year-anniversary-by-throwing-a-party-for-diablo-4/1100-6514350/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in 1997's Batman &amp; Robin as the villain Mr. Freeze, and as it turns out, he was paid a gigantic sum.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvK5YRxjk0&amp;embeds_widget_referrer=https://www.gamespot.com/phoenix-cms/articles/form&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https://cdn.embedly.com/&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https://cdn.embedly.com&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&amp;feature=emb_title">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the former bodybuilding champion discussed how his thoughts about money changed over the years as his own personal circumstances improved.

<p>Sony and Marvel's Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is arriving in theaters in two weeks and the studio released brand-new character posters, revving that hype machine. The first three are characters from the first film, Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), and Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson). Sony even included the recent creation Spider-Cat from its Spider-Man game. </p><p>A handful of new characters will hit the big screen for the first time, such as Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099 voiced by Oscar Isaac. O'Hara was briefly hinted at the end of the first Spider-verse film as an enforcer of timelines and will have a much bigger role this time around. In addition, there's Spider-Woman Jessica Drew, voiced by Issa Rae. Drew's design comes from her classic 70s costume and the fact that the first Spider-Woman was a young Black librarian named Valerie. Her first appearance was Spidey Super Stories #6, a promotional comic produced by Marvel and the PBS TV series, The Electric Company. </p><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4140140-fwa8_1oamae-zpu.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4140140-fwa8_1oamae-zpu.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4140141-fwa87vbauaemgbm.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4140141-fwa87vbauaemgbm.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4140142-fwa82xoacaailiu.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4140142-fwa82xoacaailiu.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4140143-fwa8wx4agaagdh7.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 4" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4140143-fwa8wx4agaagdh7.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4140144-fwa8qv2auaa-not.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 5" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4140144-fwa8qv2auaa-not.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4140145-fwa8kw8acaihjtd.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 6" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4140145-fwa8kw8acaihjtd.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4140146-fwa8gaqaiaa9vh8.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 7" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4140146-fwa8gaqaiaa9vh8.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4140147-fwa8bwqagaeswhi.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 8" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4140147-fwa8bwqagaeswhi.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4140148-fwa8ieaaiaabhly.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 9" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4140148-fwa8ieaaiaabhly.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4140149-fwa8a3taeaagnlk.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 10" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4140149-fwa8a3taeaagnlk.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p>Pavitr Prabhakar/Spider-Man India, voiced by Karan Soni, who fans might remember as Dopinder, the driver in Deadpool, gets his own poster.

<p>Harry Potter RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> may have been intended to feature a morality and House Point system at one point, at least according to evidence from a recent datamine.</p><p>As relayed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/datamining-shows-hogwarts-legacy-almost-had-a-morality-and-reputation-system/">PC Gamer</a>, dataminer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GrandTheftDiamonds">GrandTheftDiamonds</a> released a YouTube video outlining cut (and unused) content from Hogwarts Legacy. During the video, it was explained that a morality system and a House Points mechanic were found in the game files, indicating that work was apparently done on them.</p><div>          </div><p>A list of spells and actions was shown in the video, along with an associated House Point penalty (or reward) for each. For instance, being a class clown would have resulted in a loss of 10 points, while stopping a bully would have earned a player 20 points. The Avada Kedavra spell, known as the Killing Curse, would have resulted in a deduction of 100 points--a small penalty for ending someone's life. This is the worst offense on the list.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-morality-system-discovered-in-games-code/1100-6514341/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The next Squid Game series is coming to Netflix this year, but it's not the highly anticipated second season that fans have been waiting for. Due out this November on Netflix is Squid Game: The Challenge, which is a reality contest show where 456 people will compete for a $4.56 million cash prize.</p><p>Contestants will take part in games inspired by the show, and like the series, competitors will be eliminated each round until one person claims the top prize. Netflix said there should be no blood spilled in this event, however, making it clear, "the worst fate is going home empty-handed." A specific release date in November was not divulged.</p><p>Squid Game the show is intended to be a critique of struggling under capitalism, so the existence of a silly contest show is rubbing some people the wrong way.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-squid-game-series-premieres-in-november-but-its-not-season-2/1100-6514334/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Pokemon Scarlet And Violet Update Finally Lets You Import Your Beloved Pokemon

<p dir="ltr">An upcoming update for Pokemon Scarlet And Violet is primarily intended to fix an issue related to competitive Japan and Korean tournaments, but it'll also include a feature that fans have been asking for for months. As announced on Twitter, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will support Pokemon Home from version 3.0.0 onward.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">From Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet version 3.0.0 onward, players will be able to link Pokémon HOME with Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonScarletViolet?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#PokemonScarletViolet</a> ❤️💜 <a href="https://t.co/mAz4rjA8aU">pic.twitter.com/mAz4rjA8aU</a></p>  — Pokémon (@Pokemon) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1659189600680566787?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">May 18, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">This means that you will be able to put your beloved Pokemon from Scarlet And Violet into Pokemon Home and vice versa. Some fans are happy with this addition, especially the fact that you can apparently put Scarlet and Violet Pokemon into previous games like Sword, Shield, Legends Arceus, or Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl if they exist in that game already. However, others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/13l03w6/from_pok%C3%A9mon_scarlet_and_pok%C3%A9mon_violet_version/">less than impressed</a> that it took six months to add a feature that they've wanted since launch.</p><p>To be fair to Pokemon developer Game Freak, Pokemon Home integration has been added months after launch in every recent game in the series. This integration is also significantly more involved than previous Switch games, as it allows for that "backward compatibility" mentioned above. That said, the game's technical performance on Switch (especially its frame rate) still leaves a lot to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/13l03w6/comment/jkn3a1g/">desired</a>, as players continue to note online. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-patch-doesnt-fix-performance-but-it-does-go-after-bugs/1100-6513420/">recent update</a> was dinged by fans for not fixing the performance issues, but it did fix several nasty bugs.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-update-finally-lets-you-import-your-beloved-pokemon/1100-6514335/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Razer has announced new versions for its line of gaming speakers with the <a href="https://www.razer.com/pc/gaming-headsets-and-audio/nommo-line">Nommo V2</a>. The gaming peripheral company is known for its flashy accessories and ultrathin laptops, and the Nommo V2 fits that mold--yes, these speakers have RGB lighting. There will be three different SKUs available: the Nommo V2 X for $150 USD, V2 for $300 USD, and V2 Pro for $450 USD. They're set to launch on June 12, according to the Amazon listing. Each comes with different features so we'll break down what you get with the three models.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Razer Nommo V2 X ($150) - 2.0 speaker set without a subwoofer and no RGB lighting.</li><li dir="ltr">Razer Nommo V2 ($300) - 2.1 speaker setup with a wired subwoofer and Razer's Chroma RGB lighting.</li><li dir="ltr">Razer Nommo V2 Pro ($450) - 2.1 speaker setup with a wireless subwoofer and Razer's Chroma RGB lighting. Also comes with the Razer Wireless Control Pod.</li></ul><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4139921-razernommov2prospeakers.jpg"><img alt="Razer Nommo V2 Po speaker set." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4139921-razernommov2prospeakers.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Razer Nommo V2 Po speaker set.</figcaption></figure><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Nommo-Pro-Projection-Down-Firing/dp/B0C2Y8JYCZ?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div><p>The star of the lineup is the pricey Nommo V2 Pro with the wireless subwoofer and Razer's own Wireless Control Pod packaged with it. Chroma RGB lighting is built into the back of these speakers to project ambient lighting, and it's customizable in a similar way to other Razer products. You can set different lighting profiles to the Nommo V2 and V2 Pro and even have them sync and adapt to the color profile of what's on the screen in real-time.</p><p dir="ltr">The Wireless Control Pod is more than a volume dial and can be customized to control different features on your PC, such as mouse DPI settings, swapping profiles across other Razer peripherals, or the lighting settings of the speakers for example. The puck runs on AAA batteries, which are included, but that is one thing to note. You can also purchase the Wireless Control Pod separately for $50 USD, as it'll work with the Nommo V2 and V2X as well.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-nommo-v2-gaming-speakers-revealed-rgb-lighting-included/1100-6514330/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Mortal Kombat 1 Roster - Every Confirmed Character So Far

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4139908-mk1%282%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It's a great time to be a fighting game fan, and between new Street Fighter and Tekken games coming out soon, Mortal Kombat is throwing its lethal hat into the ring. A sort-of-reboot of the franchise that takes place in the New Era timeline, developer NetherRealm Studios describes Mortal Kombat 1 as a new take on the series that features reimagined versions of iconic characters, a new fighting system, game modes, and of course, the gory fatalities that the franchise has become infamous for.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-revealed-out-in-september/1100-6514056/">The reveal trailer showed off several of the fighters</a> who'll appear in the game, with the current roster consisting solely of familiar faces. Liu Kang, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Kung Lao, Kitana, Mileena, Shang Tsung, and Johnny Cage are all confirmed to be in the game, and NetherRealm says that many other characters will appear as well. For now, here's a quick rundown on who'll be painting the town red in Mortal Kombat 1.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Liu Kang</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4139898-mk1%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Liu Kang got a major power-up by the end of Mortal Kombat 11, as he ascended to godhood and defeated Kronika. Kang would eventually reset the timeline to what is known as the "New Era" and usher in an age of peace, but as the trailer shows, not everyone wants to take him up on that offer. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Scorpion</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4139899-mk1%287%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Everyone's favorite Shirai-Ryu ninja is back, and this time, it looks like Scorpion isn't out for blood, as he appears to be allied with his eternal rival, Sub-Zero. From his brief appearance in the trailer, it looks like not much has changed for Scorpion, as he's still sporting his trademark color scheme and his signature kunai weapon.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sub-Zero</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4139900-mk1%288%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Like Scorpion, Sub-Zero is an integral part of Mortal Kombat's history. The Lin Kuei assassin appears briefly in the trailer as he meets up with Scorpion, and looks like he hasn't lost his ice-cold touch. It's a pity that he gets his head curb-stomped into the floor, by Shang Tsung.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kitana</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4139901-mk1%285%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Mortal Kombat 1 has some royal class in its roster, thanks to the arrival of Princess Kitana. Dressed in regal blue and accompanied by her sister Mileena, Kitana appears to still be the princess of Edenia in this timeline judging by the prosperous people around her. She might want to watch out for her sister, though. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mileena</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4139902-mk1%286%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>If Mileena is going to stab her sister Kitana in the back, at least she's brought the right tools for the job. In the previous timeline, Mileena was a genetic experiment that combined Edenian and Tarkatan DNA, resulting in a lethal clone of Kitana. She's back in the New Era, but she's still one princess that you don't want to have standing behind you and within stabbing distance of your spine. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kung Lao</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4139903-mk1%284%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It's not clear <em>which </em>Kung Lao is in Mortal Kombat 1, but this might be the original legend himself, the Great Kung Lao. Whichever incarnation this is, he appears to still have a fondness for sharp fashion as he's once again wearing some killer headgear.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Raiden</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4139904-mk1%289%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>By the end of Mortal Kombat 11, Raiden sacrificed his divinity so that Liu Kang would have the power to face Kronika and her forces. Rendered mortal, that Raiden spent his remaining years as a counsel to Kang and presumably died of old age. In the new timeline, he appears to have been reborn and is now standing side by side with both the Fire God and Kung Lao.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Shang Tsung</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4139905-mk1%283%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of the most enduring villains in Mortal Kombat's long history, not even being wiped out of existence can stop this soul-stealing sorcerer from wreaking havoc in Liu Kang's new timeline. Up to his old tricks as usual, Tsung goes on a bloody rampage in the trailer and ultimately meets his fate when Kang serves up some divine justice. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Johnny Cage</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4139906-johnny-cage.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While he doesn't appear in the trailer, Johnny Cage is confirmed to be part of the game's roster. It's not clear how the action movie star will be reimagined, but if you grab the Premium Edition of the game, you'll be able to dress him up as legendary movie star Jean-Claude Van Damme and hold your own Bloodsport Kumite with him.</p></h3></p><br />

While the rest of the Kombat Pack will be released after launch, Johnny-Claude Van Cage (not his real name, we promise) will be available on day one.</p><p dir="ltr">The inclusion of Jean-Claude Van Damme is a novel callback to Mortal Kombat's history, as the game was originally conceived as a companion video game to the Van Damme movie Bloodsport before the idea was scrapped.

<p dir="ltr">AI has become an extremely hot topic these days in nearly every creative industry, and video games are no exception. In a recent <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/17/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q4-2023-earning/">earnings call</a>, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick was asked by an analyst if generative AI like ChatGPT would lower the barrier to entry on mobile games.</p><p dir="ltr">Zelnick replied that while AI technology will certainly help game developers with certain parts of the creative process, it is not a "magic trick" that can make games from an idea stage alone. He further stated that AI as a technology has certain limits, and that AI as a technology is not able to "look forward" in the same way that a human being can.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the implication of your question is does generative AI allow people who aren't in the business to make mobile hits by say, ChatGPT?"

<p>Former WWE Champion and WWE Hall of Famer "Superstar" Billy Graham has passed away at 79. Wrestling legend Ric Flair originally broke the news over his Twitter and was shortly confirmed by other sources.</p><p>Graham, real name Eldridge Wayne Coleman, transitioned from bodybuilding to become a professional wrestler in the late '60s. He eventually got his start at the legendary Canadian promoter and instructor Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling Promotion. After circulating around the AWA, he debuted in the then-WWF in 1975 in a tag-team match. He briefly left the company, but on his return, he won the World Championship from Bruno Sammartino, ending the living legend's historic four-year reign.</p><p>Fellow wrestling icons past and present acknowledged Graham's passing over social media and praised him as the prototype for what eventually would be called "sports-entertainment."

## With GTA 6 Coming, Take-Two Sees "No Pushback" On $70 Games

<p>Take-Two counts itself among the numerous gaming publishers who are now charging $70 for some of their top new releases. The company's CEO, Strauss Zelnick, has said the company has not seen a "pushback" to increased prices.</p><p>"We're not seeing a pushback on frontline price," Zelnick said during <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/17/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q4-2023-earning/">Take-Two's latest earnings event</a> (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-says-its-not-seeing-pushback-from-players-on-70-game-pricing/">via VGC</a>). "What we're seeing is consumers are seeking to limit their spending by going either to the stuff they really, really care about--blockbusters--or value. And sometimes it could be both."</p><p>Zelnick went on to say that the video game business is a "growth business," and even if comparisons to the pandemic--when revenue surged due to stay-at-home policies--are not as favorable, growth will come back, he predicted. Zelnick also said he believes there is a general economic recession happening now which could be impacting spending behavior in the short term.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-gta-6-coming-take-two-sees-no-pushback-on-70-games/1100-6514323/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Blizzard recently announced that Overwatch 2's PvE content is getting significantly scaled back, a piece of news that shocked and upset fans. People have theorized that one reason for the changes was Blizzard's return-to-office policy, which requires developers to return to the office.</p><p>Overwatch 2 executive producer Jared Neuss <a href="https://twitter.com/OhReallyJared/status/1658983185894739968">said on Twitter</a> that speculation suggesting that Blizzard's RTO policy led to the changes to Overwatch 2 "isn't true."</p><p>"Managing PvE and PvP development simultaneously has been a challenge for the team for years. It's a less exciting headline but it's reality," Neuss explained. More details will be made available in the next Director's Take update, Neuss said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-big-pve-changes-are-not-due-to-return-to-office-policy/1100-6514320/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Fans were disappointed in the situation, and now Niantic has commented on what went into the decision, including how the passes were affecting the game's ecosystem.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot recently spoke with Pokemon Go director Michael Steranka about the changes, in which he said, "the decision to add limitations and adjust the pricing of Remote Raid Passes was an incredibly difficult one for us to make," but that ultimately, "it was something we felt we had to do."</p><figure style="width: 1600px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4139445-remoteraidpass.jpg"><img alt="Remote Raid Pass for Pokemon Go" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4139445-remoteraidpass.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Remote Raid Pass for Pokemon Go</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Steranka said that Niantic internal data showed player behavior that was "completely antithetical to what we envisioned the experience for Pokemon Go to be."

<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has briefly commented on the possibility of a new mid-generation console refresh, saying that it's "likely" that updated PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles will be released.</p><p>"We probably will," Zelnick said to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-q4-brings-higher-sales-deeper-losses">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, while adding that the previous generation of upgraded consoles "did not affect the business very much" and that Take-Two will continue to support last-gen hardware. With a newer Nintendo console rumored to be released next year, Zelnick says that the company will also continue to support that console. "Yes, I think we'll continue to support it," he said.</p><p>The current generation of console gaming is now over two years old, as both the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 were introduced in November 2020. In comparison, the Xbox One saw a mid-generation refresh in the form of the Xbox One X in 2017, four years after it launched, and the PS4 Pro was released three years after the launch of the PS4. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mid-gen-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-upgrades-are-likely-says-take-two-boss/1100-6514321/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
