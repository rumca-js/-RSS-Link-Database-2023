Take 30% off any Pico or Pi Zero accessories on PiShop.us with coupon code "PICOJEFF30"!

(And don't worry, Canadians: the coupon code works on PiShop.ca too—at least until it expires on May 25th!)

I interviewed Eben Upton, co-founder of Raspberry Pi, in early May. We talked about Pi shortages, RP2040, RISC-V, Sony investment, and how the name 'Raspberry Pi' was born!
