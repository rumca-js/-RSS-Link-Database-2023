Ready though they were by March 2020, the band\u2019s plans were put on hold for a couple of years. But then things really took off when the Foxgloves performed at the Blue Ox Festival in 2022. Just three years in, the six-piece Foxgloves have released an EP and a full-length album, and there\u2019s plenty more where that came from.\n\nThe Foxgloves recently visited The Current studio to record a session with Radio Heartland\u2019s Mike Pengra. Watch and listen to the full session above.\n\nVideo Segments\n00:00:00 Johnson City\n00:04:09 Forget Me Not\n00:07:51 Wild River Honey\n00:10:48 Interview with host Mike Pengra\n\nMusicians\nNyssa Krause \u2013 bass\nMaura Dunst \u2013 vocals, fiddle, mandolin, guitar\nLiz DeYoe \u2013 guitar\nSteph Snow \u2013 vocals, ukulele, banjolele, washboard\nNikki Lemire \u2013 vocals, harp, autoharp\nSara Tinklenberg \u2013 vocals, percussion\n\nCredits\nGuests \u2013 @thefoxgloves \nHost/Producer \u2013 Mike Pengra\nVideo Director \u2013 Eric Xu Romani\nCamera Operators \u2013 Guillermo Bonilla, Erik Stromstad\nAudio \u2013 Derek Ramirez\nGraphics \u2013 Natalia Toledo\nDigital Producer \u2013 Luke Taylor\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
