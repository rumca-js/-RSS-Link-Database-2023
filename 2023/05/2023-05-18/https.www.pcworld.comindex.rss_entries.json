The sale includes up to 75 percent off on PC games, an additional 25 percent off coupon at checkout (so long as the purchases total $14.99 or more), and a free copy of <em>Death Stranding</em> from Kojima Productions. The additional coupon should apply automatically, so long as the items in your cart meet the criteria. The sale itself runs until June 15th while the giveaway game is free to claim until May 25th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Epic Rewards program will now give you five percent back with each permitted purchase. This amount will be stored in your Rewards Balance, which you can then apply at checkout to get a discount on future games. So, how does one enroll in this brand spanking new program, you ask? If you&rsquo;ve currently got a working Epic Games account, then you&rsquo;re already in. If you don&rsquo;t have an account, don&rsquo;t sweat it, you can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.epicgames.com/id/register&amp;xcust=2-1-1922153-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">sign up for free</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll automatically earn 5% back in Epic Rewards, which will be added to your Rewards Balance two weeks (14 days) after completing the associated purchase. Once you receive your Epic Rewards, you can apply them at checkout to get a discount off future eligible purchases, or save them for later. Epic Rewards can also be combined with other discounts and coupons for even better deals. Just keep in mind that Epic Rewards do expire eventually (25 months from the date they were granted to your Rewards Balance, to be exact).&rdquo;</p><cite>Epic</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, you can pick up a free copy of the hugely popular <em>Death Stranding</em> until May 25th. If you&rsquo;ve never played a Hideo Kojima game before, well, you better strap in, as it&rsquo;s likely going to be a wild (and sometimes confusing) ride. You&rsquo;re basically a glorified courier that transports anything from dead bodies to equipment and medicine. It&rsquo;s definitely a weird game, that&rsquo;s for sure, but it&rsquo;s one of the most original stories I&rsquo;ve ever played. Besides, it&rsquo;s free!

While the company suffered a massive setback <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1799666/uk-blocks-microsoft-activision-deal-to-protect-cloud-gaming.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">when the United Kingdom refused to allow the purchase</a>, the European Union <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1917099/eus-approval-of-activision-merger-dangles-tasty-freebies-for-gamers.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gave it the go-ahead</a>, after Microsoft made specific concessions for game streaming. One of them was a commitment to offering Microsoft-owned titles on competing streaming platforms, which starts today, with Xbox Game Studios titles appearing on Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce Now streaming service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s a big deal since Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox Game Pass and its associated streaming game add-on service is a big part of its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/399352/xbox-game-pass-pc-best-deal-pc-gaming.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">overall entertainment strategy</a>. Apparently, the chance to add Activision-Blizzard titles to its corporate holdings and thus becoming a mega-publishing juggernaut, is worth throwing its competition a few bones. Said bones begin with <em>Gears (of War) 5</em>, now available to stream on GeForce Now for anyone who owns the game on Steam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/05/18/geforce-now-thursday-may-18/&amp;xcust=2-1-1921899-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">the announcement from Nvidia</a>, the titles will expand quickly. <em>Deathloop, Grounded, </em>and <em>Pentiment, </em>all published by Xbox Game Studios and from Microsoft subsidiary developers Bethesda and Obsidian, will arrive on May 25th. At the moment, only Steam purchases are supported, though games bought through the Microsoft Store will be added eventually, according to the agreement which technically precedes the European Commission&rsquo;s approval. Microsoft has published dozens of PC games in the last few years, from indie-style darlings like <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em> to massive franchises like <em>Halo </em>and <em>Forza</em>, so expect that list to swell quickly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about Activision-Blizzard titles, which are notably absent from both Xbox Game Pass streaming and GeForce Now? We&rsquo;ll see those appear if and when the acquisition actually gets finalized. Microsoft is appealing the decision of the UK&rsquo;s Competition and Markets Authority <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/breaking-microsoft-vows-to-appeal-as-the-uk-regulator-blocks-its-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard&amp;xcust=2-1-1921899-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">right now,</a> with game streaming being a major point of contention. </p>\n\nVideo Games</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1921899/xbox-studios-games-now-appearing-on-geforce-now-thanks-europe.html", "date_published": "2023-05-18 15:41:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Google\u2019s inactive account purge won\u2019t delete YouTube videos", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this week, Google announced that it&rsquo;s planning on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1919355/google-delete-inactive-accounts-gmail-youtube-docs.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">deleting millions of accounts</a> made by users who were no longer active. It&rsquo;s slightly alarming if, perhaps, you have a spam Gmail account dedicated to logins for sites you used exactly once, but most users won&rsquo;t be affected. But what about millions and millions of YouTube videos from accounts no longer active? Apparently, they won&rsquo;t be purged along with the rest of the dross, according to a Google staffer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/YouTubeLiaison/status/1658829489466384387&amp;xcust=2-1-1921823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Creator Liason Rene Ritchie</a> told a concerned Twitter user that the company has &ldquo;no plans to delete accounts with YT videos,&rdquo; as spotted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/05/googles-new-inactive-account-policy-wont-delete-years-of-youtube-videos/&amp;xcust=2-1-1921823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ars Technica</a>. It&rsquo;s a relief to digital archivists, who&rsquo;ve come to view YouTube as the de facto repository of the web&rsquo;s short-form video (at least those short-form videos where everyone keeps their clothes on). With nearly twenty years of history stretching back to before the Google acquisition and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/05/07/number-hours-video-uploaded-to-youtube-per-minute/&amp;xcust=2-1-1921823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">500 hours of content per minute</a>&rdquo; being uploaded, YouTube remains the internet&rsquo;s largest centralized collection of videos, even as would-be rivals like TikTok nip at its heels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why the exception for accounts with videos associated with them? It just makes sense. While an empty and unused Gmail account is only costing Google money to maintain, as emails come in with no one to read them and serve up targeted advertising, a video remains a source of ad revenue as long as it&rsquo;s posted. (I still occasionally watch <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzLOZNxdQCw&amp;xcust=2-1-1921823-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">one of my favorite skits</a> from an account that hasn&rsquo;t posted a new video in almost a decade). Not to mention that YouTube videos make up a considerable portion of Google&rsquo;s search results, enhancing another core aspect of the company&rsquo;s bottom line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the vast majority of YouTube videos get little to no views, and it makes sense that at some point Google will want to trim the fat on YouTube as well. If you&rsquo;re using YouTube as essentially free video storage, it would be prudent to back it up, just in case this rather vague promise from a single Google employee is less than ironclad.

RAM stands for &ldquo;random access memory&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s effectively the component of your PC that is keeping track of what your computer is currently working on. When RAM is limited, your PC has to keep that current information stored somewhere else, which can dramatically slow down your workflow and load times. This is particularly notable in computationally heavy projects, such as video encoding and high-quality art creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade or you&rsquo;re looking to harvest the RAM from one PC to use in another, it helps to know what kind of RAM your system is using. That&rsquo;s doubly true now that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html\">Intel&rsquo;s 12th- and 13th-gen motherboards</a> can use either DDR4 or DDR5 RAM, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html\">AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7000 processors</a> made the switch to DDR5.

DDR2 is 21. DDR3 is 24. DDR4 is 26. Sometimes, this may show a 0. If so, you&rsquo;ll want to use &ldquo;SMBIOSMemoryType&rdquo; instead.</li><li>Capacity will show the raw byte value of the RAM&rsquo;s memory capacity, so something like 8,589,934,592 will be for an 8GB RAM module.</li><li>Speed is the supported memory speed value that your RAM module indicates it can support, which is typically anywhere between 800 and 3200.</li><li>Configuredclockspeed relates to the speed at which your RAM is currently configured to be running at.</li><li>DeviceLocator will tell you which physical slot the RAM module is plugged into on your system&rsquo;s motherboard.</li><li>FormFactor is the physical shape type of the RAM module. This will typically be the number 8 for DIMM modules found on desktop PCs or the number 12 for laptops&rsquo; SODIMM forms.</li><li>Manufacturer indicates an identified manufacturer of the RAM module. This may show up as Unknown sometimes.</li><li>Serialnumber will give you the hardware serial number for that specific stick of RAM, which is typically only relevant when dealing with the manufacturer for troubleshooting purposes.</li><li>Partnumber provides the manufacturer&rsquo;s model number for that particular RAM module, which can be very useful with the help of a Google search to identify the RAM stick you have and whether or not you can buy it again.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"additional-software-options\">Additional software options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the above information is also available with the help of some third-party software, such as <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html&amp;xcust=2-1-395053-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">CPU-Z</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy&amp;xcust=2-1-395053-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Speccy</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/cpuz-100900885-orig.jpg?auto=webp\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"cpuz\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/cpuz-100900885-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In CPU-Z, you&rsquo;ll want to use the &ldquo;Memory&rdquo; and &ldquo;SPD&rdquo; tabs to see information about your RAM.

In there, you should find virtually all of the RAM and memory information you&rsquo;d need.

Typically, these labels will either be a sticker applied directly to the stick of RAM, engraved onto the fancy heat spreader on higher-performance modules, or may be printed directly onto the circuit board. In these cases, you&rsquo;ll typically find the part number, which you can then look up with your favorite search engine to figure out the rest of the specs. If you can&rsquo;t locate a label or identifier anywhere, then it may be prudent to use one of the methods described above instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These options should help you figure out what RAM your PC is using. If you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade, be sure that you&rsquo;re getting the same type and form factor of RAM, because you can&rsquo;t directly swap out DDR3 for DDR4 RAM without having to also replace your motherboard.

There&rsquo;s only one, and it&rsquo;s too small, too far away, and too public. Sightful thinks that it&rsquo;s solved that problem with the Spacetop, a laptop that gets rid of the screen entirely and uses augmented reality to create a 100-inch virtual display floating in front of your face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know what? It works. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s immediately apparent that something is different. Clamshell laptops fold flat, and thin; the Sightful Spacetop looks more like a rubberized, squarish calzone, wrapped in the sort of protective cover you&rsquo;d see enfold an Apple iPad or Amazon Kindle. Unfold the cover, and what makes the Spacetop special is revealed: a pair of thin, tethered, augmented glasses that sit where you&rsquo;d expect to find the laptop&rsquo;s display planted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, the Sightful Spacetop is designed for business travelers who want a laptop with a massive, private &ldquo;display&rdquo; that no one else can see. Put the glasses on, and a massive, curved virtual monitor appears before you, reaching above, below, and to the sides. You can pin and resize windowed apps: Gmail, YouTube, Word, Microsoft Teams. The Spacetop  is a device that you could use on a plane flight (if you don&rsquo;t mind the odd looks), in a business or airport lounge (ditto), or even working in a conference room where you&rsquo;d like a bigger screen.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Sightful Spacetop closed\" class=\"wp-image-1921167\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Spacetop-covered.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>We&rsquo;re  not sure if the Spacetop&rsquo;s soft cover will do much in terms of protection.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Priced at $2,000, the Spacetop is purpose-built as a business tool, with an optimized Arm processor, AOSP (open-source Android) operating system, and, of course, the custom headset. But you&rsquo;ll need to act fast: Sightful is inviting just 1,000 early adopters to purchase the final hardware, enticing them with the opportunity to provide feedback on subsequent products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"spacetops-surprisingly-simple-hardware\">Spacetop&rsquo;s surprisingly simple hardware</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not here to tell you that the Sightful Spacetop will eliminate the conventional laptop. Facebook (now Meta) made that pitch before, both with its &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393485/facebook-will-bring-multiple-displays-into-vr-with-infinite-office.html\">virtual office</a>&rdquo; concept and later with the (failed?) <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346768/metas-horizon-worlds-vr-chat-is-facebook-fake.html\">Meta Quest Pro&rsquo;s virtual office environment</a>. Having tried both, though, the difference is clear: Spacetop&rsquo;s augmented glasses are both lighter and sharper than what Meta provided, meaning that there&rsquo;s less potential fatigue. Text was absolutely legible, unlike the Quest Pro, and there was little to no lag while moving the headset back and forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beside its unusual silhouette, the Spacetop chassis doesn&rsquo;t look all that different from a conventional laptop&mdash;at least the bottom of it. The chassis measures 10.47 inches wide and 9.8 inches deep, and weighs 3.3 pounds, including the headset&mdash;very similar to a conventional laptop. The base is certainly thicker, though, at 1.57 inches. Sightful asked Wistron, a Chinese ODM that makes laptops under other manufacturer labels, to build the Spacetop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, there&rsquo;s room for future improvement: Sightful built the Spacetop around a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398506/qualcomm-snapdragon-865-benchmark-performance.html\">Snapdragon 865</a> from 2019, rather than the more advanced <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379806/qualcomm-prioritizes-ai-in-snapdragon-8-gen-2-smartphone-chip.html\">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a>, for example. Specs include 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, fairly standard for a laptop. Naturally, wireless (5G NR Sub-6, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1) features heavily. You also get a 2560&times;1920 webcam, which is slightly better than what other laptops offer, plus a fingerprint reader. There&rsquo;s even a pair of 10Gbps USB-C ports with DisplayPort 1.4 capabilities, so you <em>can</em> connect an external display, if you&rsquo;re dying for one.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Sightful Spacetop headset\" class=\"wp-image-1921166\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Headset-2-with-clips.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The Spacetop&rsquo;s tethered headset, along with its corrective lenses which magnetically snap in.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But why would you? The most important hardware is what&rsquo;s tethered to the front of the chassis: the headset, which delivers 1080p resolution per eye, at 72Hz. The headset (146 x 175 x 44mm, unfolded) weighs 106 grams, which is about a quarter of the weight of the almost-defunct <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/420304/hololens-uncensored-a-candid-hands-on-with-hololens-development-edition.html\">Microsoft HoloLens</a>, another augmented-reality device. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-spacetop-headset-is-light-too\">The Spacetop headset is light, too</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking through the HoloLens was like looking through a porthole: the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.vr-compare.com/headset/microsofthololens&amp;xcust=2-1-1919392-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">field of view</a> (30 degrees horizontal, 17 degrees vertical) was much smaller than the 53-degree diagonal FOV the Spacetop provides. That&rsquo;s a decent compromise between focusing on a task and being aware of your surroundings, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/428472/microsoft-finally-gets-real-about-hololenss-field-of-view.html\">excuse Microsoft used</a>. Sightful puts most of the &ldquo;viewscreen&rdquo; to the top of your vision, so there&rsquo;s a clear, unobstructed way of seeing anything at your feet that you might stumble over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>VR nerds will appreciate that the Spacetop headset supports interpupillary distances of between 56mm and 70mm, as the width of people&rsquo;s eyes do vary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spacetop resolution is somewhat less than, say, the Meta Quest, which provides 1720&times;1890 pixels per eye, and at 72Hz to 120Hz. But the Meta Quest lineup is designed for <em>virtual</em> reality, and the Spacetop supplies <em>augmented</em> reality&mdash;which is to say that the default view is like looking through a pair of sunglasses, a neat cheat to darken the background without totally occluding it. That still means that you&rsquo;ll prefer a &ldquo;light&rdquo; desktop theme to contrast the windows with the background.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Sightful Spacetop headset\" class=\"wp-image-1921165\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/headset-profile.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Sightful CEO Tamir Berliner holds the  Sightful Spacetop headset.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>No, you can&rsquo;t wear Spacetop headset with glasses. To get around that, Sightful has made a generous concession: send them your prescription, and the company will craft a set of personalized lenses that will magnetically clip in to the Spacetop frame&mdash;for free!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"hands-on-with-the-sightful-spacetop\">Hands-on with the Sightful Spacetop</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We had a short time to play around with the Spacetop, guided by chief executive Tamir Berliner and chief technical officer Tomer Kahan. (Their backgrounds bode well for Sightful&rsquo;s success: Berliner co-founded PrimeSense, whose technology gave us the Microsoft Kinect and the iPhone&rsquo;s Face ID. Kahan worked at N-Trig, a company later acquired by Microsoft to develop the Surface Pen. Both employees worked at Magic Leap, then left when the company re-oriented on the enterprise market. )</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put the headset on and the Spacetop environment reveals itself: a large, virtual screen with windows of all sizes, curving around you. It&rsquo;s like a giant <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677744/corsair-xeneon-flex-monitor-review.html\">Corsair Xeneon Flex</a>&mdash;but about double the size. If you absolutely must have one, two, or even three displays at home, you may very well love the Spacetop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside each window Berliner trustingly put real data: a Gmail window, a calendar, YouTube, and more. Navigating through them is the same as in Windows: You use the trackpad to drag a cursor around, resize windows, and reposition them on the screen. Unlike Meta, there are no goofy controllers; this experience feels so similar to a laptop that I picked it up almost immediately.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Sightful Spacetop screens\" class=\"wp-image-1921168\" height=\"798\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Spacetop_Screens_3.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>This is a mockup by SIghtful, but it&rsquo;s pretty accurate. I recall the background being darker, however.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Sightful</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The only key differences are in a gesture: a three-finger swipe up and down on the touchpad brings the curved &ldquo;screen&rdquo; closer or further away. This not only helps make the experience more comfortable, but also allows you to &ldquo;lean in&rdquo; to a given window for a closer look. In an interesting HoloLens-esque touch, the display can be &ldquo;pinned&rdquo; to a given location, then recalled to the laptop by tapping both Shift keys simultaneously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A small &ldquo;taskbar&rdquo; floats in the center of your screen, allowing you to add windows and select apps. Since this is an open-source Android OS, the selection of apps leans heavily on productivity (office apps, basically). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used the Meta Quest Pro&rsquo;s virtual workspace, and Spacetop blows it away. For one, even with a very odd prescription (one eye is near-sighted, and one far-sighted) the default corrective lenses Sightful had available worked well. Text was sharp and usable, and I&rsquo;d attribute any blurriness to my eyes, not the hardware. I don&rsquo;t recall any lag when moving my head back and forth, and while the 75Hz lenses weren&rsquo;t as easy to work with as a high-refresh-rate screen, I didn&rsquo;t walk away with any of the vertigo I did with the Quest Pro. In part, that&rsquo;s because of the lens arrangement: there&rsquo;s a clear space at the bottom of your field of vision to see the keyboard; Meta tried to carve out a portion of its VR space to achieve the same effect, and it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headset, though light, felt a bit front-heavy. Kahan said that the device will ship with a pair of small weights, which can be clipped and adjusted to balance the headset. While it never felt like it would fall off (a nose clip prevents that) it was slightly distracting. Could I work within the Spacetop environment for hours? I can&rsquo;t honestly say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s one neat trick that the Spacetop does that you won&rsquo;t see anywhere else. The small Spacetop logo can be tapped to dismiss the UI entirely, returning you to &ldquo;reality mode&rdquo; to pay close attention to a coworker. But the logo can also <em>change</em>, transforming into a glyph that others can scan with their phone to share files&mdash;or, as Berliner reveals&mdash;eventually to join a collaborative whiteboarding session.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Sightful Spacetop glyph\" class=\"wp-image-1921169\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/logo-glyph.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>You can use the Spacetop&rsquo;s small logo button to create glyph links to various shared documents and eventually experiences.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Sightful</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the Spacetop does include a pair of 10Gbps USB-C ports, with DisplayPort 1.4 capabilities&mdash;so if you&rsquo;re dying for an external monitor, it appears the Spacetop can assuage those concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s one key weakness: the battery life. It clocks in at just over five hours, which is quite small for an Arm laptop as well as laptops in general. The Spacetop will charge to 85 percent in less than two hours, however. The headset also includes some small speakers, which sounded tinny and faint. Berliner said the low volume was designed to maintain privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"grab-a-spacetop-while-you-can\">Grab a Spacetop while you can</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re left with the same impression that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/403484/magic-leap-hands-on-augmented-reality.html\">Magic Leap instilled</a>: This is terrific technology, but at $2,000, a steep investment. Sightful&rsquo;s public stance, however, is impressive: Rather than hype up an unproven technology, it&rsquo;s remained very focused on selling the Spacetop as a productivity solution. This is not a frivolous device at all. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Sightful Spacetop\" class=\"wp-image-1921164\" height=\"893\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/spacetop-hero-alt.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The Sightful Spacetop</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, there are only 1,000 (right now) Spacetops to go around.

First, the RTX 4060 Ti sticks to the same price as its predecessors, halting a trend of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">painfully</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html\">exorbitant</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html\">RTX 40-series pricing</a>; second, the introduction of a step-up 16GB model addresses concerns about <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1780649/the-full-nerd-ep-251-is-8gb-of-vram-enough-and-bad-pc-gaming-ports.html\">8GB of VRAM simply not being enough for PC games</a> anymore, albeit at a steep price that might not be worthwhile given some technical specifics of this GPU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html\">The best graphics cards for PC gaming</a></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"meet-nvidias-geforce-rtx-4060-ti\">Meet Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 4060 Ti</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 family\" class=\"wp-image-1921203\" height=\"686\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4060-ti-specs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Both versions of the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti are identical other than the raw memory capacity, a welcome change after Nvidia&rsquo;s attempted (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1354391/nvidia-cancels-the-controversial-rtx-4080-12gb.html\">and aborted</a>) RTX 4080 12GB launch, which originally meant there would be two totally different GPUs bearing the same RTX 4080 name. (That card wound up being relabeled as <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html\">the RTX 4070 Ti</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia says the RTX 4060 Ti is tuned for exceptional 1080p gaming performance, as Steam&rsquo;s hardware surveyed is dominated by xx60-class graphics cards and most of those people use 1080p displays. Built on the company&rsquo;s new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture, the RTX 4060 Ti <em>finally </em>brings Ada&rsquo;s incredible <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/dlss-3-explained-how-nvidias-ai-infused-rtx-tech-turbocharges-pc-gaming.html\">performance-supercharging DLSS 3 technology</a>, NVENC with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1375901/tested-nvidias-geforce-rtx-4090-is-a-content-creation-monster.html\">cutting-edge AV1 encoding</a>, and superb power efficiency to more mainstream price points. The early performance results that Nvidia shared with press revolve around games that support ray tracing and DLSS, driving home GeForce&rsquo;s AI focus these days. That&rsquo;s fine and dandy but unfortunately obfuscates the potential uplift in raw GPU horsepower over its predecessors.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 family\" class=\"wp-image-1921207\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4060-ti-8gb-perf.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The company also shared some specifications for the RTX 4060 Ti that further press home the uplift in ray tracing, DLSS performance, and energy efficiency, but the charts only listed raw teraflop performance for the various GPU hardware cores, rather than spelling out explicit shader, RT, and tensor core counts. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-shows-up-on-geekbench-with-4352-cuda-cores-and-8gb-vram&amp;xcust=2-1-1921195-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Early leaks</a> suggest the RTX 4060 Ti has <em>fewer</em> CUDA cores than the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393767/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review.html\">RTX 3060 Ti</a> (4,352 versus 4,864), which may be why Nvidia took this approach if true. (Ada Lovelace cores are more potent than the RTX 30-series&rsquo; Ampere cores, however.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that&rsquo;s certain: The memory bus width is being slimmed down, from 256-bit in the RTX 3060 Ti to just 128-bit in the 4060 Ti. Think of it like traffic congestion; if memory requests are cars, the bus width is the size of the road. A hundred cars move much faster on a four-lane highway than a single lane dirt road, and that speed is analogous to the card&rsquo;s overall memory bandwidth. Ostensibly, the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti offers 288GB per second of overall memory bandwidth, compared to the 3060 Ti&rsquo;s 448GB/s&mdash;a huge gulf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not that simple though.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 family\" class=\"wp-image-1921200\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ampere-cache-mem-perf.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>An illustrative example of how traditional GPU memory works, without a larger on-die L2 cache.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 family\" class=\"wp-image-1921201\" height=\"679\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ada-cache-mem-perf.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>A comparison image showing how the larger L2 cache in Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 40-series (&ldquo;Ada Lovelace&rdquo;) GPUs helps result in far fewer calls to traditional memory.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia swiped a page from <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393733/rdna-2-deep-dive-inside-amd-radeon-rx-6000-graphics-cards.html\">AMD&rsquo;s killer Infinity Cache technology</a> for RTX 40-series offerings, dropping a large on-die cache onto the GPU itself, and the RTX 4060 family is no different. Not only does the closer physical proximity mean this cache is faster, but deploying it also reduces the need to send many requests out to the memory chips arrayed around the GPU itself, as illustrated in the slides above. While AMD&rsquo;s Infinity Cache uses an L3 cache, Nvidia opted for a 32MB L2 cache instead (versus just 2MB on the 3060 Ti). The company says the larger L2 cache particularly helps improve ray tracing and DLSS performance, and results in the &ldquo;effective&rdquo; memory bandwidth shown in the technical specifications slide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing though: As evidenced in our review of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394984/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-asus-rog-strix.html\">last-gen Radeon RX 6600 XT</a>, which had 32MB of Infinity Cache and a 128-bit bus, pairing a big on-die cache with a neutered bus width helps the GPU perform exceptionally&mdash;both in performance and power&mdash;at the display resolution it&rsquo;s targeted for, but usually results in lower-than-expected results at higher resolutions. Higher resolutions have higher memory needs, which results in fewer successful on-die cache hits. When that happens, the memory requests go out to traditional memory&mdash;and the RTX 4060 Ti&rsquo;s much smaller 128-bit bus might falter when that happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll have to wait for reviews to see if that also holds true for the RTX 4060 Ti (it has for the RTX 4070 series, which uses similar technology tuned for 1440p gaming). It&rsquo;ll be a bummer if so. The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393767/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review.html\">RTX 3060 Ti</a> was one of the best GeForce cards last generation exactly because it offered both solid 1440p performance as well as exceptional 1080p gaming. (For what it&rsquo;s worth, GeForce product manager Justin Walker says the RTX 4060 Ti can play games at 1440p, though you may need to adjust some settings in some games, and games that support DLSS will also see a performance bump.)</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"rtx 4060 ti\" class=\"wp-image-1921244\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4060-ti-perf-16gb.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Performance results for the 16GB RTX 4060 Ti with DLSS; note that Resident Evil Remake and A Plague Tale: Requiem are set to Ultra settings on the 16GB chart, but reduced to High on the performance chart for the 8GB RTX 4060 Ti above.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If the RTX 4060 Ti indeed winds up being best for no-compromises 1080p gaming, its varying memory options may wind up being less significant. While some cutting-edge games already exceed 8GB at 1080p resolution, resulting in stuttering if you don&rsquo;t adjust graphics settings, the vast majority do not. We&rsquo;ll have to see what testing reveals when we get the cards in our hands on May 24 (8GB) and sometime in July (16GB).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both cards look to be remarkably power efficient, with the 8GB model rated for 160 watts and the 16GB model rated for 165W&mdash;a mere 5W difference between the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"meet-the-geforce-rtx-4060\">Meet the GeForce RTX 4060</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not all! Nvidia also unveiled the $299 GeForce RTX 4060, disclosing both technical specs and early performance results.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 family\" class=\"wp-image-1921205\" height=\"659\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4060-specs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p><br /></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything we said about the 4060 Ti being tuned for 1080p gaming <em>definitely</em> applies to the vanilla 4060 as well. This card actually uses a different core GPU than the 4060 Ti (code-name AD107 versus AD106, respectively) and based off the specifications Nvidia provided, it should be tangibly weaker than the Ti models. It still offers DLSS 3, AV1 encoding, extreme power efficiency, and all other Ada Lovelace benefits. Nvidia&rsquo;s early performance teaser shows it beating its predecessor in games that support DLSS.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 family\" class=\"wp-image-1921202\" height=\"679\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4060-perf.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p><br /></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple things to note about the memory subsystem here, too. First, the on-die L2 cache is reduced to 24MB, compared to the Ti&rsquo;s 32MB. And second, the RTX 4060 also comes with 8GB of RAM, while its RTX 3060 predecessor shipped with 12GB. Awkward&mdash;though to be fair, the RTX 3060 cost $329 at launch, while the RTX 4060 costs $299 on a more advanced manufacturing node.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 family\" class=\"wp-image-1921204\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4060-1-percent-lows.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p><br /></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia also took the step of revealing &ldquo;1 percent low&rdquo; performance results for the RTX 4060 against its predecessors to try to stave off memory concerns. When a game runs out of GPU VRAM, it bumps things all the way over to your much slower main system memory, which results in heavy stuttering. If that was happening in the games Nvidia selected, it would be revealed in the chart above. That said, activating ray tracing and DLSS changes technical demands, and all the games in this chart have DLSS active and ray tracing on when possible. The differences may be more or less noticeable in games without those features enabled. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll have to see what independent testing reveals when the RTX 4060 launches in July.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-budget-gpu-renaissance\">A budget GPU renaissance?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After nearly half a decade of pandemic- and cryptocurrency-inspired neglect, there&rsquo;s suddenly a battle being waged for PC gamers on a budget. Intel&rsquo;s much-improved <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499123/intel-slashes-arc-a750-price-to-249-touts-substantial-gaming-improvements.html\">$250 Arc A750</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1799919/intel-arc-gpus-how-much-improvement-has-intel-made-in-6-months.html\">$350 Arc A770</a> compete in the same realm as the $299 4060 (with the A770 offering 16GB for that price) alongside <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/543823/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-finally-a-true-1080p-graphics-card.html\">discounted last-gen AMD options</a>, while leaks suggest AMD also plans to imminently release an affordable new Radeon RX 7600.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final benchmarks will tell the full story, but it suddenly seems like affordable PC gaming is back on the menu, friends. It&rsquo;s about damned time.</p>\n\nGaming, Graphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1921195/nvidia-unveils-3-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-gpus-dlss-3-goes-mainstream.html", "date_published": "2023-05-18 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "AMD\u2019s Ryzen will follow Intel\u2019s lead with hybrid cores", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Farewell, simple CPUs. AMD is moving toward a future where generic CPU cores will be replaced with performance cores, efficiency cores, and accelerators, much like Intel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</em> cornered AMD chief technical officer Mark Papermaster at a Belgium supercomputing conference, where Papermaster <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-to-make-hybrid-cpus-using-ai-for-chip-design-cto-papermaster-at-itf-world#xenforo-comments-3807584&amp;xcust=2-1-1921237-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">agreed to answer questions</a> on a number of subjects. But it was Papermaster&rsquo;s admission that AMD is moving to a hybrid architecture that most piqued our interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;ll also see is more variations of the cores themselves, you&rsquo;ll see high-performance cores mixed with power-efficient cores mixed with acceleration,&rdquo; Papermaster replied to a question from <em>Tom&rsquo;s</em> deputy managing editor Paul Alcorn. &ldquo;So where, Paul, we&rsquo;re moving to now is not just variations in core density, but variations in the type of core, and how you configure the cores.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hybrid architectures have been around for years, though they&rsquo;ve only recently made their way into the X86 architecture used by both AMD and Intel. Arm was the first company to popularize the hybrid of &ldquo;performance&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; cores, the latter used for background tasks. (Arm&rsquo;s latest chips use a three-tiered hierarchy.) In 2021, Intel ushered in the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/546076/intel-alder-lake-12th-gen-core-speeds-prices.html\">12th-generation Alder Lake family</a>, the first to mix and match Intel&rsquo;s own P- and E-cores. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD, however, has historically declined to follow suit. The company&rsquo;s latest Ryzen processors are all based on a single type of core architecture, all equally optimized for performance and power savings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Papermaster&rsquo;s second point, that AMD is moving toward acceleration, follows an <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1815008/why-amd-thinks-ryzen-xdna-ai-is-the-future.html\">earlier PCWorld interview</a> with AMD&rsquo;s corporate vice president for the client channel, David McAfee. In addition to CPUs and GPUs, McAfee said that AMD is adding Inference Processing Units, or IPUs. AMD plans to integrate IPUs into the microprocessor, much like AMD does today with integrated GPUs. Its first attempt is the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html\">Ryzen Mobile 7040</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think one of the nuances that comes along with the way that we&rsquo;re looking at at IPUs, and IPUs for the future, is more along the lines of that combination of a very specialized engine that does a certain type of compute, but does it in a very power-efficient way,&rdquo; McAfee said in an <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1815008/why-amd-thinks-ryzen-xdna-ai-is-the-future.html\">interview</a> last week and published Monday. &ldquo;And in a way that&rsquo;s really integrated with the memory subsystem and the rest of the processor, because our expectation is as time goes on, these workloads that run on the GPU will not be sort of one-time events, but there&rsquo;ll be more of a&hellip;.I&rsquo;m not going to say a constantly running set of workstreams, but it will be a more frequent type of compute that happens on your platform.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Papermaster also said that AMD is taking advantage of AI, actively beginning to research how it could be used in the development of future AMD chips. &ldquo;AI does an amazing job of having an infinite appetite to iterate, iterate, and iterate until you have a truly optimal solution,&rdquo; Papermaster told Alcorn. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not just iterating; we could do that before. It&rsquo;s iterating&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;learning.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full interview has more detail about whether AMD thinks AI could actually build chips. (Spoiler: Yes, but with some important caveats.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McAfee told PCWorld that we&rsquo;re on the cusp of some important announcements about AMD&rsquo;s future plans. We haven&rsquo;t heard anything official (Computex, maybe?) but perhaps we&rsquo;re not too far away from AMD outlining what it has in store for the next few years. Intel certainly hasn&rsquo;t been shy about <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/615644/intels-cpu-roadmap-now-extends-to-2024s-lunar-lake.html\">its own roadmap</a>.</p>\n\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1921237/amds-ryzen-will-follow-intel-into-performance-efficiency-cores.html", "date_published": "2023-05-18 10:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "This incredibly camera drone flies itself", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer is just around the corner, and you&rsquo;re bound to want to chronicle your adventures.
