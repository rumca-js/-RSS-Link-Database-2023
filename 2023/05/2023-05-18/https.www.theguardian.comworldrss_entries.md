What I have done in anticipation that we won’t get it all done till I get back is, I’ve cut my trip short in order to be [here] for the final negotiations and sign the deal with the majority leader.”</p><p><strong>What has McCarthy said?</strong> Speaking to CNBC, he said: “I think at the end of the day we do not have a debt default. The thing I’m confident about is now we have a structure to find a way to come to a conclusion. The timeline is very tight. But we’re going to make sure we’re in the room and get this done.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/18/first-thing-japan-pm-push-nuclear-weapons-pledge-hiroshima">Continue reading...</a>
