The lawsuit was filed by US relatives of Nawras Alassaf, a man who was killed in a 2017 Istanbul attack that was claimed by ISIS.

As such, they left intact a lower court decision to throw out a suit against YouTube brought by the family members of a victim of the 2015 terror attack in Paris.

If you were watching on YouTube TV though, the experience at the end of the game was highly frustrating. With just under five minutes left in the 4th quarter of a back-and-forth battle between the Miami Heat and the Boston Celtics, the streaming service had a major issue that kept viewers in a sputtering commercial loop for several minutes. Restarting the app didn't help as users were greeted with the stuttering trailer for the upcoming reboot of <em>The Little Mermaid.</em></p><p>When YouTube TV finally started to chug along again, it skipped ahead every few seconds (this was captured on DVR recordings too). Users were unable to just swipe to live television either, so they just had to contend with broken up bits of action for the rest of the game. The service <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1659026855494578176?s=20\">quickly admitted on Twitter</a> that it was having problems, specifically referencing users trying to watch the NBA playoff game. However, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1659051867639259136?s=20\">the issue impacted other channels</a> on the service too, including Bravo where <em>Watch What Happens Live </em>was airing after <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bravos-scandoval-has-made-peacock-my-number-one-streaming-app-163020121.html\">the highly anticipated <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> finale</a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Several hours later the service's support account tweeted that everything was back to normal.

We've reached out to YouTube TV for more information on the problem.</p><p>Live TV streaming wasn't the only headache for YouTube last night. While that issue was unfolding, creators <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/216258135\">were having trouble uploading</a> videos to YouTube proper, including clips for Shorts. Some experienced unusually slow processing times while others were unable to upload at all. This issue was also resolved a few hours later.</p><p>For YouTube TV, being completely unwatchable during high-profile live events is sure to leave a sour taste in subscribers' mouths. The service just increased its price by $8 a month to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-raises-prices-to-an-outrageous-73-per-month-182517379.html\">a whopping $73</a> in March. That's a little more than double the $35 monthly fee the service commanded at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-07-youtube-tv-hands-on.html\">its 2017 launch</a>. Streaming services as a whole have been regularly raising rates, so this isn't unique to YouTube TV.

It's pitched as a direct successor to the similarly-priced <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3060-ti-review-170018640.html\">RTX 3060 Ti</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-12-nvidia-rtx-2060-2070-super-review.html\">2060 Super</a>, and aimed at gamers who are more interested in high frame rates at 1080p than a high resolution.</p><p>The RTX 4060 Ti is a noticeable step down from the 4070 with 4,352 CUDA cores (versus 5,888) and a 128-bit memory interface (versus 192-bit). It's a mixed bag versus its predecessor. While the 3060 Ti has more cores and a much wider 256-bit interface, Ada, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-3-ada-lovelace-160404110.html\">DLSS 3</a> upscaling and a clock speed boost (2.3GHz base compared to the old card's 1.4GHz) theoretically help the 4060 Ti deliver more actual computing power, particularly for ray tracing and tensor-based tasks. It uses less power, too, with an &quot;average gaming power&quot; of 140W instead of the 3060 Ti's 197W.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>NVIDIA claims a roughly 15 percent average performance increase at 1080p over the 3060 Ti in games that don't use DLSS 3's frame generation, and 70 percent for those that do. You'll unsurprisingly get high 1080p frame rates in competitive titles like <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> (330FPS) and <em>Overwatch 2</em> (260FPS).</p><p>We're waiting on full specs for the starter RTX 4060 as we write this, but NVIDIA boasts a 20 percent average performance increase over the 3060 without DLSS 3 frame generation, and 70 percent when it kicks in.&nbsp;</p><p>You may want to wait a couple of months depending on your needs and budget. The standard $299 RTX 4060 won't arrive until July, while a $499 16GB RTX 4060 Ti will also land then for those who run into memory limits for some games and creative apps.&nbsp;</p><p>If you ask NVIDIA, the RTX 4060 line is the best option for most people. All but one of the most popular GPUs on Steam are NVIDIA xx60-series boards, and 77 percent of players are using 1080p or less. The 128-bit bus may make this less practical for 1440p or 4K gaming, though. There's also the question of competition. AMD is <a href=\"https://www.notebookcheck.net/Premilinary-RX-7800-XT-and-RX-7700-XT-performance-and-specifications-leak-alongside-possibly-doomed-RX-7800-XTX.709899.0.html\">rumored</a> to be introducing Radeon RX 7600, 7700 and 7800 desktop GPUs in June. They may be more enticing if AMD can deliver more value for your money.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-299-cheapest-40-series-gpu-130000067.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-299-cheapest-40-series-gpu-130000067.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-18 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "YouTube is bringing 30-second unskippable ads to its TV apps", "description": "<p>If you watch YouTube videos primarily on your TV, you may soon come across <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-17-youtube-ending-30-second-unskippable-ads-2018.html\">30-second ads</a> you won't be able to skip, just like commercials on traditional TV channels.

The company first shared information about the controller back in January under the name &quot;<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-accessibility-controller-project-leonardo-021032382.html\">Project Leonardo</a>.&quot; The announcement brings it one small, and long overdue, step closer to offering parity with Microsoft, which released the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-17-xbox-adaptive-controller-disabilities-gamepad-microsoft-tour.html\">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a> back in 2018.</p><p>The Access controller is customizable to accommodate different ranges of motion and strengths. The Analog stick caps are available in standard, dome and ball shapes. The button caps come in options including pillow and flat, alongside more unique sizes. The wide flat button cap covers two button sockets, the overhang style is equipped for people with smaller hands and the curve button cap can be pushed or pulled.

While it didn't explicitly name those titles, the Grand Theft Auto franchise has historically been one of Take-Two's biggest moneymakers.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href=\"https://sea.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rumored-title/199195/news/gta-6-might-be-coming-out-as-soon-as-next-year\">IGN</a> notes, Take-Two's net bookings for the previous fiscal year reached $5.3 billion, and it's thanks to the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/take-two-zynga-acquisiton-complete-151549286.html\">Zynga acquisition</a>. Before that, it was earning around $3 billion a year. An almost $3 billion jump in net bookings is massive, and unless Take-Two is making another huge acquisition, GTA is the franchise that would enable it to achieve that goal. <em>IGN</em> asked Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick whether we're going to see <em>GTA 6</em> as soon as next year, but the executive refused to confirm or deny it.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Part of the company's press release reads:</p><p>&quot;Looking ahead, Fiscal 2025 is a highly anticipated year for our Company. For the last several years, we have been preparing our business to release an incredibly robust pipeline of projects that we believe will take our company to even greater levels of success. In Fiscal 2025, we expect to enter this new era by launching several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry and enable us to achieve over $8 billion in Net Bookings and over $1 billion in Adjusted Unrestricted Operating Cash Flow.

Now, the sister of Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, who was allegedly kidnapped and tortured for operating a Twitter account critical of Saudi Arabia, has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/twitter-sued-over-saudi-spying-that-allegedly-landed-popular-user-in-prison/\">filed a lawsuit</a> accusing Twitter of breaking the law for letting its employees reveal his identity.&nbsp;</p><p>Areej al-Sadhan filed the complaint on her and her brother's behalf under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute.

As a result, Saudi Arabia kidnapped, tortured, imprisoned, and \u2014 through a sham trial \u2014 sentenced my brother to 20 years in prison, simply for criticizing Saudi repression on his Twitter account.&quot; The Saudi government has apparently denied Abdulrahman contact with his family, who has no idea whether he's still alive.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Abouammo and another former Twitter employee named Ali Alzabarah accessed confidential Twitter user data 30,892 times in 2015, the lawsuit states.

Six months after the warning, Jack Dorsey, who was Twitter's CEO back then, met with Mohammed bin Salman &quot;despite knowing full well [Saudi Arabia's] malign activities and various crimes,&quot; the complaint reads.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/16/twitter-rico-saudi-arabia/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> notes, Twitter faced two other lawsuits related to Saudi's spying activities on its website.
