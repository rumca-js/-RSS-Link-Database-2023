The Outlast Trials early access reviewed on PC by Travis Northup.
The Outlast Trials is a unique cooperative horror game with a fantastic premise and some really memorable scenarios, but while the early access version proves the concept there’s a lot of work to be done to make those ideas pay off. Running around with friends as you hide from murderous killers and complete utterly insane (and sometimes too edgy for their own good) death games is paradoxically tense and hilarious, but the fact that the enemy AI is about as effective as a concrete parachute and two of the three levels share too much of the same DNA certainly leaves a lot of room to grow on.

The FNAF movie teaser is here, and we’re asking the question: was it worth the long wait? Scott Cawthon first announced a film adaptation in 2015. Then 2017 rolled around, where Jason Blum announced he’d be adapting it under his Blumhouse Production brand. The Five Nights At Freddy’s movie has had a long gestation period in Hollywood, so FNAF fans are assuredly hype to see Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy on the big screen. And Matthew Lillard is presumed to be William Afton, the creator of Fazbear Entertainment. How does it hold up to Willy’s Wonderland, or the Banana Splits Movie? Since the announcement of the Five Nights at Freddy’s movie, Hollywood has tried to capitalize on the success of the FNAF formula through these live-action films, one starring Nic Cage. Willy’s Wonderland might not have been a box-office hit, but it was a hit amongst fans, particularly #FNAF fans. We also talk about The Amazing Spider-Man issue 26 where a pivotal superhero dies, which Marvel is billing as the most shocking issue in 50 years. We also give you the rundown on what to possibly expect from Sony’s PlayStation Showcase!

Not much is known about Venom 3 at this point, but with the inclusion of an already established MCU actor, it’ll be interesting to see what direction they’re going.  Hawkeye spinoff Echo has received a release date, and it'll be the first MCU series to drop a full season at once. Echo will drop all of its Season 1 episodes on Disney+ on Nov. 29. And finally today, Disney+ has announced that the first four Indiana Jones movies will start streaming on the platform on May 31.

Check out the new trailer for The Blackening, an upcoming movie starring Grace Byers, Jermaine Fowler, Melvin Gregg, X Mayo, Dewayne Perkins, Antoinette Robertson, Sinqua Walls, with Jay Pharoah, and Yvonne Orji.

The Blackening centers around a group of Black friends who reunite for a Juneteenth weekend getaway only to find themselves trapped in a remote cabin with a twisted killer. Forced to play by his rules, the friends soon realize this ain’t no motherf****** game. 

Directed by Tim Story (Ride Along, Think Like A Man, Barbershop) and screenplay and screen story by Tracy Oliver (Girls Trip, Harlem) & Dewayne Perkins (The Amber Ruffin Show, Brooklyn Nine-Nine), The Blackening skewers genre tropes and poses the sardonic question: if the entire cast of a horror movie is Black, who dies first?

The Blackening opens in theaters on June 16, 2023.
