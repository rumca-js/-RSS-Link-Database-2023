  <p id="Qmuxww">Elon Musk’s personal lawyer Alex Spiro sent a letter on behalf of Twitter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella that accuses Microsoft of violating Twitter’s developer agreement, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/technology/twitter-microsoft-misusing-data.html">as reported by<em> The New York Times</em></a>. In the Thursday letter (available in full below), Spiro claims that Microsoft may have been in violation of “multiple provisions” of Twitter’s developer agreement “for an extended period of time.”</p>
<p id="9RR7PY">Until recently, Microsoft had integrated Twitter’s APIs with some of its products — Twitter’s letter claims Microsoft operated “eight separate Twitter API apps” integrated with products like Xbox, Bing, and its ads platform. But it began pulling support for those APIs in April, including dropping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23456508">clip sharing to Twitter from Xbox</a>, likely due...</p>

  <p id="BuPr6v">Hyundai and Kia agreed to a $200 million settlement stemming from a class-action lawsuit related to a rash of car thefts inspired by a viral social media challenge on TikTok. </p>
<p id="9zndrN">The so-called “Kia Challenge” on the social media platform has led to hundreds of car thefts nationwide, including at least 14 reported crashes and eight fatalities, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/hyundai-kia-campaign-prevent-vehicle-theft">according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>. Thieves known as “the Kia Boyz” would post instructional videos on YouTube and TikTok about how to bypass the vehicles’ security system using tools as simple as a USB cable.</p>
<p id="HiRMFs">The thefts are reportedly easy to pull off because many Hyundai and Kia vehicles manufactured between 2015-2019 lack electronic immobilizers that prevent would-be...</p>

<p id="acewM3">Specifically, Apple News is getting a new Sports tab in the app that gives “easy access to stories, scores, standings, and more, for the teams and leagues you follow,” meaning it could be a handy way to follow sports-y things you care about in one spot. There are also new sports-focused score and schedule cards that will include information about specific games.</p>
<p id="WpNfp4">There is also a new Pride Lock Screen wallpaper and a few bug fixes. You can read Apple’s full changelog below:</p>

<p id="T8Al1L">The Tread Plus was initially recalled after several reports of injuries and, in one case, the death of a child. The machine featured a slatted belt, which was meant to increase traction and reduce impact as well as a raised deck. However, that combo resulted in a design flaw that made it easier to get pulled under the 455-pound machine.

  <p id="RJINqm">OpenAI has launched <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios">an iOS app for ChatGPT</a>, promising that an Android version is coming “soon.” The app is free to use, syncs chat history with the web, and features voice input, supported by OpenAI’s open-source speech recognition model Whisper. The app works on both iPhones and iPads and can be downloaded from the App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/openai-chatgpt/id6448311069">here</a>. OpenAI says it’s rolling out the app in the US first and will expand to other countries “in the coming weeks.”</p>
<p id="97iVXy">OpenAI didn’t previously hint that a mobile app was coming, but it makes sense given the incredible popularity of ChatGPT. The AI chatbot launched last November but rocketed in use.

  <p id="jWHvHH">The Supreme Court has declined to consider reinterpreting foundational internet law Section 230, saying it wasn’t necessary for deciding the terrorism-related case <em>Gonzalez v.

<p id="2nLEpa">In an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1333_6j7a.pdf">unsigned opinion</a> issued today, the court said the underlying complaints in <em>Gonzalez</em> were weak, regardless of Section 230’s applicability.

  <p id="nd1ViS">Watching YouTube on your TV is about to get more frustrating if you’re not paying to avoid ads. As announced at the <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/brandcast-2023-highlights-trends/">YouTube Brandcast</a> event on Wednesday, YouTube will soon add 30-second unskippable ads to top-performing content watched on connected TVs. </p>
<p id="QSiZHN">YouTube says viewers will see a single 30-second ad instead of two consecutive 15-second ads, though that doesn’t mean that those shorter ads will be disappearing entirely. 30-second ads will be available to advertisers via <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/introducing-youtube-select/">YouTube Select</a>, a curated advertising platform that targets the top five percent of YouTube content. YouTube claims 70 percent of YouTube Select impressions come from TVs, making it the ideal platform for longer ads.</p>
