Like, it's okay to be angry. That really resonated with me.\" For Talille Jaro and other fans, Rico Nasty's music \u2014 prissy, punk, brash and full of attitude \u2014 is a channel for anger. And in a world that paints Black girls showing any emotion as being too much, having a place to release that anger instead of muting it is essential.\n\nRico's fans, aka Nasty Mob, turn her shows into safe places to mosh together, places to build a community they can feel free around, if only for the length of a setlist. But when Rico went on tour with Playboi Carti in 2021, this feeling of safety was stripped away. Carti's fans harassed Rico during her sets at multiple shows \u2014 booing her offstage and even throwing a glass bottle at her. This left Rico feeling isolated, like she had no choice but to power through. Her fans felt alienated by what they witnessed, too, and mostly powerless to stop it.\n\nOn this episode: Rico Nasty unpacks the experience of keeping a brave face while the source of her artistic strength was drained from her in public. Talille Jaro, a proud member of Nasty Mob, recounts how it felt being in the crowd during one of those shows. Social media reporter Masani Musa dives into the \"strong Black woman\" trope, and why Rico's reception on the Carti tour is an example of how limiting and dehumanizing that idea can sometimes be. And we ask: When the outlet for your anger is shut down, how do you get your power back?\n\nIllustration by Amanda Howell Whitehurst.\nhttp://amandahowellwhitehurst.com\n\nLISTEN TO MORE EPISODES\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy2PCKGkKRVYaJh9C_eB22ryDQakzZ0Xd\n\nLOUDER THAN A RIOT\u2019s second season unpacks just how deeply misogynoir is embedded in the fabric of the hip-hop culture that we love. How did issues of masculinity play into the tensions between ILoveMakonnen and Drake, or Saucy Santana and the industry? How did Rico Nasty's community mobilize for her when she was targeted by Playboi Carti fans? Why did Megan Thee Stallion's reputation get put on the stand for a trial where she was the victim? And why does the culture antagonize rap beefs that reinforce the idea there can only be one queen of rap?\n\nFOLLOW \"LOUDER THAN A RIOT\"\nhttps://twitter.com/LouderThanARiot\n\nFOLLOW NPR MUSIC\nhttp://nprmusic.org/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/nprmusic\nhttps://twitter.com/nprmusic\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NPRMusic\n\nSee \u201cLouder Than A Riot\u201d sponsors and promo codes\nhttps://www.nationalpublicmedia.com/podcastsponsors/louder-than-a-riot/\n\nThe NPR shows you love are possible thanks to your support.
