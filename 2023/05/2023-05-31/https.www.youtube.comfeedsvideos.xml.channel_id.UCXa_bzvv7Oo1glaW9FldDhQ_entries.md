With the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1, the franchise will be rebooting itself yet again, but as we know all too well at this point, Mortal Kombat never truly hits the reset button. As the 2011 reboot proved, even a reboot is a sequel in disguise. While it remains to be seen how tangibly connected to the past games Mortal Kombat 1 will be, there's little doubt in anyone's mind that it will, at the end of the day, still serve as a continuation that stems from the events of previous entries. 

As such, over the course of the next few weeks and months, we're going to take a deep dive into the franchise and recount its entire story, from beginning to end, in as much detail as possible.
