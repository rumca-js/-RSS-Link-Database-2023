## Instagram explains its recommendations and 'shadowbanning'

<p>Instagram is, once again, trying <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-ranking-explained/"><ins>to explain</ins></a> how its recommendations work in an attempt to dispel “misconceptions” about how the app’s algorithm works and whether or not the company engages in “shadowbanning” of certain creators. In a new blog post from Instagram’s top exec Adam Mosseri, he offers one of the most detailed explanations to date on how the app ranks content in various parts of the app.</p><p>“Instagram doesn’t have a singular algorithm that oversees what people do and don’t see on the app,” Mosseri explains. Instead, he says, there are multiple algorithms and ranking systems underpinning different aspects of the app, like Explore, Reels, Stories and search. Each of these uses a variety of signals to determine how content is ranked for each user.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For example, the order of posts in your main feed is determined by your past activity, as well as previous interactions with the person who made each post. Likewise, Stories posts take into account viewing history as well as “closeness,” or “how likely you are to be connected as friends or family.” On the other hand, recommendations in Explore are largely based “posts you’ve liked, saved, shared and commented on in the past,” but are more likely to come from accounts you’ve never interacted with.</p><p>One of the more interesting sections of Mosseri's blog post is titled “addressing shadowbanning.” Mosseri notes that there isn’t a universal definition for the word, but acknowledges that many creators “use the term to imply that a user’s account or content is limited or hidden without a clear explanation or justification.” And he says that the company is working to increase transparency around when creators’ content or accounts are blocked from the app’s recommendations.</p><p>Specifically, he calls out the app’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-account-status-recommendations-shadowbans-180937137.html"><ins>“account status”</ins></a> feature, which can alert users if one of their posts or their account is considered “ineligible” for recommendations. The feature also offers an appeals process. While it’s not the first time Instagram has addressed the issue, which has been the subject of much speculation and conspiracy theories over the years, there has been a notable shift in the way the company is talking about “shadowbanning.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works"><ins>similar post</ins></a> from two years ago, Mosseri wrote that “the truth is most of your followers won’t see what you share, because most look at less than half of their Feed.” Now, he says Instagram is working on increasing transparency in cases when a creator’s content isn’t widely distributed due to a policy violation. “If anything makes your content less visible, you should know about it and be able to appeal,” he wrote.</p><p>He added that Instagram is testing “new notifications to help creators understand when the reach of their reel may be limited due to a watermark” (the company has tried <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-repost-tiktoks-best-practices-200536658.html"><ins>to discourage </ins></a>users from posting recycled TikToks to Reels for years).</p><p>While some creators may still find these explanations unsatisfying — and there are more than a few who fall into that camp, judging by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs6gh_NgPF0/"><ins>the comments</ins></a> on Mosseri’s own Instagram post — the new details underscore just how central algorithmic recommendations are becoming to Instagram. While the app  re-introduced an optional <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-chronological-feed-is-back-150050596.html"><ins>chronological feed</ins></a>, Mark Zuckerberg has said his goal is to transform Instagram and Facebook into a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-app-redesign-tiktok-recommendations-221943589.html"><ins>“discovery engine”</ins></a> more focused on recommendations than posts from friends.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/instagram-explains-its-recommendations-and-shadowbanning-234716911.html?src=rss

## Reddit app developer says the site’s new API rules will cost him $20 million a year

<p>Reddit’s recently-announced plan to charge for API access could price out the developer of one of the most popular third-party Reddit apps. The developer of Reddit client Apollo is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/"><ins>raising</ins></a> the alarm on the new API pricing, saying the changes would require him to spend millions of dollars to keep his app going in its current form.</p><p>Reddit announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-will-charge-companies-for-api-access-citing-ai-training-concerns-184935783.html"><ins>sweeping changes</ins></a> to its API rules last month, citing the rise of AI companies using their platform to train large language models. “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8xOC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3JlZGRpdC1haS1vcGVuYWktZ29vZ2xlLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFiNDQ0ZjA3LTcyYTAtNDI3Yi1iMTQ4LTFiYTMzZWExMmMyNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAX29OoOnxN9awhylAVgoBMvGz4229CKBBv5UKUD1PDto&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F04%2F18%2Ftechnology%2Freddit-ai-openai-google.html"><ins>told</ins></a><em> The New York Times</em>. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But it now seems that independent app makers will also be subject to the pricier new plans, which are set to take effect <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/12qwhbh/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/"><ins>June 19th</ins></a>. While Reddit hasn’t officially disclosed its API pricing, Christian Selig, Apollo’s sole developer, says he would have to pay $20 million to keep his app going “as-is” under the new policies.</p><p>“50 million requests costs $12,000, a figure far more than I ever could have imagined,” he wrote in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/"><ins>a post</ins></a> on Reddit, citing multiple conversations he’s had with Reddit representatives about the upcoming API changes. “Apollo made 7 billion requests last month, which would put it at about 1.7 million dollars per month, or 20 million US dollars per year.”</p><p>That pricing leaves Selig and Apollo, which has been widely praised for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apollo-reddit-iphone-14-pro-dynamic-island-pixel-pals-update-221206984.html"><ins>design details</ins></a> and for providing functionality beyond Reddit’s native app, in a tough position. While the app does offer subscriptions, its current revenue isn’t enough to cover the steep API cost. He says that the average user makes about 344 API calls a day, which would require him to raise subscription prices to at least $2.50 a month (currently, he says, most subscribers pay $0.99 a month). Furthermore, that wouldn’t account for Apollo’s power users, who use the app at much higher rates, or the app’s free users. “Even keeping the existing, subscription only users I would be SUBSTANTIALLY in the red each month,” Selig tells Engadget.</p><p>In a statement, a Reddit spokesperson said that Selig was provided “pricing per 1,000 API calls, not a monthly bill,” but declined to share details. “Our pricing is based on usage levels that we measure to be as equitable as possible,” the spokesperson said. “We’ve been, and will continue, to work with third-party apps to help them improve efficiency, which can significantly impact overall cost.”</p><p>If all of this sounds oddly familiar, there are striking similarities between Reddit’s new developer rules and the drastic changes Twitter has made to its API policies under Elon Musk. In Twitter’s case, the company decided <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-new-developer-terms-ban-third-party-clients-211247096.html"><ins>to ban</ins></a> third-party client apps while simultaneously making its API extraordinarily <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-announces-new-api-pricing-including-a-limited-free-tier-for-bots-005251253.html"><ins>expensive</ins></a> for the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone/"><ins>researchers</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-says-startups-can-experiment-with-its-data-for-5000-a-month-200705341.html"><ins>businesses</ins></a> that previously depended on higher levels of access to Twitter data.</p><p>Of note, Reddit hasn’t been as outwardly hostile to developers. Selig notes that he’s had multiple calls with Reddit and that reps he’s spoken to have been “communicative and civil” about the changes. And a Reddit spokesperson suggested the company wants to keep third-party apps around.</p><p>“We’re committed to fostering a developer ecosystem around Reddit – developers and third-party apps can make Reddit better,” the spokesperson said. “Our Data API has powered thousands of applications, such as tools to make moderation easier, and utilities that help users stay up to date on their favorite topics, and games. Developers are incredibly valuable to the Reddit ecosystem, so much so that we recently updated our Developer Platform.”</p><p>Still, Selig said he’s uncertain about how he will handle the changes. “I hope it goes without saying that I don't have that kind of money,” he shared on Reddit. “This is going to require some thinking.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/reddit-app-developer-says-the-sites-new-api-rules-will-cost-him-20-million-a-year-203911487.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon isn't just settling over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-settles-lawsuit-with-ftc-over-ring-doorbell-privacy-concerns-191257621.html">Ring doorbell privacy concerns</a>. The online retailer has <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.322683/gov.uscourts.wawd.322683.1.0.pdf">agreed</a> to pay a $25 million settlement over Federal Trade Commission (FTC) allegations it violated child privacy through Alexa. The company allegedly fell afoul of both the FTC Act and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) through its handling of kids' voice data.</p><p>While the company said it limited access to voice data and promised to delete info on request, it kept children's recordings and transcripts indefinitely by default until September 2019, according to the FTC. The Commission also says Amazon failed to delete transcripts for a &quot;significant period of time,&quot; and was still holding on to voice info and geolocation data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In response, Amazon has issued a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-response-to-ftc-settlement-regarding-alexa">statement</a> that it 'disagrees' with the FTC's claims and is settling to put the matter &quot;behind us.&quot; It maintains that Amazon Kids was designed with COPPA in mind, and that parents have easy ways to delete recordings and transcripts on the web. The company also says it will delete child profiles that haven't been used for at least 18 months, addressing an FTC concern that data could linger for years.</p><p>Amazon made it possible to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-29-amazon-alexa-voice-deletion.html">delete  your voice history</a> using Alexa back in May 2019, but it wasn't enabled by default. It also let you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-03-amazon-alexa-review-opt-out-privacy.html">opt out of human reviews</a> for transcripts in August that year. The changes came after a revelation that Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-11-amazon-alexa-voice-recording-human-review.html">had workers reviewing audio clips</a> and transcripts to improve Alexa'x understanding of speech. There were worries staff might listen to sensitive information and otherwise hear things customers didn't want others to know.</p><p>The settlements over Alexa and Ring are the latest embodiments of Amazon's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ftc-chair-lina-khan-recusal-antitrust-investigations-181556108.html">fears about the FTC</a> under chairwoman Lina Khan.

## GM’s auto emergency braking feature is now standard on its latest EVs

<p>GM <a href="https://pressroom.gm.com/gmbx/us/en/pressroom/home/news.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2023/may/0531-safety.html">announced</a> today that it’s making five active safety features standard on all its 2023 and newer EVs. In addition, the automaker says it will surpass its commitment to add <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iihs-study-trucks-forward-collision-140000406.html">Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)</a> to 95 percent of its vehicles; the feature is included in 98 percent of GM’s 2023 models — including all its EVs. The disclosure follows the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="https://apnews.com/article/automatic-emergency-braking-requirement-lifesaving-ed2df3c5bdff17361ad7d93d942ff03b">stating</a> today that all new passenger cars and light trucks will be required to include AEB within three years.</p><p>In addition to AEB, GM says four other safety features will be standard in most of its 2023 model-year vehicles. These include Forward Collision Alert (warns you if a front-facing crash is likely), Front Pedestrian Braking (alerts you to oncoming pedestrians, automatically braking if needed), Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning (lets you know if you’re drifting out of your lane) and IntelliBeam (automatic high-beam headlight controls). “As we look ahead toward a future vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, these technologies are significant building blocks with proven benefits for reducing common crashes,” said John Capp, GM’s director of Vehicle Safety Technology, Strategy and Regulations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The automaker touts its adherence to safety research data to inform the decision, citing a 2023 study at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) that showed AEB combined with Forward Collision Alert reduced rear-end crashes by 42 percent. The same research found that Front Pedestrian Braking cut head-on pedestrian collisions by 23 percent, while Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning lowered roadway departure accidents (crashes stemming from a car veering off-road or into other lanes) by 15 percent. Finally, the automaker sourced a separate 2022 UMTRI study demonstrating that IntelliBeam cut nighttime crashes involving pedestrians, bicyclists and animals by 22 percent.</p><p>GM is also upgrading the front sensors in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cadillac-lyric-suv-ev-first-drive-video-130014787.html">Cadillac Lyriq</a>, 2023 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/next-generation-chevrolet-colorado-allegedly-173100102.html">Chevy Colorado</a> and GMC Canyon. The enhanced sensors, with a wider field of vision, extend AEB operation to speeds of up to 80 mph while adding Bicyclist Automatic Emergency Braking to Front Pedestrian Braking — a welcome feature in cities with cyclists zipping in and out of traffic. In addition, the sensors enable smoother Lane Keep Assist engagement and Blind Zone Steering Assist (a short / sharp turn to avoid lane-change crashes). The automaker says the upgraded sensors and corresponding features will expand to other models in coming years.</p><p>The company emphasized that its safety features aren’t <em>only</em> for the wealthy and will also cover some of its cheapest gas-powered vehicles. For example, the 2024 Chevrolet Trax ($21,495 and up) will include all five of the safety features now standard in its more expensive EVs. “With this commitment, customers across all price points and trim levels will benefit from this set of proven safety technologies,” the company said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gms-auto-emergency-braking-feature-is-now-standard-on-its-latest-evs-192035030.html?src=rss

## Eating disorder helpline takes down chatbot after it dispenses dangerous advice

<p>The National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) was forced to take down its Tessa chatbot after it “may have given information that was harmful and unrelated to the program”, according to an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs4BiC9AhDe/"><ins>official social media post.</ins></a> Simply put, the AI chatbot was intended to help people dealing with emotional distress, but instead just made things worse by offering dieting advice and urging users to weigh and measure themselves.</p><p>Multiple users and experts in the field of eating disorders have experienced the issues first hand, claiming that the bot didn’t respond to simple prompts like “I hate my body” and that it constantly emphasized the importance of dieting and increased physical activity, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ai-chatbot-eating-disorder-helpline-neda-1850490751"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>Gizmodo.</ins></em></a> Again, this is a helpline for those with an eating disorder, <em>not</em> a weight loss support group.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The organization says this is a temporary shutdown until it fixes whatever “bugs” and “triggers” led to the chatbot dispensing dangerous information like an appointment with Dr. Oz. You’d think with such an extreme outcome, they’d be thinking about trashing the project entirely, but there’s more to the story.</p><p>The whole reason NEDA was relying on the chatbot in the first place is because it allegedly fired human staffers after they tried to unionize, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7ezkm/eating-disorder-helpline-fires-staff-transitions-to-chatbot-after-unionization"><ins>as originally reported by </ins><em><ins>Vice</ins></em><ins>.</ins></a> The <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline">long-running phone helpline</a> was manned by both paid staffers and volunteers, and former staff claim the mass firing was a direct consequence of the pro-union effort.</p><p>“NEDA claims this was a long-anticipated change and that AI can better serve those with eating disorders. But do not be fooled—this isn’t really about a chatbot. This is about union busting, plain and simple,” former helpline associate <a href="https://www.labornotes.org/blogs/2023/05/union-busting-chatbot-eating-disorders-nonprofit-puts-ai-retaliation"><ins>Abbie Harper wrote in a blog post</ins></a> on <em>Labor Notes.</em></p><p>Even with this recent snafu, the helpline’s still set to vanish tomorrow. Before this issue came to the public’s attention, NEDA had been transitioning unpaid volunteers away from one-on-one conversations with sufferers and toward training the chatbot. We’ll see if that changes. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-held-anti-union-meetings-at-all-of-its-us-stores-223528059.html"><ins>union-busters gonna bust,</ins></a> am I right?</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/eating-disorder-helpline-takes-down-chatbot-after-it-dispenses-dangerous-advice-173424523.html?src=rss

We are doing our best to ensure LCS employees, contractors and others supporting the LCS are not negatively impacted by the delay.&quot;</p><p>The company said although it needs &quot;an LCS that is thrilling to watch and showcases the highest levels of <em>League of Legends</em> play,&quot; it wouldn't be able to delay the Summer Split any further. Aletaha said doing so &quot;would make it nearly impossible to run a legitimate competition,&quot; and as such Riot would be prepared to nix the season entirely. &quot;That is not an outcome we’d want, but it’s unfortunately the reality of ensuring we run a fair, competitive global system,&quot; Aletaha added.</p><p>The LCSPA <a href="https://twitter.com/NALCSPA/status/1663276405063286784">claimed on Monday</a> there had been &quot;attempts to require teams to field scab players at the start of the season.&quot; The LCSPA urged potential replacements to refuse to play for an LCS team because &quot;crossing the line puts all players’ futures at risk&quot; and &quot;undermines player negotiating power.&quot;</p><div id="441be96f5578400fa1bdeca67c20c4dd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/dr4aHrpv8T">pic.twitter.com/dr4aHrpv8T</a></p>— LCS Players Association (@NALCSPA) <a href="https://twitter.com/NALCSPA/status/1663276405063286784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>On Sunday, a majority of the 50 LCS players voted in favor of the walkout, resulting in one of the first major instances of collective action in esports. They are protesting a decision Riot <a href="https://lolesports.com/article/our-commitment-to-the-nacl/blta77d13f68bd0293b"><ins>announced earlier this month</ins></a> to no longer require LCS teams to field a team in an official farm system. The company agreed to a request from the teams in order to &quot;support the continued, long-term success of the teams and the professional esports ecosystem in North America.&quot;</p><p>Most LCS teams swiftly said they'd be dropping their North American Challengers League (NACL) rosters. The LCSPA said the move would result in &quot;as many as 70 players, coaches and managers&quot; losing their jobs and that most of the current LCS players came through the official farm system. The LCSPA claimed the average salary cost of an NACL roster &quot;accounts for less than 17 percent of an average LCS organization's League-based salary costs in a year.&quot; It claimed that although farm systems in other regions were working well, &quot;North America now has a developmental product with no viewership, no institutional support, no paying jobs and no future.&quot;</p><p>The LCSPA urged Riot to <a href="https://twitter.com/NALCSPA/status/1661066290906251294"><ins>agree to several conditions</ins></a>, including a promotion and relegation format between the LCS and NACL. It also wanted the publisher to &quot;commit to a revenue pool for player salaries of $300,000 per NACL team per year.&quot;</p><p>Aletaha addressed each of the LCSPA's five requests in the blog post. In terms of the revenue pool, &quot;this ask is for multiple millions in subsidies for the NACL. That simply isn’t sustainable — and to be brutally honest, it shouldn’t be necessary. We have other Tier 2 leagues around the world which thrive on their own, and we believe the NACL can get to that place too.&quot; Aletaha noted that Riot is giving the organization that operates the NACL a one-time payment of $300,000 to &quot;jump-start&quot; the season and provide support to teams.</p><p>&quot;Without players, there is no league, and there is no esport,&quot; the LCSPA said in response.

<p>The four-year wait is almost over. Netflix has set a June 15th premiere date for the sixth season of sci-fi anthology series <em>Black Mirror.</em> This latest season has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-black-mirror-season-six-142210292.html"><ins>been in the works for at least a year</ins></a> and creator Charlie Brooker has stated the new episodes would “keep things fresh” by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-mirror-returns-in-june-with-its-most-unpredictable-season-yet-162740972.html"><ins>tackling sci-fi tropes the series had previously avoided,</ins></a> calling it the “most unpredictable season” he’s been involved with.</p><p>The cast list is strong with this one. The upcoming sixth season stars Aaron Paul (<em>Breaking Bad</em>), Annie Murphy (<em>Schitt’s Creek</em>), Ben Barnes (<em>Shadow and Bone</em>), Himesh Patel (<em>Station Eleven</em>), Josh Hartnett (<em>Black Hawk Down</em>), Kate Mara (<em>House of Cards</em>), Rory Culkin (<em>Columbus</em>), Salma Hayek Pinault (<em>Frida</em>) and so many more. As always, this is an anthology series so each actor will likely just appear in one episode, but you never know.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c690032a8321490fb4619ea7c81307ae"></div><p>To celebrate the premiere, Netflix has also dropped a brand-new trailer filled with intriguing shots. Brooker has said in the past that the newest season would be more cinematic in scope and this trailer certainly abides by that statement.</p><p><em>Black Mirror’s</em> early seasons were a terrifying look at near-future possibilities, but now that we’re actually living in one, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-11-black-mirror-season-five-review.html"><ins>the show has lost a bit of its satirical edge.</ins></a> Let’s hope season six cranks it up a notch.

## Ransomware attack exposes sensitive data for nearly 9 million dental patients

<p>A recently disclosed ransomware attack has compromised some particularly sensitive medical data. Dental insurer Managed Care of North America (MCNA) <a href="https://response.idx.us/MCNA-Information/">reports</a> that an intruder accessed and took copies of informationpatients between February 26th and March 7th of this year, including addresses, Social Security numbers, driver's licenses and insurance data. Some of the info belonged to parents, guardians and guarantors (people who pay bills on others' behalf), MCNA says. A <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/895b95c8-abc8-41f1-8c3f-b0415575de56.shtml">filing</a> with Maine's Attorney General indicates that over 8.9 million people were affected.</p><p>The company hasn't identified the perpetrator. However, <em>TechCrunch</em> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/ransomware-attack-on-us-dental-insurance-giant-exposes-data-of-9-million-patients/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">learned</a> that the Russia-based LockBit ransomware group is taking credit and says it has published all the files after MCNA refused to pay a $10 million ransom. Samples from the roughly 700GB of data appear to corroborate the claim.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>MCNA is offering one year of free identity theft protection to affected customers. It's also advising clients to check their accounts and bills for anything unusual. The firm says it's the largest US insurer for government-backed plans for children and seniors, and its partners include New York City as well as numerous unions.</p><p>The tally makes this the largest health data breach in 2023 to date. Before now, the largest incident was a March breach <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/16/us-pharmacy-giant-says-hackers-accessed-personal-data-of-almost-6-million-patients/">at PharMerica</a> that compromised info for nearly 6 million patients. MCNA is far from unique as a victim of ransomware, but the responses have varied across the industry. While some have refused to pay ransoms and have instead dealt with the repercussions, others have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cna-40-million-cybersecurity-ransom-222844410.html">paid millions</a> to reclaim their systems.</p><p>This also suggests that LockBit hasn't been deterred by recent crackdowns. Canadian police arrested alleged leader Mikahil Vasiliev in November, while the US charged a Russian national in March. However, the cybercrime outfit has also been attached to high-profile attacks that include California's finance department and the UK's Royal Mail. Campaigns like this aren't likely to stop in the near future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ransomware-attack-exposes-sensitive-data-for-nearly-9-million-dental-patients-161546447.html?src=rss

## Apple WWDC 2023: What to expect, from iOS 17 to new MacBooks

<p>Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference regularly sets the tone for the company’s future, and that may be truer than ever for 2023. Many expect the company to introduce its first mixed reality headset at the event, with a new platform to match. However, the wearable is far from the only major announcement believed to be coming at WWDC this year. Rumors have included a larger MacBook Air, a major watchOS update and even app sideloading on iOS. Here’s what you’re likely to see when executives take to the digital stage on June 5th.</p><h2>Mixed reality headset</h2><figure><img alt="Oculus Quest VR headset" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/c3340190-ff2d-11ed-99bd-0e42e6c35cda" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Minh Pham on Unsplash</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Apple’s first foray into mixed reality hardware (that is, a blend of real and virtual worlds) is one of the company’s worst-kept secrets. The tech giant has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-30-apple-buys-startup-ar-lenses.html">acquiring headset-friendly startups</a> for years, and Tim Cook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-14-tim-cook-has-more-faith-in-augmented-reality-than-vr.html">hasn’t been shy about his interests</a> in augmented and virtual reality. Now, though, a headset appears to be ready for a WWDC debut — Apple’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-wwdc-2023-begins-june-5th-171718339.html">event logo</a> even hints at a lens.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the rumors are accurate, Apple’s stand-alone device (possibly called Reality Pro) may be more powerful than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html">Meta Quest Pro</a> and many other high-end headsets. It might offer a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-no-metaverse-for-vr-headset-182544991.html">4K resolution per eye</a>, with at least six cameras providing a view of the outside world as well as full body motion tracking. It could also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-m2-processor-215501828.html">use an M2 chip</a> that outperforms the mobile processors you typically see in stand-alone headsets. Expectations are that it will require an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-mixed-reality-headset-may-come-with-a-magnetic-cable-for-its-external-power-supply-171341879.html">external battery pack</a> and last for just two hours on a charge, but it would be relatively light and slim.</p><p>The true star might be the software, though. The Apple headset will reportedly run a new platform (possibly called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-xros-mixed-reality-headset-130532613.html">xrOS</a>) designed with mixed reality in mind. Rather than rely on controllers, you would use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/latest-apple-headset-rumors-say-itll-include-vr-workouts-and-sports-192316389.html">hand gestures, gaze detection and Siri voice commands</a> to navigate the interface. An Apple Watch-style crown would toggle between AR and VR, and you could type in mid-air.</p><p>This initial device is believed to be focused on productivity, with VR-ready versions of Apple apps like Pages, iMovie and GarageBand supposedly in the works.

Rumors have persisted for months that iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-third-party-app-stores-report-195840839.html">enable sideloading</a> – that is, installing apps outside the App Store – to honor European Union competition rules. Just like on Android, you could download apps directly from the web or through third-party stores. That would allow for things that aren’t possible under Apple’s existing rules, such as web browsers that use their own engines instead of WebKit.</p><p>Sideloading might not be the only notable feature. <em>MacRumors</em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/05/ios-17-control-center-changes-rumor/">claims</a> iOS 17 will revamp the Control Center. You could also see a Day One-style <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-reportedly-working-on-a-health-led-journaling-app-114058422.html">life journaling app</a> and mood tracking in the Health app. There have also been reports the company will expand the functionality of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-review-dynamic-island-useful-always-on-display-battery-life-camera-test-sample-pictures-130020449.html">iPhone 14 Pro’s</a> Dynamic Island, give Maps a new lock screen interface and streamline the Music and Wallet apps. The iPad may play catch-up in some areas, with iPadOS 17 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/26/ipad-lock-screen-customizations-ipados17/">rumored</a> to inherit iOS 16’s lock screen customization and include a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-reportedly-developing-an-ai-health-coach-for-apple-watch-212515646.html">tablet-native Health app</a>.</p><p>Accessibility may play an important role, as well. Apple recently previewed a series of iOS features that make the iPhone <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-assistive-access-simplifies-ios-16-for-people-with-cognitive-disabilities-120012723.html">more usable for people with disabilities</a>. Assistive Access provides a simplified interface for people with cognitive issues, while Live Speech and Personal Voice have iOS speak written text during calls. You can even have your phone speak what it sees on text and buttons. Apple hasn’t explicitly said iOS 17 will introduce these features, but a release “later this year” suggests that’s more than likely.</p><p>WWDC may also represent Apple’s opportunity to detail the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-next-car-play-will-meld-itself-to-your-car-infotainment-system-174750787.html">next-gen CarPlay interface</a> it teased at last year’s conference. While the company previously said the platform could control more in-cabin systems, it has yet to explain those capabilities. The first cars using this experience are due to arrive late this year, so Apple doesn’t have much time to prepare developers for the upgrade.</p><p>iOS and iPadOS updates typically launch in September or October. Public betas should be available considerably sooner, though, and have historically arrived within weeks.</p><h2>WatchOS 10</h2><figure><img alt="Apple Watch Series 8 with Astronomy face" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/398c6da0-ee67-11ed-bfa7-872a4ff5351c" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low/Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>The Apple Watch may be due for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-reportedly-redesigning-watchos-around-widgets-162720331.html">largest software update</a> in its history. <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-30/watchos-10-details-apple-watch-to-gain-widgets-as-part-of-new-software-at-wwdc-lh3f71uv?sref=10lNAhZ9">claims</a> watchOS 10 will be redesigned around widgets, bringing back traces of the Glances from the original OS with elements of the Siri watch face.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-frame-tv-irl-153546368.html"><ins>Samsung's The Frame</ins></a> is a smart TV that has a nifty trick up its sleeve. When you're not watching something, it looks like a piece of art. It's an intriguing alternative to the standard gloomy black box that can dominate a living room when a big-screen TV is turned off. Now, over at Woot, you can snap up a Frame TV at a discount.

The biggest discounts, percentage wise, are on the 50-inch and 75-inch models, as both are a third off. The 50-inch model has dropped by $430 to $870, while the 75-inch model is $1,000 off at $2,000.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When Art Mode is enabled, The Frame can display the artwork of your choice. Some of the pieces are available at no extra cost, though you'll have access to a wider selection with a Samsung Art Store subscription. The options range from iconic works such as the <em>Mona Lisa</em> and <em>The Starry Night</em> to modern photography. The Frame has a low profile and anti-reflective matte glass to bolster the illusion that you're looking at framed art instead of a TV. The bezel is customizable too.</p><p>When you do want to tune in to a show or movie, you'll be able to watch in 4K, unless you opt for the 32-inch model, which doesn't have a QLED 4K display.

## Range Rover’s next luxury add-on: A car seat that vibrates to music

<p>Many car makers will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-dolby-atmos-160018074.html">surround you with speakers</a> in a bid to create immersive sound, but Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) thinks your seat can also play a role. The company's new Range Rover Sport SV Edition One includes Subpac-powered &quot;Body and Soul Seat&quot; tech (appropriately, BASS) whose headrest-mounted membranes and transducers deliver haptic feedback in response to lower frequencies in your music. Whether you're the driver or a passenger, you'll feel the thumps of a dance or rap track.</p><p>The system complements the Range Rover Sport's 29-speaker Meridian audio setup, which already has a subwoofer, but Jaguar Land Rover and Subpac also claim the vibrations can improve your health through six wellness programs. The companies point to a JLR-supported study indicating that BASS can help you relax and reduce stress by increasing the variability of your heart rate. Provided that holds up in the real world, this may be the luxury SUV to get if you need to unwind during the commute home.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Range Rover SV Edition One BASS seat" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/a6662970-ffb5-11ed-bff0-94e24e176cc0" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jaguar Land Rover</div></figure><p>The Range Rover Sport SV Edition One is already sold out for its first year. You can <a href="https://www.landroverusa.com/range-rover/range-rover-sport/sv.html">sign up</a> to be notified about other SV trim levels, and there are hints BASS will be more widely available going forward.</p><p>However well this seat works, it's just the start for Subpac. The company has been pitching its mix of haptics and bone conduction to movie theaters, music producers, VR simulation creators and gamers, and has a Flow platform that can bring vibration to seats and wearables (think of something like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-06-the-basslet-puts-a-haptic-subwoofer-on-your-wrist.html">Lofelt's Basslet</a>). The firm also hopes to venture into aviation and the overall wellness space.

<p>There’s a big day coming up, and plenty of pressure on you to hand over a gift that somehow represents all of your love and appreciation. It may be called Father’s Day, but this is an event for you to say a loving thank you to whatever person held that special role in your life, irrespective of their gender. Thankfully, we've collated a list of the best tech gifts you can buy to at least go some small way in saying thanks for all of that parenting you did, and probably still do.</p><h2>Sony WH-1000XM5</h2><p></p><p>Sony’s XM series of headphones are the default option for pretty much every regular buyer these days. Sony's latest model, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LVdILTEwMDBYTTUtQ2FuY2VsaW5nLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMtSGFuZHMtRnJlZS9kcC9CMDlYUzdKV0hIP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEwbS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2M3NGFjZDItNGFkOS00YmFlLWE0ZTEtOGYxMWEyMGU2ODZhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaFooelRV1Cbyl51kIs4lGmNtBzJjikw3OQD2hTqXuby&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free%2Fdp%2FB09XS7JWHH%3F">WH-1000XM5</a>, offer a better looking design, a more comfortable fit and even better sound than its predecessor. As Billy Steele wrote in his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html">review</a>, if you thought the XM4s couldn’t get better, you’ll be staggered by the improvement here.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A lot of small things have been tweaked, including the fact there are twice as many noise cancellation microphones as on the XM4. That promises better high-frequency sound blocking, which should be great in crowded areas and on airplanes. For $400, they’re pricier than, say, Bose’s 700s, but that saving might be something of a false economy. If you just can’t stretch that far, then keep an eye out for the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Ftem4udG8vM2x1REVhMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2M3NGFjZDItNGFkOS00YmFlLWE0ZTEtOGYxMWEyMGU2ODZhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQzKf5NJu04_bS11ClkD_N7S2gcQgz1bEIpb918LbIyU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3luDEa0">XM4</a>, since the old flagship is remaining on sale at a discount.</p><h2>Withings Body Cardio smart scale</h2><p></p><p>Let’s face it: You want your loved ones to stay healthy, keep an eye on their heart and generally be around for as long as possible. One way to do that is by upgrading your bathroom scales to something like <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9XaXRoaW5ncy1Ob2tpYS1Cb2R5LUNhcmRpby1Db21wb3NpdGlvbi9kcC9CMDc5NjVORFc3P3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTBtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzYzc0YWNkMi00YWQ5LTRiYWUtYTRlMS04ZjExYTIwZTY4NmEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVNpWOFcyFeqNq25bnWCciKalk5HxvuWzZLAULb9ebtu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWithings-Nokia-Body-Cardio-Composition%2Fdp%2FB07965NDW7%3Fth%3D1">Withings’ Body Cardio smart scale</a>. Designed to look as unobtrusive as possible, but hidden inside its shell is a number of extra special features you don’t get elsewhere.</p><p>You’ll get a heart-health check, automatic person tracking and a full body composition breakdown, telling you how much fat, water and muscle you’re carrying. I’d be remiss not to mention, too, Withings’ class-leading Health Mate app, which is great for collating large chunks of health data and helping you understand it in an easy-to-digest manner.</p><h2>reMarkable 2 with Stylus + Type Folio</h2><p></p><p>I’m a big fan of distraction-free writing machines that enable me to focus and avoid succumbing to the temptations of the internet. My go-to has historically been the basic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-09-apple-ipad-keyboard-folio-irl.html">iPad with the keyboard folio</a>, which I’ve been using to get me out of a pinch for years now. To be clear, I still love that machine but in terms of distraction-free tech, I think the <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">reMarkable 2</a> with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-type-folio-keyboard-hands-on-130057978.html">Type Folio</a> has the edge. It’s a stripped-down, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">e-paper slate</a> designed to let you type and amend documents with its stylus in a way that’s as close to editing on real paper as you’re likely to get.</p><p>It’s a 10.3-inch tablet with an e-paper display that’s more or less responsive enough that you won’t be waiting forever for it to refresh. On its own, it’s little more than a glorified e-reader, but with the stylus and Type Folio, it becomes something a lot more powerful. I reviewed it fairly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-type-folio-keyboard-hands-on-130057978.html">recently</a> and found I could type a first (and second) draft of a piece and then, just by closing the keyboard and reorienting it into portrait mode, could then pull out the stylus and start making notes. The Type Folio, I think, makes the right compromises for the size, and doesn’t require too much adaptation for most experienced touch-typers.</p><p>And since I tested it, the company has launched a <a href="https://news.remarkable.com/new-software-update-enhances-typing-and-reading-experience-across-the-remarkable-ecosystem">new version of its operating system</a> which adds a number of small but vital quality-of-life improvements. That includes the ability to format for bold and italic text on the fly, as well as tweaks to the refresh rate for smoother scrolling. If there’s a downside, it’s that the whole setup isn’t cheap, even if you opt to buy a reconditioned model. You’ll be spending $299 for the slate, $129 for the stylus and $199 for the keyboard, so this might be one of those gifts that you’ll need to club together to buy.

With built-in Bluetooth, balanced TRS and unbalanced RCA inputs, you’ve got a wide variety of ways to get this jacked into whatever you’re doing.</p><p>Alongside, you’ll get an EM-USB Condenser microphone which connects to your computer over USB-C with on-board headphone headphone monitoring and gain control.

But I bet they, like me, are also that little bit too scared to just go out and buy one since they probably don’t know what they’d use it for. That’s why you, as loving people, should go and buy them a Dremel much in the same way that I hope my kids, when they’re old enough to earn money, go out and buy <em>me</em> a Dremel.

Not to mention the general health tracking capabilities, and the fact you can keep them healthy with a Fitness+ subscription thrown in.

Put it on and you’ll instantly feel like a rugged outdoors-type ready to indulge in some wood choppin’ or other Bear Grylls-adjacent nonsense. Withings is even smart enough to throw in a whole bunch of tools to help you size your band without needing to trek to a jewelry store. And that’s before I get to the 30-day battery life.</p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p></p><p>Look, if your dad is anything like me, then they’re probably not a massive gamer, or might just play the odd title. I’m told that there’s a whole genre of Dad Games out there that apparently appeal to the fathers in our lives, which are all about following some sort of process. It’s likely then that they won’t have paid much attention to <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series, which feels as un-Dad a game as you could imagine. Which is why I’m here to say that, until the start of this year, I felt the same, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-this-non-gamer-fell-in-love-with-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-123054845.html">I’ve since had my eyes opened to how amazing it really is</a>. Even better,  is that there’s a brand new title in the Zelda series, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MZWdlbmQtWmVsZGEtQnJlYXRoLVdpbGQtTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoL2RwL0IwOTdCMllXRlg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTBtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzYzc0YWNkMi00YWQ5LTRiYWUtYTRlMS04ZjExYTIwZTY4NmEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWAZYwjIpfYXqxE3MPqlWWG3xY3hLRaU8Iso2x3U4Rz6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLegend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB097B2YWFX"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, which I’d urge all of you to check out.</p><p>You play as Link, a little dude who – much like Mario – has to rescue a princess countless times throughout history. That normally involves traversing a beautiful, unspoiled paradise called Hyrule that’s scattered with all sorts of monsters who want to kill you. From the outside, you might think that it’s all just button-mashing and hyperactive combat, which is not a dad-friendly genre. But, in fact, the game puts far more emphasis on puzzle-solving and lateral thinking, and it has the best 3D puzzles this side of the <em>Portal</em> series which alone makes it ideal for dads the world over. Not to mention the freedom to tackle the game any which way you want to, giving you the choice to build your own solution rather than being forced to comply with Nintendo’s.</p><p>In the last game, <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, you could harness the game’s physics and chemistry engines to dispatch troublesome enemies by using the environment against them. For instance, you could freeze them and then give them a whack, building up the kinetic energy to such an extent that they’re sent hurtling miles away from you. Or, if you approach them in the middle of a storm, you can get them to raise their metallic swords in anger and get a dose of lightning. In this one, you can find scattered electronic components and assemble them however you want to jury-rig vehicles to help you get around. I mean, what could be more Dad-Game than that?</p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom OLED Switch</h2><p></p><p>And if you’re buying them <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, you might also want to get the console to go with it. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaW50ZW5kby1Td2l0Y2gtTW9kZWwtTGVnZW5kLVplbGRhLUtpbmdkb20vZHAvQjBCWks1TTlURC8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTBtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzYzc0YWNkMi00YWQ5LTRiYWUtYTRlMS04ZjExYTIwZTY4NmEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcbLNmBLEojmazYMKC-1pu9usobB-7J3Ht4D8e_xHL3O&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNintendo-Switch-Model-Legend-Zelda-Kingdom%2Fdp%2FB0BZK5M9TD%2F">Nintendo’s Switch OLED Edition</a> takes the same portable-home-console hybrid you know and love, and dials it up to 11. That includes a thinner bezel, better kickstand design and a nicer overall look and a feel that’s a little less kiddified than the standard model. If your dad’s a bit of an AV snob, too, then the deeper blacks, better color reproduction and clearer sound will also appeal.</p><p>Now, you can get the OLED Switch in the standard monochrome, which is fine but a little bland, so here I’ve recommended the specific Tears of the Kingdom edition. Not only do you get gold Joy Cons with a lovely white-and-green etching design, but you also get a white and gold TV dock. Even nicer is the concentric circle watermark on the underside, which looks significantly classier than the plain option. Especially if they’re going to play the game on the go, when they might want to let the world know that they appreciate the finer things in life.</p><h2>Audio Technica ATLP120XBT turntable</h2><p></p><p>There are a lot of Bluetooth turntables which are designed for the hip crowd who want to show off their ye olde-fashioned record player.

The fact it could be confused for a Technics SL-1210, right down to the s-shaped tone arm is, I’m sure,<em> just a total coincidence</em>.</p><p>The sound is good, and you’ll get adjustable pitch control alongside the belt-driven turntable (sorry, no scratching on this unit). And connectivity-wise, it’s well-stocked, with Dual RCA-out, USB or Bluetooth 5.0, with support for aptX. It’s a unit I’m thinking about getting for my mum, since it’ll enable her to digitize her stack of 78rpm records over that USB connection.</p><h2>LG C2 OLED TV</h2><p></p><p>LG’s C1 was one of the best TVs of 2021, and so you shouldn’t be surprised that its successor is even better. I could simply say “this is an LG OLED” and you could probably let its reputation walk you over to your TV store of choice. With a skinny body and almost non-existent bezels, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MRy1CdWlsdC1SZWZyZXNoLUFJLVBvd2VyZWQtT0xFRDQ4QzJQVUEvZHAvQjA5Uk1MTEpQWD90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEwbS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2M3NGFjZDItNGFkOS00YmFlLWE0ZTEtOGYxMWEyMGU2ODZhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcOiCYdXJfwbmTpHcRtMlco1cocbp6CHH2iOUJ0G1Auy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48C2PUA%2Fdp%2FB09RMLLJPX%3Fth%3D1">C2</a> is close to that perfect idea of a magic window for everything you’re watching, or playing.</p><p>But let’s drill down into the specifics: The C2 gets a faster processor which LG pledges will improve dynamic tone mapping, as well as improving webOS performance. Similarly, the screen’s brightness is a little higher than the C1, and contrast has been improved overall. LG’s focus this year was also on quality-of-life features beyond the picture quality, including an easier UI, new voice remote and the ability to add user profiles. Let’s also talk gaming, since if your beloved parent likes to play, you’ll find the C2 supports GeForce Now and, uh, Stadia.</p><p>(As an aside, the C2 is very much a luxury television for the sort of kids who really appreciate your parental figures. If your budget won’t stretch that far, you should look out for the C1 which is currently massively, <em>almost stupidly </em>discounted and still beats the pants off much of the TV market.)</p><h2>BenQ HT2050A projector</h2><p></p><p>Projectors are a minefield, aren’t they? It’s a big investment for something you might not be sure you’ll use on a very regular basis unless you’ve got your own cinema room. I’ve always fancied building something in my backyard so I can run an outdoor theater in the warmer months. But I don’t know how much I’d actually use the thing after spending a hefty chunk on the initial investment.</p><p>Thankfully, if I ever do, I’ll likely buy <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Ftem4udG8vM2Fsa1BETiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2M3NGFjZDItNGFkOS00YmFlLWE0ZTEtOGYxMWEyMGU2ODZhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeBESq5_sOAqXwMr7qAR9QBYcFFrjLCeI8LU70FCvPuE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3alkPDN">BenQ’s HT2050A</a>, which my colleague (and projector nerd) Steve Dent says is one of the best for performance and affordability. Coming in fairly cheap, it’s bright, has a 1.3x zoom and vertical lens shift, making it easy to place in tricky spots and easy to get the best picture quality out of its small body. It’s HD-only, of course, but then I’m not yet sold on the benefits of a 4K projector if you’re mostly watching live sports or old movies, or even your parent’s pictures of their most recent holiday.</p><h2>Breville Creatista Plus</h2><p></p><p>I suspect a lot of dads fall into the trap of having the ability to buy themselves nice things, but never actually go through with it. (I could easily buy myself a Dremel, for instance, but I still haven’t!) One thing they’ve probably thought about but not followed through on is to upgrade their coffee routine from whatever they bought before you were born. I myself was making at home lattes with instant coffee and a microwave for far longer than I’m prepared to admit. But I was wary about buying a bean-to-cup machine given that they can become a time-consuming hobby in and of themselves.</p><p>So, after plenty of research, I bought the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OZXNwcmVzc28tQ3JlYXRpc3RhLUVzcHJlc3NvLUJyZXZpbGxlLVN0YWlubGVzcy9kcC9CMDFMWVRQMlNHLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEwbS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2M3NGFjZDItNGFkOS00YmFlLWE0ZTEtOGYxMWEyMGU2ODZhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfLjitZcfeiSj2lIsARrkmmUYQo4wAI0PcwePE1FguSC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNespresso-Creatista-Espresso-Breville-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB01LYTP2SG%2F%3Fth%3D1">Creatista Plus</a>, a Nespresso-compatible machine that makes pretty decent coffee at home. As well as producing standard drinks, you can use the built in steam wand to prepare milk for something that’s close enough to barista-standard. Now, I’ll say that it is a lot pricier than some of the machines in its class, but I chose it as much for how it looked as what it did. Sure, there’s a built-in digital display that’ll give you fine-grain control over every fact of your coffee, but it also looks like a proper grown-up coffee machine.

It serves as a relatively short, and fairly gentle introduction to Fisher’s viewpoint on the culture at large, especially given what’s going on right now.</p><p>At 81 pages, it can hardly be called a weighty tome, and it lacks some of the florid language you often see from philosophy books. Fisher often draws parallels between his points and various pop culture milestones that most folks will be familiar with. A treatise on <em>Office Space’s</em> rules around pieces of flair dovetails into an exploration of how politicians focus on metrics for success will hide the diminished quality of whatever they’re trying to improve. References to lines of dialog from <em>Heat</em> become points to connect the destruction of community and the way mental health has become an individualized issue, rather than a societal one. And it might just help make your Thanksgiving dinner conversations a little more pleasant in future.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-fathers-day-gift-ideas-123012557.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: Industry leaders say AI presents 'risk of extinction' on par with nuclear war

<p>With the rise of AI language models and tools like ChatGPT and Bard, we've heard warnings from people involved, like Elon Musk, about the risks posed by AI. Now, a group of high-profile industry leaders has issued a one-sentence statement: “Mitigating the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-presents-risk-of-extinction-on-par-with-nuclear-war-industry-leaders-say-114025874.html">risk of extinction</a> from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.”</p><p>That’s… heavy. It was posted to the Center for AI Safety, an organization with the mission &quot;to reduce societal-scale risks from artificial intelligence,&quot; according to its website. Signatories include OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman and Google DeepMind head Demis Hassabis. Turing Award-winning researchers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, the godfathers of modern AI, also put their names to it. Hinton recently left Google over ethical concerns.</p><p>It’s not the first statement like this. In March, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and more than 1,000 others called for a six-month pause on AI to allow industry and the public to effectively catch up to the technology. &quot;Recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict or reliably control,&quot; the letter stated. No specific scenarios elaborate on how AI could threaten humanity, but there’s been more than enough science fiction to make me think of worst cases.

The main draw of these watches is that they ship with a bright and crisp AMOLED display, a design choice <a href="https://www.engadget.com/garmin-unveils-its-first-dedicated-running-watches-with-amoled-displays-120030944.html"><ins>Garmin has begun to fully embrace,</ins></a> providing a vivid picture without drawing too much battery life. There’s also a built-in flashlight with multiple intensities and a strobe mode, a red-only visual display option for darker conditions and plenty of advanced fitness features.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To that end, the Epix Pro series includes “dozens” of new, preloaded activities like soccer, basketball, horseback riding, racquet sports and plenty more. The fitness trackers now offer endurance scores and hill scores for advanced metrics. Runners and walkers will also receive notifications regarding points of interest along the route. There are new weather map overlays to view local environmental conditions and upgraded shading for making it easier to understand elevations within topographic maps. The Epix Pro line is available now and launches in three sizes (42mm, 47mm and 51mm.) Prices start at $900.</p><p>The Fenix 7 Pro series is for serious explorers, with solar charging, a powerful LED flashlight, mapping upgrades and a red safety light, all of which are intended to provide greater awareness when training in the dark, like a ninja. The heart rate sensor also got a significant boost, with new optical sensors and sport-specific algorithms that track your pulse rate across a diverse array of activities. There's no ECG app, however, so you'll have to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/garmin-ecg-app-smartwatch-120035781.html">look elsewhere if that's a primary concern. </a></p><p>The new endurance score feature measures how easy it is to engage in prolonged physical activities, combining V02 sensors, hill scores and previous training data. Just like the Epix Pro, the Fenix 7 boasts an updated mapping system with weather overlays, points of interest and improvements to topographic maps. There’s also new preloaded activities like whitewater rafting and motocross. The Fenix 7 Pro is available in multiple sizes and designs, starting at $800.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/garmin-reveals-high-end-smartwatches-for-explorers-with-deep-pockets-110022376.html?src=rss

## Google has officially stopped supporting the first-gen Chromecast

<p>It's officially the end of an era for the original Google Chromecast, with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-22-chromecast-first-gen-spotify-support.html">first-generation model</a> no longer receiving any updates or support, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/05/30/chromecast-no-updates/"><em>9to5Google reports</em></a>. Chromecast first came on the scene in 2013 as a key-sized device that promised to provide a Smart TV experience for $35, and it has done just that. Google has upgraded the initial Chromecast's hardware throughout the years to keep up with streaming denands but is now leaving it behind for good.</p><p>In a <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/7124014#zippy=%2Ccurrent-production-firmware-version">release on Chromecast's informational hub</a>, Google asserted that &quot;Support for Chromecast (1st gen) has ended, which means these devices no longer receive software or security updates, and Google does not provide technical support for them. Users may notice a degradation in performance.&quot; Google last updated Chromecast's support page back in April, meaning the announcement has gone unnoticed for some time now.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Through the lens of Google alone, a complete pull-back on the 10-year-old Chromecast original has been a long time coming. The company has only looked after the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-27-google-first-generation-chromecast.html">first-gen's bug and security issues</a> (rather than larger-scale updates) since 2019. The last update came in November 2022 and was the first in three years. Google has also released newer versions since the first-gen, like the cheaper $30 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-1080p-hdr-remote-130016962.html">Chromecast with Google TV (HD)</a> and the $50 4K model.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-24-google-chromecast-at-five.html">loyal first-gen Chromecast user</a>, the only thing to do now is to make sure it's fully upgraded and hope for the best.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-has-officially-stopped-supporting-the-first-gen-chromecast-095205330.html?src=rss

## Uber's One subscription swaps ride discounts for cashback rewards

<p>Uber <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-one-subscription-140045273.html">launched</a> its Uber One subscription service in 2021 with the promise of various perks like free deliveries, but the main benefit was a five percent discount on eligible rides. Now, the company is eliminating that in favor of six percent cashback (in the form of Uber Cash) to be used toward rides, Uber Eats and more, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/30/uber-drops-ride-discounts-for-subscribers-switches-to-cash-back/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> has reported. This despite the fact that Uber One doubled its subscriber base to 12 million last year with the discount marketed prominently on the app.</p><p>&quot;As Uber One is the best way to save across Uber and Uber Eats, we're making it even easier to use your benefits on Uber's full suite of products,&quot; Uber's consumer communications lead Becky Katz Davis told <em>TechCrunch</em>. In a letter to subscribers, the company suggested that consumers use their Uber Cash on fancier vehicles or Uber Eats orders.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The move appears to be a way to help Uber boost its ride count and margins. Uber One subscribers now make up 27 percent of total booking, and over 50 percent in some markets, the company said recently. In addition, the service is &quot;profitable,&quot; Khosrowshahi said in an earnings call earlier this year. &quot;And what we find is it’s a very, very effective way, essentially, to draw frequency and higher engagement with our customer base.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Uber One arrived effectively as a replacement for Uber Rewards, the company's airline-like rewards program that was dropped last summer. The shift from discounts to Uber Cash could be a risky play, though. Uber brags on its Uber One landing page that members &quot;save on average $27 per month with Uber One.&quot; Now, though, riders will need to do some calculations to see if the new system is worth the $10 per month or $100 annual subscription price.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ubers-one-subscription-swaps-ride-discounts-for-cashback-rewards-085948944.html?src=rss

## Logitech MX Anywhere 3S hands-on: A nearly ideal travel mouse

<p>Logitech already makes some of the best productivity peripherals around, but with a few key upgrades, the company may have just created an almost perfect travel mouse. And after using the new $80 MX Anywhere 3S for the last week and a half (including on a trip of my own), I’m not sure I want to use anything else ever again.</p><p>On the outside, the MX Anywhere 3S features the same basic design as its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-anywhere-3-mouse-price-specs-availability-070104068.html"><ins>predecessor</ins></a>, including a similar palette of color options (graphite, pale gray, and rose). The differences are on the inside, where the mouse features a new 8K DPI optical sensor that’s more accurate than before and works on practically any surface you can think of (wood, cloth, glass, et cetera). You also get a new set of super quiet mouse buttons similar to what you find on its larger sibling – the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-mechanical-hands-on-gamer-switches-meet-premium-productivity-070109417.html"><ins>MX Master 3S</ins></a> – which might not sound all that important, but it’s very a welcome feature for families where multiple people are studying/working from home. Finally, as part of Logitech’s efforts to increase the sustainability of its products, the MX Anywhere 3S is made from up to 78 percent post-consumer recycled plastic (though that figure is around 61 percent for the gray and pink models).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Priced at just $80 and with a battery life of up to 70 days, the Logitech MX Anywhere 3S might be the perfect travel mouse." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/4f4e6670-ff2e-11ed-afbf-a10d18e0092b" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engagdet</div></figure><p>Between its new features and the already fantastic foundation, the MX Anywhere 3S is simply a delight to use. Weighing just 95 grams, it's lighter than pretty much everything aside from a handful of gaming mice while boasting a rechargeable battery that lasts up to a whopping 70 days. You still get the ability to pair the mouse with up to three different devices (PCs, laptops, tablets and more), and thanks to a very travel-friendly ambidextrous design, it works great in tight situations. And while Logitech’s free-spinning MagSpeed mouse wheel isn’t new, scrolling actually feels a tiny bit smoother than before too.</p><p>The one big departure from previous MX Anywhere mice is that the 3S doesn’t come with a dongle. Instead, for this model (and likely going forward), Logitech is relying entirely on Bluetooth. One reason for this change is that Logitech believes modern Bluetooth connectivity has gotten good enough that a dedicated wireless receiver simply isn’t necessary, and after using this thing for more than 10 days, I get it. I haven’t had a single laggy mouse stroke or delayed reaction the entire time I’ve used it and even on Bluetooth you still get support for Logitech’s multi-device <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023188134-Logitech-Flow"><ins>Flow software</ins></a>. Besides, for frequent travelers, a dongle is just one more thing to keep track of (or lose entirely).</p><figure><img alt="The MX Keys S is a slightly refreshed version of its super slim desktop keyboard which now comes with more customization options for its backlight and an updated function row. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/0acb0850-ff2e-11ed-99cf-9f76bc9775cb" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, the main reason why the MX Anywhere 3S doesn’t come with a dongle is because Logitech’s Bolt receiver is still only available as a USB Type-A receiver, and with most new laptops these days only having USB-C, it doesn’t make a ton of sense to include something requires an adapter to use. Logitech says that because USB-C ports are so small, there isn’t enough room to fit the electronics without making the whole thing unusually bulky. Meanwhile with USB-A, Logitech is able to build tiny circuit boards that fit inside the connector itself. So while the company is still trying to figure out a solution, we’ll have to wait a little longer for a USB-C version of Logitech’s Bolt receiver. That said, while there are situations where having one would be useful, I haven’t missed having a physical dongle at all when using the MX Anywhere 3S.</p><figure><img alt="The new MX Keys S combo bundle includes the keyboard, and MX Master 3S mouse and the MX Wrist Rest for $200 -- $30 less than what everything would cost if purchased separately. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ce64d800-ff2d-11ed-b5cf-7fc73ddc1a1a" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Aside from its new mouse, today Logitech also has a couple of other refreshed devices. On the $110 MX Keys S, new features include more control over backlighting brightness and automatic activation settings, an updated function row with additional videoconferencing controls (and that always handy emoji key), and a fresh pale gray model to match the rest of the MX family. Alternatively, for people who need a new suite of office peripherals, Logitech has created a productivity bundle called the MX Keys S Combo which includes the MX Keys S, an MX Master 3S mouse and the MX Palm Rest – all in one box for $200. And while the MX Master 3S and the wrist wrest aren’t new, considering that those three devices would typically cost $230 if purchased separately, this bundle is a nice way to get a discount.</p><figure><img alt="Here's what the new Smart Actions tab look like in the Logi Options+ app. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/a92d6890-ff2d-11ed-be3f-24aaade0f29f" style="height: 1290px; width: 2286px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Lastly, while it’s been in beta for some time, today alongside the MX Keys S, Logitech’s <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9d8b417f-05d3-461d-8465-21e1a10e527d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Logitech&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5ZDhiNDE3Zi0wNWQzLTQ2MWQtODQ2NS0yMWUxYTEwZTUyN2QiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubG9naXRlY2guY29tL2VuLXVzL3NvZnR3YXJlL2xvZ2ktb3B0aW9ucy1wbHVzLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjkyZWRjZGUwLThhNDQtNDE3Yy1iZTUzLWY1NTY1OGUyOWNjYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVbXu5fhDPmK2UmMuKBHqroaFyfEGzuRImGtcnvZiJB9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware%2Flogi-options-plus.html"><ins>Smart Actions</ins></a> feature is finally getting an official release. Available inside the Logi Options+ app, Smart Actions is a neat tool for automating various repetitive tasks across multiple programs with a single keystroke. That means you can create a silence command that will do stuff like mute zoom, turn off your microphone and pause your favorite music app all with a single tap. By default, there are a number of basic templates you can browse, though they can also be customized as needed. And while I’m still testing out the limits of Smart Actions, so far my favorite way to use it has been creating what I call my “game time” command, which opens apps like Steam, Discord, Battle.net and more all with a single shortcut. And the nice thing is that if you don’t want to create your own Smart Actions, Logitech made them easy to share and import. So if you see someone else with a shortcut you like, you can just ask them to send it to you.</p><p>The MX Anywhere 3S, the MX Keys S and the MX Keys S Combo are all available today priced at $80, $110 and $200, respectively.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-anywhere-3s-hands-on-a-nearly-ideal-travel-mouse-specs-price-availability-070134836.html?src=rss

## Microsoft releases a temporary fix for Surface Pro X camera bug

<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-22h2#3108msgdesc">deployed</a> a critical troubleshooter update for Surface Pro X devices that will give users access to their camera again. On May 23rd, plenty of Surface Pro X owners <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-microsoft-surface-pro-x-bug-causes-camera-to-stop-working-220001254.html">reported</a> that their cameras had stopped working entirely.

The troubleshooter update will be automatically applied to affected devices, and owners can check if it has been installed by going to their "hardware and devices troubleshooter" history and then looking for an entry that says "[a]utomatically change system settings to fix a problem on your device."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/microsoft-drops-surface-pro-x-webcam-quality-to-get-broken-cameras-working-again/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> notes, users are reporting on the Microsoft support forum that the troubleshooter worked sufficiently, save for some posters saying that their cameras were working in slow motion outside of Teams or Zoom. Microsoft admitted in its announcement this workaround isn't perfect — it is, after all, only meant to be a temporary fix. It might "disable some features of the camera or lower the image quality," but it will make the camera functional until Microsoft comes up with a permanent fix. The tech giant is currently working with device manufacturers to release updated camera drivers expected to restore full camera functionality. It doesn't have an ETA for the driver rollout yet, but it promised to share more information when it becomes available.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-releases-a-temporary-fix-for-surface-pro-x-camera-bug-061524664.html?src=rss
