In May 2022, an 18-year-old walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and opened fire with two legally-purchased AR-style weapons, killing 19 children and two adults.

A year later, this documentary investigates lingering questions about why the tragedy happened, probes the police response, examines gun politics in Texas and explores how some of the Robb Elementary families have navigated their transformed lives. The documentary also examines Uvalde’s history of struggle and its efforts to heal.
