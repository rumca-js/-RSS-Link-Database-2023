<p>Sevilla’s empire just will not fall, not even to the Romans. After three long, exhausting hours, the match that seemed to never end, just like their extraordinary dominance of this competition, came down to a single kick. Or so it seemed: instead, at midnight in Budapest it came down to two of them. Gonzalo Montiel, the man who scored the penalty that won his country the World Cup was entrusted with taking the penalty that would win his club their seventh, yes seventh, Europa League. This time he did not score, his shot saved by Roma’s Rui Patrício.</p><p>But Anthony Taylor, the referee who had given and taken away a penalty for Sevilla during the actual game, which had lasted 147 minutes, was advised by the VAR of an encroachment. And so he gave Montiel another chance, and this time the Argentinian found the net, supporters stream down the stands and onto the pitch. At long last, it was all over. At times it had felt like this would never, ever end. But it did, and with history made once more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/31/sevilla-roma-europa-league-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The director of This is England’s take on a novel about an 18th-century counterfeiting gang is funny, moving, shocking and totally compelling. He has effortlessly reinvented a whole genre</p><p>Benjamin Myers’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/25/the-gallows-pole-benjamin-myers-review">2017 novel The Gallows Pole</a> told the true-life tale of the 18th-century gang of coin clippers led by “King” David Hartley, whose illegal work and attendant violence came to dominate Cragg Vale in West Yorkshire. It had formerly been the home of a thriving cottage textiles industry, but the advent of the industrial revolution and the rise of nearby Halifax as the centre for all that trade had left surrounding towns and villages concomitantly impoverished. In Myers’ hands, it is a powerful story of desperation, class warfare and the ability of money to corrupt – or further corrupt – anyone it touches. Though it must be said that it is so unrelentingly grim and humourless that at times you do feel you are moments away from hearing the voice of Jim Broadbent as the pretentious playwright in Victoria Wood’s Staying In crying “The north! My north!”.</p><p>Shane Meadows’s take on the tale keeps all the energy, density and fortitude of the book, but adds the missing humour (and women – Myers’ book is, quite legitimately but noticeably, all about the men) to give it light and shade. Though it retains the strange “stag men”, who roam the moors appearing to people on the edge of consciousness or death, it moves the main figures back to a more ordinary humanity, from Myers’ bordering-on-folkloric space.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/31/the-gallows-pole-review-shane-meadowss-period-drama-is-an-absolute-must-see">Continue reading...</a>

Then one day he revealed all</p><p>When modern and ancient collide, you expect a discordant note to be struck. But on Sunday, I went to a place where the ages were in harmony. For many a spring, during the all-too-short asparagus season, my dad has disappeared into the Worcestershire countryside and returned bearing bunches of the finest spears. For a man who hardly ever does any shopping, or indeed ventures out much at all, this is odd. “I have a supplier,” he’ll say, offering no further explanation.</p><p>I had long wanted to get to the bottom of this mysterious business, but then the season would finish and I would forget about it for another year. Not this year. Almost grudgingly, he showed me the way to his source: a drive-thru asparagus store. There’s a first time for everything. Love it. How John Constable would paint this rural scene, or Thomas Hardy describe it, or Edward Elgar set it to music, I cannot imagine. But I was enchanted.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/31/psst-want-to-buy-some-top-grade-asparagus-my-dad-has-the-secret">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘This is from my Fake Holidays series, taken at the Kremlin Palace hotel in Turkey. I found an entertainer dressed as Superman and asked him to pose by the pool. You’d end up in prison if you did this in the real Red Square’</p><p>This photo is part of my Fake Holidays series. At the beginning of the project, more than 15 years ago, I went to Lara Beach in Antalya, Turkey, where there is one luxury five-star hotel after another, all along the coastline. On the other side of the road were the tents of the workers who had built the hotels. Luxury hotels are like little ghettoes. You take your plane and your taxi, then you are in the middle of an isolated luxury area.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kremlinpalace.com.tr/">Kremlin Palace hotel</a>, where this photo was taken, has an exact copy of Saint Basil’s Cathedral in Red Square, Moscow. I have been to Moscow and seen the original church, which is a focal point – all tourists take a picture there. But here in Turkey, there is a swimming pool in front of the cathedral. I was fascinated. There were many Russian tourists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/31/superman-kremlin-russian-red-square-reiner-riedlers-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

## The Moscow drone attacks bring Russia’s war to its doorstep – and put Putin’s alternative reality at risk | Jade McGlynn

The Kremlin has blamed Ukraine, although Kyiv <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-drones-ukraine-denies-involvement-podolyak/32294495.html">has denied any involvement</a> in the attacks – the first of this scale on Russian soil since it invaded Ukraine 15 months ago.</p><p>Russian media reports originally suggested as many as 30 drones targeted the city, and videos of (apparent) direct hits on buildings went viral. But soon Kremlin officials reclaimed the narrative. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin <a href="https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/17875641">claimed only eight drones</a> had participated in the attack, and insisted any damage to buildings was caused by debris after they were shot down. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu, buoyed up by support from politicians and president Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, tried to distract from the embarrassment, citing the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed by Russian forces, and the Nato equipment Russia has purportedly destroyed.</p><p>Dr Jade McGlynn is a research fellow at King’s College London and the author of <a href="">Russia’s War</a> and <a href="">Memory Makers: The Politics of the Past in Putin’s Russia</a></p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>If the guests aren’t complaining, they’re wandering around naked</p><p>I have worked in my family’s hotel for almost all of my life. It’s seasonal, as in any coastal town. I started out washing up and prepping in the kitchens on Friday nights and in the school holidays, moved into the restaurant as a waiter, then on to front of house and finally into management. As with any smaller business, there is really no such thing as “I’m a chef” or “I’m a housekeeper”; everyone mucks in.</p><p>We once had a team of senior cricket players who came back a little worse for wear after hitting the local cider. I don’t know if they had lost or won, but one guy locked himself out of his room naked and made his way down to the bar looking for the toilet. That has happened multiple times with people who come home drunk from weddings – my mum once had to climb through a window to help a lady who had got stuck, naked, in the bath for about five hours. We have also found a female guest wearing a long skirt pleasuring herself on the patio, fully embracing her audience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/31/people-throw-tantrums-and-try-to-get-things-for-free-my-life-as-a-hotelier-in-badly-behaved-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Soho theatre, London<br /></strong>The Irish drag queen and activist, AKA Rory O’Neill, feelingly recounts her journey in a country long hostile to difference</p><p>What am I <em>for</em> any more? That’s the question the “Queen of Ireland”, Panti Bliss, asks in this latest solo show, which contrasts the country she grew up in, where performing in drag was a radical act, to the queer-friendly nation of recent years. With all she fought for secured, and with cross-dressing now “defanged and Instagrammed” to within an inch of its sequined life, “Why the fuck,” asks Panti – AKA Rory O’Neill – “am I still in drag?”</p><p>There are moments in If These Wigs Could Talk when audiences may find themselves asking the same question. Few drag expectations are met here. There’s no music, no song – and if Panti is camp, it’s more solitary tent than a whole row. There’s comedy, at a stretch, in the form of a choice one-liner about LinkedIn and two anecdotes distinguished less by comical incident than storytelling flair. Panti makes them entertaining, but must work to do so, selling the one about a substitute boyfriend as more outrageous than it is and ramping up the embarrassment – in the one about smuggling a dildo through security – to off-brand levels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/31/panti-bliss-review-soho-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Opera Holland Park, London</strong><br />In an engaging but problematic staging, the Duke’s court is relocated to interwar Oxford, with Alison Langer’s beautifully sung Gilda a standout</p><p>A lot happens before anyone sings a note in <a href="https://operahollandpark.com/">Opera Holland Park</a>’s season-opening production of Rigoletto. Bicycles, bells and birdsong set the scene, then a man working quietly at a desk is grabbed by a smartly dressed gang and half drowned. Are we watching a murder? His assailants let him go, laugh as he shakes with fear, and throw him a towel. It’s an initiation rite. The fear that runs through Verdi’s opera is immediately evoked; the life-or-death high stakes, not so much.</p><p>This new production is directed by <a href="https://operahollandpark.com/">Cecilia Stinton</a> and conducted by <a href="https://www.lee-reynolds.com/">Lee Reynolds</a>, who together brought Holland Park audiences<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/06/carmen-review-opera-holland-park-cecilia-stinton-kezia-bienek"> a refreshingly unhackneyed, quietly feminist Carmen</a> last year. The corrupt and licentious ducal court in Renaissance Mantua has been transferred to Oxford in the Charleston era, with the party music that Verdi wrote for a small onstage group of players turned into a scratchy old gramophone recording of a 1920s-style dance band, a detail that Reynolds makes work surprisingly convincingly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/31/rigoletto-review-opera-holland-park-london-cecilia-stinton-alison-langer">Continue reading...</a>

As insiders know, Clause 3.4 of the Gay Agenda stipulates that during the month of June homosexuals of the world must unite to brainwash the masses and convert innocent heterosexuals to our dastardly ways.</p><p>For the last few years corporations have happily gone along with all this. They’ve made a big song and dance about how they value things like inclusivity and diversity and human rights<em>. </em>They’ve spoken about how important kindness<em> </em>is. They’ve kowtowed to LGBTQ+ people who have made unreasonable demands that they be treated like people. They’ve talked about dangerous things like respect and acceptance.</p><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/31/conservatives-bullying-pro-lgbtq-companies-pride-month">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The brilliance of the kaleidoscopic, animated Spider-Verse erupts again in this multidimensional film about a teen superhero with exasperated parents</p><p>In 2018, writers Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman gave us a delirious and utterly unexpected new web-spin on the infinite self-replication of Marvel Comics IP and its most reliable hero, Spider-Man. Instead of yet another MCU live action version, directed and produced in that hard, depthless CGI light, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/28/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review-a-dazzling-animated-caper">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a> was a brilliantly inventive animated fantasia about the Spidey mythology, riffing on movies and comic books. The Spider-Verse was a cosmos in which different Spider-folk existed in parallel: a multiverse at least as interesting as that of Dr Strange, and more interesting than the solemn awards-prestige of Everything Everywhere All at Once. Everyone who saw it wondered how this kaleidoscopic new take could be applied elsewhere: James Bond: Across the James-Bond-Verse or Bilbo Baggins: Beyond the Bilbo-Baggins-Verse.</p><p>Now we have a sequel subtitled Across the Spider-Verse – could it be that they wanted a certain Beatles track and Apple wouldn’t let them? – with a threequel (Beyond the Spider-Verse) in the pipeline. This second instalment features a plethora of Spideys and the result is as crazily frantic and eyeball-frazzling as ever, but with something exhausting about it now. Its funny jokes – including a gag about the “Spider-Men pointing at each other” meme – and poignant touches get obscured in the endless maelstrom. But there’s no doubting the full-tilt energy, the pure blizzard of narrative data and the twists and turns that it would be unsporting to reveal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/31/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review">Continue reading...</a>

He is joined at the front of the stage by saxophonist Jake Clemons, the nephew of Springsteen’s late stage foil Clarence Clemons. Jake stares at Springsteen’s fingers, apparently gawping in amazement at the dexterity of his playing. Then he closes his eyes and rests his head on Springsteen’s shoulder as he continues playing.</p><p>It’s a small moment that seems to sum up the continued appeal of Springsteen when in the company of his most celebrated backing band. It’s simultaneously hokey – could it be rehearsed? – and, with its echo of the pose struck by Springsteen and Jake’s uncle on the cover of 1975’s Born to Run, oddly moving.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/31/bruce-springsteen-review-murrayfield-stadium-edinburgh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While the Tories’ dire record on green issues gets worse by the day, Keir Starmer’s pledges show an impressive commitment</p><p>It’s been a long time coming, but at last it seems that voters who give a damn about the climate emergency will have a real choice at the next general election.

## The Shape of Things review – seductive sociopaths show cruel intent

<p><strong>Park theatre, London<br /></strong>The tension is raised in Neil LaBute’s dark comedy as entitled Evelyn sets about remoulding unworldly Adam from geek to good-looking boyfriend</p><p>To those uninitiated with Neil LaBute’s theatre of cruelty, the opening could pass for a meet-cute: cool art student Evelyn (Amber Anderson) chats up bookish nerd Adam (Luke Newton), telling him she finds him attractive in the same breath as saying that she doesn’t like his hair. But Evelyn’s words are a warning sign as she sets about chillingly remoulding Adam from geek to good-looking boyfriend – from his clothes to nails and a nose job.<br /><br />LaBute’s 2001 dark comedy was written for the stage before being adapted into the better-known film starring Rachel Weisz and Paul Rudd, and Nicky Allpress’s slick production reminds us of its innate theatricality.<br /><br />The dialogue still sounds fast, fresh and funny, the cast catching its beats, although the savagery in the script never fully bares its teeth. The tension is better raised in matters of friendship and betrayal when Adam’s friends Phil (Majid Mehdizadeh-Valoujerdy) and Jenny (Carla Harrison-Hodge) enter the fray but some of the manipulations between Evelyn and Adam feel softened.</p><p>Still it retains LaBute’s cruel intent at its heart: Evelyn is a dead-eyed amoralist and Anderson, a screen actor making her stage debut, brings a brattish sense of entitlement. Adam is endearingly unworldly at the start, his physical transformation more subtle than Rudd’s but no less convincing. He is not the same teary victim as Christine from In the Company of Men, coming back with anger at Evelyn, which undercuts her cruelty but makes their dynamic more believable.<br /><br />The play’s big psychological reveal – that Adam changes on the inside as he becomes more superficially attractive – is hardly deeply mined insight. It works better as an analogy to the compromises that couples make for each other, especially in controlling relationships.<br /><br />The production comes with period elements intact from 90s music (Air, the Chemical Brothers) to cultural references (Women’s lib, American Gigolo), and Peter Butler’s set is made up of suitably soulless blank white lines with occasional neon and light showers.<br /><br />If it loses some of the intimacies of film, it shows these characters up close, literally: scenes take place front of stage so the characters’ faces are in ours, some sitting among us so we can study their expressions as Evelyn reveals her dark denouement. The ending lands with a soft punch but still leaves us dwelling on LaBute’s seductive sociopaths, and what, exactly, makes them tick.</p><p>At <a href="https://parktheatre.co.uk/whats-on/the-shape-of-things">Park theatre, London</a>, until 1 July.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/31/the-shape-of-things-review-park-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Austria, France, Germany, Sweden and now Spain – the firewall between the mainstream and the far right is crumbling</p><p>Normalisation is the process by which something unusual or extreme becomes part of the everyday.

But the normalisation of the far right is happening across the democratic world.</p><p>Once Trump became “normal”, events that seemed even more extreme did too.

<p>Exclusive: in the first of his series of Guardian columns, Arsenal’s head coach runs the rule over two clubs he has met in the last two seasons</p><p>The narrative of the last three Champions League finals has been similar, with one team really coming out, dominating and profiting from their goalscoring opportunities early on. It is the chance to get momentum and give the opponents a game they maybe hadn’t prepared for. In last year’s final, Barcelona were on the receiving end of a fast start from Lyon. In Saturday’s final, between Barcelona and Wolfsburg, we will likely see both teams attempt to start aggressively.</p><p>Jonatan Giráldez’s Barcelona will want to keep the ball, in keeping with their style, but they also press aggressively and will try to pen Wolfsburg back into their half. Wolfsburg, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/01/arsenal-wolfsburg-womens-champions-league-match-report">knocked out my team</a>, Arsenal, in the semi-finals, will do the opposite. They don’t like building and will try to frame the game around counterattacking moments and profit from those. If they lose the ball deep, they’re going to be very aggressive in their defensive man-marking and counterpressing to try to win it back. I imagine the first 15 minutes may be very, very intense.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/31/womens-champions-league-final-barcelona-wolfsburg-jonas-eidevall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Science, memoir, fiction and poetry all point us towards the urgent truth that humans and nature are part of each other – and under threat</p><p>As humans, we are part of the natural world, a stitch in the rich tapestry that is global biodiversity. Yet so often, and at an increasing rate that couples with biodiversity loss, we see ourselves as something separate from nature. The pace of our lives has increased beyond sustainability, and the impact of our existence is out of balance. Exploring our connection with the natural world has never been more vital, especially in the UK, which now stands as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/10/nearly-half-of-britains-biodiversity-has-gone-since-industrial-revolution">one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world</a>. Plans to restore nature are weighed on cost, both financial and the perceived inconvenience to human life. But a healthy healthy human life requires a healthy natural world.</p><p>I am drawn to literature that cements humans as a part of nature and stories than use the natural world to anchor our lived experiences, to explore what it means to be human, to help to understand ourselves as a part of the ecosystem. In my own writing, I explore my changing relationship with the sea, how nature has both hurt and healed my body and mind, and how wild creatures have provided waypoints along a physical and emotional navigation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/31/top-10-books-about-connecting-with-nature-hannah-stowe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Not everyone finds it easy to listen to the Smiths now, but those early transmissions were utterly formative for this vital new band and their enraptured fans</p><p>It’s 40 years this month since anyone bar the attenders at their handful of gigs heard the Smiths. On 13 May 1983, they released their first single, Hand in Glove, on Rough Trade. Then, on 31 May, John Peel broadcast their first session for his BBC Radio 1 show. Before the year was out, they would have recorded one more for him, as well as two for David Jensen. A total of 14 songs were broadcast, all being heard for the first time, apart from a new version of Handsome Devil, the B-side to Hand in Glove.</p><p>The Smiths’ radio sessions were as astounding a rush of real-time creativity as pop has witnessed. When they released their first album the following year, only two of its 10 tracks had not previously been recorded for Radio 1. It was those sessions that built up their following so rapidly and so rabidly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/31/the-glory-of-it-was-real-40-years-of-the-smiths-peel-sessions">Continue reading...</a>

Almost every critical reaction seemed to contain the same sentence: “I’ve been playing for 60 hours yet I’ve barely scratched the surface”. Like Breath of the Wild before it, the latest title in Nintendo’s role-playing adventure seriesis a vast odyssey with an intricate narrative constructed from dozens of quests, supported by a fully functioning world. Like many other gamers my age, I thought to myself, that would have been great when I was 25, but I’ll get an hour a day on this thing at most. Is it all too much?</p><p>About 10 hours into the main campaign – which, as ever, revolves around a quest to track down the eponymous royal but somehow also manages to be mind-numbingly complex, like Middlemarch with monsters – something important happened: I let go. Without a deadline to finish it (thanks Keza, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-pure-magic">for taking on the review</a>), I could just enjoy it in my own way. For several years, I’ve been writing about how experiences such as Fortnite and Minecraft are no longer games to play but places to be (hang out with friends, build some stuff, whatever), and I was finally able to apply this sense of freedom to a big role-playing game. I decided I was never going to finish Tears of the Kingdom, and that was such an immense relief. Now I could have fun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/31/pushing-buttons-tears-of-the-kingdom-hyrule-map">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tony Tulathimutte’s writing workshop, Crit, reels in eminent guest speakers and helps launch the careers of new authors </p><p>The list of past guest speakers at Crit, the writing workshop that author Tony Tulathimutte runs out of his Brooklyn apartment, reads like a veritable who’s who of 21st-century literary greats. Jonathan Franzen, Hua Hsu and Carmen Maria Machado have all popped by as guests at the eight-week course. And while Tulathimutte describes himself as “literally just some guy” on his <a href="https://www.tonytula.com/">website</a>, he’s won an O Henry award, and former students like Beth Morgan and Rax King have gone on to earn lucrative book deals and win highly <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcoKaye/status/1168911582455390211?s=20">prestigious</a> prizes.</p><p>Tulathimutte, 39, founded Crit in 2017 after winning the Whiting award for his first novel, Private Citizens<em>. </em>While he had previously taught courses at Sarah Lawrence College and the University of Massachusetts, and led workshops for indie companies like Sackett Street Writers, these gigs came and went. Running his own school seemed like a more sustainable way to make a living while maintaining his career as an author (Tulathimutte <a href="https://twitter.com/tonytula/status/1630357577702813703">announced</a> the sale of his second novel, Rejection, earlier this year). According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/writers-and-authors.htm">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, writers and authors earn on average $69,510 a year, while an alarming <a href="https://authorsguild.org/news/authors-guild-survey-shows-drastic-42-percent-decline-in-authors-earnings-in-last-decade/">Authors Guild survey</a> showed that its members drew a median income of $6,080 in 2017, down 42% from 2009. “I figured if I could get enough applications coming in, running my own class would be more stable [than waiting for invitations],” Tulathimutte said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/31/the-side-hustle-that-keeps-a-literary-authors-career-afloat">Continue reading...</a>

She finds one of her parishioners, Brian Salmon, in a state of undress with a 15-year-old local boy, David Leaves.

Still she must report them. “Never had doing the right thing felt so wrong.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-arditti">Michael Arditti</a>’s latest novel explores the timeless difficulty of doing the right thing.

## An Uneasy Inheritance by Polly Toynbee review – living up to high ideals

<p>What happens when good intentions meet good fortune? Politics melds with personal drama in this candid family history</p><p>Another title for this enthralling family memoir might be the “would-be-goods”. The phrase was coined by E Nesbit of Railway Children fame, who was also a co-founder of the Fabian Society, but it perfectly encapsulates the middle-class liberal-left tradition that Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee can trace back through her family for generations. As well as her parents and grandparents there are cousins and great-aunts, all educated, clever, public service-oriented men and women anguishing over a set of subjects that have only become more urgent in recent years: low pay, environmental harm, colonial appropriation and, most pertinently here, the way that social stagnation props up the political status quo.</p><p>This makes Toynbee singular and perhaps Toynbees plural sound smug, but nothing could be further from the truth. In her laceratingly honest and often funny book she illustrates how “to live on the left side is to live with inevitable hypocrisy and painful self-awareness, with good intentions forever destined to fall short of ideals, social concern never enough”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/31/an-uneasy-inheritance-by-polly-toynbee-review-living-up-to-high-ideals">Continue reading...</a>

She wasn’t just heartbroken, but despondent about her career. “The first album we made together,” 2018’s Cosmic Wink, “was the one where I got a record deal and things started really happening.

<p>A brilliantly funny, deeply sad portrait of an Irish family in crisis from the author of Skippy Dies</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/paul-murray">Paul Murray</a>’s second book, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/06/skippy-dies-paul-murray" title="">Skippy Dies</a>, was one of the standout novels of the previous decade: a riotously entertaining tragicomedy, set in a posh Dublin boys’ school, in which bone-deep sorrow and pathos cut through the teenage hilarity and fart jokes. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/22/the-mark-and-the-void-by-paul-murray-review">The Mark and the Void</a>, 2015’s tricksy satire of both the banking crash and the difficult novel-writing business, strayed into metatextual noodling, but with The Bee Sting, Murray is triumphantly back on home turf – troubled adolescents, regretful adults, secrets signposted and exquisitely revealed, each line soaked in irony ranging from the gentle to the savage.</p><p>Clocking in at more than 600 pages, it is the story of a well-to-do Irish family in financial, emotional and existential trouble: Dickie Barnes, who has taken over his father’s car showroom; his wife Imelda, a local beauty; daughter Cassie, preparing for university; and 12-year-old son PJ. The after-effects of the financial crash have crippled the motor business, and now that the money and the good times have run out Dickie hides away in local woods, building a shelter against the collapse of civilisation while Imelda furiously eBays their possessions. Cassie fears for her future; PJ fears divorce. We see the same few months through the eyes of each in turn, during floods and drought, as slow‑building ecological disaster parallels the family’s own unfolding apocalypse. (The climate crisis, Murray understands, puts a bitter twist on the pathetic fallacy.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/31/the-bee-sting-by-paul-murray-review-a-tragicomic-triumph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Callie Khouri’s feminist crime classic is a masterclass in narrative and character development and director Ridley Scott delivers pure action brio</p><p>Screenwriter Callie Khouri’s desperada road-movie thriller Thelma &amp; Louise is the classic whose Bechdel test credentials go all the way up to the title. Just over 30 years later, it looks punchier, bolder, hotter and sweatier than ever. This is a masterclass in narrative construction and character development and director Ridley Scott puts his pedal to the metal with pure action brio; I always particularly love the shot where the camera lovingly counter-swooshes back along the flank of the Thunderbird while it barrels down the highway, for the pure hell of it. It is a feminist crime classic in the tradition of Gun Crazy and Bonnie and Clyde, whose two heroines, played by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, get the Polaroid camera out for the most famous selfie in film history. And that ending – although arguably a concession to the idea of crime not being allowed to pay – still has the power to stun.</p><p>The film is the story of two friends. Louise Sawyer (Sarandon) is a worldly wise woman waiting tables in a diner in Arkansas, whose supposed boyfriend, Jimmy (Michael Madsen) never seems to be around. Louise’s younger best friend is housewife Thelma Dickinson, a role in which Davis gave a wonderfully sweet-natured, innocent, vulnerable performance; it briefly made her an A-list star and we should have a twinge of regret thinking about the roles Davis should have been offered after this. Thelma is being bullied and cheated on by her boorish husband Darryl (Christopher McDonald) and longs for some escape. Then Louise offers her a special girls-only weekend break in a fishing cabin she’s managed to borrow – just the two of them, taking off for some fun in Louise’s sleek T-Bird.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/31/thelma-and-louise-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is no surprise many of us have struggled to reconnect with the world, post-pandemic. But by being thoughtful about friendships, valuing weak ties and accepting invitations, positive change is possible</p><p>It’s hard for me to pinpoint the moment during the pandemic where I felt as if something in me had changed, maybe for good. But I think it was on my birthday, so that would have been in July 2020. This particular birthday fell at a time when you couldn’t really see people, but the shops were open. This was the time of banana bread recipes, the 2-metre rule and Thank You Baked Potato.</p><p>Anyway, I went especially to a balloon shop, all masked-up and ready for battle, and bought a load of massive helium balloons shaped like drinks, thinking: “I will not be defeated by this joyless apocalypse.” And yet, on this birthday, the inflated margaritas brought no joy whatsoever. They just hung in the air, accusingly. Party balloons for a nonexistent party. I felt stupid and desperate. I knew this wasn’t depression, anxiety or long Covid. It was my confidence. It had deserted me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/31/my-covid-confidence-crisis-how-to-regain-your-sense-of-self-health-and-happiness">Continue reading...</a>
