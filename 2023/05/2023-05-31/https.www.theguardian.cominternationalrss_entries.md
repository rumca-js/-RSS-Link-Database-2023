<p>Brooke Kroeger’s eye-opening new book looks back at the many women in journalism who fought to have their voices heard in a male-dominated industry</p><p>“Getting the cold call email from him was crazy,” said author and journalist Brooke Kroeger, telling me about how her latest project, Undaunted – which recounts the two-century-long story of women in journalism – originated with a phone call from a male editor. “I had some idea of who he was, I was aware of him. I knew he was senior, and I looked him up pretty quick.”</p><p>The man in question was Jonathan Segal, a vice-president at Knopf who has published seven books that went on to receive Pulitzer prizes. He was offering Kroeger the assignment of a lifetime. Segal had determined that there was no good trade book available covering the history of women in journalism in the United States, and he was hoping Kroeger would be willing to write it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/31/undaunted-brooke-kroeger-book-women-journalism">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Always be in the ballgame’: how bench players can tilt the NBA finals

<p>For all the talk around Nikola Jokić and Jimmy Butler ahead of the NBA finals, history shows reserves like Denver’s Bruce Brown and Miami’s Duncan Robinson could be the difference</p><p>Before the 1982 NBA finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, Earl Cureton had no idea when he might play in the series. But instead of focusing on what he didn’t know, the backup forward-center for the Julius Erving-led Philadelphia 76ers focused on what he could. Stay ready, observe the game. Don’t lose sight of how to help, even in small doses. It doesn’t matter that you’re a reserve on the sidelines, Cureton told himself. Still, the experience was jarring; his first time in the league’s final series. The playoffs are a different animal compared to the regular season and the NBA finals are even more pressurized. Though this all swirled in Cureton’s mind some 40 years ago, the task remains the same for players today. Indeed, in this year’s NBA finals, players like Denver’s Bruce Brown Jr and Miami’s Duncan Robinson will undertake crucial roles coming off the bench for their squads. But what exactly does it take to excel as a backup in the league – especially in June?</p><p>“Your mental focus is the most important thing you have to sharpen when it comes to the playoffs,” Cureton tells the Guardian. “With my situation [in Philly], I never knew when I was going in. And you never know what’s going to happen – foul trouble, injuries. You have to prepare yourself like you’re going to be out there every single game.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/31/nba-finals-backups-bruce-brown-duncan-robinson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former Spain and Real Madrid manager loves fine food and playing the piano but couldn’t resist the challenge of taking over at Molineux with the club bottom of the Premier League</p><p>The Basque Country is the place countless elite coaches call home, among them Unai Emery, Mikel Arteta, Andoni Iraola and Xabi Alonso. But the Spanish region, in the western Pyrenees close to the French border, is famed for something else as Julen Lopetegui, another of those with roots there, can vouch. “More Michelin stars per square kilometre than anywhere else in the world,” the Wolves manager says. “So we have a lot! And I know all of them. One of them went to school with me, Martín Berasategui; he has 12 Michelin stars. He was my friend at school.”</p><p>It explains Lopetegui’s interest in hospitality. Growing up, he helped his parents at their restaurant in Asteasu, and he co-owns Asador Imanol, a restaurant in Madrid. As he reflects on those early days in the family business, one sitting, when all the covers were taken, sticks in the memory. “A friend of mine came [in] with a ball,” he says. “My job was to attend the flames on the grill – that was my only job. So my father told me to watch 25 one-kilo steaks … big steaks! So I’m looking after the fire and saying: ‘It will be OK. For a few seconds, I’ll play football.’ But it was more like 10 minutes and the steaks all caught on fire! My father comes and they are all on fire. It was the equivalent of one week’s wages … all gone! It was my fault. Can you imagine?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/31/julen-lopetegui-when-i-came-to-wolves-a-lot-of-friends-asked-me-why">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Striker who won Champions League in 2021 and Conference League last season is aiming for glory in Europa League final</p><p>Give it a couple of days and Roma’s fans may change their tune. Well, not the tune exactly, but the temptation could be to tweak the words a little. In the <em>Curva Sud</em> at the Stadio Olimpico where they watched, enamoured, as Tammy Abraham belted out the club’s anthem and belted in the goals, they long since took to calling him <em>Tre Punti Tammy</em>, Tammy Three Points. Come back from Budapest with that 15kg hunk of silver and it could be time to call him Tammy Three Cups.</p><p>After all, the England striker says: “It is the only one left not in my cabinet.” Winner of the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/roma-feyenoord-europa-conference-league-final-match-report">the Europa Conference League in 2022</a>, victory against Sevilla in the final of the Europa League in Hungary on Wednesday would complete a unique collection, all three continental competitions clinched and consecutively. <em>Tammy Tre Tituli</em> has a nice ring to it, echoes of José Mourinho’s famous “<em>zero tituli</em>” line, uttered more than a decade ago and repeated ever since, slipping into Italy’s footballing lexicon, his use of a <em>u</em> where there should be an <em>o</em> making it more memorable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/31/tammy-abraham-roma-europa-league-final-three-cups-farewell">Continue reading...</a>
