The Fenix 7 Pro series starts at $799.99, while the Epix 2 Pro will start at $899.99. </p>\n<p id=\"tKgstf\">There\u2019s good news if you wanted an Epix 2 last year but were bummed that it only came in one size. Garmin doesn\u2019t believe that less is more, so you can also now pick between three sizes of Epix 2 models: 42mm, 47mm, and 51mm. Both Pro lineups also offer a more durable Sapphire Edition. </p>\n<p id=\"s1u6xR\">The vast majority of what\u2019s new will be shared across both the Epix 2 Pro and Fenix 7 Pro lineups.
