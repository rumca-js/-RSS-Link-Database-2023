Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at Star Citizen after all these years. From a game that recieved a couple million on Kickstarter, it's raised over half a billion with the most ambitious game idea that has yet to be realized to even 10% of the vision Chris Roberts and Cloud Imperium Games has set. This game and it's troubled development has led me to abandon this game and hoping to return when it finally drops what was initially advertised. Thanks for watching!
