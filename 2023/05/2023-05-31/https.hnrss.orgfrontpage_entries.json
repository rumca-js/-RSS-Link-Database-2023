Chine and Lindsey here from Onu (<a href=\"https://joinonu.com\">https://joinonu.com</a>). Onu lets you write scripts and turn them into internal tools suitable for use by non-technical teammates. We built Onu to help you spend more time coding and less time running scripts for ops or customer support. Unlike no-code/low-code products, we\u2019re code-first and let you use your preferred tools. We take care of the annoying parts for you: most importantly the frontend, but also auditing, permissions, and 3rd party integrations (e.g. Slack, email, Jira, Pagerduty).<p>We\u2019ve put up a few sample screenshots at <a href=\"https://joinonu.com/examples\">https://joinonu.com/examples</a>, and a demo video here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XMnBRsktsw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XMnBRsktsw</a>.<p>Many engineers lose hours a week fielding requests from other teams. While most companies have a home-grown internal dashboard (or are using a third party tool builder for this such as Retool), there is still a long tail of scripts that engineers have to run regularly for their ops and CX teammates, either locally or by SSHing into prod. Maybe a user\u2019s account got stuck in a weird state, or you have a script to manually onboard new customers to your B2B product, or you have to run a custom provisioning script each time you add a bike to your e-bike fleet (something we experienced at Lyft).<p>We experienced these problems while working on engineering teams at Lyft and Stripe. Our teams needed internal tooling, but we didn\u2019t have time to build feature-rich dashboards. Stripe had a homegrown tool that allowed engineers to quickly spin up simple internal tools without writing any frontend code. When we started working on Onu with a different idea we immediately felt the pain of not having a similar tool. We pivoted to working on our current product instead because we already knew how powerful it can be for speeding up engineering teams.<p>Internal tool builders mostly take a no code/low code approach that requires engineers to duplicate a lot of business logic in the browser. This leads to brittle internal apps that are hard to keep in sync with the business logic in your codebase, and difficult to maintain as you scale. In addition, such tools subject you to point-and-click / drag-and-drop workflows that just aren\u2019t the sweet spot for programmers. We don\u2019t like working that way ourselves, so we focus on a code-first approach, allowing you to hand scripts to non-technical teammates to own and run without engineering oversight.<p>Onu works with your existing dev workflow. You write scripts in your editor of choice\u2014not the browser\u2014and deploy tasks the same way you deploy any other code. We can host your scripts if you prefer, but you can also add Onu to your existing Express server and our frontend will handle routing requests to the correct script. We currently have a Node SDK and are rolling out Python next.<p>You can try Onu now by heading to <a href=\"https://auth.joinonu.com/signup\">https://auth.joinonu.com/signup</a> and signing up for an account. It\u2019s free for personal use cases and for teams of up to 5 people.

As someone who often shares comedy videos with friends via WhatsApp, I typically search for \"YouTube Download\" on Google and click on one of the first few results. However, today I was taken aback to find that no working websites appeared in the search.<p>Upon further investigation, I discovered that numerous recent DMCA reports have called for the removal of these websites, e.g., (https://lumendatabase.org/notices/34141048#) and (https://lumendatabase.org/notices/34226349#). Interestingly, this development coincides with YouTube's ongoing ad-blocker crackdown.<p>I don\u00b4t agree that those websites necessarily violate copyrighted content.

responses is more like a GPT-3.5++. It generates more buggy code, the answers have less depth and analysis to them, and overall it feels much worse than before.<p>For a while, the GPT-4 on phind.com gave even better results than GPT-4-powered ChatGPT. I could notice the difference in speed of both GPT-4s. Phind's was slower and more accurate. I say \"was\" because apparently phind is now trying to use GPT-3.5 and their own Phind model more frequently, so much for GPT-4 powered search engine....<p>I wonder if I use Poe's GPT-4, maybe I'll get the good old GPT-4 back?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249</a></p>\n<p>Points: 45</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249", "date_published": "2023-05-31 03:46:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Did Arthur Booth turn his life around after Judge Mindy's revelation?", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/celebrity-biographies/500558-did-arthur-booth-turn-life-judge-mindys-revelation/\">https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/celebrity-biographies/500558-did-arthur-booth-turn-life-judge-mindys-revelation/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36133643\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36133643</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/celebrity-biographies/500558-did-arthur-booth-turn-life-judge-mindys-revelation/", "date_published": "2023-05-31 02:00:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Feedback: I try to answer \u201chow to become a systems engineer\u201d", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2023/05/30/eng/\">https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2023/05/30/eng/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36133263\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36133263</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "link": "https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2023/05/30/eng/", "date_published": "2023-05-31 01:04:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Nvidia DGX GH200: The First 100 Terabyte GPU Memory System", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/announcing-nvidia-dgx-gh200-first-100-terabyte-gpu-memory-system/\">https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/announcing-nvidia-dgx-gh200-first-100-terabyte-gpu-memory-system/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36133226\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36133226</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>", "link": "https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/announcing-nvidia-dgx-gh200-first-100-terabyte-gpu-memory-system/", "date_published": "2023-05-31 00:58:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
