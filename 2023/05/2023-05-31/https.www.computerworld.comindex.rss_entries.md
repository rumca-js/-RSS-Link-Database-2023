<p>Several hundred tech and administrative workers at Amazon’s main headquarters in Seattle staged a walkout today, urging the technology and retail giant to adopt more climate-friendly policies and do away with rules mandating in-office work.</p><p>Several speakers at an event — which was broadcast on Twitter — spoke outside the company’s headquarters Wednesday morning, saying that climate change wasn’t being taken sufficiently seriously by Amazon, and arguing for a range of policies that would reduce the company’s impact on the environment. The event was organized in part by a group called Amazon Employees for Climate Justice.</p><p>Representatives from other groups — including Minneapolis labor advocacy group the Awood Center, which helped Amazon warehouse workers in that city organize for better working conditions — sent statements of support, and speakers included the director of local climate justice action group 350 Seattle, Shemona Moreno.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3698268/amazon-workers-walk-out-to-protest-return-to-work-policy-climate-change.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>The metaverse has been described as the next phase of the internet: interconnected and persistent 3D spaces where we will work, play, and, so it seems, purchase virtual real estate. But metaverse-related technologies have failed to keep up with the considerable hype, the vision of ultrarealistic virtual environments offered by tech vendors miles away from the current reality of cartoony avatars and cumbersome, expensive headsets.</p><p>As the hype spotlight has shifted sharply to generative AI and all its dangers and possibilities, talk of the metaverse — or “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-metaverse-is-quickly-turning-into-the-meh-taverse-1a8dc3d0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Meh-taverse</a>” — these days largely centers on its demise. And not without reason: Meta (formerly Facebook), which changed its name in 2021 to reflect its new focus, has spent billions on VR development with comparatively little return, at least so far. Sales of VR and AR headsets have fallen short of expectations. And Microsoft <a href="https://altvr.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shuttered AltspaceVR</a>, the social VR platform it acquired in 2017, and has reportedly <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3687732/microsoft-cuts-hololens-xbox-surface-jobs-as-industrial-metaverse-team-said-to-fold.html">laid off workers focused on mixed reality development</a> while <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3688433/as-microsoft-embraces-ai-it-says-sayonara-to-the-metaverse.html">making AI its clear priority</a> going forward. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3697812/metaverse-not-dead-yet.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
