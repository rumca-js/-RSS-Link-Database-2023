JPMorgan Chase has implemented an employee surveillance system called WADU, which is causing fear and paranoia among employees.

According to the Reddit post - WADU is a software which monitors various aspects of employees' work activities, including login times, application usage, facial expressions, speech patterns, body language, and stress levels.

The collected information is compiled and made accessible to managers in real-time, allowing them to track employees' productivity and morale.

The system utilizes HD security cameras in offices and branches to monitor employees' non-verbal body language throughout the day.

JPMorgan Chase is pushing for a return to the office to refine the Wadu profiles and gain a return on their investment in the system.
