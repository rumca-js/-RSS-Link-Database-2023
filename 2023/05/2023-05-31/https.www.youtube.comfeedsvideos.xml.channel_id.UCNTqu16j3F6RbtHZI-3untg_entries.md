Zilker Park is a scenic and central area enjoyed by the people of Austin Texas for generations. Recent years have brought in a huge wave of new residents to the area, spurring new plans to develop more space for parking and infrastructure that many fear will damage the environment and alter the natural experience of Zilker. As a new Austin resident and enjoyer of Zilker, I caught wind of this story and felt it needed to be shared with more people.
