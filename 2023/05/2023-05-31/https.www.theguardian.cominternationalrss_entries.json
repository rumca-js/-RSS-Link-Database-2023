Don\u2019t lose sight of how to help, even in small doses. It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re a reserve on the sidelines, Cureton told himself.

Though this all swirled in Cureton\u2019s mind some 40 years ago, the task remains the same for players today. Indeed, in this year\u2019s NBA finals, players like Denver\u2019s Bruce Brown Jr and Miami\u2019s Duncan Robinson will undertake crucial roles coming off the bench for their squads.
