A Toronto Blue Jays player shared a, quote, "anti-LGBTQ" post on Instagram. He apologized. The Toronto Sun wants him fired anyway.</p><p>Here's Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Anthony Bass apologizing that he let his Christian beliefs show regarding Bud Light and Target boycotts. You know the bullet points. He apologizes to his "friends" in the LGBTQ community. He's sorry for embarrassing his teammates.

He's demanding the team fire him anyway. But before anyone starts, Chisholm wants you to know this is NOT cancel culture run amok. The problem is Chisolm by amplifying a video on Instagram he has caused headaches for teammates, coaches and sponsors, and needlessly offended some of the club’s biggest supporters. By biggest supporters, I'll assume he means white liberals.</p><p>Freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom from consequences, especially in the corporate world, and some players are more disposable than others. With Pride Month just around the corner, the Jays would be wise to wash their hands of this mess entirely instead of playing the role of enabler.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Shocking as it may sound, this isn't the worst sports reporter take we've heard. It ranks #2. #3 is the reporter who wanted the Ottowa Senators to cancel Jordan Peterson <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-peterson-hockey" target="_blank">because Peterson performed in the same arena</a>. And #1 with a bullet is the hockey reporter who told a play if he didn't want to wear the Pride jersey, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nhl-network-analyst-lashes-out" target="_blank">he should go back to Russia where he belongs</a>. </p><p>It's all the same attitude. If you don't bend the knee to a radical progressive agenda, they'll make you bend the knee. In the case of LGBTQAI+EIEIO bullies, they have the full weight of the Democrat Party and the media (but I repeat myself) to bring down on you. It's not even June yet.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## #BoycottTarget takes lead on iTunes: Conservative values Trump mainstream artists Taylor Swift,  Luke Combs

Forgiato Blow aka Trump's Nephew aka the Mayor of MAGAville recorded a song about how conservatives have a "target" on our back while the retailer is TARGETing our kids. It was catchy. He recorded the video guerilla-style at a Target. And at the time, Saturday morning when I wrote about it, the song had hit #6 on the iTunes charts.</p><p>It's not ranked #6 anymore.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I just woke up to the news that our song Boycott Target is now the #1 song in ALL GENRES, making it the official #1 song in the USA beating out major artists and their labels. LOOK AT GOD! Thank you to every mom and dad who is standing up for their children. We the people have… <a href="https://t.co/9IZKISAfn2">pic.twitter.com/9IZKISAfn2</a><br />— Jimmy Levy (@JimmyLevyMusic) <a href="https://twitter.com/JimmyLevyMusic/status/1663541382126944256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Here's what's causing all this:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Why Is <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Target?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Target</a> Targeting Our Kids? <br /><br />Retweet If You Support <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoycottTarget?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BoycottTarget</a> <a href="https://t.co/z9cEkLoShi">pic.twitter.com/z9cEkLoShi</a><br />— Trumps Nephew (@ForgiatoBlow47) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForgiatoBlow47/status/1661861660351516674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>There are two things I love about this. The first is that like when the "Let's Go Brandon" songs hit the charts, it makes things mainstream. If you didn't know there were <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/blue-jays-anthony-bass-apologizes-sharing-hurtful-video-endorsing-target-bud-light-boycotts" target="_blank">people calling for Target to be boycotted</a> or <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/05/bud-light-target-and-a-new-era-of-corporate-caution.html" target="_blank">why there were boycotts happening</a>, this at least breaks the news and has non-political people asking questions.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Why is there a song called Boycott Target & why is it number 1 on iTunes… <a href="https://t.co/a34TlrKiJe">pic.twitter.com/a34TlrKiJe</a><br />— he not a boy, it’s Judge Taylor (@tayausjax) <a href="https://twitter.com/tayausjax/status/1663590632143695879?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The second and more important thing has nothing to do with politics. I f*cking love that the Internet has so leveled the playing field in releasing music that this is possible. My man probably recorded this song in his basement with nothing but a laptop, a copy of Garageband, and maybe a keyboard. The video took a camera and a friend working overnights at a Target. Tweeting the video out cost him at most $8 a month. </p><p>And he was able to take out multimillionaire artists like <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/taylor-swift-cancel-matty-healy" target="_blank">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/luke-combs-vancover" target="_blank">Luke Combs</a>, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/morgan-wallen-concert" target="_blank">Morgan Wallen</a>. Put as many qualifiers on it about this only being one chart on iTunes as you like. This still "shouldn't" happen.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>When Andrew Breitbart said politics is downstream from culture, this is what he was talking about. Outstanding work by all involved.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

All things considered, this is among the least embarrassing things to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6328447330112" target="_blank">happen at a Target</a> in recent weeks. It remains an example of how "pranksters" are the Joe Biden of web content, and we're not going to be satisfied until we watch when these people "prank" the wrong person. it almost happened in this video.</p><p>I put "prank: in sarcastic quotes because these pranks revolve around things like <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/old-ladys-dog-tiktoker" target="_blank">stealing someone's dog</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gasoline-cars-pranks" target="_blank">threatening to murder them</a>. Then when the person acts like you would if you stole their dog or tried to set them on fire, the "prankster: yells LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE!

That way, when they turn around to see who threw that, there is no one around. Only mannequins. Get it? Then you laugh at the person while you like and subscribe. You can't discuss science that isn't approved by government bureaucrats on YouTube. But you can commit a misdemeanor against them (at best) as long as you laugh about it.</p><p>This lady did not find it funny, so she hit them back. I would have liked an extended video where she beat the crap out of them and made one of them cry. But maybe next time. She was in a rush on this day and just needed to pick up a birthday present.</p><p>These losers are lucky the woman was in a rush. Throwing something at someone is an attack. An attack allows the person attacked to defend themselves and retaliate. THAT is the content I want to see. "Pranksters" finding out the hard way how the IRL world works.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is furious that someone on Twitter created a fake account of her, and it’s hilarious. Also, a gender bender by the name of Beans, got a 5 o’clock tattooed on their mustache. Lastly, we break down the worst Socialist dictators ever. The first one will surprise you.

## Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher blasts his team for honoring anti-Catholic drag group at Pride Night

At least one player, pitcher Blake Treinen, is showing the courage to speak out about it.</p><p>The drag nuns are known as the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. You may remember them from such blog posts last this 2019 classic, "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/another-child-sex-offender-discovered-at-drag-queen-story-time" target="_self" title="view post: ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'">ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'</a>." The "Sisters" <a href="https://www.outkick.com/los-angeles-dodgers-lgbtq-pride-night-sisters-perpetual-indulgence-apology-invite/" target="_blank">frequently dress as Jesus, Mary and other religious figures</a>, and brag about mocking the Stations of the Cross, and even the Eucharist. The Dodgers had uninvited them from Pride Night when it was brought to the team's attention that this is considered offensive. Then <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/los-angeles-dodgers-sisters-indulgence" target="_blank">leftist politicians got involved and the team was forced to bend the knee</a>, claiming "will continue to work with our LGBTQ+ partners to better educate ourselves, find ways to strengthen the ties that bind and use our platform to support all our fans to make up the diversity of the Dodgers family."</p><p>All fans, except for Catholics. Or anyone else who holds a single opposing viewpoint to far-left progressives. Like teammate Blake Treinen.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">My friend and <a href="https://twitter.com/MLB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MLB</a> pitcher Blake Treinen asked that I post this statement for him in regards to the <a href="https://twitter.com/Dodgers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Dodgers</a> honoring of the sisters of perpetual indulgence. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HoldTheLine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HoldTheLine</a> <a href="https://t.co/jIDeDJF8ke">pic.twitter.com/jIDeDJF8ke</a><br />— Sean Feucht (@seanfeucht) <a href="https://twitter.com/seanfeucht/status/1663678574015004675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>I am disappointed to see the Sister’s of Perpetual Indulgence being honored as heroes at Dodger Stadium. Many of their performances are blasphemous, and their work only displays hate and mockery of Catholics and the Christian faith. ...  The fans do not want propaganda or politics forced on them. The debacle with Bud Light and Target should be a warning to companies and professional sports to stay true to their brand and leave the propaganda and politics off the field.</blockquote><p>As of this writing, Treinen has not been forced into using an apology. Unlike Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Anthony Bass, who was forced to apologize over sharing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cspq-sJAS9I/?hl=en" target="_blank">an Instagram video about being a Christian</a> and boycotting Target.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Pussy. <a href="https://t.co/l8HbKP2BJv">https://t.co/l8HbKP2BJv</a><br />— Brodigan (@brodigan) <a href="https://twitter.com/brodigan/status/1663674138194501632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The protests over Target and Bud Light aren't about a trans infleuncer or a toddler's onesie that says "queer." It's about the radical activism pushing ALL OF IT. No one complained that the LA Dodgers were hosting a Pride Night. The issue was with one of the acts that were a part of it. But the bullies in the LGBTQAI+EIEIO community demand total compliance, and will bring both the government and the media down on you if you dare question anything.</p><p>There’s no common ground if you can’t say “we’re okay with Pride Night, but maybe find away to express Pride without dressing like nuns, mocking Jesus, and attacking 330 million Americans.” Just like there is no common ground between saying "talking to kids about tolerance is cool, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-private-school-dean-students" target="_blank">but leave the pornography and the sex toys at home</a>."</p><p>People are fed up with having the left's political agenda rammed down their throats at every turn. Enough is enough.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: James Van Der Beek - yes, Dawson - goes OFF on Democrat failures, Joe Biden being afraid to debate

But let's be honest. Ever since Joey left him to go sailing with Pacey for the summer, the dude has never been the same. James Van Der Beek was taking a stroll on Memorial Day. I'm guessing around his Texas ranch <a href="https://www.insider.com/james-van-der-beek-shares-moving-la-texas-family-2023-5#:~:text=James%20Van%20Der%20Beek%20moved,play%20with%20his%20six%20children." target="_blank">since he got out of the hellhole known as Los Angeles</a>. While remembering those who made the ultimate sacrifice and their families, he couldn't help but notice the people in charge are not worthy of that sacrifice.</p><p>Do I think Van Der Beek is a secret conservative? No. I think there are shades of Ralph Nader vs Bill Clinton happening but in reverse. The Democrat Party has gotten so extreme, moderates are waking up. And as someone who is all in for DeSantis, I'm here to revel in all the inter-party Democrat chaos.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">James Van Der Beek is redpilled <a href="https://t.co/Z4YKPLyfSM">pic.twitter.com/Z4YKPLyfSM</a><br />— Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) <a href="https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1663655122357059584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Big Banks? Big Business? Big Tech, Big Pharma, Big Government, Big Whatever... I mean, what the hell? How is this a Democracy?</blockquote><p>I'm assigning "Big Whatever" to "Big Journalism." All the American institutions that the left has total control over.</p><blockquote>If we're letting a small, little, back room of people make all the decisions for us, that's not a democracy and it doesn't work. Because y'all have been wrong about a lot these past couple of years in the back room.</blockquote><p>The past couple of years? A couple is two. Two years would be 2021-2023. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/randi-weingarten-senate-hearing" target="_blank">I have no idea what he can be talking about</a>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="1daef" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33772818&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Here's where I think this is less a secret conservative thing and more a Nader'ish thing. Van Der Beek's biggest complaint is how the DNC and Joe Biden are afraid to debate his primary opponents.</p><blockquote>And don't tell me the other candidates aren't serious. One of them is polling at 8%. The other one is at 20%. That is a daughter of the vote who already thinks there's at the very least some debate over who should be president.</blockquote><p>Also, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jake-tapper-joe-biden-horrible-news_n_64707c01e4b0047ed77b00b2" target="_blank">66% of the public say that a Biden victory would either be a setback or a disaster for the United States</a>. There is also that.</p><p>The fear of debate and pretending that Biden has no opponents cracks me the f*ck up. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/robert-kennedy-campagn-cheryl-hines" target="_blank">One of those opponents Is Robert Kennedy Jr.</a>. Bobby Kennedy's son. Not some distant Kennedy cousin, one of the legit heirs to Camelot. Democrats have gotten so extreme there isn't room for a Kennedy in their party. They are also afraid of letting the current Democrat president -- and an elderly gentleman whose brain is at least 51% tapioca -- anywhere near him and a microphone.</p><p>Do I think James Van Der Beek will ever vote for one of our guys? No. However, I beliece his voice speaking out on political issues should at the very least be <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hayley-williams-paramore-ron-desantis" target="_blank">as amplified as the lead singer of Paramore</a>.</p><p>Now here is James's best performance. I suggest adhering to the NSFW.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Since <a href="https://twitter.com/YakuzaCasey?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@YakuzaCasey</a> started us on Dawson's Creek this morning...
