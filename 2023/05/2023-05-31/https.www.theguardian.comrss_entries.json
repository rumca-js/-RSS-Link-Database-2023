Panti makes them entertaining, but must work to do so, selling the one about a substitute boyfriend as more outrageous than it is and ramping up the embarrassment \u2013 in the one about smuggling a dildo through security \u2013 to off-brand levels.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/31/panti-bliss-review-soho-theatre-london\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/31/panti-bliss-review-soho-theatre-london", "date_published": "2023-05-31 13:39:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Bloomsbury reports sales surge as people buy books as \u2018affordable diversion\u2019", "description": "<p>Harry Potter publisher says in challenging economic times books are seen as cheap form of entertainment</p><p></p><p>Bloomsbury Publishing, the home of Harry Potter, has revealed a rise in annual sales as it said people were turning to books as a cheap form of entertainment as finances were squeezed.</p><p>Sales of children\u2019s books rose 17%, led by a 51% jump in sales of the hit author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/maas-sarah-j\">Sarah J Maas\u2019s</a> titles whose latest work, Crescent City: House of Sky and Breath, was released in February last year.

But Evelyn\u2019s words are a warning sign as she sets about chillingly remoulding Adam from geek to good-looking boyfriend \u2013 from his clothes to nails and a nose job.<br /><br />LaBute\u2019s 2001 dark comedy was written for the stage before being adapted into the better-known film starring Rachel Weisz and Paul Rudd, and Nicky Allpress\u2019s slick production reminds us of its innate theatricality.<br /><br />The dialogue still sounds fast, fresh and funny, the cast catching its beats, although the savagery in the script never fully bares its teeth. The tension is better raised in matters of friendship and betrayal when Adam\u2019s friends Phil (Majid Mehdizadeh-Valoujerdy) and Jenny (Carla Harrison-Hodge) enter the fray but some of the manipulations between Evelyn and Adam feel softened.</p><p>Still it retains LaBute\u2019s cruel intent at its heart: Evelyn is a dead-eyed amoralist and Anderson, a screen actor making her stage debut, brings a brattish sense of entitlement. Adam is endearingly unworldly at the start, his physical transformation more subtle than Rudd\u2019s but no less convincing. He is not the same teary victim as Christine from In the Company of Men, coming back with anger at Evelyn, which undercuts her cruelty but makes their dynamic more believable.<br /><br />The play\u2019s big psychological reveal \u2013 that Adam changes on the inside as he becomes more superficially attractive \u2013 is hardly deeply mined insight. It works better as an analogy to the compromises that couples make for each other, especially in controlling relationships.<br /><br />The production comes with period elements intact from 90s music (Air, the Chemical Brothers) to cultural references (Women\u2019s lib, American Gigolo), and Peter Butler\u2019s set is made up of suitably soulless blank white lines with occasional neon and light showers.<br /><br />If it loses some of the intimacies of film, it shows these characters up close, literally: scenes take place front of stage so the characters\u2019 faces are in ours, some sitting among us so we can study their expressions as Evelyn reveals her dark denouement.

Almost every critical reaction seemed to contain the same sentence: \u201cI\u2019ve been playing for 60 hours yet I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface\u201d. Like Breath of the Wild before it, the latest title in Nintendo\u2019s role-playing adventure seriesis a vast odyssey with an intricate narrative constructed from dozens of quests, supported by a fully functioning world. Like many other gamers my age, I thought to myself, that would have been great when I was 25, but I\u2019ll get an hour a day on this thing at most. Is it all too much?</p><p>About 10 hours into the main campaign \u2013 which, as ever, revolves around a quest to track down the eponymous royal but somehow also manages to be mind-numbingly complex, like Middlemarch with monsters \u2013 something important happened: I let go. Without a deadline to finish it (thanks Keza, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-pure-magic\">for taking on the review</a>), I could just enjoy it in my own way. For several years, I\u2019ve been writing about how experiences such as Fortnite and Minecraft are no longer games to play but places to be (hang out with friends, build some stuff, whatever), and I was finally able to apply this sense of freedom to a big role-playing game. I decided I was never going to finish Tears of the Kingdom, and that was such an immense relief. Now I could have fun.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/31/pushing-buttons-tears-of-the-kingdom-hyrule-map\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/31/pushing-buttons-tears-of-the-kingdom-hyrule-map", "date_published": "2023-05-31 10:45:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018A friend said it gave them hope\u2019: four ways to find love \u2013 without the apps", "description": "<p>People often feel stressed and let down by online dating.
