The System Shock Remake brings back the original game's forward-thinking difficulty system, that lets you create a personal tailor made experience.

Most video game difficulties are basic and restrictive. Easy, Medium Hard. Shouldn’t games offer more flexibility for players? Well, it's not as new of a concept as you might think. It fact the idea’s been around since 1994. Almost 30 years ago the original system shock offered a custom difficulty that let players tweak individual accepts of the game to create their ideal gameplay experience. And now the new remake offers the same thing, and I’m gonna use it as an example of how games can do more with difficulty.
