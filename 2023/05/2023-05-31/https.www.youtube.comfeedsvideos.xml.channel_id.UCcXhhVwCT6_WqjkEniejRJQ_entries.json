I have spent the whole day cadding and will continue tomorrow to start the process of ordering all the parts. \nI am prioritizing spending time on cadding over video editing, i will spend more time once i am building and testing things IRL, going to be really fun to see how all this works. Would be a great feeling if i can get this assembly to work directly from CAD to IRL... Would be a good sign for the project. \n\nGood luck with everything you are doing!\n\n#4k #wintergatan\n\u2014\nMUSIC DOWNLOADS \u25ba https://wintergatan.bandcamp.com \nWINTERGATAN RECORDS \u25ba http://www.wintergatan.net/#/shop\nSPOTIFY \u25ba http://bit.ly/2oKxXWd \nITUNES \u25ba http://apple.co/2ntWNsZ \nMERCH \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/wintergatan\nDISCORD \u25ba https://discord.gg/wintergatan\nSECOND OFFICIAL CHANNEL:\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/c/Wintergatan2021\n\u2014", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q88W2MT60s", "date_published": "2023-05-31 19:56:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
