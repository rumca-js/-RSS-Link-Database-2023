Tears of the Kingdom fans believe that the game boasts a hidden experience level scaling system which is similar to the one which supposedly governed world progression in Breath of the Wild. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has officially been completed in less than one hour, setting an all-new speedrunning record for the Breath of the Wild sequel.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse reviewed by Tom Jorgensen

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse surges with visual inventiveness and vibrance in an undeniably strong evolution of the style established in Into the Spider-Verse. Miles and Gwen’s search for their place in the multiverse is relentless and exciting, almost to a fault, and though the plot is often an afterthought to the pure chaos of creation on display, strong performances and character arcs that feel true to the heroes we met last time help ensure that Across the Spider-Verse is a more-than-worthy follow-up to an all-time classic.

In today's Entertainment Fix:
A new book detailing the chaotic behind-the-scenes drama of the show "Lost" is making waves on the internet. Many people involved in the show, including writers and actors, have reportedly been witness to—or victims of—racism, sexism, and abuse on the set or in the writers' room. Lost co-creator and co-showrunner Damon Lindelof has responded to these allegations, and admitted that he failed to create a better working environment. In slightly lighter news, the Black Mirror's dystopian visions of society return next month in a brand new season, and Nintendo and Universal's The Super Mario Bros. Movie is making some real money at the box office, two months after its release.
