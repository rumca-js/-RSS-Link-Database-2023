  <p id="ZsOdN6">Google Assistant will lose the ability to integrate with third-party notes apps on June 20th, per an AnyList developer <a href="https://blog.anylist.com/2023/05/google-assistant-integration-shutdown/">blog post</a> announcing the change (<a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/05/31/google-assistant-notes-lists-integration/">via <em>9to5Google</em></a>). AnyList says it’s talking to Google about the change and hopes it can re-add integration later but, for now, has nothing to announce.</p>
<p id="BqVYeY">The loss of third-party notes and list app support will come along with the deprecation of Google software support for third-party Google Assistant smart displays, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/10/23676959/google-third-party-assistant-smart-displays-updates-bard">was discovered in April this year</a>.</p>

  <p id="jSQurj">Apple could have a pretty big Worldwide Developers Conference next week, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman. In addition to the rumored mixed reality headset and the usual updates to its operating systems, Gurman is expecting Apple to focus on “several” new Macs at the show, <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1663757505070256128">he said in a tweet</a>.</p>
<p id="o3PjqE">Gurman has already reported that a MacBook Air with a larger 15-inch screen and M2 chip <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23683762/macbook-air-15-m2-m3-summer-wwdc-rumor">is in the works</a>, and it seems possible that could be one of the stars of the WWDC show. Apple revealed the redesigned M2-equipped 13-inch Air <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23148515/apple-new-macbook-air-m2-features-specs-price-release-date">at last year’s WWDC</a>, so it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Apple would once again use the event to introduce a larger Air.</p>

I loved the challenging, escape room-style puzzles that gave my brain a good, hearty scratching, and my only real complaint was that it was over too soon. With no more puzzles to solve, I stepped away from the game. But now, to my delight, <em>Escape Academy</em> is getting its second DLC, <em>Escape From the Past</em>, on June 19th. </p>

  <p id="0IXjVK">All new vehicles will be required to have a “more effective” version of automatic emergency braking (AEB) under a new rule proposed today by the US Department of Transportation. </p>
<p id="6VcaMS">Around 90 percent of light-duty vehicles on the road today come standard with AEB. But the Department of Transportation is proposing a rule that would require automakers to adopt a more robust version of the technology that can stop vehicles traveling at higher speeds and detect vulnerable road users, like cyclists and pedestrians, even at night. </p>
<p id="LhSkgX">“AEB systems are a big step forward for saving lives on our roadways and preventing crashes,” US DOT Deputy Secretary Polly Trottenberg said at a press conference Wednesday. “When deployed, AEB systems can potentially...</p>

  <p id="XPdtgl">I am willing to bet that, at some point in your life, you have attempted to learn a new language and given up. Perhaps you took a few classes in high school but never continued. Maybe you downloaded the Duolingo app to your phone but never touched it. Maybe you started Rosetta Stone but lost interest. Discord and the language-learning platform Memrise have a possible solution for you: the Memrise Discord app, a new GPT-3-trained chatbot that can teach you new tongues from the comfort of your Discord server. </p>
<p id="ZJtlWX">The problem with many of today’s language-learning methods, in the experience of Memrise co-founder Ben Whately, is that they don’t force students into real-world situations. “If we spoke about cooking like we speak about language...</p>

  <p id="qlPWUy">Garmin’s joining the Pro bandwagon. On Wednesday, it’s launching the Epix 2 Pro and Fenix 7 Pro, which both come with a boatload of new mapping and training features, hands-free flashlights, and sensors. The Fenix 7 Pro series starts at $799.99, while the Epix 2 Pro will start at $899.99. </p>
<p id="tKgstf">There’s good news if you wanted an Epix 2 last year but were bummed that it only came in one size. Garmin doesn’t believe that less is more, so you can also now pick between three sizes of Epix 2 models: 42mm, 47mm, and 51mm. Both Pro lineups also offer a more durable Sapphire Edition. </p>
<p id="s1u6xR">The vast majority of what’s new will be shared across both the Epix 2 Pro and Fenix 7 Pro lineups. For example, all models will now feature a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22883556/garmin-fenix-7-epix-gps-smartwatches-outdoors-fitness">built-in hands-free LED...</a></p>

<p id="xbNt1P">You can use the new widgets to monitor processor utilization and speed, memory usage, GPU temperatures and usage, and Wi-Fi or Ethernet speeds. They’re certainly a lot more useful than the usual widgets or the news feeds full of junk stories from MSN. Microsoft did announce at Build earlier this month that you’ll be able to disable the Microsoft News feed in the widgets board later this year, thankfully.</p>
