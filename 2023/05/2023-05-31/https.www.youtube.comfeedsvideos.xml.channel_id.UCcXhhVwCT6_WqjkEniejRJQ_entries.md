I made this video quickly, so, its a very simple update, i hope you find it useful despite its simplicity. I have spent the whole day cadding and will continue tomorrow to start the process of ordering all the parts. 
I am prioritizing spending time on cadding over video editing, i will spend more time once i am building and testing things IRL, going to be really fun to see how all this works. Would be a great feeling if i can get this assembly to work directly from CAD to IRL... Would be a good sign for the project. 

Good luck with everything you are doing!
