<p>One does not simply shelve a movie with a $220 million budget--even when the star is garnering the wrong kind of publicity. Despite rumors, The Flash was never going to get the Batgirl treatment, according to producer (and sister to director Andy Muchietti), Barbara Muchietti, in an interview with <a href="https://ew.com/movies/the-flash-ezra-miller-controversy-never-shut-down-film/">Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p>In August 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery was still a newly-merged organization, and executives were making a lot of decisions about current and future content on the Max platform, then still called HBO Max. Two events took place in very close proximity; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/batgirl-film-shelved-by-warner-bros-even-though-it-finished-shooting-report/1100-6506105/">the studio suddenly canned Batgirl</a> even though it had finished filming and featured fan-favorite casting including Brendan Frasier and Michael Keaton. At the same time, Ezra Miller's ongoing legal troubles came to a head.

<p>Fortnite's Chapter 4 Season 2 has been a real doozy, adding the incredible Mega City to the Battle Royale island as part of an all-new Japan-inspired biome, along with the recently vaulted Kinetic Blade. But now spring is ending, and summer is upon us--and it's almost time for Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3. Here's everything we know so far about Fortnite's latest summer season.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When does Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3 begin?</h2><p dir="ltr">According to in-game messaging, the current season will end on June 9 at 11 PM PT / 2 AM ET, which indicates there's once again no live event this season. If Season 3 starts the way Season 2 did, then the game will only be offline for a few hours--meaning that you should expect Season 3 to begin sometime in the early morning of June 9.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond the ending time for this season, Epic hasn't made any announcements about what's in store for Season 3. And there haven't been many leaks yet, either--just one, really. But it's a big one. Not as big as the battle pass splash page leaking ahead of last year's summer season, but it's been enough to get a lot of folks all hot and bothered, in a good way.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-3-start-date-battle-pass-and-optimus-prime/1100-6514710/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Diablo 4 Beginner's Guide: Tips And Tricks For When You Go To Hell

<p>It's been a decade since the last entry in the series, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> is shaping up to be a massive hit. If this is your first foray into Diablo or an action dungeon crawler, you might feel overwhelmed by the number of systems and the frenetic combat. Luckily, Diablo 4 looks more complicated than it is and with a few tips, you should be more than prepared to take down Lilith. Here are 15 tips to bring with you when you go to Hell.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Balance between selling items and salvaging early on</h2><p dir="ltr">Once you hit the endgame you likely won't be thinking too much about how much gold you have, but early on you might find yourself strapped for cash. Once you make it to the main <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-kyovashad-hub-city-guide/1100-6512473/">hub city in Act I</a>, you will unlock the ability to salvage unwanted loot for materials, which are used to upgrade the gear you <em>do </em>like. Upgrading requires both gold and materials, so you will want to try and make sure you have plenty of both. A good strategy is selling all of your unwanted junk, instead of salvaging, roughly every third trip to the armorer.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Stash gems</h2><p dir="ltr">Inventory management has always been an important part of Diablo, and Diablo 4 is no exception. While every item takes up only a single slot, one item type might fill your inventory very quickly; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-all-gems-and-bonuses/1100-6514612/">gems</a>. Gems come in a variety of different colors and quality, with each different kind taking up its own inventory slot. You won't want to sell these, but you certainly don't want to have them taking up inventory space. Once you start collecting gems, you will want to regularly drop them off at your stash until you need them.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-beginners-guide-tips-and-tricks-for-when-you-go-to-hell/1100-6514704/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4146018-junegames2023.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The last couple of months have been a non-stop ride of high-profile releases and game of the year contenders, and if you thought that you'd get a break in June from all of the highly anticipated releases, then you thought wrong. The first half of 2023 is ending on a high note, as sequels that have been years in the making finally launch, major new chapters in long-running franchises are arriving, and several beloved classics are getting HD makeovers.</p><p dir="ltr">June starts out with the launch of Street Fighter 6, which is shaping up to be an impactful evolution of what is arguably the biggest fighting game franchise in the world. Not just a good-looking sequel with plenty of new characters to master, Street Fighter 6 is reinventing how fighting games are played with its updated controls and an expanded system for multiplayer brawls.</p><p dir="ltr">A few days later, it's time to go to hell. Or to be specific, a realm of reality adjacent to it. Diablo IV is classic action-RPG adventuring from Blizzard, with this sequel focused on creating a dark and tragic world to explore as one of several playable classes. This won't just be a one-and-done odyssey either, as Blizzard has plans to keep Diablo IV running for years after launch with a seasonal content model.</p><p dir="ltr">Towards the end of June, Final Fantasy XVI will launch. It has been seven years since the mainline series got a new numbered entry, and Final Fantasy 16 is a big departure from previous games. This time, the franchise is headed deep into action territory, mixing magical spellcasting with hard-hitting melee combat. On top of that, Final Fantasy 16 is aiming to tell a mature story of war, sacrifice, and freedom in a world where gigantic crystals have shaped the destiny of humanity for eons.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond those big releases, you can also look forward to new motorsports, quirky indies, and some tactical action against alien organisms that have no respect for your face's personal space.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Killer Frequency - June 1</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4135801-killerfrequency.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It’s a late night at KFAM radio station, and something strange is happening on the airwaves. As disc jockey Forrest Nash, you'll need to solve puzzles and spin some classic tunes if you want to keep your listeners from being filleted by a local serial killer. Solve riddles, meet a variety of small-town personalities, and indulge in a playlist of '80s classics while you attempt to outwit a killer out for blood.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903620/Killer_Frequency/">See on Steam</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection  - June 1</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4144914-etrianodysseyoriginscollection.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>One of the best JRPGs of a bygone era gets a new lease on life in the Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection. A collection that includes Etrian Odyssey HD and its labyrinthian forest, Etrian Odyssey II HD and its castles in the sky, and the marvelous sunken cities that can be explored in Etrian Odyssey III HD, this package also has several upgrades for these classic games. All three games benefit from remastered graphics, a newly remastered soundtrack, and quality-of-life improvements that help modernize the experience across all three games.</p><div><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/etrian-odyssey-origins-collection">Save at Fanatical</a> </div></div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Street Fighter 6  - June 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4135800-streetfighter6.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Capcom's latest entry in the Street Fighter series isn't just shaping up to be hard-hitting evolution of the fighting game franchise, but also its most approachable entry yet.

Katamari games are some of the best chaos simulators on the market as you roll all of existence up into a giant ball of memories. For this package, the second game in the Katamari series gets updated with improved graphics and gameplay enhancements, while Royal Reverie is a trip back in time as you experience the childhood of the King of All Cosmos. Just remember to <em>always </em>keep on rolling.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/We-Love-Katamari-REROLL-Royal-Reverie/dp/B0BVBVS1GN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">See on Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Amnesia: The Bunker - June 6</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4144916-amnesiathebunker.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>A desolate bunker underneath the battlefields of World War I is spooky enough, but throw in homicidal nightmares lurking in the shadows and you've got a recipe for a survival-horror experience that's bound to give you sleepless nights. As French soldier Henri Clément, you've got a noisy dynamo flashlight to keep the monsters at bay, scarce supplies to scavenge, and an ever-present threat reacting to your every move and sound. Every action has a consequence, and it'll be up to you to bear the brunt of them as you delve deeper into terrifying territory.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944430/Amnesia_The_Bunker/">See on Steam</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Diablo IV - June 6</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4135802-diabloiv.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>After years of development, Blizzard's finally ready to unleash the terror of the Burning Hells and High Heavens on players once again. Diablo IV looks like a return to the dark and gritty roots of the original games, and is set in a version of Sanctuary that's still under siege from demonic and angelic forces. New heroes will need to rise up to face ancient enemies, and like in previous games, there'll be plenty of enemies to slay, loot to collect, and stories to uncover in the next chapter of Diablo.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/">Diablo IV Review</a>.</em></p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Diablo-IV-PlayStation-5/dp/B0BPPPPYK7?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">See on Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>MotoGP 23 - June 8</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4135798-motogp23.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While the grid might have very few challengers to give developer Milestone a run for its money, the studio's recent MotoGP games have been terrific simulators of this captivating two-wheeled sport.

Layers of Fear and Layers of Fear 2, as well as all of their respective DLC, get remade in this collection and enhanced with ray tracing support, HDR visuals, and up to 4K resolution. Its a fresh visual spin on two cult-classic games, and whether you're focused on your finishing brushstrokes in The Painter or waiting for the final curtain call in The Actor, you'll have to prepare yourself for some of the finest psychological horrors as you face your fears one last time.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946700/Layers_of_Fear/">See on Steam</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Crash Team Rumble - June 20</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4135803-crash-team-rumble.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Crash Bandicoot is back, but instead of dashing through levels collecting mystical masks and Wumpa fruit, he's teaming up with his allies and enemies for some 4v4 multiplayer action. Crash Team Rumble puts a new spin on the series, as teams will battle it out in arenas to see who can gather the most Wumpa fruit and stop the competition from doing the same. A Crash-themed multiplayer game might sound weird,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-team-rumble-puts-a-modern-spin-on-the-mascot-platformer-and-it-just-might-work/1100-6513604/"> but as we've discovered</a>, it has a lot of potential thanks to its competitive angle and energetic match flow.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/crash-team-rumble/9NZRCG3291RW">See on Xbox Store</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Aliens: Dark Descent - June 20</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4135796-aliensdarkdescent.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>A new Alien game always seems to be lurking in the shadows, but Aliens: Dark Descent is putting a different spin on the spooky action-packed franchise. Instead of going in guns blazing with your Colonial Marines, you'll need to come up with a solid plan and execute it properly if you want to avoid having your face introduced to hug-happy critters. Mixing the strategy of tactical RPGs with some lateral thinking, you'll need to lead your soldiers in real-time to stop a new and terrifying xenomorph outbreak.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150440/Aliens_Dark_Descent/">See on Steam</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy 16 - June 22</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4135804-ff-16.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Almost a decade has passed since the last core numbered entry in the Final Fantasy series, and this time, Square Enix is focusing on delivering a new experience in its iconic franchise.

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145267-7742487287-lite..jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo likes to get weird. When you're one of the most successful companies of all time--video games or otherwise--you are afforded the luxury to experiment and make products that are not guaranteed hits. Some of those turn out to be unexpected successes, but for the curious collector, even the biggest flops are worth checking out for the pure novelty of it. After all, when your flesh is no more and your bones have long been fossilized, will it matter that your favorite accessory for the Game Boy didn't sell well? No. Will it matter that you still enjoyed it? Also no, but we don't want to think about that. While we remain on this mortal plane, we will enjoy every oddity Nintendo has to offer. And since that Wii Vitality Sensor never materialized, we'll never even have to know how close we are to leaving.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the years, Nintendo has itself created many weird accessories and devices, ranging back from the NES era (and even earlier) all the way to the Switch. But third-party companies have done so, too, and many of these are even weirder than what Nintendo came up with. Did you know you can fish with your Game Boy? You're about to. And if you thought that you couldn't turn your handheld into a device resembling an oral surgery tool, you would be dead wrong. Never underestimate what Nintendo (and Nintendo partners) are capable of.</p><p dir="ltr">These are the best weird Nintendo experiences of all time, including a few that are actually pretty handy.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Game Boy Camera and Game Boy Printer</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145269-7255128927-38762.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It's hard to imagine today if you're younger, but there was a time when everyone <em>didn't </em>have a camera in their pockets at all times and cell phones were only for making phone calls. Nintendo decided the best way to correct that was the Game Boy Camera, a game cartridge and camera combination that plugged in just like any other game. It could take pictures in such low resolution that they looked like security camera snapshots from an underground criminal compound, but it sure was cool to have a working camera in your Game Boy. Paired with the Game Boy Printer, you could print out little stickers of your favorite photos after doctoring them to be as silly as possible.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>U-Force</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145271-6889140179-38762.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><em>Image credit: <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/video-game-controller-nintendo-u-force-power-field-controller-broderbund/7wGljg8IKp6UXQ">Strong Museum of Play</a></em></p><p>The NES and Famicom introduced some of the most important and long-lasting controller features of all time, including the directional pad still seen on almost every console's controller today. But that didn't stop third-party companies from trying to find ways to replace that controller almost immediately. One of these, the U-Force by Broderbund, promised that you wouldn't have to touch anything, with sensors recognizing hand movements for game control. If that sounds familiar, imagine if something like Kinect was used for games requiring pinpoint accuracy and you'll see how the U-Force was one of the goofiest ideas in history. It also came with an optional flight-style grip with buttons, if you wanted to look even cooler playing your games.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Konami LaserScope</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145274-2521814001-s-l16.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><em> Image credit: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/304906536432?_trkparms=amclksrc=ITM&amp;aid=1110006&amp;algo=HOMESPLICE.SIM&amp;ao=1&amp;asc=20200818143230&amp;meid=d6b2d4d2afa9476ba61039e415584b3d&amp;pid=101224&amp;rk=2&amp;rkt=5&amp;sd=166111051126&amp;itm=304906536432&amp;pmt=0&amp;noa=1&amp;pg=2047675&amp;algv=DefaultOrganicWebV9BertRefreshRanker&amp;brand=Konami&amp;_trksid=p2047675.c101224.m-1">moogleman27909 on eBay</a></em></p><p> </p><p>But while the U-Force would make you<em>look</em>silly, the Konami LaserScope would make you look<em>and sound</em>silly. A headset resembling the scouter units from Dragon Ball, it was essentially a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSYfmQE7hA0">repurposed Zapper controller</a>that replaced the trigger with sound recognition. This wasn't<em>voice</em>recognition, as it just needed to hear a noise rather than a specific command, but it allowed you to play certain games by moving your head and yelling. A novel idea, it also made playing a video game an all-family affair, as everyone else in your house would have to listen to you yelling at your TV in order to make your weapons work. To no one's surprise, it didn't really catch on, but it was one of the more creative ways to shake up game controls at that time.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Power Glove</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145275-4353761833-38762.png" /><br /><h3><p>Made famous--or infamous--in the Fred Savage movie and feature-length commercial The Wizard, the Power Glove is certainly a product of the '80s, and with its official backing by Nintendo and prominent scene in the movie, you'd expect it to be good. But even in the film, a character says it's "so bad." He meant it in a cool, rebellious way, but the Power Glove was simply too ambitious for the technology at the time. It made use of sensors to tell where your fingers are positioned inside. Codes were needed to work with each game, but the poor accuracy likely meant you'd want to just use a regular controller instead--which was included on the outside of the glove. It had to be testing pretty poorly during development if an entire controller was just stuck on top.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Game Boy Pocket Sonar</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145278-3813423315-s-l16.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><em>Image credit: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/134569546811?chn=ps&amp;_trkparms=ispr=1&amp;amdata=enc:1gQgB7rK-SsKrbIlW4j25oA86&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&amp;mkcid=2&amp;mkscid=101&amp;itemid=134569546811&amp;targetid=1587268788377&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=pla&amp;googleloc=9005884&amp;poi=&amp;campaignid=19894961968&amp;mkgroupid=148855406073&amp;rlsatarget=pla-1587268788377&amp;abcId=9307911&amp;merchantid=6296724&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwvdajBhBEEiwAeMh1U1vmJVlbgk2m9iZuD7kmIS5ozeoHiKq2tSz-czLBhrMdf1s9Bv2ajBoCTkkQAvD_BwE">kuchibashi17 on eBay</a></em></p><p>More than any other item on this list, the Game Boy Pocket Sonar made us ask this question: why? The peripheral was created by Bandai (now part of Bandai Namco) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mHSHmk_UU4">allowed you to find fish underwater</a>. The only problem is that the Game Boy is not waterproof, and while it includes a case, you'd likely be using this device on a slippery dock or a boat, meaning there was a good chance your Game Boy would go tumbling into the murky depths of the sea--or pond--and the fish would find it, instead. It's even more creative than the LaserScope, but it's limited to such a specific use and despite having a real bobber that floats in the water, wouldn't you rather just hang out, relax, and hook some worms onto your fishing hook like everyone else?</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nintendo Labo</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145279-9570248886-38763.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>No one but Nintendo would have thought the best way to enhance the Switch was with cardboard, but that's why Nintendo has been so successful for so long: It thinks of things we didn't know we even wanted. The Labo line, which includes a VR headset, robot kit, and variety kit packed with little devices and toys, uses the features of the Switch and a mix of cardboard and reflectors to make something borderline magical. The variety kit is particularly impressive because it includes a working piano, and using the Switch's software and your ingenuity, you can even make new toys and devices--or <a href="https://twitter.com/hitokage22/status/987939654497284096">recreate a boss fight from Undertale</a>.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Labo-Variety-Kit-Switch/dp/B01MY7GL3O?tag=gamespot-best-lists-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Lego Super Mario figure</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145280-8987829215-38762.png" /><br /><h3><p>Mario is usually an adorable little fellow you'd be happy to see in the worst of times. That's true for his Lego version, too, which lights up and lets you play the original Super Mario Bros. theme song when place on top of the Lego NES set's television unit. However, when he's not powered on, there are two black voids where his eyes should be. It's like something out of a horror movie, replacing the portly plumber's plucky personality with one of pure pain and predatory petulance. Is this the price Mario must pay in order to become "Super?" Is this what we don't see when the video game is shut off? It would certainly explain why Peach seems to want nothing to do with him on a romantic level!</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Building-Interactive-Featuring/dp/B085878WLK?tag=gamespot-best-lists-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Virtual Boy</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145281-5922682900-38762.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Ok, let's be honest here: "Best" might be pushing it a bit too much for the Virtual Boy, one of the entries here created by Nintendo itself. An early attempt at Virtual Reality that fell painfully short, it saw Nintendo take a huge swing and a miss at a time when it was on top of the world--this was when the SNES and Game Boy were still selling like, well, they were the SNES and Game Boy. But Nintendo opted for something no one expected--or wanted, apparently--with the Virtual Boy. It only displayed red and black colors, had a very limited library of games that were mostly mediocre, and you couldn't actually use it without AC power, despite the "Boy" name. It sold terribly, was discontinued remarkably quickly for a Nintendo console, and we all kind of wish we had one anyway.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nintendo e-Reader</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145282-5379743754-s-l16.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><em>Image credit: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/385608722831?epid=1074972973&amp;hash=item59c812298f:g:K1kAAOSw9ONkXgoF&amp;amdata=enc:AQAIAAAA4BKpMLdEKDBUTf8yEXIFA3iyzgbdwZ4gzIpCoorGenwGPaY5PT58qXdVMaWknaMwVUrPHXBpVJa7tGzY7Ig4F9WyiXB88Crupcwh292leKEaOm7kM50ZgT0IkT90cmEUkFOVtMfF91LnRXdGz00yMNiMUmaPWmVL5mnsNZ+jwhWQaIhMEREln5kTxCPOuu+mnX/v2yIKnaMG05IAz1eJQ2Q+jfMkF6o7mBpX6n3kRGVa4ZT1F7gl45fsSqkh/F7uTLUbPto1r8ofdFxqezb9SS9sYhknMSGu1jjGbB2Z9Te6|tkp:Bk9SR8adztuNYg">skoober827272 on eBay</a></em></p><p>Amazon Kindle, eat your heart out! Ok, actually, this doesn't actually let you read books on the Game Boy Advance. Instead, the Nintendo e-Reader was essentially an add-on for the system that let you unlock features and play classic games by scanning paper cards. It also allowed for additional levels and features in certain standard Game Boy Advance games, but because of its design--you couldn't load a game into the e-Reader itself--this required connecting a second Game Boy Advance to the first one via a link cable. It's not exactly the most cost-efficient or simple way to get new levels but the e-Reader definitely saw its influence live on in things like the 3DS' AR technology.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Game Boy Advance Video</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145284-1161672129-38762.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><em> Image credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4od1AdB8e4">WULFF DEN on YouTube<br /><br /></a></em></p><p>Sometimes you just need to watch an episode of All Grown Up! and you can't wait until you get home, even if that means viewing it in a resolution that would make a 240p YouTube video from 2006 feel special. Majesco's Game Boy Advance Video came along well before smartphones meant you had a computer in your pocket at all times, so letting kids swap out episodes of cartoons and watch them for hours during long car trips--provided they had headphones--was actually a pretty neat idea. Its idea was well ahead of the technology needed to make it work well, however, so it's not a huge surprise that Nintendo and Majesco didn't keep emphasizing video content moving forward. YouTube <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forget-imax-watch-tenet-on-a-game-boy-advance-instead/1100-6488735/">creator WULFF DEN did</a>, however, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4od1AdB8e4">putting Tenet onto a cartridge</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Riiflex</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15971423/4145285-4282762415-38762.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Sure, you could just lift something slightly heavy in order to tone up your arms, but then you wouldn't be using video games to do it… we guess.

Two? Maybe? 8BitDo is one of the best third-party controller manufacturers on the market, with options that work on everything from the Switch to the many plug-and-play mini consoles, but the 8BitDo Lite is just<em>strange</em>. It's a blocky controller that includes two directional pads for "total 2D gaming action," but the use cases for the controller are pretty minimal.

## Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Review

<p dir="ltr">Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually breathtaking movie that will constantly leave you in a dizzy awe of its trippy animation. It's also a clumsy story that can never figure out what it wants to emphasize, ending very abruptly and leaving the next movie to figure everything out.</p><p dir="ltr">That makes Across the Spider-Verse very difficult to evaluate. This is effectively only half a movie, both because of how it's structured and because it's one part of a two-part story. And so, in a very real way, the quality of this film will ultimately be determined by its sequel, which is scheduled for next March.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, let's talk about Across the Spider-Verse on its own terms, as best we can, anyway. It opens with the tragic backstory of Gwen Stacey's Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld)--in which her Peter Parker becomes the Lizard and dies fighting her. Gwen's universe has its own surrealistic art style that's astonishingly pleasing to watch, and it's all delivered to the rhythm of a song. I'd go as far as to say this is the best opening sequence of any superhero movie.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review/1900-6418074/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Diablo 4 - All Gems And Bonuses

<p>Gems are one of the many returning features in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a>. These items slot into certain pieces of armor, jewelry, and weapons to give them added bonuses, depending on what you slotted them into. Not all equippable items that you find or purchase will have a gem socket, but you can pay a fee at a gem shop to add a single socket to that item if you wish. You can find gems as lootable drops from killing mobs, bosses, and opening chests.</p><p>In Diablo 4, there are five different rarity levels that a gem can come in. The lowest level will give your item a small buff while the highest level will provide a much larger buff. The gems will also give different bonuses depending on if you slot it into a piece of armor, jewelry (amulet or ring), or a weapon (one-handed or two-handed). To see all of the available gems and what bonuses they give each item in Diablo 4, check out the guide below.</p><h2>All gems and their bonuses</h2><p>For the most part during your run through the main story of Diablo 4, you will only see the Crude or Chipped variety of gems as lootable drops. Crude is the lowest level a gem can come in, and you are able to upgrade it to a Chipped gem by visiting a gem vendor and trading three Crude gems to obtain a single Chipped one. From here, you need to reach a higher level (it's unclear what level) and you will be able to trade three Chipped gems to obtain a single regular gem.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-all-gems-and-bonuses/1100-6514612/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The season will consist of eight episodes split into two volumes. Part 2 of Season 3 follows four weeks later on July 27.

## Diablo 4 World Tier 3 Capstone Dungeon Level Requirement And Tips

<p>The Capstone Dungeons are one of the primary pieces of endgame material that players can take on and complete in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a>. They contain the same basic principles as any other dungeon in the game, but they represent a much tougher challenge than any other one you might have completed prior.</p><p>You can't unlock the ability to complete a Capstone Dungeon until you have completed the main campaign in Diablo 4. The first Capstone Dungeon can only be done on World Tier 2, will require you to be roughly level 45-50, and upon completion, will give you access to World Tier 3: Nightmare, which features tougher enemies but more XP, gold, and better loot drops. While there is a second Capstone Dungeon you can complete to unlock World Tier 4 in Diablo 4, we'll be mainly going over the first one in today's guide.</p><h2>Starting the first Capstone Dungeon</h2><p>When you see the end credits roll and hop back into Diablo 4, you will go on a couple of short quests that are considered the "Epilogue." After completing these, you can look at your quest list, and under the Priority Quest tab, you will see a new task titled "World Tier 3: Nightmare." <strong>This quest has a level recommendation of 50</strong>, but we were able to beat it as a level 48 Sorcerer, so you don't have to be right at level 50 to start it, or perhaps even prevail.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-world-tier-3-capstone-dungeon-level-requirement-and-tips/1100-6514613/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Much like Cinderella's Curse, Sleeping Beauty's Massacre will also be produced and directed by Louisa Warren with Jasmine Ebony Thomas (Motherland) writing.</p><p>"This film will flip everything as you know it on its head. It is savage, dark, and utterly horrifying," said Warren in a statement. "I am setting out to create the most uncomfortable horror experience to date. There will be lies, gore, and a big massacre.

<p>Player versus player combat, or PvP for short, is a major feature in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a>. Of course, players can choose whether or not to participate in PvP, as it's a totally optional feature within the game. If some fans want to stick solely with the main story and PvE elements of Diablo 4, they are completely free to do so. However, those that want to venture into PvP will need to head to the Fields of Hatred in Sanctuary. This is a part of the world map in Diablo 4 and it's solely where PvP takes place. The Fields of Hatred are located in the Dry Steppes region of the map and are found just north of the desert of Kehjistan. If you want to learn more about what goes on in the Fields of Hatred and exactly how PvP works in Diablo 4, you have come to the right place.</p><h2>How PvP works in Diablo 4</h2><p>As previously mentioned, you can find the Fields of Hatred in the southern part of the Dry Steppes region (as seen in the screenshot below). You can enter the fields in one of three paths and there is also a town waypoint found in the northwestern part of the area. We recommend visiting and capturing this waypoint as soon as possible so it's easier to fast travel between the area and other parts of the map.</p><figure style="width: 2560px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4144985-diablo4screenshot2023.05.25-12.45.30.67.png"><img alt="The Fields of Hatred is the area in red on the map.

Talk to the man with the icon over his head, and he will introduce you to the Seeds of Hatred and PvP. Basically, Seeds of Hatred is a currency that is only found within the Fields of Hatred. It is obtained through killing mobs, bosses in the area, chests, and other events. When you leave the Fields of Hatred, all of the Seeds of Hatred you have will be purged, meaning you no longer have them. You can keep track of how many you have by looking at the counter to the left of your mini-map.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-pvp-explained-how-the-fields-of-hatred-works/1100-6514624/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> Strongholds are smaller and open dungeon-style areas that players can visit to earn terrific rewards, such as Renown and XP. They usually involve a set of tasks that players need to complete before they can challenge the boss of the Stronghold to earn their rewards. Luckily for players, the tasks are laid out for them upon arriving at each Stronghold's location, so all players really need to do is find that specific location.</p><p>There are three Strongholds in every single region of the map in Diablo 4, making for 15 in total. If players want to find them all, they will have to uncover the specific areas they are in. While you can spend hours doing this yourself, it's easier if you know the Stronghold locations ahead of time. Below, you can see exactly where all 15 Strongholds are located on the map of Sanctuary in Diablo 4.</p><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">All Diablo 4 Strongholds</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="All_Diablo_4_Strongholds">All Diablo 4 Strongholds</h2><p>We will go region by region and state/describe the exact area of the map that the Stronghold is located in.

Alessandro notes that <strong>the campaign took roughly 30 hours to complete</strong> while maining a Necromancer. Additional activities were also completed, such as side quests and dungeons, to experience a chunk of what the game world has to offer. For those looking to beat it faster, others on staff were able to rush through the campaign in <strong>less than 15 hours</strong>. Of course, these totals don't account for endgame content, which is the main attraction for many players and will likely add dozens more hours to any player's total experience.</p><h3 id="Diablo_4_Campaign_Acts_and_Quests">Diablo 4 Campaign Acts and Quests</h3><p>Below, we've listed the Diablo 4 campaign acts and quests overview.

<p>While details of Call of Duty Season 4 haven't been officially revealed by Activision, a new report suggests that a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Warzone 2</a> map called Vondel is arriving with the big update.</p><p dir="ltr">In a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1663940200744058881">tweets from CharlieIntel</a>, the outlet reports that Season 4 is arriving on June 14, with sources claiming the update will include the new Warzone 2 map Vondel, which is apparently set in the Netherlands and is developed by Beenox. Additionally, the claim suggests that this map will have a Resurgence respawn mode to start, and Vondel is reportedly also getting DMZ support at some point.</p><p dir="ltr">While this report doesn't include anything specific about this map, Modern Warfare 2 does partially take place in the Netherlands, which speculates that Vondel could be based on Vondelpark, which is the largest park in Amsterdam. The 120-acre park features plenty of open grassy areas, water, large statues, and facilities, with plenty of surrounding houses and hotels, so this could potentially work as a small map for battle royale and DMZ.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-could-be-getting-a-new-map-in-season-4-per-report/1100-6514696/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Vanpool, a video game studio known for its work with Nintendo over the past decade, is shutting down. The news comes from a notice posted on the <a href="http://www.vanpool.co.jp/">developer's website</a>, which states that the company is dissolved as of May 31. It gives no reason for the studio's closure, nor any specific details.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the name Vanpool is not as well-known as that of other studios that frequently collaborate with Nintendo, such as Fire Emblem developer Intelligent Systems, the studio worked on many notable games, especially in the Kirby series. Founded in 1999, the studio first worked on Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga, contributing mostly to its minigames, before making Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland and its Japanese-exclusive follow-up Ripened Tingle's Balloon Trip of Love.</p><p dir="ltr">As a solo developer, Vanpool is perhaps best-known for the Dillion's Rolling Western series, of which three entries came out for 3DS between 2012 and 2018. In recent years, the studio worked almost exclusively on Kirby games, partnering with franchise studio HAL Laboratory on Super Kirby Clash, Kirby Fighters 2, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Though the studio is mostly worked Nintendo over the past decade, Vanpool was originally founded by developers who left the defunct studio Love-de-Lic, which created cult games like Moon: Remix RPG Adventure and L.O.L.: Lack of Love. Moon: Remix RPG Adventure received its first official Western release back in 2021.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-collaborator-known-for-work-on-kirby-is-shutting-down/1100-6514693/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Ahead of its anticipated launch on June 2, the Steam listing for the PC version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/street-fighter-6/">Street Fighter 6</a> has been updated to include a reference to Denuvo Anti-Tamper systems being included at launch.</p><p>The listing change, which can be seen on the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1364780/history/">changelog on Steam DB</a>, references both Denuvo Anti-Tamper as well as a system to limit the use of a single game key to five PCs a day. Anti-Tamper is a popular solution used to protect a game's source code, with Denuvo claiming to protect against efforts such as reverse engineering that could help pirates crack the game. This has frequently been circumvented in the past, so it is not entirely a silver bullet.</p><p>What makes this contentious is down to the issues some legitimate players of Denuvo-supported games experience, particularly degraded performance that has been traced back to the inclusion of the anti-tamper systems. There's no way of knowing yet if these issues will manifest in Street Fighter 6, but the decision to announce Denuvo's inclusion this close to launch will likely take some players by surprise.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/street-fighter-6-adds-denuvo-support-days-before-launch/1100-6514691/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>All hell is about to break loose once Diablo 4 launches, and fortunately, you won't have to face demonic hordes and angelic armies on your own. Diablo 4 is officially out on June 6, but this time, it'll be landing day one on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.</p><p>Ahead of its debut on multiple platforms, you can read up on how cross-play works, what co-op options will be available, and how cross-progression will function.</p><h2>How Diablo IV cross-play works</h2><p>These PC and console realms won't be gated off for Diablo IV, as you'll be able to group up with players regardless of the platform that they're playing on. This is thanks to Diablo IV being hooked into Blizzard's Battle.net online system, so if you don't already have an account, you'll want to set one up now to be ready to play as soon as you start the game. Console gamers do get one exclusive function that PC gamers won't have access to, and that's couch co-op.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-cross-play-cross-progression-and-co-op-explained/1100-6514684/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake Will Not Feature Newly Recorded Voice Acting

<p dir="ltr">Back when Konami first revealed the long-rumored Metal Gear Solid 3 remake to the world, the publisher said that the remake would "star the original voice characters." This statement is apparently quite literal, as Konami has now confirmed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/30/23742786/metal-gear-solid-delta-3-snake-eater-remake-voice-actors-no-changes">The Verge</a> that the remake will feature the same voice clips as the original game, with no changes or re-recordings.</p><p dir="ltr">While some might prefer the nostalgia of the original voice acting, many remakes of high-profile games have featured rewritten dialogue and re-recorded voice acting, including Final Fantasy VII Remake and Resident Evil 4. Given the vagueness of the original announcement, it was easy to take it either way. And judging by the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/13r6gf7/according_to_a_press_release_from_konami_the/">online reaction to this</a>, many fans also assumed that the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake would go the re-record route, but that's apparently not the case.</p><p dir="ltr">Officially titled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the MGS3 remake doesn't have a release date yet. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6514614/">we do know</a> that the game is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and that original series creator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-isnt-involved-in-the-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-konami-confirms/1100-6514670/">Hideo Kojima</a> is not involved in the project's production in any capacity. On a recent episode of Spot On, GameSpot's Tamoor Hussain and Lucy James expressed concern about the project, especially given that MGS3 is widely considered one of the best games of its console generation, if not of all time.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-will-not-feature-newly-recorded-voice-acting/1100-6514686/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The 2021 reboot of the Resident Evil movie franchise might be getting a sequel, with a report suggesting that some funding for the project has just been allocated.</p><p>A report by <a href="https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/province-pledges-11m-toward-greater-sudbury-economy-6803973">Sudbury.com</a>, a new outlet for the region of Sudbury, Canada, states that an $11 million cash injection has been secured by the local government for 20 projects in the area. The report, first picked up by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/resident-evil-welcome-to-raccoon-city-sequel">PCGamesN</a>, goes on to state that one of those projects is named "Umbrella Chronicles," which is being developed by film company Raccoon HG Film Productions, the same company behind Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City.</p><p>Given that the Sudbury area is also where the movie was filmed, it seems plausible that all this evidence is pointing towards production on its sequel starting sometime soon. While it has yet to be officially announced, the rumored title of "Umbrella Chronicles" could suggest the film pulling source material from the spin-off game of the same name. Although given that Welcome to Raccoon City smashed together the stories of both Resident Evil 1 and 2, anything is possible for the direction of a follow-up.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-sequel-to-resident-evil-welcome-to-raccoon-city-is-in-production-report/1100-6514683/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Fortnite's Chapter 4 Season 3 isn't quite here yet, but we've got a pretty good idea of what might be coming to the battle royale shooter in June. Perhaps the biggest piece of news is that an Optimus Prime skin might be coming to the game as this season's big crossover, and other Transformers-themed items could be along for the ride.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">SEASON 3 LEAKS SO FAR ‼️<br />- Fortnite x Transformers Collab with an Optimus Prime skin.<br />- A Summer Meowscles skin, and a Mechanic skin.<br />- Rideable Raptors that now get exhausted.<br />- Tropical Biome and with most likely a Desert area, and a volcanic area, as it's been leaked multiple… <a href="https://t.co/6YFkqNOluf">pic.twitter.com/6YFkqNOluf</a></p>  — HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1662826824596856832?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">May 28, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In the above tweet, reliable Fortnite leaker HypeX broke down all of the leaks that have emerged about the upcoming season so far. They include rideable raptors that get exhausted, a tropical biome with desert and volcano-themed areas, Ratchet &amp; Clank-style grind rails, and a full new racing mode, complete with cosmetics, a car garage, and race tracks. Weapon-specific leaks suggest that the Lever Action Rifle and Infantry Rifle will make a return, along with the introduction of a Mythic Drum Shotgun.</p><p dir="ltr">The Optimus Prime skin in particular seems to originate from a loading screen that was posted to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/13tjci0/optimus_prime_coming_to_fortnite_next_season/">popular gaming leaks community</a> on Reddit. As usual, it's best to treat these leaks as unconfirmed rumors for the time being, and thus with a whole heaping helping of salt. However, it is true that Fortnite leakers have a pretty good track record when it comes to things like this. As <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1662829142335713282">HypeX notes</a> in a follow-up tweet, the leakers don't know for sure if all of this new content is planned for Season 3 alone, so it's possible that some of it will emerge in coming seasons.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/optimus-prime-may-be-coming-to-fortnite-soon/1100-6514680/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>We have good news for fans of racing games and childhood nostalgia alike, as Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is officially on the horizon. In an announcement from Mattel and developer Milestone, details of the new kart racer were unveiled, along with a cinematic trailer, and a release date for consoles and PC set for October 19, 2023.</p><p>The sequel comes two years after Milestone's original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hot-wheels-unleashed/">Hot Wheels Unleashed</a>, which released to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/hot-wheels-unleashed">generally favorable reviews</a> from critics. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hot-wheels-unleashed-review-toybox-drift/1900-6417753/">Hot Wheels Unleashed review</a> gave the game a 7/10, praising its fluid gameplay and car variety, while criticizing the variety of its set pieces.</p><p>Milestone has said that Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged will include "greater diversity of vehicles and environments," including--if the trailer is any indication--off-roading (or, in this case, off-tracking) through rugged outdoor terrain. They have also added two new gameplay mechanics: "Dash," which can be used to dodge incoming objects or ram opponents off the road, and "jump," which can help "uncover hidden shortcuts" and "discover new track sections." Motorcycles and ATVs will also be making their debut in the 130-vehicle starting roster, though it's unclear if--or how--the handling of these will differ from the more traditional, four-wheeled options.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-announced-coming-this-fall/1100-6514665/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Barbie's Ryan Gosling On The "Hypocrisy" Of Ken Haters: "You Never Cared"

<p>When Barbie was introduced in 1959, she was sold by herself, but her greatest accessory wouldn't hit the market until a year later: Ken. The Ken doll was something that Barbie had as a companion, friend, boyfriend, or whatever you wanted him to be. A man without an identity of his own, Ryan Gosling, who plays the main Ken in the upcoming Barbie movie really wants you to care about Ken. </p><p>"Ken...his job is beach," Gosling told <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/ryan-gosling-summer-2023-cover-profile-ken-barbie">GQ</a>, explaining who Ken is to him. "For 60 years, his job has been beach. What the f--- does that even mean? And everyone was fine with that, for him to have a job that is nothing. But suddenly, it's like, 'No, we’ve cared about Ken this whole time.' No, you didn’t. You never did. You never cared. Barbie never f---ed with Ken. That's the point. If you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So your hypocrisy is exposed. This is why his story must be told."</p><p>Director Greta Gerwig has already said that Ken's creation is sort of <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1295951/barbie-is-spiritual-creation-for-director-greta-gerwig/">a reverse Adam and Eve story</a> in the Book of Genesis. Much like Barbie, Ken is malleable but is almost a worshipper of Barbie and everything she is. Gerwig said that she cast Gosling in the role because of a quality he has about never judging the characters. "He doesn't try and make you know that Ryan Gosling knows that this is silly. He does it in a way that takes on all of the potential humiliations of the character as his own."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/barbies-ryan-gosling-on-the-hypocrisy-of-ken-haters-you-never-cared/1100-6514678/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Black Mirror is coming back for its sixth season this June, and the newest trailer has arrived. This trailer provides the best look at the new season and shows brief glimpses at the season's five movie-length episodes.</p><p>Netflix is calling Season 6 the "most unpredictable, unclassifiable and unexpected season yet." One of the episodes is called "Joan Is Awful," and it looks to be some kind of nightmare about a person's life getting made into a TV show on a Netflix-like service called Streamberry without their knowledge. Another episode, "Loch Henry," seems to follow a documentary film crew chronicling mysterious abductions.</p><p>"Beyond the Sea" stars Aaron Paul and Josh Hartnett as astronauts with an eerie undertone suggesting something will go horribly wrong. "Mazey Day" looks to be a story about a celebrity photographer played by Zazie Beetz. The last episode is called "Demon 79," and it appears to follow a young woman with a killer instinct.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-mirror-season-6-trailer-shows-off-five-chilling-nightmares/1100-6514673/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>With a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater officially in development, fans have been wondering if series creator Hideo Kojima is involved in its development. Unsurprisingly, the legendary game director won't be making any contributions to the development of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and his frequent artistic collaborator Yoji Shinkawa isn't involved with this production either.</p><p>"They are not involved," a Konami spokesperson said to <a href="https://za.ign.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/176621/news/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-devs-on-whether-kojima-is-involved-and-why-they-picked-this-game">IGN</a>. "However, the development team will work hard to create this remake and also the ports--for Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection--so that they can be enjoyed on multiple platforms by even more players all around the world."</p><p>As for the development team, Konami says that the "central role" will be handled by Konami developers who have been "involved in the production of the past games in the Metal Gear series," and they'll be working alongside Virtuos, a studio that has also been involved in the production of previous entries in the Metal Gear series.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-isnt-involved-in-the-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-konami-confirms/1100-6514670/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
