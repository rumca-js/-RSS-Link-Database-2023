<p>It was all rather tame compared to the drama and fury of Liverpool’s last home triumph but Jürgen Klopp may have welcomed the serenity of Fulham’s visit to Anfield. A fifth Premier League win in succession, Liverpool’s best run of the season, maintained his team’s pursuit of European football and brought yet another milestone in the outstanding Anfield career of Mohamed Salah.</p><p>Salah’s decisive first half penalty, awarded after a soft foul by Issa Diop on Darwin Núñez, ensured the Eygpt international became only the third player in Liverpool’s history to score in eight consecutive home matches. Salah’s latest strike took him to outright fifth on the club’s all-time league goalscorers’ list and just one behind Steven Gerrard’s tally of 186 in all competitions for Liverpool. He also requires only one more to hit the 30 goal mark for the fourth season out of seven as a Liverpool player.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/03/liverpool-fulham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Her language is clear and direct. Each line builds on the last, with primary-school economy. At first, the picture she paints is unremarkable. It is all relay races, bird watching and maths classes. We hear about grandmas, fathers and big brothers. It is as familiar as the monkey bars on <a href="https://amyjanecook.com/">Amy Jane Cook</a>’s pastel-coloured set with its pleasing geometric shapes.</p><p>In interlinking monologues, we meet Alice (Kirsty MacLaren), determined to triumph in the school sports day; Jade (Tamara Fairbairn), certain her family history can enrich the curriculum; and Chloe (Esmé Kingdom), wishing she could connect with people as well as she can the environment. Excellently played, they are eager to please, prone to extravagant bursts of energy and, beneath it all, vexed about a world that is not quite right.</p><p>At <a href="https://northernstage.co.uk/whats-on/protest/">Northern Stage, Newcastle</a>, until 6 May.

<p>Tensions between ministers and mandarins are the product of impossible policy demands derived from unrealistic dogmas</p><p>The principle of civil service impartiality does not preclude officials having opinions. It requires only the professionalism to set partisanship aside when enacting government policy. That might not always be easy, and trust is not always in ready supply.

<p>Sports stars and business people are embracing the kingdom again, but human rights abuses continue four years after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder</p><p>The journalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi">Jamal Khashoggi</a> was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The CIA subsequently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report">concluded</a> that this was ordered by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, though he denies it. The murder was so high-profile, and the details so horrifying, that concern about optics prevailed even where moral qualms were not a priority. Prominent business figures <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/heres-everyone-dropped-saudi-arabias-davos-middle-east-195445490.html">dropped out</a> of a glitzy investment conference dubbed “Davos in the desert”.

Cristiano Ronaldo took first place thanks to his move to the Saudi club Al-Nassr, while golfers Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson shot into the top 10 after joining the LIV Golf tour. The only surprising thing about Lionel Messi’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65461978">suspension from Paris St-Germain</a> this week is that the footballer is paying a price for his lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia – albeit for his failure to turn up for training because he was on a trip there as a “tourism ambassador”, rather than due to reputational concerns.

<p>Our culture is full of lessons about individual survival. But it is the people around us who make the difference between sink and swim</p><p>I won’t give my dog a cooked bone. At family gatherings, when such a thing is waved in his direction, I will raise the palm of my hand to close off this avenue of pleasure. The dog’s disappointment will be hard to bear, as will the scorn of the relatives who will say something along the lines of, “Ah rubbish. Look at all the strays you see fending for themselves on beaches abroad and whatnot! They get thrown all sorts of scraps and they’re just fine!”</p><p>This is right and wrong. But mainly wrong. Yes, the dogs you see might be doing OK, but they’re the survivors, the most resilient of their litters.

Canadian singer and songwriter who enjoyed success with hits such as If You Could Read My Mind and Sundown<p>Gordon Lightfoot, the singer and songwriter, who has died aged 84, became one of Canada’s best loved musical figures, winning 16 of his homeland’s Juno awards. He scored eight Top 5 albums in Canada during the 1970s (including the 1975 compilation Gord’s Gold), four of them reaching No 1, and Sundown (1974) topping both the Canadian and the US chart.</p><p>He was held in huge esteem and amassed an impressive track record of having his songs covered by many of the leading artists of his era. The melancholy and lonesome Early Mornin’ Rain would become one of his signature compositions, covered by many artists including Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Paul Weller. Dylan, who would perform various Lightfoot songs in his own concerts, commented: “I can’t think of any Gordon Lightfoot song I don’t like. Every time I hear a song of his, it’s like I wish it would last forever.” Marty Robbins took Lightfoot’s Ribbon of Darkness to the top of the US Country chart in 1965, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/25/harry-belafonte-obituary" title="">Harry Belafonte</a> delivered a dramatic rendition of Oh, Linda, and Peter, Paul and Mary had a US Top 30 hit with For Lovin’ Me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/03/gordon-lightfoot-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The ex-SNL comedian recruits Edie Falco and Joe Pesci for a scrappy new comedy show that mixes raw honesty with rambling inconsistency</p><p>A goodly slice of the public has come to view Pete Davidson as one of those famous-for-being-famous types, better known for his tabloid-topping exploits than his career in comedy. A former class clown with a bank account in the millions, he comports himself like he’s shooting spitballs at the man-about-town concept: he’s dropping six figures with pal Colin Jost on a decommissioned Staten Island ferry that may be structurally unsound; he’s reinventing fashion by dressing like a club promoter/gas station parking lot weed dealer; he’s canoodling with a lineup of increasingly glamorous A-listers; he’s getting high on who knows what.</p><p>Davidson’s probably identified more with the fact of being on Saturday Night Live than the work he’s done there, having gone eight seasons without much in the way of classic characters or catchphrases. When he started out at the sketch institution, he presented as a natural descendant of Adam Sandler, another lanky goofball with boyish charms that took him from detention to sold-out stages. The blockbuster vehicles that shored up his predecessor’s reputation as a movie star, however, never came.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/03/bupkis-review-pete-davidson-show-peacock">Continue reading...</a>

As the statement’s authors failed to elaborate on what exactly those characteristics and qualities happened to be, it was left to Lampard’s many chums in the media and punditocracy to elaborate, pointing out that he had a previous incarnation of the club in his DNA, knew where the training ground was and, before his dismissal, had previously saved Everton from relegation over the course of five months by steering them from 16th in the Premier League table, four points above the relegation zone, to the dizzy heights of 16th<sup> </sup>in the Premier League table, four points above the relegation zone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/03/football-daily-email-chelsea-frank-lampard">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I wanted to shoot them outside of their studies – at a moment of joy. They patiently waited so that I could capture the moment with the low-flying plane’</p><p>This shot was taken in Istanbul a year into my work on Hafiz, the photo series that would launch my career as a photographer. Between 2017 and 2021, I travelled across Turkey documenting the lives of young Muslim schoolgirls enrolled in religious Qur’anic schools and studying to obtain “hafiz” – an ancient rite of passage that requires the memorising of all 604 pages – or 6,236 verses, or 77,430 words – of the Holy Qur’an.</p><p>Hafiz, which translates as “guardian” or “memoriser”, is a custom following in the footsteps of the prophet Muhammad, who – between the 6th and 7th centuries, when most people in the Arabic world were illiterate – spread religious scripture by word of mouth. Still today, thousands of students study to memorise the holy book. From the age of 12, my twin sister and I began the process, too. Every day we woke at 5am with the morning call to prayer, before chanting lines alongside 600 classmates at Qur’anic school. In the afternoon we attended secular school. There were moments of freedom at home, when we watched TV, ate what we liked and were normal teenagers. But in those moments I found myself missing hafiz school, and in particular my classmates. They became my sisters, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/03/veiled-girls-pink-rollercoaster-sabiha-cimens-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>National Gallery, London</strong><br />From Caravaggio’s most explicitly gay painting to an action-packed pages of a superhero comic, this exhibition of art inspired by the roving radical is enrapturing</p><p>In medieval Italy, a wealthy young man called Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone, son of a silk merchant, threw off his worldly identity to become the wandering preacher known to history as Francis of Assisi. Happy in his poverty, communing with nature, speaking to birds, praising Brother Sun and Sister Moon, his radical, joyous version of Christianity challenged a church that had become a system of power and wealth.</p><p>You don’t need to believe to believe in Saint Francis. Francis was the real thing, as innocent and poetic as his portraits, to judge by a letter he wrote to his friend Brother Leo that’s on display in the National Gallery’s enraptured exhibition about this inspiring figure. And his vision is as urgent as it was 800 years ago, seen in surprising finds including a medieval feminist fresco of Poor Clares, as the female Franciscan order was called, and a silvered horn given to Francis as a symbol of peace by Sultan al-Malik al-Kamil.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/03/saint-francis-of-assisi-review-marvel-superhero-bird-loving-roamer">Continue reading...</a>

The reason is, as always, economic. The major Hollywood studios have changed their business model from broadcast to streaming. Once we watched our favorite TV shows by satellite dish; now we watch them over the internet. It doesn’t really change the work, however.</p><p>The studios are, of course, entitled to change their business model. Their goal is to maximize profits – and they’re doing a great job of it. The resulting change has increased studio profits by 39% over the past 10 years. Yet in that same time period, the average writer’s salary has gone down 4%. The pie has gotten larger, but writers’ share of that pie has significantly decreased. Ultimately, the way screenwriters are compensated for their work needs to be updated: we’re being paid according to the old business model, not the new.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/03/why-hollywood-writers-are-striking">Continue reading...</a>

The Democrats will need 218 signatures, which means all 213 Democrats in the chamber will need to sign on along with five Republicans – likely be a difficult task given that McCarthy got 217 for his bill tying a debt ceiling increase with budget cuts, and some Republicans voted against his bill because they wanted more cuts.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is announcing updates to the interest rates today and is expected to raise rates by a quarter-point today, a move that could shake markets.</p><p>Last night, Ayanna Pressley <a href="https://twitter.com/swintersmith/status/1653541538369007617?s=46&amp;t=h2osjeatDG_bQhXArEDDhg">said</a> she joins House Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/02/aoc-dianne-feinstein-should-retire-courts">calling for</a> the resignation of longtime Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein as her absence from the Senate judiciary committee has slowed down the pace of crucial judicial confirmation.

<p><strong>Milton Court, London<br /></strong>Jorinde Keesmaat’s staging of Tom Green’s reworked music-theatre piece is performed with fabulously assured authority by Lucia Lucas and the Ragazze Quartet</p><p>Tom Green’s music-theatre piece has undergone several changes since it began life as a song cycle on poems from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carol-ann-duffy">Carol Ann Duffy’s</a> collection, The World’s Wife. At the request of the <a href="https://ragazzequartet.nl/en/">Ragazze Quartet</a>, Green first planned a concert work for soprano and string quartet, but that soon morphed into a theatre piece for the same combination; in that form it received its first performances under the auspices of the Welsh National Opera in 2017. Since then Green has reworked The World’s Wife for the transgender baritone <a href="https://www.lucialucas.com/">Lucia Lucas</a>, cutting one scene and adding an epilogue based on recordings of interviews with the performers and presenting it in a new staging by <a href="https://jorindekeesmaat.nl/about/">Jorinde Keesmaat</a>.</p><p>Duffy’s poems give voices to the women of history, real and mythic, who have been overshadowed by their male partners, and Green sets 10 of them, including Mrs Aesop (“By Christ, he could bore for Purgatory”), Salome (“I’d done it before and doubtless I’ll do it again, sooner or later”) and Mrs Icarus (“He’s a total, utter, absolute, Grade A pillock”). The tone ranges from the absurd to the bleakly dark, from Mrs Beast entertaining her fellow fairytale characters for a poker night, to Queen Herod fearing for the life of her baby.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/03/the-worlds-wife-review-carol-ann-duffy-tom-green-lucia-lucas-ragazze-quartet">Continue reading...</a>

The Spin may not be about to stand in the street shouting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/30/minister-defends-offensive-coronation-day-oath-to-king-charles">oaths of allegiance</a> to a new king, but that’s because The Spin was taught not to stand in the street swearing at anyone. And be you a coronation watcher or dodger, it’s impossible to ignore the prime cricketing omens embedded in this weekend’s celebrations.</p><p>The last summer a monarch was crowned, England won back the Ashes by playing an entirely new brand of cricket. Admittedly, the style they adopted 70 years ago was rather less dynamic than Bazball. The 1953 Ashes is mostly remembered for the incredible stonewalling of Trevor Bailey, the dead-bat-dick of England-Australia contests, a man whose face launched a thousand forward-defensives. Bailey’s string of tenacious innings led him to be dubbed The Barnacle, which was an improvement for someone whose previous nickname was The Boil.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/03/the-spin-cricket-ashes-coronation-1953-queen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Maryam Touzani’s compassionate and complex film slowly peels back the layers of a marriage between a couple who work together in their dressmaker’s shop</p><p>This tender and sad drama should come with the opposite of a content warning: a reassuring note at the start to explain that no physical harm or public humiliation will come to the gay men whose story we are about to watch. It’s set in Morocco where homosexuality is a criminal offence, and for the first half an hour I assumed the emotional brace position, convinced it would end in arrest or worse for its lead character. But instead, the film’s director Maryam Touzani had put together a gentle, complex film: a love story between a gay man and his wife.</p><p>Ridiculously good-looking Palestinian actor Saleh Bakri’s handsome face is hidden away behind a caterpillar-like moustache to play Halim, a master tailor who makes hand-embroidered women’s caftans. Like Daniel Day-Lewis’s couturier in Phantom Thread, Halim is an obsessive artist, refusing to use a sewing machine and infuriating his rich customers by keeping them waiting for his masterpieces. His elegant wife Mina (Lubna Azabal) runs front of shop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/03/the-blue-caftan-review-tender-moroccan-love-story-between-a-gay-tailor-and-his-wife">Continue reading...</a>

## Can a monarchy sit easy in modern Britain? | Diana Evans

<p>With the queen gone, Charles faces an uphill battle to convince a struggling public this is all still worth it</p><p>“King Charles III” does not roll off the tongue. Almost eight months after he became monarch, and on the eve of his coronation, it still seems difficult to utter this title in full acceptance and seriousness. But of course, it is very serious. It is bank holiday, Westminster Abbey, 1,000-years-of-history, many-millions-of-taxpayers’-money serious. Although we are reminded that this is a less lavish coronation than Elizabeth II’s, it occurs amid dire economic circumstances, of which ordinary people are bearing the brunt. They may be feeling compelled to ask: “Is it worth it?”</p><p>Admittedly, the queen was a tough act to follow. There she was, a constant powdery fixture, waving and smiling when appropriate, addressing the nation from one mansion or another when required, brightly adorned in colourful, near-fluorescent hues as if to prevent us from forgetting her existence. Her head was on the money in crowned profile. We were aware of her every time we used a cash machine, this white-haired great-grandmother dutifully serving in luxury at the expense of the very note you have just extracted from said cash machine, not to mention the financial legacies of empire and colonialism. The morality of the arrangement was always dubious, but the staid undeniability of tea and the queen as two tenets of Britishness endured – sweet, mild, harmless, even while associated with some of the unresolved crimes of history.</p><p>Diana Evans is the author of A House for Alice and Ordinary People</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/03/can-a-monarchy-sit-easy-in-modern-britain">Continue reading...</a>

Written in 2017, its European premiere aptly celebrates the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/23/my-eyes-filled-with-tears-my-voice-shook-simon-callow-on-coming-face-to-face-with-shakespeares-first-folio">Folio’s 400th</a> anniversary.</p><p>We begin in the pub, as ageing lions of the stage sigh into their tankards. It’s three years since Shakespeare died, and his former colleagues John Heminges and Henry Condell fret that youngsters with poor texts and little talent already mangle his works. Shakespeare’s star player, Richard Burbage, knows everything by heart (“that’s the only way you get to tell everyone else what to do”) but when he dies, the friends realise that the words might fade with him. As Heminges warns: “Publish – or vanish.”<br /><br />It’s a risky project: “Half the country can’t read,” grumbles Heminges, “the other half can’t pay.” They battle foul papers and fading memories to assemble the scattered texts. Despite cantankerous printers and with the aid of Tomi Ogbaro’s earnest scribe, who secretly copied his favourite texts, the mighty book comes together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/03/the-book-of-will-review-queens-theatre-hornchurch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From John Steinbeck to Tommy Orange, it’s an old story that keeps on going, in one of the wealthiest countries on Earth. These books help explain why</p><p>For all its wealth and devotion to the myth of the American Dream, the US allows many more of its citizens to live in poverty than other wealthy countries do. We hold the 10th highest poverty rate in a 2021 ranking of OECD countries, with almost 38 million Americans living in poverty. Even that number is calculated using an outdated measure that probably doesn’t fully account for the number of families that are truly struggling. How is it that a country that prides itself on success and progress can allow so many of its citizens to go without? It’s an urgent question we’ve been writing about – failing to solve – for a long time.</p><p>The books about poverty that resonate most for me come in two forms. Novels and narrative nonfiction books often take a personal, sometimes painfully vivid and honest portrayal of a family or individual in a way that can personalise the potentially abstract issue for readers. My own book, The Forgotten Girls, follows in this tradition. To write it, I returned home to my small, poor town in the Arkansas Ozarks after many years of living in big cities on the east coast to find my childhood best friend: through our reconnection, I explored the ways that the different places we lived marked our adult lives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/03/top-10-books-about-being-poor-in-america-the-forgotten-girls-by-monica-potts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tom Hanks’s underwhelming account of a Hollywood film production is a bland busman’s holiday</p><p>‘I make movies because no other labour satisfies my quest to capture an unspoken truth,” says the visionary director at the heart of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomhanks" title="">Tom Hanks</a>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/27/tom-hanks-first-novel-the-making-of-another-motion-picture-masterpiece" title="">debut novel</a>. “One so pure and undiscovered that the audience will slap themselves upside their heads for not having seen it long ago.” The director is giving a motivational pep talk to his beautiful young star. He possesses Solomon’s wisdom and Napoleon’s tactical nous. He’s an inspirational boss; he’s a dynamite kisser. While Hanks has played his fair share of American movie heroes, he’s never played one as head-slappingly awesome as this.</p><p>Bill Johnson, we learn, is in town to shoot a superhero blockbuster called Knightshade: The Lathe of Firefall. The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece duly chronicles its production, chivvying the reader from its 1940s conception through its first iteration as a countercultural comic book all the way to a star-spangled premiere in 21st-century Times Square. In the hands of a lesser mortal, Knightshade would be big, dumb franchise fodder. But Johnson’s an auteur. He means to tear up the rulebook and make the sort of superhero picture no one’s ever seen before. “No capes,” he declares, like Archimedes in his bathtub.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/03/the-making-of-another-major-motion-picture-masterpiece-review-crying-out-for-an-editor">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Violent story of  a man’s doomed efforts to settle back into family life after a shady trip abroad is dynamic but despairing</p><p>This movie from western Ukraine is one of the strangest and fiercest I have seen in a while: dynamic and yet despairing. It does not allude to Russia’s war on Ukraine, but perhaps that conflict is there subtextually, in the sense of tribal loyalty, community tradition and the distinct, almost occult pull towards the west. There is something of Aleksey German or Sergey Loznitsa here, and its lead character is like a more watchful and subdued, though no less violent, version of someone that Emir Kusturica would dream up.</p><p>The setting is Bukovina, in the eastern Carpathian mountains bordering Romania. Oleksandr Yatsentyuk plays Leonid, nicknamed Pamfir (“Stone”), a guy who has just come home from a job in Poland; he makes passionate love to his wife Olena (Solomiia Kyrykova) and then settles happily back down to family life with his son Nazar (Stanislav Potiak), who has evidently grown from his teen years to adulthood while Leonid’s been away. Leonid is looking forward to the local <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jan/15/celebrating-malanka-winter-festival-ukraine-in-pictures">Malanka festival</a>, a faintly sinister, pagan affair of masks and straw capes; without any difficulty Leonid also resumes his regular his job as a water-diviner, detecting sites and digging wells.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/03/pamfir-review-ukrainian-smugglers-dark-return">Continue reading...</a>

## What do horses feel at the Kentucky Derby? Mostly fear and pain

<p>US audiences will be sold a tale of horses battling for glory and adulation at Churchill Downs. But the actual story is far more disturbing</p><p>For a horse, winning means nothing – they don’t even understand the concept. Yet every May US horse racing sells a narrative to draw in the public. The story goes that a group of young horses are locked in gritty pursuit of Triple Crown glory. But trophies, money and adulation are all human-made abstractions. The main concern for a horse is survival.</p><p>To be clear, what <em>people</em> think horses’ feel is not the same as what the horses themselves experience. This is what Dr Stephen Peters, a neuroscientist known for his work with both humans and horses, calls anthropomorphism: attributing human characteristics to an animal.</p><p>Elizabeth Banicki <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/15/medina-spirit-scandal-horse-abuse-bob-baffert">worked for two decades</a> as an exercise rider in the horse racing industry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/03/kentucky-derby-racehorses-deaths-animal-welfare">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A woman’s quest to uncover her family’s difficult past reveals broader truths about the present conflict</p><p>In 2014, Victoria Belim came across a strange entry in her great-grandfather Sergiy’s notebook: “Brother Nikodim, vanished in the 1930s fighting for a free Ukraine.” Who was Nikodim? She had never heard the family talk of him. And why had he vanished? The mystery was made more urgent by Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea and the renewed fight for a free Ukraine. Having left the country at the age of 15, first for the US, then to settle in Brussels, Belim desperately missed it. And now she had a reason to go back: not just to visit her grandmother Valentina but to discover the truth about Nikodim.</p><p>Valentina lived in a village in central Ukraine, where Belim had spent happy years as a child, and was delighted to have her granddaughter back. But whenever she was asked about the past, she shrugged it off: “Now we must think about the future.” She avoided mention of the current war, too, except to complain that it had pushed up food prices. Her one preoccupation was her garden, in particular her cherry orchard, and she harassed Belim to help out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/03/the-rooster-house-by-victoria-belim-review-secrets-and-lies-in-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>

It looks as if the UK financial authorities, prodded by ministers, have concluded that principles are great until they starting costing you business.</p><p>The FCA’s core proposal is to adopt a single class of listed company.

<p>The Uruguay striker has endured a difficult debut season at Anfield and it could be a case of right player at the wrong time</p><p>It was a bizarre moment during a bizarre game. In the 73rd minute of Liverpool’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/30/liverpool-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">4-3 victory over Tottenham</a> on Sunday, Darwin Núñez could be seen receiving instructions from Thiago Alcântara as he prepared to come on as a substitute, the Spanish midfielder taking it upon himself to play coach despite not even being part of Liverpool’s matchday squad. And as he did so Jürgen Klopp, the actual coach, looked on with a mix of confusion and contempt.</p><p>It would, of course, not be the last time Klopp <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/30/jurgen-klopp-accuses-referee-paul-tierney-of-grudge-after-beating-spurs">got annoyed that afternoon</a> and in this case he was perhaps right to be, given that whatever Thiago said to Núñez had no positive effect. The Uruguay forward entered the pitch and ran around with little poise or purpose, and was largely wonky and wasteful in possession. The erratic, ineffective nature of Núñez’s cameo was best summed up by his failed attempt to stop Richarlison from scoring Spurs’s third goal, a flying right-foot challenge that ended up closer to the Brazilian’s head than it did the ball, and all in all it was another display that added to the sense the 23-year-old is increasingly out of place at Anfield.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/03/darwin-nunez-out-in-the-cold-and-looking-out-of-place-at-liverpool">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Delevingne is pretty good and Mipo O’s story of a single mother struggling to stay afloat has impact – but most are on a spectrum between insipid and awful</p><p>Who really likes anthology movies? We’re not talking about multistory films like Short Cuts or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/17/cannes-2014-wild-tales-review-argentinian-portmanteau-movie-is-a-box-of-delights">Wild Tales</a> – those are often good, even great – but those bundles of shorts by different directors. More often than not they are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/26/nightmare-radio-the-night-stalker-review-dj-scares-up-grab-bag-of-horror-stories">lucky-dip packages of horror stories</a>, but there are also more pretentious upmarket ones, held together by some thin thematic connective tissue, like the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/03/7-days-havana-city-anthology">Cities of Love</a> series. Tell It Like a Woman’s only obvious unifying concept is that all the shorts were directed by female directors. It’s depressing for starters that this is still considered enough of a novelty to justify calling attention to it, but it’s also a bummer that the films in this particular rattlebag are mostly sketchy, earnest and dull.</p><p>The opening one, Pepcy &amp; Kim directed by Taraji P Henson, stars Jennifer Hudson as a female prison inmate Kim, who has dissociative identity disorder; her alternate personality (Pepcy) pops up over her shoulder, trying to steer her actions when she’s on the verge of getting released. Hudson’s performance is serviceable if a bit broad, but the editing is hellishly clunky. In Catherine Hardwicke’s Elbows Deep, Dr Tartovi (Marcia Gay Harden) and a nurse don masks and rubber gloves to treat an unhoused woman, Validation (Cara Delevingne, pretty good), who is staying temporarily at a fancy hotel during lockdown in 2020. They remove layer after layer from the mentally ill woman until she’s ready to take a shower, but it’s hard to grasp what the final point is meant to be at the end of this dance of the seven hundred veils and T-shirts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/03/tell-it-like-a-woman-review-cara-delevingne-powers-all-female-short-film-package">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My sister and I started running online life drawing classes during lockdown. When I began to pose for the artists, I found myself liberated</p><p>I wasn’t meant to be a life model. My sister and I had started running online life drawing classes during the first lockdown, and for one portrait class, when a friend couldn’t model, I thought: I’ll just do it. I was born with a cleft lip and palate and all my life I’ve had to endure people staring at me. When you have a visible difference, you can feel the stares on you. Putting myself in front of a group of people, who were there to look and then draw me, felt liberating. I felt as if I was reclaiming the stare – like I was inviting these artists to look at me with positivity and respect, rather than staring to be nosy or hateful.</p><p>I had started to become aware I looked different from other people when I was about four. My parents were conscious that I should be around children who looked like me, and were good at taking me to cleft lip and palate groups, but when I started school I became more aware of my visible difference. Children would have problems with me over nothing – I think because they felt uncomfortable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/03/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-was-bullied-over-my-cleft-palate-but-found-confidence-as-a-life-model">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Robert Brown was given a 26-year sentence in 2011. But he is due to be released in November, without parole or risk assessment. What does this case tell us about attitudes towards domestic homicides?</p><p>The facts are these. At 4pm on a Sunday, Halloween 2010, Robert Brown arrived at the Ascot house of his estranged wife, Joanna Simpson – a house that was the subject of a bitter legal battle, due for its final hearing in a week’s time.</p><p>Brown was returning their two children, nine and 10, after a half-term visit. They ran inside to the family room, leaving their parents in the hallway, where Brown took a hammer he’d packed in the children’s bag and bludgeoned Simpson repeatedly. (Their daughter said she heard “bang, bang, bang” as the blows fell.) There were injuries on Simpson’s hands and her arms where she’d defended herself, fractures and double fractures on her eyes and cheeks, her nose and skull. Brown then lifted her body into the back of his Volvo, covered her in plastic sheeting and returned to the house to disconnect the phone, remove the CCTV system, then collect the children. As they drove away, their son asked if Brown was “taking Mummy to hospital”. Instead, Brown dropped the children back at his home with his current partner, grabbed some items from the garage – duct tape, forensic overalls, plastic overshoes – and drove onwards to Windsor Great Park.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/03/the-killing-of-joanna-simpson-she-was-bludgeoned-and-buried-by-her-husband-why-is-he-being-set-free">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Species, which pre-date dinosaurs, hatch larvae that help clean streams by filtering out matter</p><p>This is the peak season for observing the brook lamprey, <em>Lampetra planeri</em>, breeding in unpolluted shallow streams. Adults will be wound round each other placing fertilised eggs in stony nests built for the purpose. The brook lamprey is the smallest of the three lamprey species <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/15/specieswatch-lamprey-ancient-fish-vertebrate-spawn-british-rivers">found in the UK</a>, at 14 cm long, and is not migratory like its rarer, bigger cousins, the river and sea lampreys, the latter growing up to a metre.</p><p>All three types are remarkable survivors. Lamprey fossils pre-date the dinosaurs by 100m years and are more primitive than most fish in that they do not have bony skeletons but are held together by cartilage, like sharks. After breeding, they die, leaving their eggs to hatch. The larvae drift downstream to find a muddy patch where they burrow and stick their heads out, filtering edible organic matter out of the water, so cleaning the streams in which they live. After three to five years they reach maturity and metamorphose into adult lampreys, growing eyes and a suction disc with blunt teeth, but their digestive system disappears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/03/brook-lamprey-now-is-the-perfect-time-spot-this-ancient-fish-in-uk">Continue reading...</a>
