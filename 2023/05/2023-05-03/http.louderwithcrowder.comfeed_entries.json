Not to you. To wholesalers.</p><blockquote>[Consultant Bump WIlliams]: I don't think [Bud Light's VP] understood who the core Bud Light shopper was.

So it's kinda heartbreaking. Thanks, Annheisuer Busch. I may not be able to feed my family.</blockquote><p>Call me crazy, but I don't think giving away free beer OF THE BEER THAT'S COSTING THEM THEIR LIVELIHOODS is going to make things right. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/budweiser-conservative-ad\" target=\"_blank\">Neither will commercials</a> that are <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-chicken-fried-commercial\" target=\"_blank\">pandering to the point of insulting</a>.</p><p>Anheuser-Busch might want to try the one thing they're trying their best to avoid.

The seaman in question is Yeoman 2nd Class Joshua Kelley on the deck, \"Harpy Daniels\" below the deck. Harpy was brought on as the first \"Navy Digital Ambassador\u201d last November. The Navy is facing a historic recruiting crisis and is attempting different ways to reach younger recruits.</p><blockquote>\u201cAn effort is, indeed, being made to connect recruiting to the interests and concerns of Gen-Z,\u201d Lt.

Presumably, smart people in their administration are now evaluating the initiative before deciding to go further.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"da351\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33588701&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>You have to question who the audience is for this, and there is a degree of \"how do you do fellow kids\" to it. Someone saw on the news that drag queens are popular with the youths and believed by highlighting that the Navy hearts queens too, Zoomers will come a-runnin' to the nearest recruitment office. Even though if you drew a Venn diagram of the 25% of Zoomers who claim they are LGBTQAIIP+EIEIO now vs people who hate the military-industrial complex, you'd have most of a circle.</p><p>Rumors of the Department of Defense sending Dylan Mulvaney on a USO tour with Hologram Bob Hope saying \"a reminder of what you boys are fighting for\" could not be confirmed at this time. Though I'm sure Dylan would slay in whatever Dylan was wearing.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
