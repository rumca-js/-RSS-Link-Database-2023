<p>Researchers at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (along with collaborators in Sweden, Germany and the UK) have <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2023-05-03-researchers-capture-elusive-missing-step-final-act-photosynthesis">shed new light</a> on the final step of photosynthesis. They observed in atomic detail how Photosystem II, a protein complex found in plants, undergoes a transformation that leads to the loss of an extra oxygen atom. Scientists believe the discoveries will help provide a roadmap for optimizing clean energy sources. “It’s really going to change the way we think about Photosystem II,” said Uwe Bergmann, scientist and professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who co-authored the paper.</p><p>Researchers took “extremely high-resolution images” of different stages of the process (at room temperature), giving them new insight into specifically how and where the oxygen is produced. Baseball can provide a simple (if somewhat forced) metaphor to illustrate the process. “The center cycles through four stable oxidation states, known as S0 through S3, when exposed to sunlight,” SLAC explains. “On a baseball field, S0 would be the start of the game when a player on home base is ready to go to bat. S1-S3 would be players on first, second, and third.” Based on this metaphor, a batter making contact to advance the runners signifies the complex absorbing a sunlight photon. “When the fourth ball is hit, the player slides into home, scoring a run or, in the case of Photosystem II, releasing one molecule of breathable oxygen.” It’s that final stage (S4, between third base and sliding home in our metaphor) that they imaged for the first time, where two oxygen atoms bond to release an oxygen molecule, revealing additional steps previously unseen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The video below illustrates the team’s process and discoveries.</p><div id="8273eeda7311480eabec310797a60bd5"></div><p>“Most of the process that produces breathable oxygen happens in this last step,” said Vittal Yachandra, a scientist at Berkeley Lab and co-author of the paper, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zNDE1ODYtMDIzLTA2MDM4LXoiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImYxOWMzMTQ3LWJlMzktNDdjZi1iNjNjLWIxODBjZWJiMWRjNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVzaYpC_iAcgQGro1N_5FOcjxQkmojqxM2XXmKgKzCAc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06038-z">published in</a><em>Nature</em>. “But there are several things happening at different parts of Photosystem II and they all have to come together in the end for the reaction to succeed. Just like how in baseball, factors like the location of the ball and the position of the basemen and fielders affect the moves a player takes to get to home base, the protein environment around the catalytic center influences how this reaction plays out.”</p><p>The researchers expect an X-ray upgrade later this year to shed more light on the process. It will use a repetition rate of up to a million pulses per second, up from the 120 per second used in this experiment. “With these upgrades, we will be able to collect several days’ worth of data in just a few hours,” Bergmann said. “We will also be able to use soft X-rays to further understand the chemical changes happening in the system. These new capabilities will continue to drive this research forward and shed new light on photosynthesis.”</p><p>The team believes the results will help them “develop artificial photosynthetic systems that mimic photosynthesis to harvest natural sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into hydrogen and carbon-based fuels.” Jan Kern, another co-author and scientist at Berkley Lab, said, “The more we learn about how nature does it, the closer we get to using those same principles in human-made processes, including ideas for artificial photosynthesis as a clean and sustainable energy source.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/scientists-observe-elusive-missing-step-in-photosynthesis-final-stage-214947146.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> is rolling out a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gmail/"><ins>Gmail</ins></a> feature that aims to help you figure out whether a sender is genuine or if they may be a scammer. When you receive an email from a company that has verified its identity, you'll see a blue check next to their name in your inbox.</p><p>The checkmark update is Google's latest implementation of the Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) tech. Google started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmail-bimi-logo-verified-025752904.html"><ins>testing BIMI in Gmail in 2020</ins></a>. At first, it enabled brands that were enrolled in BIMI to include authenticated logos in their emails. The blue check is a perhaps more obvious indicator that the sender is legitimate.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When you hover over the blue check in Gmail, you'll see a pop-up that reads &quot;The sender of this email has verified that they own [the domain was sent from] and the logo in the profile image.&quot; The pop-up includes a link that directs you to a page with more information.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshot of a Gmail inbox, showing a blue check mark next to the email sender's name (Google, in this case).

## Google is replacing Chrome's lock icon because most people don't know what it means

<p>Do you know what the lock icon in your web browser means? If not, you're far from alone. Google now plans to <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2023/05/an-update-on-lock-icon.html">replace</a> the lock next to the address in Chrome with a variant of the &quot;tune&quot; icon you see below. Simply put, most people don't understand it. According to Google's research, only 11 percent of users realize that it refers to HTTPS encryption. Many others think it means the site is trustworthy — a problem when even phishing sites use the technology.</p><p>The tune icon doesn't imply trustworthiness, Google says. Instead, it signals that security is the default state. It also invites a click, making it more likely that you'll use site controls. Many people never even realized they could click the lock, according to the company.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Google Chrome 'tune' icon" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/beef1f20-e9e8-11ed-bf93-eeeb57d7a1c2" style="height: 640px; width: 640px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Most users will see the replacement icon in Chrome 117 on Android and desktop, which is scheduled to arrive early in September. As you can't tap the icon in Chrome for iOS, Google is pulling the icon entirely on Apple's mobile platforms. If you just can't wait, you can see the icon now in Chrome Canary if you enable the Chrome Refresh 2023 flag.</p><p>The change is overdue in some respects. Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chrome-90-https-secure-browsing-031843815.html">defaulted to HTTPS</a> web connections in Chrome 90 two years ago, and that came months after Mozilla made a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/firefox-83-https-only-mode-093501278.html">similar change in Firefox</a>. Over 95 percent of page loads in Chrome for Windows use HTTPS, the company adds. Much like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/japan-digital-minister-no-more-floppy-disks-fax-machines-123207491.html">floppy disk</a> icon sometimes used to represent file saves, the lock is a relic from another era.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-is-replacing-chromes-lock-icon-because-most-people-dont-know-what-it-means-194503194.html?src=rss

## Airbnb refocuses on cheap rooms as its rentals get pricier

<p>The pandemic is over, according to Airbnb (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90862194/covid-19-pandemic-three-years-ending-over-when">that's debatable</a>), so the company is gearing up for a massive summer of vacationing. It's <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/2023-summer-release/">introducing over 50 new features to its rental platform</a>, including an expansion of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-improved-price-transparency-152910440.html">more transparent pricing it unveiled last year</a>. Most importantly, though, it's refocusing on the pitch that made the company a success: Being able to easily rent low-cost rooms. It's relaunching that experience as &quot;Airbnb Rooms,&quot; which will make it easier to find private rooms, as well as offer more details up-front to potential renters.&nbsp;</p><p>A new &quot;Host Passport&quot; feature will help you get to know hosts before booking, a useful feature since you'll most likely be sharing their living space. Listings can also show if a bedroom has its own lock, and if the bathrooms are private or shared with the host. “Airbnb Rooms are often more affordable than hotels, and they’re the most authentic way to experience a city,&quot; Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said in a statement. &quot;This is the soul of Airbnb.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company says it'll have over a million Airbnb Rooms listings, and that more than 80 percent of them will cost under $100 a night. Given how much Airbnb prices have skyrocketed over the last few years, as hosts pumped up cleaning costs and built mini-rental empires, it makes sense for the company to highlight its more affordable offerings. For many travelers, including this reporter, hotels often seem cheaper and easier to book than many Airbnb options.&nbsp;</p><p>As for other upgrades, Airbnb will also let you view checkout instructions before completing a booking (which could be a useful red flag for potential nightmare hosts), it's improved map performance and revamped  wishlists completely (including the ability to write notes). The company is also reducing service fees for stays longer than three months, as well as for stays longer than a month if you pay with a linked bank account. Not surprisingly, Airbnb is also getting into the pay over time game with a new partnership with Klarna.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-refocuses-on-cheap-rooms-as-its-rentals-get-pricier-192901723.html?src=rss

Per <em>The Times</em>, a Munich state court said on Wednesday that Stadler would also pay a €1.1 million fine and serve a sentence of up to two years. The former executive is expected to make his confession in about two weeks.</p><p>Since the start of his trial in 2020, Stadler had maintained he was innocent of any wrongdoing. In court, Volkswagen has insisted that Dieselgate was the work of employees who hid the software they created from the company’s leadership. While at Audi, Stadler also served as a member of Volkswagen’s management board. Alongside Stadler, German prosecutors are set to convict two other former executives: Wolfgang Hatz and Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio.

According to court documents filed by German prosecutors, Audi engineers originally designed the software that Volkswagen would later deploy in its vehicles.

<p>We’ve known there was a reboot coming of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/babylon-5-reboot-cw-still-alive-103501531.html"><ins>1990s sci-fi cult hit </ins><em><ins>Babylon 5</ins></em></a> for a while now, but we didn’t have any concrete details until today. Original series creator J. Michael Straczynski just announced that it’s an <a href="https://twitter.com/straczynski/status/1653799076641779712"><ins>animated feature length film</ins></a> developed by Warner Bros. Animation.</p><p>Straczynski is quiet regarding plot details but did say that the movie is “classic <em>B5</em>” with a “raucous, heartfelt” story, going on to suggest that the cartoon feature is “the most <em>B5</em>-ish” project since the original series bowed out in 1998. He also said that the movie is completely finished and just awaiting release. In other words, it’ll likely be a matter of months, not years, before mega-fans get their eyeballs on this one.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="9342882f191f4993be75ee0e79f899f3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">BABYLON 5 ANIMATED MOVIE coming from Warner Bros.

If the film is “in the can”, as Straczynski says, here’s hoping we also get a trailer or at least some animation stills with that release date announcement. It’s still unknown which original series actors, if any, will reprise their roles for the film.</p><p><em>Babylon 5</em> was originally on the air for five seasons, which was followed up by five made-for-TV movies (the last one aired in 2002). The show has long-been praised for its commitment to hard sci-fi and revolving crew of motley characters, netting two Hugo Awards and a Saturn Award during its run. It’s primarily set on the titular space station, calling to mind rival sci-fi epic <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em>. There’s some discussion as to which series came first, as <em>DS9</em> aired a full year before <em>Babylon 5,</em> but <em>B5</em> was first to production. In recent years, series creator Straczynski has been heavily involved with shows like <em>Sense8</em> and plenty of high-profile comic books.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/babylon-5-will-return-as-an-animated-movie-from-its-original-creator-184454424.html?src=rss

## Finnish newspaper hopes to pierce Russian propaganda with a ‘CS: GO’ map

<p>A Finnish newspaper is celebrating World Press Freedom Day today by walking the walk. <em>Helsingin Sanomat</em>, Finland’s biggest daily paper, created a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-06-cs-go-danger-zone-f2p-battleroyale.html"><em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em></a> map containing a secret room. Inside the hidden blood-red chamber, players find real-world multimedia storytelling about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — sneaking some much-needed journalism into a country inundated with propaganda.</p><p>The developers that the newspaper worked with on the map left some clues for Russian players to find it. First, it takes place in an unnamed battleground location imitating “a Slavic city.” Additionally, the map’s name, <em>de_voyna</em>, is a reference to the Russian word “voyna,” which translates to “war.” (That description is prohibited in Russia when describing the invasion; Putin's government insists on calling it a “special military operation”).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Video game screenshot from &#x002018;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.&#x002019; On the side of a war-torn building is a dark passageway with a light over its entrance. A flaming car sits in the foreground." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/bbbc7340-e9dc-11ed-bc3e-e017ad919dab" style="height: 1440px; width: 2560px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Helsingin Sanomat / Valve</div></figure><p>The obscured room also has several hints to help Russian players find it: It’s located near an eternal flame monument (a burning car), a traditional practice commemorating WWII (or “the Great Patriotic War” as it’s known in Russia) that will be familiar to Russians. A light also hangs above the entrance, another breadcrumb indicating the dark passageway may differ from others nearby. Finally, players can spot the room by moving the camera around after an in-game death.</p><p>After walking down the stairway entrance, players see a darkly lit room with red lights hanging from the ceiling, casting a foreboding crimson tone over the space. Next, players see a headline on the wall opposite the entrance, reading: “Counterstrike of the Free Press.” Nearby, a map reveals civilian targets hit by Russian armies. Additionally, three walls are covered with images from real-life news stories showing some of Russia’s atrocities: the Bucha massacre (where the Russian military executed Ukrainian civilians in the street and buried them in a mass grave), a story of a man whose family was killed by a Russian cruise missile and a count of the estimated 70,000 Russian soldiers killed in the war. Finally, a Russian-language radio voice-over tells each story when moving closer to a news item.</p><figure><img alt="Video-game screenshot of a red-hued bunker with a map on the opposite wall. A title above the map reads, &#x002018;Russian Strikes on Civilian Targets 2022-2023.&#x002019;" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/55def500-e9de-11ed-baf6-42f3fe9df70c" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Helsingin Sanomat / Valve</div></figure><p>The unnamed (to avoid harassment or worse) game designers that <em>Helsingin Sanomat</em> worked with had experience designing hundreds of <em>CS: GO</em> maps. They pitched in “to be able to be involved in making such a map with a humanitarian purpose connected to the real world,” they told the publication. “Russia’s senseless aggression on Ukraine has killed tens of thousands of civilians, including children. The least we can do is to bring Putin’s war crimes and Russian propaganda to light.”</p><p><em>Helsingin Sanomat</em> editor-in-chief Antero Mukka <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/finnish-daily-uses-shooter-videogame-dodge-russias-press-restrictions-2023-05-03/">told</a><em>Reuters</em> that his paper didn’t ask for publisher Valve’s permission to include the map since the game encourages user-created content. “If some young men in Russia, just because of this game, happen to think for a couple of seconds what is going on in Ukraine then it's worth it,” he said.</p><p>If you want to assist with the cause, Helsingin Sanomat recommends playing the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2969831273"><em>de_voyna map</em></a>, which should help increase its in-game visibility. Although it’s hard to imagine the locale remaining playable for long after Putin’s government learns about it, it’s an inspiring — and highly creative — way of defying the authoritarian regime’s free-press restrictions.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/finnish-newspaper-hopes-to-pierce-russian-propaganda-with-a-cs-go-map-182944369.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/meta/"><ins>Meta</ins></a> is in hot water with the Federal Trade Commission once again after the agency <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/05/ftc-proposes-blanket-prohibition-preventing-facebook-monetizing-youth-data"><ins>proposed more sanctions</ins></a> against the company, which has allegedly failed to fully comply with a 2020 privacy order. Among other things, the agency has proposed a blanket ban on monetizing data Meta collects from users aged under 18, whether they use Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Quest virtual reality headsets.</p><p>The proposed sanctions, which the FTC seeks to apply as part of an update to the 2020 order, include a ban on Meta launching new products, services and features unless an assessor confirms that the company is in full compliance with its obligations. Additionally, Meta would have to get explicit consent from users before employing facial recognition tech. All of these measures, plus others the FTC has proposed to strengthen aspects of the 2020 order, would apply to companies that Meta buys or merges with.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The FTC issued the most recent privacy order, which is in place for 20 years, as part of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-24-facebook-will-pay-5-billion-fine-for-cambridge-analytica-data-b.html"><ins>a $5 billion settlement</ins></a> that Meta (then known as Facebook) reached with the agency over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. At the time, the FTC determined that Meta had broken a 2012 order concerning user data privacy. Along with allegedly failing to comply with the 2020 order, Meta has violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), according to the FTC.</p><p>“Facebook has repeatedly violated its privacy promises,” Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. “The company’s recklessness has put young users at risk, and Facebook needs to answer for its failures.”</p><p>Among other things, Meta allegedly misled parents over how much control they have over who their children can communicate with through the Messenger Kids app. The FTC says that, between 2017 and mid-2019, children were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-06-facebook-childrens-privacy-safety-concerns.html"><ins>able to chat with unapproved contacts through the app</ins></a> in violation of the 2012 order and COPPA.</p><p>Moreover, the agency says that Meta continued to provide third-party developers access to user data, despite pledging in 2018 to revoke access to the information if users hadn't accessed their apps within a 90-day period. According to the FTC, Meta allowed third-party developers to maintain access to user data in certain situations until some point in 2020.</p><p>An assessor that the FTC appointed to ensure Meta's compliance with the 2020 order found that there were several flaws with the company's privacy program. In its <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/C4365-Commission-Order-to-Show-Cause-%28Redacted-Public%29.pdf"><ins>Order to Show Cause</ins></a>, the FTC said that &quot;the breadth and significance of these deficiencies pose substantial risks to the public.&quot;</p><p>Moreover, the agency says that Meta continued to provide third-party developers access to user data despite pledging in 2018 to revoke access to the information if users hadn't accessed their apps within a 90-day period. According to the FTC, Meta allowed third-party developers to maintain access to user data in certain situations until some point in 2020.</p><p>Meta has called the FTC's move &quot;a political stunt.&quot; Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the potential impact on its business, Meta is gearing up for a legal battle with the agency. &quot;Despite three years of continual engagement with the FTC around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory,&quot; the company said in a statement that spokesperson Andy Stone <a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1653812002819649536"><ins>shared on Twitter</ins></a>.</p><p>&quot;Let's be clear about what the FTC is trying to do: usurp the authority of Congress to set industry-wide standards and instead single out one American company while allowing Chinese companies, like TikTok, to operate without constraint on American soil. FTC Chair Lina Khan's insistence on using any measure — however baseless — to antagonize American business has reached a new low. We have spent vast resources building and implementing an industry-leading privacy program under the terms of our FTC agreement. We will vigorously fight this action and expect to prevail.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-ftc-wants-to-ban-meta-from-profiting-from-kids-data-180720686.html?src=rss

## New ‘Double Dragon’ game trailer promises nostalgic beat-em-up thrills

<p>The original <em>Double Dragon</em> basically invented co-op beat-em-up action in 1987, and now modern players are about to get a dose of nostalgic side-scrolling goodness thanks to a new franchise installment. <em>Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons </em>launches this fall for every major platform, including PC, Xbox consoles, PlayStation 4 and 5 and the Nintendo Switch.</p><p>What to expect from this installment? The trailer suggests a return to the tried-and-true beat-em-up formula. There’s a nice retro pixelated art style, 13 playable characters to choose from and, of course, two-player local co-op. The new title <a href="https://doubledragongaiden.com/"><ins>also includes a tag-team ability,</ins></a> so you actually play as two characters at once.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="007273e5e1ca4e87b67854e6f22a67ee"></div><p>Developer Modus Games is teasing some roguelite elements, like a dynamic mission select feature that randomizes stage length, enemy number and difficulty. This is also a 2023 console game and not an arcade machine from the 1980s, so expect purchasable upgrades and some light RPG mechanics.</p><p>As for the plot, the years haven’t been kind to series protagonists Jimmy and Billy Lee. The sequel finds New York City devastated by nuclear war, which leads to gangs of hooligans roaming the radioactive streets. You know what happens next (you beat them up). It remains to be seen if your avatars can beat up that long nuclear winter.</p><p>Modus Games isn't a well-known developer but it has plenty of well-regarded indie titles under its belt, like <em>Afterimage</em> and <em>Teslagrad 2.</em> The trailer looks cool, so this is worth keeping an eye on, especially given that there hasn’t been a <em>Double Dragon</em> game <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-26-a-new-double-dragon-game-is-on-its-way-next-month.html">since the long ago days of 2016.</a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/new-double-dragon-game-trailer-promises-nostalgic-beat-em-up-thrills-175831891.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ea/">EA</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/codemasters">Codemasters</a> have revealed more details about this year's edition of their Formula 1 racing sim series. <em>F1 2023 </em>will hit PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC via the EA App, Steam and Epic Games Store on June 16th.</p><p>Among other things, the game will feature the return of the Braking Point story mode. Braking Point <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f1-2021-release-date-trailer-ea-codemasters-173514272.html">debuted in <em>F1 2021</em></a>, but it wasn't present in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/e-as-new-f-1-game-launches-july-1-124016175.html">last year's edition</a>. This time around, Devon Butler (the antagonist from the first chapter) and Aiden Jackson are now teammates on an upstart racing team looking to take on F1's heavy hitters. You can expect to encounter new characters, challenges and rivalries.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b98645f9766645f7a00f26ff97c4f67e"></div><p>Codemasters has updated the cars' handling based on feedback from F1 teams. The cars are said to have more predictable behavior this time around, along with more traction when braking, accelerating and navigating corners. The studio has also improved the engine torque and inertia, balanced the aerodynamics and tire grip for added realism and incorporated Precision Drive tech for controller players, EA says.</p><p>Every team, driver and circuit from F1's real-life 2023 season is in the game, including the street circuit for the new Las Vegas Grand Prix and Qatar's Lusail International Circuit. Legacy circuits Paul Ricard (France), Shanghai (China), and Portimão (Portugal) will all be available from the jump too.</p><p>Players will be able to set races to 35 percent of their real-life distances. That should offer more flexibility to those who may not have the time for a standard-length grand prix. On top of all that, it's somehow taken until 2023 for EA to add red flags, a major aspect of F1 races, to the series.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/f1-23-will-arrive-on-june-16th-171249183.html?src=rss

## First 'Dune: Part Two' trailer sees Timothée Chalamet catching a ride on a sandworm

<p>Praise, Shaï-Hulud. Warner Bros. has shared the first trailer for <em>Dune: Part Two, </em>and if you were a fan of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-movie-review-cinema-hbo-max-173051367.html">Denis Villeneuve's adaption</a> of the first half of Frank Herbert's seminal sci-fi novel, let's just say <em>Part Two</em> looks like it will be even better. The teaser opens with Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and Chani (Zendaya) talking about the future of Arrakis. &quot;Where you see sand here, imagine water. If you dive in, you can't reach the bottom,&quot; Paul tells an incredulous Chani.&nbsp;</p><div id="ba3599d05d7546a499c2798f25b661cc"></div><p>Following that exchange, the trailer offers us our first look at Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan. Her character didn't make an appearance in <em>Dune: Part One, </em>but judging from the clip, Irulan will at least narrate some of the story, a change that could bring the movie closer to Herbert's 1965 novel. Another critical character that wasn't in <em>Part One</em> but makes an appearance in the trailer is Feyd-Rautha, played here by Austin Butler.  <em>Dune: Part Two </em>will arrive in theaters on November 3rd. Unlike the first film, Warner Bros does not plan to simultaneously release <em>Part Two </em>to the soon-to-be-renamed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-will-just-be-called-max-when-it-folds-in-discovery-171611258.html">HBO Max</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/first-dune-part-two-trailer-sees-timothee-chalamet-catching-a-ride-on-a-sandworm-170208358.html?src=rss

## Senators reintroduce COPPA 2.0 bill to tighten child safety online

<p>Yet more senators are trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-earn-it-act-will-be-introduced-to-congress-for-the-third-time-192619083.html">resurrect legislation</a> aimed at protecting kids' online privacy. Senators Bill Cassidy and Ed Markey have <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-cassidy-reintroduce-coppa-20-bipartisan-legislation-to-protect-online-privacy-of-children-and-teens">reintroduced</a> a &quot;COPPA 2.0&quot; (Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act) bill that would expand and revise the 1998 law to deal with the modern internet, particularly social media.</p><p>COPPA 2.0 would bar companies from gathering personal data from teens aged 13 to 16 without their consent. It would ban all targeted advertising to children and teens, and create a &quot;bill of rights&quot;  that limits personal info gathering for marketing purposes. The measure would also require a button to let kids and parents delete personal data when it's &quot;technologically feasible.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The sequel potentially makes it easier to take action in the first place. Where COPPA requires direct knowledge that companies are collecting data from kids under 13, 2.0 would cover apps and services that are &quot;reasonably likely&quot; to have children as users. The Federal Trade Commission, meanwhile, would have to establish a division committed to regulating youth marketing and privacy.</p><p>Cassidy and Markey portray the bill as necessary to tackle a &quot;mental health crisis&quot; where tech giants allegedly play a role. The politicians argue that social networks <a href="https://www.engadget.com/seattle-schools-sue-tik-tok-meta-and-other-platforms-over-youth-mental-health-crisis-090607723.html">amplify teens' negative feelings</a>, pointing to Facebook's own research as evidence.</p><p>Social networks have tried to clamp down on misuses of child data. Meta's Facebook and Instagram have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-ad-targeting-limits-181607863.html">limited ad targeting for teens</a>, for instance. However, there have also been concerns that online platforms haven't gone far enough. On top of earlier calls for bans on ad targeting, states like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arkansas-passes-social-media-law-requiring-age-verification-230716388.html">Arkansas</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/utah-passes-laws-requiring-parental-permission-for-teens-to-use-social-media-223302739.html">Utah</a> have already passed laws respectively requiring age verification and parental permission for social media. Another Senate bill, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-bill-would-require-parental-consent-for-teens-to-use-social-media-172601557.html">Protecting Kids on Social Media Act</a>, would require parents' approval across the US.</p><p>Whether or not COPPA 2.0 makes it to the President's desk for signature isn't clear. The first attempt got <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1628/actions">stuck in committee</a> ahead of the current Congress session. It also comes right as other senators are making attempts to revive the EARN IT Act (aimed at curbing child sexual abuse material) and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-group-reintroduces-a-revised-kids-online-safety-act-212117992.html">Kids Online Safety Act</a> (meant to fight toxic online content as a whole). All three reintroductions are bipartisan, but they'll need considerably stronger support in the Senate, plus successful equivalents in the House, to become law.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/senators-reintroduce-coppa-20-bill-to-tighten-child-safety-online-165043087.html?src=rss

<p>For the third time in less than a year, Unity is laying off a part of its workforce. On Tuesday, the company shared it would let go of approximately 600 employees or about eight percent of its global workforce. The company previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unity-lays-off-four-percent-of-its-workforce-051606470.html"><ins>laid off about 225 staffers</ins></a> last June, and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-software-to-lay-off-nearly-300-employees"><ins>another 284 employees</ins></a> at the start of the year. Prior to the first round of workforce reductions, the company employed more than 8,000 staff. It now has around 7,000 employees. Unity also plans to reduce the number of offices it operates globally.</p><p>Unity declined to comment. A spokesperson instead pointed Engadget to a filing the company made with the <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001810806/76175bee-6430-4f62-a6ab-5b0cc4beccb4.pdf"><ins>US Securities and Exchange Commission</ins></a>, as well as a recent interview CEO John Riccitiello did with <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy91bml0eS1jb25kdWN0cy1pdHMtdGhpcmQtYW5kLWxhcmdlc3Qtcm91bmQtb2YtbGF5b2Zmcy1pbi1hLXllYXItNDhmZGFmZTEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ3OTQ3Mzg4LWU2YTEtNDg1MC1hNWY1LWIzZDM4MDljZWQyZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaUAXtriJxgyScdwsq3sQ58zUtwvi5sRvdnUQzSiAm20&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Funity-conducts-its-third-and-largest-round-of-layoffs-in-a-year-48fdafe1"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. “It’s all about setting ourselves up for higher growth,” he told the outlet, adding the layoffs would affect some in middle management. “It was clear we had too many layers.” Riccitiello also said Unity would move to a hybrid work model starting in June, with employees expected to work from the office at least three days a week.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The layoffs come despite Unity recently posting its best fiscal quarter and year in company history. In February, the engine maker <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=eb405808-1409-406e-be17-d5f705e9e3ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Unity&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlYjQwNTgwOC0xNDA5LTQwNmUtYmUxNy1kNWY3MDVlOWUzZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly91bml0eS5jb20vb3VyLWNvbXBhbnkvbmV3c3Jvb20vdW5pdHktYW5ub3VuY2VzLWZvdXJ0aC1xdWFydGVyLWFuZC1mdWxsLXllYXItMjAyMi1maW5hbmNpYWwtcmVzdWx0cyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDc5NDczODgtZTZhMS00ODUwLWE1ZjUtYjNkMzgwOWNlZDJmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYdA61cNDJRd2Hbg5VDg-X7y5vrjhxErYV9KJXLEnGTK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Funity.com%2Four-company%2Fnewsroom%2Funity-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-financial-results">reported a Q4 revenue of $451 million</a>, representing a 43 percent increase from the same period in 2021. It was also Unity’s first profitable quarter as a publicly traded company. Despite that performance, investors don’t appear to be impressed with the company.

The company is expected to release its Q1 earnings next week. Unity’s latest layoffs come amid broader workforce reductions across much of the tech industry.

However, some influencers have claimed that the Creator Fund only paid a few dollars for videos with millions of views. TikTok didn’t specify how much more the new system pays, but it says it’s based on feedback from the Creator Fund and is designed to “generate higher revenue potential.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apart from the follower and recent-view count requirements, the Creativity Program Beta also says participants must “create and publish high-quality, original content longer than one minute.” In addition, the company says eligible creators can track video eligibility in an updated dashboard, where they can also see their estimated revenue and performance metrics.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tiktoks-new-monetization-program-is-now-available-for-all-eligible-us-creators-161555027.html?src=rss

<p>Even though <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/fortnite/"><em>Fortnite</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>was exiled from Apple and Google's mobile app stores <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-fortnite-190920925.html">years</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-android-225437892.html">ago</a>, there are still ways for you to play the all-conquering battle royale on your phone or tablet, thanks to the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-free-iphone-ipad-android-164349771.html">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-130054958.html">GeForce Now</a>. Starting today, <em>Fortnite </em>will also be available on another cloud gaming service.

You can access it if you have an Amazon Prime or Luna+ subscription. It's worth noting, however, that GeForce Now users on the free tier have a one-hour time limit per session.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b0d1f909de784a868c875d9117004384"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is your fight now. <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FortniteGame</a> welcome to Luna 💜 <br /><br />Play <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FortniteOnLuna?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FortniteOnLuna</a> with Prime or a Luna+ Subscription:   <a href="https://t.co/NQWgjqYqK8">https://t.co/NQWgjqYqK8</a><a href="https://t.co/0mHoOl2ysU">pic.twitter.com/0mHoOl2ysU</a></p>— Amazon Luna (@amazonluna) <a href="https://twitter.com/amazonluna/status/1653766434198003712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Whichever cloud gaming service you use to play <em>Fortnite</em>, you'll need to sign in to an Epic Games account.

There are several notable games on Luna+ as well, including the likes of <em>Control, Alien Isolation, Devil May Cry 5,</em> the <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>and <em>3</em> remakes and <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>. There's a seven-day free trial available, after which Luna+ costs $10 per month.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 5/3/2023 12:04PM ET: </strong>Clarifying that <em>Fortnite </em>will be available indefinitely on Luna for Prime members as well as Luna+ subscribers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-lands-on-amazon-luna-151947469.html?src=rss

## OBS can now stream high-quality AV1 video to YouTube

<p>High-quality video won't make or break a livestream, but it certainly helps — and now it's considerably easier to provide. OBS Studio 29.1 is now <a href="https://obsproject.com/blog/obs-studio-29-release-notes">available</a> with support for AV1 stream encoding when broadcasting to YouTube. While YouTube treats the feature as a beta, it enables higher-quality footage than H.264 at similar bitrates, and higher resolutions if you have the headroom. As creator EposVox <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1iWmp0b0NCbGExZyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODY5MDA2NDctYTdhMS00NDFjLWFmZjMtMjU3M2UzMTQ2MTEwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcyagnN37QXwBYTuoEstK2or1i-ZgQw7AuKdkBnKZPdk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbZjtoCBla1g">demonstrates</a>, you can effectively eliminate visual artifacts with 1080p 60FPS video or jump to 4K at the same frame rate without consuming significantly more bandwidth than a 1080p H.264 feed.</p><p>The improvement relies on the new Enhanced RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) standard, which extends the existing approach to handle newer video formats.

YouTube, meanwhile, hasn't said when its support will be widely available. However, the change hints at a future where creators can stream video that looks about as good to viewers as it does on the host's PC.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/obs-can-now-stream-high-quality-av1-video-to-youtube-145506980.html?src=rss

## The best gifts for grads under $50

<p>Gifting can be difficult at any time, but it’s been particularly hard over the past couple of years. You may still be working with a tight budget, but you also want to give that grad in your life something that can help make the transition to post-school life a bit easier (and more fun). The tech gifts that come to mind immediately — iPhones, smartwatches, game consoles and the like — are not exactly budget-friendly. But there are handy gadgets out there that won’t drain your wallet. Here’s Engadget’s list of the best tech gifts under $50 for new graduates.</p><h2>Anker Nano Pro 20W</h2><p></p><p>Anker’s latest 20W charger will be a handy gift for any grad. More often than not, the new gadgets we buy today don’t come with AC adapters, so having an extra on hand can’t hurt. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Bbmtlci1DaGFyZ2VyLUR1cmFibGUtQ29tcGFjdC1JbmNsdWRlZC9kcC9CMDk5RjU1OFMxP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdzEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRiMGFkODAyLTBhZWEtM2VlNC1iZWM5LTAxNjAwZDJhMjk4NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaJWw5xAq9OLVixMcA3IGQdJvnmbFWMbxCTMxrsgqV7o&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-Charger-Durable-Compact-Included%2Fdp%2FB099F558S1%3Fth%3D1">Nano Pro</a> can fast-charge the latest iPhones to 50 percent in only 25 minutes, plus it’s smaller than Apple’s own 20W adapter. It also has advanced features like a Dynamic Temperature Sensor, which keeps the charger from overheating, and a power tuner chip, which adjusts power output depending on the connected device. It may not be the trendiest graduation gift, but it’s one that your grad will likely take with them to work, on vacations and elsewhere.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Blink Mini</h2><p></p><p>New graduates moving out into a new apartment will feel a certain peace of mind knowing they can keep an eye on their abode while they’re out all day. That’s especially true for any that have pets patiently waiting for them at home. A <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CbGluay1NaW5pLVdoaXRlLTFDYW0vZHAvQjA3WDZDOVJNRj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby13MS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGIwYWQ4MDItMGFlYS0zZWU0LWJlYzktMDE2MDBkMmEyOTg1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZfmFcir_5pR4zVsLGrstGJJWHWAJh9BZuLo5YsHIBmW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlink-Mini-White-1Cam%2Fdp%2FB07X6C9RMF">Blink Mini</a> security camera has all of the features they’d need to check in every once in a while, and it’s footprint is so small that they’ll easily be able to find a place for it. The camera will record 1080p video when it senses motion, and it’ll send an alert to your grad’s phone so they can view the footage. It also supports two-way audio, so they can comfort their furry friends with their voices as needed. And while Blink does have a subscription plan that lets you store video clips to the cloud, it’s not necessary if you’re just using the camera as a second pair of eyes. Plus, you can download any video clips you want to save to your phone for safe keeping.</p><h2>8Bitdo Pro 2</h2><p></p><p>We’ve been fans of 8Bitdo’s affordable, multi-platform controllers for quite some time, and the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhYWTg2NDcyP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXcxLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YjBhZDgwMi0wYWVhLTNlZTQtYmVjOS0wMTYwMGQyYTI5ODUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAW6FzqrPS5f7Mkd-ge1PHZ3PkNXLstzkUnM4dnR1gjGv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08XY86472%3F">$50 Pro 2</a> is no exception. You can use it with the Nintendo Switch and on Windows, macOS, Android and Raspberry Pi, and you’re able to map functions to buttons using its companion smartphone app. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/8-bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-150053234.html">Pro 2</a> also adds new bumper buttons under each arm, something the previous version did not have. In general, 8Bitdo’s controllers are more ergonomic than, say, relying on a keyboard and mouse when playing PC games. They’re also a dramatic improvement over the Switch’s Joy-Cons which, if we’re honest, aren’t the most comfortable controllers to use for long stretches of time. The Pro 2 charges up via USB-C, but you can also remove the battery pack and replace it with AA batteries if you know you won’t be able to charge up frequently.</p><h2>Cosori Stainless steel electric kettle</h2><p></p><p>Multitaskers are crucial in the kitchen, especially when you’re fighting with your countertops for space. One of the best kitchen gadgets with many uses is an electric kettle, and you don’t have to spend a ton to get a decent one. Cosori makes a few good models, including this <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DT1NPUkktRWxlY3RyaWMtU3RhaW5sZXNzLUluZGljYXRvci1Qcm90ZWN0aW9uL2RwL0IwOUJRRDNZRFkvP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdzEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRiMGFkODAyLTBhZWEtM2VlNC1iZWM5LTAxNjAwZDJhMjk4NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXoWou7rShMRF73Gt5-trFNhwwiElSq7P_luX7MtofRy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCOSORI-Electric-Stainless-Indicator-Protection%2Fdp%2FB09BQD3YDY%2F%3Fth%3D1">stainless steel one</a> that comes in at only $40. It has a six-cup capacity and claims it can boil water in less than three minutes, which means new graduates won’t have to wait long to make a cup of coffee or tea, cook some ramen noodles or get broth ready for soup. We also like that it has an automatic shutoff safety feature that powers down the machine 30 seconds after water comes to rolling boil.</p><h2>Chipolo One</h2><p></p><p>Help your grad keep track of their things by getting them a gadget like the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlYUjcyQzRQLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby13MS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGIwYWQ4MDItMGFlYS0zZWU0LWJlYzktMDE2MDBkMmEyOTg1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAfivhttvTigGpTg9C2GnsviXdCEl2aSNPdOvwpYSrbv4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09XR72C4P%2F">Chipolo One</a>. This Bluetooth tracker is one of our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html">favorites</a> because its separation alerts are top-notch. What that means in practice is if your grad leaves their keys or wallet with the One attached to it somewhere, say at a coffee shop, they’ll get a notification to their phone quickly after they leave, telling them they left something behind. Chipolo’s tech will even give you directions via your maps app to the precise location of your lost stuff, in the event that you miss the original notification. The Chipolo One is also a good pick for anyone, really, since it works on iPhones and Android devices.</p><h2>Anker 511 Power Bank</h2><p></p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlLWkZHR01UP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXcxLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YjBhZDgwMi0wYWVhLTNlZTQtYmVjOS0wMTYwMGQyYTI5ODUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfbYJGFHCtEJLPSHkei0lHKOSv-vhDY9cLG28CDMa_nH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09KZFGGMT%3F">Anker 511 Power Bank</a> is something everyone should keep with them at all times, but new graduates will find it particularly useful. The last thing they want to worry about is their phone dying on them in the middle of a busy day of job interviews, side hustle work and adulting chores. Only slightly larger than a tube of lipstick, the 511 Power Bank will slide easily into most bags and backpacks, and they could probably get away with sticking it in their pocket if they’re rushing out the door. It has a 5,000mAh capacity that can easily top up a phone that’s inching closer and closer to zero-percent battery life. Plus, it has a built-in foldable plug for use as a power adapter if they happen to be near an outlet. They’ll have to provide their own USB-C cable for charging, but they probably have one of those lying around already anyway.</p><h2>Yeti Rambler water bottle</h2><p></p><p>Everyone needs a good water bottle they can take with them almost everywhere and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ZRVRJLVJhbWJsZXItQm90dGxlLUluc3VsYXRlZC1TdGFpbmxlc3MvZHAvQjA4NDJTNzVLNT90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXcxLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YjBhZDgwMi0wYWVhLTNlZTQtYmVjOS0wMTYwMGQyYTI5ODUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR7zFXtppXRMoEmgs3xDUuLk1_FpNhdK9n81DfcZuirL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FYETI-Rambler-Bottle-Insulated-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB0842S75K5%3Fth%3D1">Yeti’s 18-ounce Ramber</a> will be a good pick for most people. It has a simple design made of 18/8 stainless steel, plus double-wall vacuum insulation that keeps cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot for longer. It’s shatter resistant so it can take an accidental beating, and it’s dishwasher safe for easy cleanup and care. We like the “chug cap” that comes with it — it’s best used with cold drinks, so maybe that will encourage your grad to use this Yeti for all-day hydration instead of all-day caffeination. This Ramber also comes in more than a dozen different colors, so you should be able to find one that fits in with the rest of your giftee’s stuff.</p><h2>Baggu Standard Set of 3 reusable bags</h2><p></p><p>Reusable tote bags are handy to have whenever you leave the house. New graduates may find themselves in need of one when they stop to get ingredients to make dinner on their way home from work, or when they unexpectedly buy something while out with friends. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TdGFuZGFyZC1CYWdndS1TZXQtVGhhbmstWW91L2RwL0IwOUY4UlpZNEg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdzEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRiMGFkODAyLTBhZWEtM2VlNC1iZWM5LTAxNjAwZDJhMjk4NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAY5VH-_fJ1E4R0HCqSAunoNdpec3U8Sdup1AsXk3rWZ8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FStandard-Baggu-Set-Thank-You%2Fdp%2FB09F8RZY4H">Baggu’s reusable totes</a> are some of our favorites, not only because they come in <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=96de7661-569f-4b41-bd9c-b77f29281fb5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=BAGGU&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NmRlNzY2MS01NjlmLTRiNDEtYmQ5Yy1iNzdmMjkyODFmYjUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmFnZ3UuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3N0YW5kYXJkLWJhZ2d1LXNldC1vZi0zLXRoYW5rLXlvdS1zZXQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjRiMGFkODAyLTBhZWEtM2VlNC1iZWM5LTAxNjAwZDJhMjk4NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWkF_0K-E013_IxHLRpFxaU5oaIjDiW3G8vuG_CF3DKc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.baggu.com%2Fproducts%2Fstandard-baggu-set-of-3-thank-you-set">a ton of fun colors and designs</a>, but also because they’re durable and machine-washable. They’re made from ripstop nylon that’s easy to fold up into a small square and toss into any backpack or purse, so there’s really no excuse not to keep one with you at all times. Plus, each bag can hold up to 50-pounds worth of stuff, so they shouldn’t buckle under the weight of a week’s worth of groceries.</p><h2>Logitech Signature M650 Mouse</h2><p></p><p>We generally recommend Logitech mice to most people and the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUtYNjZaQ0QvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXcxLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0YjBhZDgwMi0wYWVhLTNlZTQtYmVjOS0wMTYwMGQyYTI5ODUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARHu0Ta0FKbprD3hprNUiPq9BSMvs_72Spx8GSJW1Jb0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09KX66ZCD%2F">Signature M650</a> is a great one for a new graduate to toss in their bag to use both at home and work. It has a relatively small profile along with a precision scroll wheel and buttons that are quieter than those on other mice. Whether they’re working in an office with an open floor plan or next to their roommate at their WFH desk, they won’t distract anyone with the sounds of constant clicking or scrolling. This model has two customizable side buttons that allow them to really make the accessory their own, plus it connects to computers via Bluetooth or USB receiver. But the best part is that it should last up to two years on one AA battery before they need to change it; one less gadget they need to remember to recharge regularly is a great thing.</p><h2>Roku Streaming Stick 4K</h2><p></p><p>New grads are pretty cash-strapped, so most of them are not going out to buy a new TV immediately after getting their diploma.

## AMD's Ryzen 7040U chips promise speedier graphics for thin-and-light laptops
 - [https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-7040u-chips-promise-speedier-graphics-for-thin-and-light-laptops-130527019.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-7040u-chips-promise-speedier-graphics-for-thin-and-light-laptops-130527019.html?src=rss)

<p>Now that AMD has rounded out its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-7000-mobile-cpus-16-core-033046361.html">high-performance mobile CPUs</a>, it's turning its attention to chips for thin laptops. The company has <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom.html">introduced</a> Ryzen 7040U processors that it claims can outrun the competition, particularly for gamers who may need to be content with integrated graphics. They all tout RDNA 3-based Radeon 700M GPUs that tout the enhancements seen on desktop video cards. A Ryzen 7 with the Radeon 780M runs between 30 percent to 139 percent faster than an equivalent Intel 13th-gen Core i7 P-series chip, AMD claims. That's at 1080p with low graphics settings, but it could make some games playable that weren't an option before.</p><p>AMD also believes the Ryzen 7040U line offers better raw computing power than rivals. The Zen 4 architecture is said to deliver between 29 percent to 128 percent better app performance than not just the Core i7, but 5 percent to 75 percent over the M2 found in Apple's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-13-inch-review-m2-2022-130005000.html">13-inch MacBook Pro</a>. AMD is relying on synthetic benchmarks to make the claim and is testing its highest-end Ryzen 7 part, but that may be worth considering if you plan to edit videos or juggle multiple productivity apps.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new hardware also brings Ryzen AI acceleration to offload some work from the chip's main compute units. AMD also boasts of improved efficiency to provide the &quot;longest possible time&quot; on battery power, although it doesn't provide estimates. That's likely to vary based on the CPU model and exact laptop.</p><p>The initial lineup includes four processors. The Ryzen 3 7440U is aimed at the entry level with four cores, eight processing threads, a base 3GHz clock speed (up to 4.7GHz) and 12MB of cache. At the mid-range, the Ryzen 5 7540U uses six cores, 12 threads, a baseline 3.2GHz speed (up to 4.9GHz) and 22MB of cache. The Ryzen 5 7640U is slightly faster with Ryzen AI support, a 3.5GHz clock (up to 4.9GHz). The top-end Ryzen 7 7840U includes eight cores, 16 threads, Ryzen AI, a 3.3GHz starting clock (up to 5.1GHz) and 24MB of cache. All four models have a thermal design power between 15W and 30W.</p><p>We'd expect laptop manufacturers to begin using the Ryzen 7040U relatively quickly. It's too early to say if the advertised performance gains manifest in real life, but AMD is clearly confident it has some major advantages over rivals.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-7040u-chips-promise-speedier-graphics-for-thin-and-light-laptops-130527019.html?src=rss

## Google rolls out support for passkeys across its services

<p>When you check the security settings of your Google account, you will now find a new section marked &quot;Passkeys.&quot; That's because the tech giant has <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-password/">started rolling out support for</a> the new authentication technology, which offers a passwordless experience across its services. I'm already seeing the option in my accounts, and activating it for my phone and laptop was almost a one-click experience.</p><p>The technology uses your device biometrics — your fingerprint or your face — or its pin to confirm that it's you logging in. However, it's completely different from using your biometrics to auto-populate username and password boxes. Creating a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paypal-adds-passkey-support-150043721.html">passkey</a> for your account generates a pair of cryptographic keys, one private and one public. The private key stays on your device, and it's what Google will use to verify your identity with the public key uploaded to its servers. Passkeys are considered more secure than current login technologies, since private keys only stay on the device where they're created and can't be stolen if a hacker breaks into Google's servers. The fact that you don't have to use a password to sign in means the technology can also protect you from phishing attempts.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google has been championing the use of passwordless logins and had added passkey support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-passkey-support-android-chrome-164017230.html">for Chrome and Android</a> last year. That said, it will not be removing the option to sign in using passwords — or to activate two-factor authentication — which will be especially helpful if you have a device that doesn't support the newer technology yet. If you log into your account on multiple devices, you can create a passkey for each one of them, unless you have access to a service that backs up or syncs passkeys. A passkey you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-passkeys-offer-even-better-protection-for-you-passwords-190334447.html">create on an iPhone</a>, for instance, will sync with devices that use the same iCloud account, so it can also be available on an iPad or a MacBook.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also use a passkey stored on your current phone to sign into a new device. Just choose &quot;use a passkey from another device&quot; and click through, after which Google will ask if you want to create a separate passkey for that device.&nbsp;</p><p>In the blog post written by the Google Account Security and Safety teams, they said:</p><p>&quot;Today's launch is a big step in a cross-industry effort that we started more than 10 years ago and we are committed to passkeys as the future of secure sign-in, for everyone. We hope that other web and app developers adopt passkeys as well and are able to use our deployment as a model.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-rolls-out-support-for-passkeys-across-its-services-130003969.html?src=rss

## ChatGPT scams are the new crypto scams, Meta warns

<p>As the buzz around ChatGPT and other generative AI increases, so has scammers’ interest in the tech. In a new report published by Meta, the company says it’s seen a sharp uptick in malware disguised as ChatGPT and similar AI software.</p><p>In a statement, the company said that since March of 2023 alone, its researchers have discovered “ten malware families using ChatGPT and other similar themes to compromise accounts across the internet” and that it’s blocked more than 1,000 malicious links from its platform. According to Meta, the scams often involve mobile apps or browser extensions posing as ChatGPT tools. And while in some cases the tools do offer some ChatGPT functionality, their real purpose is to steal their users’ account credentials.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a call with reporters, Meta Chief Security Officer Guy Rosen said the scammers behind these exploits are taking advantage of the surge in interest in Generative AI. “As an industry we've seen this across other topics that are popular in their time such as crypto scams fueled by the immense interest in digital currency,” Rosen said. “So from a bad actor’s perspective, ChatGPT is the new crypto.”</p><p>Meta noted that people who manage businesses on Facebook or who otherwise use the platform for work have been particular targets. Scammers will often go after users’ personal accounts in order to gain access to a connected business page or advertising account, which are more likely to have a linked credit card.</p><p>To combat this, Meta said it plans to introduce a new type of account for businesses called “Meta Work” accounts. These accounts will enable users to access Facebook’s Business Manager tools without a personal Facebook account. “This will help keep business accounts more secure in cases when attackers begin with a personal account compromise,” the company said in a statement. Meta said it will start a “limited” test of the new work accounts this year and will expand it “over time.”</p><p>Additionally, Meta is rolling out a new tool that will help businesses detect and remove malware.

<p>Apple and Google have announced a partnership to tackle unwanted tracking through the likes of AirTags and Tile devices. The companies have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-and-google-team-up-to-tackle-bluetooth-tracker-stalking-140516646.html">proposed industry standards</a> &quot;to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth location-tracking devices for unwanted tracking.&quot;</p><p>Apple and Google submitted the draft specification to the Internet Engineering Task Force, a notable standards development organization. Over the next three months, interested parties will review the documentation and weigh in on it. Beyond Apple and Google, the proposal has received backing from Samsung, Tile, Chipolo, Anker's Eufy brand, Pebblebee, and several safety and advocacy groups.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Reddit makes easier to share and view linked posts on social media sites

<p>Admitting that &quot;we didn't make it easy to&quot; share posts on other social media platforms, Reddit has <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/2023socialsharingupdates">announced</a> that it's rolling out new features to fix that issue. Those include an updated &quot;shared link&quot; preview for text posts shared via messaging services, new sharing for Instagram Stories, one-tap screenshot sharing and more. The improvements arrive on the heels of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-can-now-search-the-comments-within-an-individual-reddit-post-193020546.html">other user-friendly features</a> like an updated interface, improved comment searching and more.</p><p>In the past, sharing a Reddit post on a messaging app like WhatsApp forced the recipient to click the link to see what was going on. Now, you get a visual preview of the content, along with the subreddit name, total upvotes and comments.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another new trick is the ability to share Reddit content directly to Instagram stories without the need to screenshot or download content to your phone. And much like with apps like Google Photos, a new custom &quot;share sheet&quot; pops up showing your most-used social channels, so you can quickly publish without leaving the Reddit app. There's also a one-tap screenshot sharing experience that allows you to share content without saving images to your device. That provides a direct link to the content rather than just a screenshot.</p><p>Finally, Reddit has introduced a new <a href="https://publish.reddit.com/assets/Reddit_Embed_Documentation.pdf">embedding toolbox</a> that makes it easier to embed tweets in articles or CMS platforms like WordPress. Again, that allows users to not only show Reddit content on a website, but also link to it directly. That brings it in line with other social media sites like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, which have had the capability since forever.</p><p>It's hard to believe that Reddit has existed so far without these features, but the company evidently felt that it stood alone and didn't need the extra reach. The sharing follows other updates designed to make the app and websites easier to use, like the ability <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-can-now-search-the-comments-within-an-individual-reddit-post-193020546.html">search within post comments</a>, the addition of new text browsing feeds including Read and Watch, a revised, decluttered interface and more. At the same time, Reddit recently made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-will-charge-companies-for-api-access-citing-ai-training-concerns-184935783.html">API access a paid feature</a>, ostensibly due to AI training concerns.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/reddit-makes-easier-to-share-and-view-linked-posts-on-social-media-sites-094608453.html?src=rss

## White House proposes 30 percent tax on electricity used for crypto mining

<p>The Biden administration wants to impose a 30 percent tax on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elizabeth-warren-bitcoin-mining-letter-212435537.html">electricity used by cryptocurrency mining</a> operations, and it has included the proposal in its budget for the fiscal year of 2024. In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/05/02/cost-of-cryptomining-dame-tax/">blog post on the White House website</a>, the administration has formally introduced the Digital Asset Mining Energy or DAME excise tax. It explained that it wants to tax cryptomining firms, because they aren't paying for the "full cost they impose on others," which include environmental pollution and high energy prices.&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto mining has "negative spillovers on the environment," the White House continued, and the pollution it generates "falls disproportionately on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color." It added that the operations' "often volatile power consumption " can raise electricity prices for the people around them and cause service interruptions. Further, local power companies are taking a risk if they decide to upgrade their equipment to make their service more stable, since miners can easily move away to another location, even abroad.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It's no secret that the process of mining cryptocurrency uses up massive amounts of electricity. In April, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC8wOS9idXNpbmVzcy9iaXRjb2luLW1pbmluZy1lbGVjdHJpY2l0eS1wb2xsdXRpb24uaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTZiMzVkMmItZjc5MC00OTVmLWJkOWEtZWNkMjhjOTRlODBkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeApXBH1Gk-EEiY6XrKiF2VGNhJYuQOKDHIO4Hlccxom&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F04%2F09%2Fbusiness%2Fbitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> published a report detailing the power used by the 34 large scale Bitcoin miners in the US that it had identified. Apparently, just those 34 operations altogether use the same amount of electricity as three million households in the country. <em>The Times</em> explained that most Bitcoin mining took place in China until 2021 when the country banned it, making the United State the new leader. (In the US, New York Governor Kathy Hochul <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-state-crypto-mining-law-180528956.html">signed legislation</a> that restricts crypto mining in the state last year.)

That could encourage mining firms not just to minimize energy use, but also to find cleaner sources of power. It might be difficult to convince the administration to go down that route, though: In its blog post, it said that the "environmental impacts of cryptomining exist even when miners use existing clean power." Apparently, mining operations in communities with hydropower have been observed to reduce the amount of clean power available for use by others. That leads to higher prices and to even higher consumption of electricity from non-clean sources.&nbsp;</p><p>If the proposal ever becomes a law, the government would impose the excise tax in phases. It would start by adding a 10 percent tax on miners' electricity use in the first year, 20 percent in the second and then 30 percent from the third year onwards.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/white-house-proposes-30-percent-tax-on-electricity-used-for-crypto-mining-090342986.html?src=rss

## Elon Musk reportedly threatened to reassign NPR's Twitter account due to inactivity

<p>Twitter owner Elon Musk has reportedly <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/02/1173422311/elon-musk-npr-twitter-reassign">emailed an NPR reporter</a> to ask if the organization is returning to the website and to suggest that the company could reassign its account if it doesn't. According to NPR, Musk sent one of its reporters an unprompted email that reads: &quot;So is NPR going to start posting on Twitter again, or should we reassign @NPR to another company?&quot; If you'll recall, the organization quit Twitter in April after being <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-designates-npr-as-us-state-affiliated-media-165306913.html">labeled as a &quot;state-affiliated media,&quot;</a> along with state-run outlets, such as China's<em>&nbsp;</em>Xinhua News Agency and Russia's RT.</p><p>Before NPR decided <a href="https://www.engadget.com/npr-is-ditching-twitter-over-government-funded-media-label-on-its-main-account-155556726.html">to ditch Twitter</a> altogether, the social network changed the label to &quot;government-funded media&quot; after being called out. However, NPR said the updated label is still &quot;inaccurate and misleading,&quot; as it's &quot;a private, nonprofit company with editorial independence.&quot; The label also prompted PBS to leave the website. Twitter ultimately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-pulls-government-funded-label-from-media-accounts-141046730.html">decided to remove</a> the &quot;government-funded media&quot; label entirely, even from state-run outlets, but neither NPR nor PBS has returned to the website.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Musk's surprise email turned into an exchange with the executive, wherein he reportedly wrote in one of his responses: &quot;NPR isn't tagged as government-funded anymore, so what's the beef?&quot; And when asked who would be taking over the NPR account on Twitter, he replied: &quot;National Pumpkin Radio,&quot; along with a couple of emoji. We reached out Twitter for a statement, but the company doesn't have a communications team anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>Under <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-twitter-accounts">Twitter's policy</a>, the company said that users can simply log in once every 30 days to keep their account active. Further, it said that accounts may be permanently removed due to inactivity, but it &quot;cannot release inactive usernames at this time.&quot; It encourages people to find a variation if the username they want is &quot;used by an account that seems inactive.&quot; However, NPR said that in their email exchange, Musk told the organization that Twitter's &quot;policy is to recycle handles that are definitively dormant.&quot; He apparently added: &quot;Same policy applies to all accounts. No special treatment for NPR.&quot; It's unclear if Twitter intends to update its official <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-twitter-accounts">policy page for inactive accounts</a> with that information, and if it will implement safeguards to protect former users from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html">impersonation</a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-threatened-to-reassign-nprs-twitter-account-due-to-inactivity-050040503.html?src=rss
