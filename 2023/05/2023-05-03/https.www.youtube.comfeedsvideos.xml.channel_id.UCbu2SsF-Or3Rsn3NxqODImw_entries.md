Resident Evil 4 remake might be one of the most highly replayable single-player experiences of all time.

This is No HUD, a show all about finding new and interesting ways to play some of your favorite games. In our first episode we take a look at Resident Evil 4 and why it's a huge mistake to stop after your first playthrough.
Thatâ€™s because Resident Evil 4 has so much more to offer past a first-time experience, including gameplay changes on higher difficulties, unlockables that offer fun bonuses, and a whole host of challenges to pursue. The game is a masterclass in replayability with new layers to it with each run. Whether intentional or not, Resident Evil 4 is an incredible example of how replaying a game can be just as, if not more rewarding, than that first playthrough.
