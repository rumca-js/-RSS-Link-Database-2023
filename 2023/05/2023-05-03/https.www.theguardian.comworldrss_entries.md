<p>Flavour molecules cause champagne bubbles to rise in straight line – unlike those in other drinks</p><p>From the pop of its cork to its delicate golden hue, champagne has many features that make it a celebratory tipple – but none are as recognisable as its fine fizz. Now researchers have shed new light on the quintessential sparkle, revealing why champagne bubbles rise in a straight line, unlike those of many other drinks.</p><p>“Our intuition, from studying bubble dynamics, is that bubbles rising in line do not follow a straight line. The wake behind each bubble knocks out the trailing bubble behind to the side,” said Prof Roberto Zeni, the co-author of the study from Brown University, Rhode Island, in the US.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/03/solved-at-last-the-mystery-of-why-champagne-bubbles-go-straight-up">Continue reading...</a>
