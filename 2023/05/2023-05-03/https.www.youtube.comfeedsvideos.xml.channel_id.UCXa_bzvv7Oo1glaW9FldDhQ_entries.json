Titles like Returnal, Horizon Forbidden West and Forza Horizon 5, all showcase the sheer power of current-gen hardware. \n\nBut looking back at previous-gen games, especially some which never received upgrades for the newer hardware, it's crazy how some could easily rival the current crop. Let's look at 15 last-gen titles that fall into that category.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-kkNT5AADE", "date_published": "2023-05-03 15:30:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "What The Hell Happened To REDFALL?", "description": "By now, you would've seen several reviews for Arkane's Redfall. The co-op looter shooter is now available on Xbox Series X/S and PC after reportedly over five years in development (if LinkedIn profiles are anything to go by). A quick peek at its Metacritic reveals a Metascore of 64 on PC out of 38 reviews, while the Xbox version has a 59 Metascore based on 29 reviews.\n\nSteam hasn't been too kind either \u2013 it's sitting a \u201cMostly Negative\u201d rating based on 816 user reviews, with only 30 percent being positive. In a way, some people would have predicted Redfall not living up to Arkane Studios' legacy. The overall gameplay looked incredibly formulaic, and the heavy focus on co-op was odd.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghzbNwP404I", "date_published": "2023-05-03 13:30:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "The Last Case of Benedict Fox Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "There\u2019s something wildly thoughtful and provocative about The Last Case of Benedict Fox.
