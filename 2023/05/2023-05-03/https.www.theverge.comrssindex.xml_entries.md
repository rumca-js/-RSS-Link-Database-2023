  <p id="BmOKtp">The security team at Meta is acknowledging broad occurrences of fake ChatGPT malware that exists to hack user accounts and take over business pages.</p>
<p id="MmENu6">In the company’s new <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/05/metas-q1-2023-security-reports/">Q1 security report</a>, Meta shares that malware operators and spammers are following trends and high-engagement topics that get people’s attention. Of course, the biggest tech trend right now is AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard, so tricking users into trying a fake version is now in fashion — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/13/23071786/etherscan-coingecko-crypto-phishing-ad-popup-coinzilla-metamask">sorry, crypto</a>.</p>
<p id="7GMZYN">Meta security analysts have found about 10 forms of malware posing as AI chatbot-related tools like ChatGPT since March. Some of these exist as web browser extensions and toolbars (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-12-20-google-tightens-chrome-web-store-extension-rules.html">classic</a>) — even being available through unnamed official web stores. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/12/fake-chatgpt-preys-facebook-users/"><em>The</em> <em>W...</em></a></p>

  <p id="SZyx4Z">Discord is taking away the four-digit tag that it puts after its usernames as it looks to make it “easier to connect” with other users. As <a href="https://discord.com/blog/usernames">noted in a post on Discord’s blog</a>, this change will force most users to change their usernames, as Discord will no longer have the four-number tag that distinguishes one person with the same username from another.</p>
<p id="zSZsM1">Instead of having a four-number discriminator appended to your username, you will now have a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12620128861463">unique alphanumeric username</a> with the “@” symbol in front of it. You’ll also get to choose a non-unique display name that can include special characters, spaces, emoji, and non-Latin characters, making the platform a lot more like other mainstream social networks, such as Twitter and Instagram.

  <p id="lUi2si">TikTok’s second creator fund is opening up to more users starting today. </p>
<p id="Eh6phY">First <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/20/23604204/tiktok-creativity-program-creator-fund-longer-videos-eligibility">announced in February</a>, the program has been invite-only until now. Called the Creativity Program, the fund is meant to pay popular users for their content, but only if they meet certain requirements. The wider availability now aligns with the original TikTok creator fund, which promised to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund">pay out $1 billion over three years</a> to creators on the app.</p>
<p id="3ShON6">The Creativity Fund requirements suggest a slight shift in TikTok’s priorities. Most notably, creators need to be making videos longer than a minute in order to be eligible to earn money through the fund. Users also need to have at least 10,000 followers and 100,000 authentic views on their videos in the last 30...</p>

  <p id="txw8P8">After a surprise decision by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last week, the biggest acquisition in gaming history hangs in the balance. Microsoft’s $68.7 billion deal to acquire Activision Blizzard has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/26/23689252/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-blocked-uk-cma">blocked by UK regulators</a>, and EU regulators are due to make a decision in the coming weeks.</p>
<p id="TwXdsb">In Status Update (above), we look back at the history of this deal over the past year, Microsoft and Sony’s battles over <em>Call of Duty</em>, and exactly why regulators are concerned over this giant purchase.

<p id="wAXwtN">AMD claims the new chip can give Apple a run for its money, besting the 2022 MacBook Air’s M2 processor in “application performance” by up to 75 percent and taking on the Intel Core i7-1360P by even more than that in both productivity <em>and </em>graphics, as you’ll see stated fairly vaguely in the charts below.</p>

  <p id="DeWp3s">Meta’s VR social platform is getting a new feature to help you show off what a fun time you’re having in the so-called “metaverse” with all your Instagram and Facebook followers. With its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fen-gb%2Fblog%2Fquest%2Fmeta-horizon-worlds-v108-release-notes%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F5%2F3%2F23709283%2Fmeta-horizon-worlds-sharing-to-instagram-facebook-stories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">v108 update</a>, Horizon Worlds can now share photos and videos directly to your story on either platform.

But now you also have the option of posting <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1559666693797949440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1559666693797949440%7Ctwgr%5Ec1f51327715ce2b9bb5b5618ba536acf67c2fc31%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.pcmag.com%2Fvr-1%2F142187%2Fzuckerberg-swears-metas-premier-app-doesnt-look-like-a-wii-game">Horizon Worlds’ Wii-level graphics</a> to Meta’s stories, where they can sit alongside real-world photographs of holidays, meals, and...</p>
