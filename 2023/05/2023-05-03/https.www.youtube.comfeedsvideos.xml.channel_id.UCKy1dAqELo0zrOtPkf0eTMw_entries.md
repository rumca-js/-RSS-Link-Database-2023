Star Wars: Visions Volume 2 reviewed by Samantha Nelson. Premieres May 4, 2023 on Disney+.
While the themes of Star Wars: Visions Volume 2 can be a bit repetitive, the diversity of characters and animation styles presented in tight episodes makes it well worth watching. Alternately goofy, political, sweet, and thrilling, the show celebrates the broad reach of Star Wars and provides plenty of characters and plots compelling enough to anchor their own spinoffs.

The trailer showcases the return of Billy and Jimmy Lee as they take on multiple enemies. Additionally, watch as Marian joins the fray, along with a new playable character, Uncle Matin.

New York City in the year 199X: the city has been devastated by nuclear war. Its citizens fight for survival as riots, crime and chaos flood the streets. Criminal gangs terrorize what remains as they vie for dominance. Unwilling to endure these conditions any longer, young Billy and Jimmy Lee take it upon themselves to reclaim their city. 

Series icons Billy and Jimmy Lee are joined by Marian, returning as a fully realized, firearm-wielding ranged fighter, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a riot-shield-wielding powerhouse. Tag in and out as the classic Lee duo or switch it up with different characters. With two-player local co-op, the action quadruples as you and a friend clean up the mean streets. 

Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons will be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 in 2023.

## The Last Case of Benedict Fox Review

The Last Case of Benedict Fox reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One.

"The Last Case of Benedict Fox features a wonderfully unique supernatural setting that’s full of interesting ideas, but mixed execution and control issues meant that I could only enjoy its morbid mystery in patches. While I derived great satisfaction from completing its genuinely taxing puzzles, my progress with the main case too often stalled thanks to ambiguous objectives and poor navigation tools that had me retreading sections of its sprawling map to an exhausting degree, routinely stalling the story’s momentum for prolonged stretches at a time. Many of its flaws are of the type that seem like they might be remedied via post-release patching, but in its existing state The Last Case of Benedict Fox is like one of its protagonist’s bungled double jumps – it reaches for greatness but falls a bit too short of the mark."

Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 lands in theaters soon and it might just be the last outing for this particular group of A-holes! But before you check out their fight against the High Evolutionary in the final James Gunn film for Marvel, let’s recap their galaxy spanning adventures. From Awesome Mix vol 1, through Infinity War, Endgame and a Christmas Special, here is the Guardians of the Galaxy’s story so far.

While Peter Quill aka Star-Lord pines for Gamora, Rocket Raccoon, Nebula, Drax, Mantis and Groot try to hold the team together. But even that wasn’t the “original lineup.” Just how did the Guardians pick up team members like Kraglin and Cosmo? And which enemies did they piss off enough to create Adam Warlock? And remember how involved these guys are with Thanos, that jerk? All these questions and more will be answered before Gunn fires up his plans for Superman and all of his DCU buddies.
