But in its Tiny Desk performance, the group adjusted its stage plot slightly for a new setting, still singing together of yearning, of fatigue, of kinship. Gusts of post-rock, emo, folk and minimalism sweep around the octet's sound, but the musical mish-mash isn't quite the point \u2014 caroline stresses a communal spirit, witnessed here in a beautiful set.\n\nOver three songs performed from caroline's self-titled debut \u2014 one of NPR Music's 50 best albums of 2022 \u2014  strings skitter and swoon, guitars stutter and drum sticks roll atop the Tiny Desk itself. In sprawling arrangements and frenzied improvisations, this is impatient music that awaits patient ears. There's power and vulnerability in choral singing, where different kinds of voices aid and uplift the moment for something better. That's especially the case on \"Dark blue,\" with a mournful-yet-triumphant chord progression you could sit inside forever, as the music shifts and shuffles over a bustling drone and the band offers a deceptively simple carpe diem: \"I want it all.\" \n\nSET LIST\n\"Good morning (red)\" \n\"Dark blue\" \n\"Skydiving onto the library roof\" \n\nMUSICIANS\nJasper Llewellyn: acoustic guitar, cello, drums, vocals\nMike O'Malley: electric guitar, vocals\nCasper Hughes: electric guitar, vocals\nOliver Hamilton: violin\nMagdalena McLean: violin, vocals\nFreddy Wordsworth: trumpet, bass\nAlex McKenzie: clarinet, flute, saxophone\nHugh Aynsley: drums, percussion\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers:  Kara Frame, Sofia Seidel, Alant\u00e9 Serene, Catie Dull\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galv\u00e1n, Jill Britton\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #caroline", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_PNkXFdTog", "date_published": "2023-05-03 09:00:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
