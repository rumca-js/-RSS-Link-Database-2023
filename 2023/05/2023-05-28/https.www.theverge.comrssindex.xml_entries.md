  <p id="mEeZON">A hands-on look at the Meta Quest 3 reveals a massive set of improvements to the Meta mixed reality headset, as detailed in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-28/meta-quest-3-real-life-hands-on-how-it-compares-to-apple-mixed-reality-headset-li7h3suy">Mark Gurman’s <em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> for <em>Bloomberg</em> this morning. Gurman says the Quest 3, now codenamed Eureka, is “far lighter and thinner” than the original Quest 2, which bodes well for its comfort during extended usage.</p>
<p id="jL7fvb">A lot of the features he mentioned are similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23728368/wwdc-2023-date-time-live-stream-watch-how-to-rumors">what we expect to learn</a> about the Apple “Reality Pro” VR / AR headset soon, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567935/apple-reality-pro-vr-headset-hand-tracking-mac-screen-mirror-facetime">fancy hand-tracking</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537191/apple-mixed-reality-headset-digital-crown">pass-through video</a>. But some rumors say the rumored Apple headset <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23601588/apple-wwdc-vr-ar-mixed-reality-launch-rumor">could cost as much as $3,000</a>. Gurman said Meta also hasn’t settled on the Quest 3’s price yet, but that it could be costlier than the $400 Quest 2, which “may stick around at a...</p>

This price is as good as it gets for this giant LG OLED gaming display. </p>
<p id="cntjUV">If you take this deal, you can expect the usual inky blacks that make OLEDs the contrast champs of the display world, and its 4K resolution will mean a nice, sharp picture spanning its flat panel.

## The odd appeal of absurdly long YouTube videos that don’t play anything

  <p id="hbORta">The video’s title is, for once on YouTube, pretty straightforward: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjWfY7SnMBI&amp;t=15s">24 hours + of pure black screen in HD!</a>” Leaving aside the questions about the difference between standard- and high-def pure black screens, the video does what it says on the tin. Hit play, and you get more than 24 hours — 24 hours, one minute, 27 seconds, to be exact — of black screen and silence. It’s like turning off your computer, without turning off your computer. </p>
<p id="Kk4UQZ">This video has 40.2 million views.</p>
<p id="LyRWez">The first time I watched it, I assumed there was a joke or a Rick Roll or something in there somewhere and watched an upsettingly long time to find it. Nothing. So I figured it was a bit. Fun meta-commentary about the drivel people choose to watch! Most commenters seemed...</p>
