While at home in Nashville, Hitchcock found he couldn\u2019t stop writing songs. \n\nOne of the results of those efforts is the new album, \"Shufflemania!,\" released in late 2022. Hitchcock, touring once again, visited The Current studio to play songs from that album. Watch Hitchcock performing \"The Man Who Loves The Rain\" during that session at The Current.\n\nWatch and listen to the full session here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBr4iZZonX4\n\nCredits\nGuest \u2013 @robynhitchcockweb \nHost \u2013 Bill DeVille\nProducer \u2013 Derrick Stevens\nVideo Director \u2013 Evan Clark\nCamera Operator \u2013 Peter Ecklund, Evan Clark\nAudio \u2013 Eric Xu Romani\nGraphics \u2013 Natalia Toledo\nDigital Producer \u2013 Luke Taylor\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
