The USB feature of the new ESP32 chips is handy. Unfortunately, it is not easy to use because the information is hidden. This video shows how everything works and how you must set up the Arduino IDE to exploit the USB functionality. I promise it will save you a lot of frustration and time. And it is the basis for a future video about simple debugging with the new Arduino IDE 2.0
