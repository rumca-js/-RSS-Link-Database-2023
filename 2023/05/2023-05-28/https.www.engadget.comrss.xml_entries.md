<p>Japan and JAXA, the country‚Äôs space administration, have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-02-07-japans-space-agency-planning-space-based-solar-power-arrays.html"><ins>spent decades</ins></a> trying to make it possible to beam solar energy from space. In 2015, the nation made a breakthrough when JAXA scientists successfully beamed 1.8 kilowatts of power, enough energy to power an electric kettle, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-12-scientists-make-strides-in-beaming-solar-power-from-space.html"><ins>more than 50 meters</ins></a> to a wireless receiver. Now, Japan is poised to bring the technology one step closer to reality.</p><p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Science/Japan-to-try-beaming-solar-power-from-space-in-mid-decade"><em><ins>Nikkei</ins></em></a> reports a Japanese public-private partnership will attempt to beam solar energy from space as early as 2025. The project, led by Naoki Shinohara, a Kyoto University professor who has been working on space-based solar energy since 2009, will attempt to deploy a series of small satellites in orbit. Those will then try to beam the solar energy the arrays collect to ground-based receiving stations hundreds of miles away.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Using orbital solar panels and microwaves to send energy to Earth was first proposed in 1968. Since then, a few countries, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-18-china-solar-farm-power-station-space-2025.html"><ins>China</ins></a> and the US, have spent time and money pursuing the idea. The technology is appealing because orbital solar arrays represent a potentially unlimited renewable energy supply. In space, solar panels can collect energy no matter the time of day, and by using microwaves to beam the power they produce, clouds aren‚Äôt a concern either. However, even if Japan successfully deploys a set of orbital solar arrays, the tech would still be closer to science fiction than fact. That‚Äôs because producing an array that can generate 1 gigawatt of power ‚Äì or about the output of one nuclear reactor ‚Äì would cost about $7 billion with currently available technologies.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/japan-will-try-to-beam-solar-power-from-space-by-2025-214338244.html?src=rss

<p>Portugal could become the latest country to effectively ban Huawei and other Chinese firms from participating in its 5G buildouts. As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-26/portugal-effectively-bans-chinese-companies-from-5g-network?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, the government of Portugal this week recommended barring local carriers from sourcing 5G equipment from suppliers based outside of the European Union or from countries that aren‚Äôt part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED).</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.gns.gov.pt/pt/comissao-de-avaliacao-de-seguranca/"><ins>statement</ins></a> Portugal‚Äôs Higher Council for Cybersecurity shared on Thursday, the government said firms outside those jurisdictions pose a ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù to the security of the country‚Äôs wireless networks. The document didn‚Äôt call out Huawei specifically, but as China isn‚Äôt a member of NATO, the OCED or the EU, the company, alongside other Chinese suppliers like ZTE, would effectively be excluded from participating in Portugal‚Äôs 5G networks should the country‚Äôs cabinet approve the security council‚Äôs recommendation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>‚ÄúHuawei has no prior knowledge of, and hasn‚Äôt been consulted about, this matter,‚Äù a Huawei spokesperson told the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4facc4e8-5bcc-4dc3-9a3c-6327927f0b6d"><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>. ‚ÄúOver the past two decades, Huawei has worked with Portuguese carriers to build out wireless networks and provide quality services that connect millions of people. We will continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and serve Portuguese customers and partners who rely on our products and services.‚Äù</p><p>Banning Chinese companies from participating in its 5G networks would be an abrupt turnaround for Portugal, which has enjoyed close relations with the East Asian superpower for years. As the <em>Financial Times </em>notes, Portugal has been one of the biggest per capita recipients of Chinese investment in recent years. Altice Portugal, the country‚Äôs largest wireless carrier, signed a deal in 2018 to use Huawei equipment for part of its 5G rollout. If Portugal moves forward with a ban, it would join <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canada-joins-five-eyes-allies-in-banning-huawei-and-zte-5-g-telecom-gear-081053188.html"><ins>Canada</ins></a> and a handful of other European countries, including Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, that have recently barred the company from participating in their 5G networks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/portugal-considers-banning-huawei-from-national-5g-networks-201102160.html?src=rss

<p>With the hype around AI reaching a fever pitch in recent months, many people fear programs like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-just-released-gpt-4-a-multi-modal-generative-ai-172326765.html">ChatGPT</a> will one day put them out of a job.

## Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 headset could feature color cameras for more lifelike pass-through video

<p>Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 VR headset won‚Äôt arrive until later this year. However, now we have a better idea of what to expect from the device courtesy of <em>Bloomberg‚Äôs</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-28/meta-quest-3-real-life-hands-on-how-it-compares-to-apple-mixed-reality-headset-li7h3suy?sref=10lNAhZ9"><ins>Mark Gurman</ins></a>, who says he went hands-on with a prototype to better understand how Quest 3 will stack up against Apple‚Äôs forthcoming mixed-reality headset. Gurman reports the prototype, codenamed Eureka, ‚Äúfeels far lighter and thinner‚Äù than its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">predecessor</a>. He says the head strap ‚Äúseems a bit stronger,‚Äù too, and uses fabric on the sides instead of plastic like the Quest 2.</p><p>More consequentially, the front of the device reportedly features a new design incorporating an enhanced sensor suite. Three ‚Äúvertical pill-shaped sensor areas‚Äù house two color video pass-through cameras, two standard cameras and a depth sensor. As Gurman notes, that‚Äôs a significant upgrade from the Quest 2, which doesn‚Äôt come with color pass-through or a depth sensor. The presence of the former means you won‚Äôt need to designate the walls in your play space.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The front lower sides of the headset feature tracking cameras, while the bottom has a volume rocker and a wheel to adjust interpupillary distance. That means you can tweak the Quest 3‚Äôs IPD without taking the headset off, something you can‚Äôt do with the Quest 2.</p><p>‚ÄúThe actual clarity and VR displays within the Quest 3 feel similar to those in the Quest 2 ‚Äî despite the resolution being rumored to be slightly higher,‚Äù Gurman writes, while noting pass-through for mixed reality applications and overall performance is significantly improved over the Quest 2. Speaking to the former, he says there‚Äôs a ‚Äúnight-and-day improvement‚Äù thanks to the added dual RGB cameras. ‚ÄúI was even able to use my phone while wearing the headset, something that often feels impossible on a Quest 2,‚Äù he adds. As for performance, Quest 3 reportedly features Qualcomm‚Äôs next-generation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-vr-headsets-will-continue-to-qualcomm-chips-for-the-foreseeable-future-120555404.html"><ins>Snapdragon XR2 chipset</ins></a>, leading to shorter app launch times and more consistent frame rates in games.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Gurman says the Quest 3 doesn‚Äôt include face and eye tracking, which means the headset won‚Äôt support foveated rendering. That‚Äôs a feature you can find on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html"><ins>Quest Pro</ins></a>. It allows the system to prioritize its limited computing resources on areas where you‚Äôre looking. Another feature the Quest 3 won‚Äôt carry over from the Quest Pro is controller-mounted cameras, though Gurman says Meta is trying to improve peripheral tracking in other ways.</p><p>‚ÄúMeta hasn‚Äôt yet settled on pricing for the device, but people involved in its development believe it may come in higher than the Quest 2‚Äôs $400,‚Äù Gurman notes, adding the company could keep the Quest 2 around ‚Äúat a lower price.‚Äù He adds Meta doesn‚Äôt plan to release a new Quest Pro ‚Äúanytime soon since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-drops-the-price-of-its-quest-pro-vr-headset-to-999-153753541.html"><ins>first version bombed</ins></a>.‚Äù The company reportedly plans to announce the Quest 3 sometime in October, which aligns with what company executives have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-2023-233025187.html"><ins>said</ins></a> in the past when asked when consumers can expect a new Quest headset.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/metas-quest-3-headset-could-feature-color-cameras-for-more-lifelike-pass-through-video-155645837.html?src=rss

## Hitting the Books: Renee Descartes had his best revelations while baked in an oven

<p>Some of us do our best thinking in the shower, others do it while on the toilet. Renee Descartes, he pondered most deeply while ensconced in a baker's oven.

All rights reserved.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr /><h2>When Ren√© Descartes Got Baked</h2><p>Ren√© Descartes, like Pythagoras before him and Einstein after, occupies that special place in our collective consciousness where his work has become ‚Ä¶ well, essentially a short-hand for genius-level intellect. Think about it ‚Äì in any cartoon or sitcom where one character is (or, through logically-spurious means, suddenly becomes) a brainiac, there are three things they‚Äôre narratively bound to say: ‚Äòthe square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides‚Äô ‚Äì that‚Äôs Pythagoras; ‚Äò<em>E </em>= <em>mc</em>2‚Äô ‚Äì thank you, Einstein; and finally, ‚Äòcogito ergo sum‚Äô. And <em>that </em>is Descartes.</p><p>Specifically, it‚Äôs <em>old </em>Descartes ‚Äì Descartes after he had figured his shit out. But while his later writings undeniably played a huge and important role in setting up how we approach the world today ‚Äì he‚Äôs actually one of the main figures who brought us the concept of the scientific method ‚Äì Descartes‚Äôs early years leaned a little more on the silly and gullible than the master of scepticism he‚Äôs come to be known as.</p><p>Descartes was born in 1596, which places him firmly in that period where science and philosophy and magic were all pretty much the same thing. He‚Äôs probably best known as a philosopher these days, but that‚Äôs likely because a lot of his developments in mathematics have become so incredibly fundamental that we kind of forget they had to be invented by anybody at all. And I know I‚Äôm saying that with ten years of mathematical training behind me and a PhD on the shelf, but even if you haven‚Äôt set foot in a maths class since school, you‚Äôll be familiar with something that Descartes invented, because he was the guy who came up with graphs. That‚Äôs actually why the points in a graph are given by <em>Cartesian coordinates </em>‚Äì it‚Äôs from the Latin form of his name, Renatus Cartesius.</p><p>And while maths, despite what everyone keeps telling me, <em>can </em>be sexy, ‚Äòcogito ergo sum‚Äô really does have a nice ring to it, doesn‚Äôt it? ‚ÄòI think, therefore I am.‚Äô It doesn‚Äôt sound like a huge philosophical leap ‚Äì in fact, it kind of sounds like tautological nonsense ‚Äì but it‚Äôs actually one of the most important conclusions ever reached in Western thought.</p><p>See, before Descartes, philosophy didn‚Äôt exactly have the sort of wishy-washy, pie-in-the-sky reputation it enjoys today. The dominant school of thought was Scholasticism, which was basically like debate club mixed with year nine science. Sounds fair enough, but in practice ‚Äì and especially when combined with the strong religious atmosphere and general lack of science up till that point ‚Äì it was basically a long period of everybody riffing on Plato and Aristotle and trying to make their Ancient Greek teachings match up with the Bible. This was, needless to say, not always easy, and led to rather a lot of navel gazing over questions like ‚ÄòDo demons get jealous?‚Äô and ‚ÄòDo angels take up physical space?‚Äô</p><p>Descartes‚Äôs approach was radically different. He didn‚Äôt see the point in answering questions like how many angels can dance on the head of a pin until he‚Äôd been properly convinced of the existence of angels. And dancing. And pins.</p><p>Now, of course, this is the point when non-philosophers throw up their hands in despair and say something along the lines of ‚ÄòOf <em>course </em>pins exist, you idiot, I have some upstairs keeping my posters up! Jesus, Ren√©, are we really paying a fortune in university fees just so you can sit around and doubt the existence of stationery?‚Äô</p><p>But to that, Descartes would reply: are you sure? I mean, we‚Äôve all had dreams before that are so convincing that we wake up thinking we really <em>did </em>adopt a baby elephant after our teeth all fell out. How do I know I‚Äôm not dreaming now? How do I know this isn‚Äôt a <em>The Matrix</em>-type situation, and what you think are pins are just a trick being played on us by Agent Smith?</p><p>In fact, when you get right down to it, Descartes would say, how can we be sure <em>anything </em>exists? I might not even exist! I might be a brain in a vat, being cleverly stimulated in such a way as to induce a vast hallucination! And yes, sure, I agree that sounds <em>unlikely</em>, but it‚Äôs not <em>impossible </em>‚Äì the point is, we simply can‚Äôt <em>know</em>.</p><p>The only thing I can be sure of, Descartes would continue ‚Äì despite everyone by this point rolling their eyes and muttering things like ‚Äòsee what you started, Bill‚Äô ‚Äì is that <em>I </em>exist. And I can be sure of that, because I‚Äôm thinking these thoughts about what exists. I may just be a brain in a vat, being fed lies about the reality that surrounds me, but ‚ÄòI‚Äô, ‚Äòme‚Äô, my sense of self and consciousness ‚Äì that definitely exists. To summarise: I think ‚Äì therefore I am.</p><p>It was a hell of a breakthrough ‚Äì he‚Äôd basically Jenga‚Äôd the entire prevailing worldview into obsolescence. And it‚Äôs the kind of idea that could really only have come from someone like Descartes: a weirdo celebrity heretic pseudo-refugee who had a weakness for cross-eyed women, weed and conspiracy theories.</p><p>Descartes was, as his name suggests, French by birth, hailing from a small town vaguely west of the centre of the country. If you look it up on a map, you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs actually called Descartes, but it‚Äôs not some uncanny coincidence ‚Äì the town was renamed in 1967 after its most famous resident.</p><p>Which is kind of odd, because it‚Äôs not like Descartes spent all that much time there. He went to school in La Fl√®che, more than 100km away, where even at the tender age of ten he was displaying the sort of behaviour that would make him perfectly suited to a life of philosophy, sleeping in until lunch every day and only attending lectures when he felt like it. This can‚Äôt have made him all that popular with the other kids, who were all expected to get up before 5am, but that‚Äôs why you choose a school whose rector is a close family friend, I suppose, and, in any case, by the time the young Ren√© turned up they were probably all too tired to do much about it.</p><p>After finishing high school, he spent a couple of years at uni studying law, as per his father‚Äôs wishes ‚Äì his dad came from a less well-to-do branch of the Descartes family tree, and probably would have wanted Descartes to keep up appearances for the sake of holding on to posh perks like not paying taxes. It must have pained him, therefore, when after graduating with a <em>Licence </em>in both church and civil law, Descartes immediately gave it all up and went on an extended gap year. ‚ÄòAs soon as my age permitted me to pass from under the control of my instructors, I entirely abandoned the study of letters, and resolved no longer to seek any other science than the knowledge of myself, or of the great book of the world,‚Äô he would later write, like some kind of nineteen-year-old <em>Eat Pray Love </em>devotee.</p><p>‚ÄòI spent the remainder of my youth in travelling, in visiting courts and armies, in holding intercourse with men of different dispositions and ranks, [and] in collecting varied experience,‚Äô he continued, in his philosophical treatise-slash-autobiography <em>Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One‚Äôs Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences</em>, which for obvious time-saving reasons is usually referred to as <em>Discourse on the Method</em>. Andlike so many philosophy students throughout history, there was one place he found in his travels that caught Descartes‚Äôs heart and imagination more than anywhere else: Amsterdam.</p><p>Now, it is of course true that places can change a lot over the course of 400 years ‚Äì at this point in history, France was being ruled by a nine-year-old autocrat and his mum, Germany didn‚Äôt exist, and England was a few years short of becoming a Republic. So you might think, sure, <em>these days </em>Amsterdam has a bit of a reputation, but back in Descartes‚Äôs time, it was probably a hub of quiet intellectualism and sombre, clean living.</p><p>Nope! Dynasties may rise and fall, empires spread and eventually fracture, but apparently, Amsterdam has always been Amsterdam. Descartes spent his first few years in the city living his absolute best life, studying engineering and maths under the direction of Simon Stevin ‚Äì another guy you‚Äôve never heard of who made a mathematical breakthrough you almost certainly use every single day of your life, since he invented the decimal point ‚Äì and dressing like an emo and throwing himself into music. He joined the Dutch army for a bit, despite being by all accounts a tiny weedy bobble-headed French guy, and, yes, he almost certainly smoked a bunch of pot along the way.</p><p>And then, one November night in 1619, while on tour in Bavaria, Descartes had a Revelation. And he had it, according to his near-contemporary biographer Adrien Baillet, inside an oven.</p><p>‚ÄòHe found himself in a place so remote from Communication, and so little frequented by people, whose Conversation might afford him any Diversion, that he even procured himself such a privacy, as the condition of his Ambulatory Life could permit him,‚Äô Baillet writes.</p><p>‚ÄòNot ‚Ä¶ having by good luck any anxieties, nor passions, within, that were capable of disturbing him, he staid withal all the Day long in his stove, where he had leisure enough to entertain himself with his thoughts,‚Äô he continues, as if that‚Äôs a normal thing to write and not an account of someone being so introverted that they secluded themselves miles away from anyone who knew them and then crawled into an oven for the day.</p><p>Modern biographers have suggested a few interpretations of what this oven might have been, and I‚Äôm sorry to report that, of course, it‚Äôs not as ridiculous as it first seems: in the seventeenth century, before we‚Äôd tamed electricity and gas mains and whatnot, a ‚Äòstove‚Äô or ‚Äòoven‚Äô was more like your modern-day airing cupboard than an Aga. Just bigger. And fancier. And all your towels are on fire. Look, the analogy isn‚Äôt perfect, but the point is that when Descartes said, in <em>Discourse on the Method</em>, that he had ‚Äòspent all day entertaining his thoughts in an oven‚Äô, he wasn‚Äôt being completely absurd ‚Äì just, you know, kind of weird.</p><p>Depending on where you fall on the scale between ‚ÄòDescartes was a stoner lol‚Äô and ‚ÄòDescartes was a paragon of virtue, 10/10 no notes awesome dude‚Äô, what happened next was either the result of too much weed, too much oven, or too much being a fricking genius destined to reform all of Western philosophy. Either way, he had a pretty rough night, full of strange dreams and disturbing hallucinations* that even the loyal Baillet thought might be a sign he was going a little bonkers.</p><p>‚ÄòHe acquaints us, That on the Tenth of <em>November </em>1619, laying himself down <em>Brim-full of Enthusiasm</em>, and ‚Ä¶ <em>having found that day the Foundations of the wonderful Science</em>, he had Three dreams one presently after another; yet so extraordinary, as to make him fancy that they were sent him from above,‚Äô writes Baillet, just in case you were wondering where on that scale Descartes would put himself. In fact, so sure was he of the divine nature of his dreams that, Baillet said, ‚Äòa Man would have been apt to have believed that he had been a little Crack-brain‚Äôd, or that he might have drank a Cup too much that Evening before he went to Bed.</p><p>‚ÄòIt was indeed, St. <em>Martin</em>‚Äôs Eve, and People used to make Merry that Night in the place where he was ‚Ä¶ but he assures us, that he had been very Sober all that Day, and that Evening too and that he had not touched a drop of Wine for Three Weeks together.‚Äô</p><p>Sure, Ren√©. Though honestly, the content of the dreams aren‚Äôt as noteworthy as the conclusions he drew from them ‚Äì unless you think ‚Äòwalking through a storm to collect a melon from a guy‚Äô is super weird, I guess. And goodness knows how he got from cantaloupe to conceptualism, but these three dreams are said to have given him the inspiration first for analytic geometry ‚Äì that is, his maths stuff ‚Äì and then the realisation that he could apply the same kind of logical rigour to philosophy. And I don‚Äôt want to minimise what Descartes achieved after this melon-based enlightenment ‚Äì it takes guts to stand up in a world governed by strict ritual and belief and announce that not only is everyone around you an idiot, but also they probably don‚Äôt even exist, so there. But have you ever heard that saying about not being so open-minded that your brain falls out?</p><p>Well, 1619 was also the year that Descartes, writing under the pseudonym ‚ÄòPolybius Cosmopolitanus‚Äô ‚Äì Polybius being an ancient Greek historian, and Cosmopolitanus being Latin for ‚Äòcitizen of the world‚Äô ‚Äì released the <em>Mathematical Thesaurus of Polybius Cosmopolitanus</em>. It kind of sounds like a Terry Gilliam movie, but it was actually a proposal for a way to reform mathematics as a whole.</p><p>It doesn‚Äôt matter that you‚Äôve never heard of it. It‚Äôs not as famous as the <em>Discourse</em>; in fact, it may not have ever even been completed. The important bit wasn‚Äôt what was contained inside the book, but who it was dedicated to: to ‚Äòlearned men throughout the world, and especially to the F.R.C. very famous in G[ermany].‚Äô</p><p>And who was this mysterious F.R.C? Descartes was specifically referencing the <em>Fr√®res de la Rose Croix</em>. In English, they were known as the Brothers of the Rosy Cross ‚Äì and, today, they‚Äôre called the Rosicrucians. So, you may have heard of the Rosicrucians, but it‚Äôs more likely you haven‚Äôt. Today, the term actually refers to two separate organisations, both of which claim to be the ‚Äòreal‚Äô Rosicrucians and both of which denounce the other group as being a bunch of weirdos. They‚Äôre equally wrong on the first point, and equally right on the second: there‚Äôs no Rosicrucian group around today that is directly linked to the original group that Descartes was a fan of, and every iteration of the organisation is and always has been fucking bananas.</p><p>But people in search of a new outlook on the universe often don‚Äôt get to choose which batshit philosophy the world throws at them first, and Descartes had the peculiar fortune of going through his minor mental breakdown in early seventeenth-century Germany.</p><p>Between 1614 and 1616, three ‚Äòmanifestos‚Äô were published in Germany. They were anonymous, recounting the tale of one Christian Rosenkreuz, a man who was born in 1378, travelled across the world, studied under Sufi mystics in the Middle East, came back to Europe to spread the knowledge he had gained in his travels, was rejected by Western scientists and philosophers, and so founded the Rosicrucian Order, a grand name for what was apparently a group of about eight nerdy virgins. All of this, the manifestos said, he accomplished by the age of about twenty-nine, after which he presumably just sat on his thumbs for a long old while since the next big thing he‚Äôs said to have done was die aged 106.</p><p>Now, some people have posited that everything you just read is false ‚Äì a kind of early modern conspiracy theory. And yes, ‚ÄòChristian Rose-Cross‚Äô, as the name translates from German, is rather on the nose for the founder of a Christian sect, and, <em>yes</em>, it‚Äôs a bit farfetched for anybody to have lived for more than a century in the 1400s, <em>and, yes</em>, OK, so the last manifesto was almost certainly actually written by a German theologian named Johann Valentin Andreae, who was attempting to take the piss out of the whole thing and publicly renounced it when he realised people were taking him seriously ‚Äì but that‚Äôs the thing: people <em>did take it seriously</em>. And one of the people who took it seriously seems to have been Descartes.</p><p>‚ÄòThere is a single active power in things: love, charity, harmony,‚Äô mused the philosopher most famous for radical doubt of everything that couldn‚Äôt be proved via logic alone. Not in any published work ‚Äì these were the thoughts of Descartes the early-twenties guy just trying to figure his shit out, found years later in the journal he kept throughout his life.</p><p>Another: ‚ÄòThe wind signifies spirit; movement with the passage of time signifies life; light signifies knowledge; heat signifies love; and instantaneous activity signifies creation. Every corporeal form acts through harmony. There are more wet things than dry things, and more cold things than hot, because if this were not so, the active elements would have won the battle too quickly and the world would not have lasted long.‚Äô</p><p>If that sounds, you know, completely ridiculous to you, that‚Äôs probably because we live in a post-Descartes world, and he didn‚Äôt. All this poor oven-baked idiot had at his disposal were a dream about melons, a steadfast conviction that he had been personally chosen by God to reform the entirety of Western thought up until that point, and some rumours about a weird sect of rosy German virgins who were devoted to doing just that.</p><p>You may have already guessed the next bit of the story: Descartes joins the Rosicrucians and embarks on some insane rituals and philosophies that we‚Äôve never heard of today because it doesn‚Äôt fit in with our modern ideas of ‚Äògenius‚Äô, right?</p><p>It‚Äôs actually way more stupid than that. In a series of events that, once again, really feels like it was ripped straight out of some cult comedy movie, Descartes tried to join the Rosicrucians, but kept running into the problem of them not, in fact, existing. So he couldn‚Äôt join the group, but what he could and did do was accidentally make everyone <em>think </em>he had joined, thus entirely screwing over his reputation as someone to take seriously.</p><p>Of course, in the grand scheme of things, this didn‚Äôt matter much, because to a lot of people he was dangerous enough even without all the conspiracy stuff: his insistence that truth was something for humans, not God, to judge, and the idea that authority should or even could be questioned, made him an enemy of most established Churches, so much so that he eventually published an extremely circular and nonsensical ‚Äòproof‚Äô of God‚Äôs existence to try to placate his attackers.</p><p>The irony was that Descartes <em>knew </em>God existed ‚Äì otherwise who had told him to transform philosophy and mathematics via the medium of melons? And, ultimately, as hubristic as this claim was, Descartes did make good on it, publishing the end result of that night in the oven in the 1640s with a slew of philosophical and metaphysical treatises, which were hailed in his beloved Netherlands as ‚Äòheretical‚Äô and ‚Äòcontrary to orthodox theology‚Äô and ‚Äòget out of our goddamn town Descartes.‚Äô</p><p>Eventually, Descartes found refuge with Christina, Queen of Sweden, who was a fan of his ideas about science and love. She invited him to her court with the promises of setting up a new scientific academy and tutoring her personally. It seemed too good to be true. It was. In 1649, in the middle of winter, Descartes moved to Queen Christina‚Äôs cold, draughty Swedish castle and discovered that he couldn‚Äôt fucking stand his new boss or home. Worst of all for the philosopher who lived his entire life by the principle of never once waking up before noon, Christina declared that she could only be tutored at five in the morning, a demand that Descartes responded to as any night owl would: by saying ‚ÄòI would literally rather die‚Äô and promptly proving his point by literally dying just a few months later. In his final act, the man famous for telling the world ‚ÄòI think, therefore I am‚Äô had posed an equally unknowable philosophical conclusion: he would no longer think, and therefore he no longer existed.</p><p>Perhaps the final irony in the tale is that, as heretical as <em>cogito ergo sum </em>was considered at the time, with its previously unthinkably radical concept of doubting everything, even that which seems self-evident ‚Äì modern philosophers have actually critiqued Descartes as <em>not going far enough</em>. Thinkers such as Kierkegaard have blasted Descartes for presupposing that ‚ÄòI‚Äô exists at all, and Nietzsche for presupposing that ‚Äòthinking‚Äô exists.</p><p>I guess the moral of Descartes‚Äôs story, if there is one, is probably this: you can‚Äôt please all of the people all of the time ‚Äì especially if they‚Äôre philosophers. So, honestly? Why <em>not </em>just smoke a bunch of weed and crawl into an oven?</p><p></p><p>* Some modern scientists have suggested that Descartes‚Äôs night in the oven may in fact be the earliest recorded experience of Exploding Head Syndrome, a sleep disorder you may well have had yourself once or twice. Despite the gnarly name, it doesn‚Äôt actually involve your head exploding ‚Äì that would certainly have made Descartes‚Äôs future work more impressive ‚Äì but it does cause you to hear loud bangs and crashes that aren‚Äôt really there, and sometimes see flashes of light as well, both of which Descartes recorded experiencing that night.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-edisons-ghosts-katie-spalding-little-brown-and-company-143030441.html?src=rss

<p>A US federal court this week gave final approval to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-butterfly-keyboard-lawsuit-settlement-154210232.html">$50 million class-action</a> settlement Apple came to last July resolving claims the company knew about and concealed the unreliable nature of keyboards on MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro computers released between 2015 and 2019. Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rejects-challenges-apples-50-mln-keyboard-settlement-2023-05-26/"><em>Reuters</em></a> (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/26/apple-macbook-keyboard-lawsuit-payments/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>), Judge Edward Davila on Thursday called the settlement involving Apple‚Äôs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-12-apple-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-macbook-keyboards.html">infamous ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù keyboards</a> ‚Äúfair, adequate and reasonable.‚Äù Under the agreement, MacBook users impacted by the saga will receive settlements between $50 and $395. More than 86,000 claims for class member payments were made before the application deadline last March, Judge Davila wrote in his ruling.</p><p>Apple debuted the butterfly keyboard in 2015 with the 12-inch MacBook. At the time, former design chief <a href="https://youtu.be/fWMiTHyGfwE">Jony Ive</a> boasted that the mechanism would allow the company to build ever-slimmer laptops without compromising on stability or typing feel. As Apple re-engineered more of its computers to incorporate the butterfly keyboard, Mac users found the design was susceptible to dust and other debris. The company introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-13-ifixit-macbook-pro-keyboard-cover-up.html">multiple revisions</a> to make the mechanism more resilient before eventually returning to a more conventional keyboard design with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-macbook-pro-16-inch-review-ultimate-apple-laptop.html">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> in late 2019.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple won‚Äôt have to admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement agreement. Before this week, some members of the class action lawsuit attempted to challenge the deal on the grounds that a proposed $125 payout for one group in the class was not enough, an appeal Judge Davila rejected. ‚ÄúThe possibility that a better settlement may have been reached ‚Äî or that the benefits provided under the settlement will not make class members 'whole' ‚Äî are insufficient grounds to deny approval,‚Äù Davila wrote in his ruling. The judge also rejected a request for compensation from MacBook owners who experienced keyboard failures but did not get their computers serviced by Apple. There‚Äôs no word when claimants can expect their payment to be sent out, but the lawyers involved in the case said they ‚Äúlook forward to getting the money out to our clients.‚Äù</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/us-judge-grants-final-approval-to-apples-50-million-butterfly-keyboard-settlement-141223797.html?src=rss
