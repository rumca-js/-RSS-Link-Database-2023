Unfortunately, it is not easy to use because the information is hidden. This video shows how everything works and how you must set up the Arduino IDE to exploit the USB functionality. I promise it will save you a lot of frustration and time. And it is the basis for a future video about simple debugging with the new Arduino IDE 2.0\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nESP32-S3-DevKitC-1: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCUfbC1\nESP32-S3 Development board (TTGO): https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DE6OEsN\nESP32-S3 modules: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdftNZx\nESP32-C3 datasheet: https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c3_datasheet_en.pdf\nESP32-S2 datasheet: https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s2_datasheet_en.pdf\nESP32-S3 datasheet: https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3_datasheet_en.pdf\nSRV05-4 ESD chip: https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/srv05-4-d.pdf\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://passiv-energie.gmbh/\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\nhttps://yosmart.com/\nYouTuber Patreon: https://www.youtube.com/@MakersMashup/\n\nThe links above usually are affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost to you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGitHub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.
