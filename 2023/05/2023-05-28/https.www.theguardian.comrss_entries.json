Not so much the trousers and jackets sported on his train travel, although they remain borderline criminal, but his efforts to engage with The Poor. First in 1993, when he emulated the lifestyle of a single mother on benefits (\u201cFor someone like me, who\u2019s never had to think about these things, it\u2019s just boring having to think all the time about how you buy the cheapest things and whether the money\u2019s going to last\u201d). And then again \u2013 because those poor and their boring lives are always with us, are they not? \u2013 five years ago he gave us a feature-length documentary in which he oozed around the council estates of England in Our Housing Crisis: Who\u2019s to Blame? If memory serves, the answer somehow wasn\u2019t Margaret Thatcher\u2019s reign-defining sell-off of the public housing stock (we had 6.5m council homes in 1980; nearly a third of them were transferred to private hands under the Right to Buy scheme). Instead, it was apparently the failure of councils to build replacements since. Obvious, really, especially if you are a devotee of oleaginous logic delivered with a smug but straight face.</p><p>But it all comes flooding back. As do awful memories of Matthew Parris attempting to live on benefits for a week in 1983. He considered the people he met, living \u201cmeagre and threadbare\u201d lives, were at the right level of poverty to stay motivated, and returned 20 years later to find how things had turned out.

In just 49 days, she and her chancellor undermined long-term investor confidence to the extent that the UK government, once able to borrow at interest rates of almost zero, now faces some of the highest borrowing costs of developed nations, with these costs liable to rise even further as a result of only moderately bad economic news. It means that for the first time in decades, the UK is subject to the same sorts of external market pressures on its investment, tax and spending decisions as much less affluent economies.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/28/observer-view-on-tories-disastrous-economic-legacy\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/28/observer-view-on-tories-disastrous-economic-legacy", "date_published": "2023-05-28 05:31:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "China\u2019s first domestically produced passenger jet makes maiden commercial flight", "description": "<p>Although China hopes to cut its reliance on foreign technology, many of the C919\u2019s parts are sourced from overseas</p><p>China\u2019s first domestically produced passenger jet took off on its maiden commercial flight on Sunday, a milestone event in the nation\u2019s decades-long effort to compete with western rivals in the air.</p><p>Beijing hopes the C919 commercial jetliner will challenge foreign models like the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320, though many of its parts are sourced from abroad.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/chinas-first-domestically-produced-passenger-jet-makes-maiden-commercial-flight\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/chinas-first-domestically-produced-passenger-jet-makes-maiden-commercial-flight", "date_published": "2023-05-28 05:28:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The plot is up, now it\u2019s just a question of keeping it running", "description": "<p>As the plants find their legs, the summer jobs of watering and a little light weeding come to the fore</p><p>Our early summer sowing is done for now.

So here I am, clambering atop my soapbox once more, megaphone in hand, to preach to the many unconverted my message that all wine-drinkers\u2019 lives would be richer with a little orange in their lives. It seems to me that the best of these wines combine the best qualities of white and red wines \u2013 the freshness and raciness of whites; the chew and complexity of reds \u2013 to make something original. In fact, the term orange covers such a broad spectrum of colours and styles \u2013 from wines that are all-but-indistinguishable from whites in appearance and flavour to the dark amber and nuttily sherry-like \u2013 it makes generalisations about the category every bit as flawed as they are for red wine. Better, perhaps, to treat each orange wine as an individual, capable, as Vi\u00f1a Gonz\u00e1lez Bastias\u2019s glorious muscat-based example is, of sui generis flavours and textures such as, in this case, the combination of mouthwatering citrus pith tang and chewiness with floral, muscat grapey prettiness.</p><p><strong>Black</strong><strong>book Slow Disco </strong><strong>Sauvignon Blanc</strong><strong>, Essex, England 2021 </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>\u00a319, <a href=\"https://www.blackbookwinery.com/shop/2021-slow-disco-sauvignon-blanc\" title=\"\">Blackbook Winery</a></strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong>Orange wines are effectively the red wines of the white grape world. Just as red wines get their colour, chewy tannins and much of their flavour complexity from the (red) grape skins, so orange wines are made by keeping the juice of white grapes in contact with the skins for an extended period during fermentation. Most white wines, by contrast, are made solely from the juice of white grapes, while ros\u00e9 wines, which at their palest are effectively the white wines of the red grape world, are made from red grapes which have only been in very brief contact with the skins. Much of the stylistic range in orange wines derives from each winemaker\u2019s skin-maceration recipe. Some producers, such as Battersea-based urban winery Blackbook, give their pristine, Essex-grown sauvignon blanc fruit just a few (12) days of skin contact, which gives a colour at the golden end of the white wine spectrum and a little extra texture to the classic tropical-citrus-elderflower sauvignon flavours.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/28/why-orange-wines-are-the-best-of-both-worlds\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/28/why-orange-wines-are-the-best-of-both-worlds", "date_published": "2023-05-28 05:01:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Red Berets ride to the rescue of New York subway commuters, 1979", "description": "Help was at hand for \u2018the worst routes, the least well-lit stations and the poorest, most violent neighbourhoods\u2019<p>\u2018Chivalry has returned to New York,\u2019 proclaimed the <em>Observer</em> on 15 July 1979, as it descended into the lawless New York subway underworld, accompanied by the Magnificent Thirteen Subway Patrol, AKA the Red Berets.
