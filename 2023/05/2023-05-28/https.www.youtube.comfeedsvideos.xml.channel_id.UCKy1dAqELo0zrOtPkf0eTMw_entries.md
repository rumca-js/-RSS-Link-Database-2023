What’s up dads, grads, and everyone else - June is here and with it, a ton of massive video games. June’s usually pretty slow game release-wise, but this year, that is not the case. From Street Fighter 6, to Final Fantasy 16, to Diablo IV here are the biggest games out this month.

Oh, and heads up, we’re producing this video before the numerous gaming showcases and events happening this month, so it’s very possible some games get surprised June release dates.

IGN host Kim Horcher makes her case that Disney live-action remakes should be focused around animated films that never became classics in the first place. As Disney’s live-action Little Mermaid opens in theaters and a live-action Moana adaptation has just been announced, this video gives an unlikely look at what could be coming next from the history of Disney animation.
