In 2015, the nation made a breakthrough when JAXA scientists successfully beamed 1.8 kilowatts of power, enough energy to power an electric kettle, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-12-scientists-make-strides-in-beaming-solar-power-from-space.html\"><ins>more than 50 meters</ins></a> to a wireless receiver. Now, Japan is poised to bring the technology one step closer to reality.</p><p><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Science/Japan-to-try-beaming-solar-power-from-space-in-mid-decade\"><em><ins>Nikkei</ins></em></a> reports a Japanese public-private partnership will attempt to beam solar energy from space as early as 2025. The project, led by Naoki Shinohara, a Kyoto University professor who has been working on space-based solar energy since 2009, will attempt to deploy a series of small satellites in orbit. Those will then try to beam the solar energy the arrays collect to ground-based receiving stations hundreds of miles away.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Using orbital solar panels and microwaves to send energy to Earth was first proposed in 1968. Since then, a few countries, including <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-18-china-solar-farm-power-station-space-2025.html\"><ins>China</ins></a> and the US, have spent time and money pursuing the idea. The technology is appealing because orbital solar arrays represent a potentially unlimited renewable energy supply. In space, solar panels can collect energy no matter the time of day, and by using microwaves to beam the power they produce, clouds aren\u2019t a concern either. However, even if Japan successfully deploys a set of orbital solar arrays, the tech would still be closer to science fiction than fact. That\u2019s because producing an array that can generate 1 gigawatt of power \u2013 or about the output of one nuclear reactor \u2013 would cost about $7 billion with currently available technologies.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/japan-will-try-to-beam-solar-power-from-space-by-2025-214338244.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/japan-will-try-to-beam-solar-power-from-space-by-2025-214338244.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-28 21:43:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Portugal considers banning Huawei from national 5G networks", "description": "<p>Portugal could become the latest country to effectively ban Huawei and other Chinese firms from participating in its 5G buildouts.

Gurman reports the prototype, codenamed Eureka, \u201cfeels far lighter and thinner\u201d than its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html\">predecessor</a>. He says the head strap \u201cseems a bit stronger,\u201d too, and uses fabric on the sides instead of plastic like the Quest 2.</p><p>More consequentially, the front of the device reportedly features a new design incorporating an enhanced sensor suite. Three \u201cvertical pill-shaped sensor areas\u201d house two color video pass-through cameras, two standard cameras and a depth sensor. As Gurman notes, that\u2019s a significant upgrade from the Quest 2, which doesn\u2019t come with color pass-through or a depth sensor. The presence of the former means you won\u2019t need to designate the walls in your play space.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The front lower sides of the headset feature tracking cameras, while the bottom has a volume rocker and a wheel to adjust interpupillary distance. That means you can tweak the Quest 3\u2019s IPD without taking the headset off, something you can\u2019t do with the Quest 2.</p><p>\u201cThe actual clarity and VR displays within the Quest 3 feel similar to those in the Quest 2 \u2014 despite the resolution being rumored to be slightly higher,\u201d Gurman writes, while noting pass-through for mixed reality applications and overall performance is significantly improved over the Quest 2. Speaking to the former, he says there\u2019s a \u201cnight-and-day improvement\u201d thanks to the added dual RGB cameras. \u201cI was even able to use my phone while wearing the headset, something that often feels impossible on a Quest 2,\u201d he adds. As for performance, Quest 3 reportedly features Qualcomm\u2019s next-generation <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-vr-headsets-will-continue-to-qualcomm-chips-for-the-foreseeable-future-120555404.html\"><ins>Snapdragon XR2 chipset</ins></a>, leading to shorter app launch times and more consistent frame rates in games.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Gurman says the Quest 3 doesn\u2019t include face and eye tracking, which means the headset won\u2019t support foveated rendering. That\u2019s a feature you can find on the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html\"><ins>Quest Pro</ins></a>. It allows the system to prioritize its limited computing resources on areas where you\u2019re looking.

Think about it \u2013 in any cartoon or sitcom where one character is (or, through logically-spurious means, suddenly becomes) a brainiac, there are three things they\u2019re narratively bound to say: \u2018the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s Pythagoras; \u2018<em>E </em>= <em>mc</em>2\u2019 \u2013 thank you, Einstein; and finally, \u2018cogito ergo sum\u2019. And <em>that </em>is Descartes.</p><p>Specifically, it\u2019s <em>old </em>Descartes \u2013 Descartes after he had figured his shit out. But while his later writings undeniably played a huge and important role in setting up how we approach the world today \u2013 he\u2019s actually one of the main figures who brought us the concept of the scientific method \u2013 Descartes\u2019s early years leaned a little more on the silly and gullible than the master of scepticism he\u2019s come to be known as.</p><p>Descartes was born in 1596, which places him firmly in that period where science and philosophy and magic were all pretty much the same thing. He\u2019s probably best known as a philosopher these days, but that\u2019s likely because a lot of his developments in mathematics have become so incredibly fundamental that we kind of forget they had to be invented by anybody at all. And I know I\u2019m saying that with ten years of mathematical training behind me and a PhD on the shelf, but even if you haven\u2019t set foot in a maths class since school, you\u2019ll be familiar with something that Descartes invented, because he was the guy who came up with graphs. That\u2019s actually why the points in a graph are given by <em>Cartesian coordinates </em>\u2013 it\u2019s from the Latin form of his name, Renatus Cartesius.</p><p>And while maths, despite what everyone keeps telling me, <em>can </em>be sexy, \u2018cogito ergo sum\u2019 really does have a nice ring to it, doesn\u2019t it? \u2018I think, therefore I am.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t sound like a huge philosophical leap \u2013 in fact, it kind of sounds like tautological nonsense \u2013 but it\u2019s actually one of the most important conclusions ever reached in Western thought.</p><p>See, before Descartes, philosophy didn\u2019t exactly have the sort of wishy-washy, pie-in-the-sky reputation it enjoys today. The dominant school of thought was Scholasticism, which was basically like debate club mixed with year nine science. Sounds fair enough, but in practice \u2013 and especially when combined with the strong religious atmosphere and general lack of science up till that point \u2013 it was basically a long period of everybody riffing on Plato and Aristotle and trying to make their Ancient Greek teachings match up with the Bible. This was, needless to say, not always easy, and led to rather a lot of navel gazing over questions like \u2018Do demons get jealous?\u2019 and \u2018Do angels take up physical space?\u2019</p><p>Descartes\u2019s approach was radically different. He didn\u2019t see the point in answering questions like how many angels can dance on the head of a pin until he\u2019d been properly convinced of the existence of angels. And dancing. And pins.</p><p>Now, of course, this is the point when non-philosophers throw up their hands in despair and say something along the lines of \u2018Of <em>course </em>pins exist, you idiot, I have some upstairs keeping my posters up! Jesus, Ren\u00e9, are we really paying a fortune in university fees just so you can sit around and doubt the existence of stationery?\u2019</p><p>But to that, Descartes would reply: are you sure? I mean, we\u2019ve all had dreams before that are so convincing that we wake up thinking we really <em>did </em>adopt a baby elephant after our teeth all fell out. How do I know I\u2019m not dreaming now? How do I know this isn\u2019t a <em>The Matrix</em>-type situation, and what you think are pins are just a trick being played on us by Agent Smith?</p><p>In fact, when you get right down to it, Descartes would say, how can we be sure <em>anything </em>exists? I might not even exist! I might be a brain in a vat, being cleverly stimulated in such a way as to induce a vast hallucination! And yes, sure, I agree that sounds <em>unlikely</em>, but it\u2019s not <em>impossible </em>\u2013 the point is, we simply can\u2019t <em>know</em>.</p><p>The only thing I can be sure of, Descartes would continue \u2013 despite everyone by this point rolling their eyes and muttering things like \u2018see what you started, Bill\u2019 \u2013 is that <em>I </em>exist. And I can be sure of that, because I\u2019m thinking these thoughts about what exists. I may just be a brain in a vat, being fed lies about the reality that surrounds me, but \u2018I\u2019, \u2018me\u2019, my sense of self and consciousness \u2013 that definitely exists. To summarise: I think \u2013 therefore I am.</p><p>It was a hell of a breakthrough \u2013 he\u2019d basically Jenga\u2019d the entire prevailing worldview into obsolescence. And it\u2019s the kind of idea that could really only have come from someone like Descartes: a weirdo celebrity heretic pseudo-refugee who had a weakness for cross-eyed women, weed and conspiracy theories.</p><p>Descartes was, as his name suggests, French by birth, hailing from a small town vaguely west of the centre of the country. If you look it up on a map, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s actually called Descartes, but it\u2019s not some uncanny coincidence \u2013 the town was renamed in 1967 after its most famous resident.</p><p>Which is kind of odd, because it\u2019s not like Descartes spent all that much time there. He went to school in La Fl\u00e8che, more than 100km away, where even at the tender age of ten he was displaying the sort of behaviour that would make him perfectly suited to a life of philosophy, sleeping in until lunch every day and only attending lectures when he felt like it. This can\u2019t have made him all that popular with the other kids, who were all expected to get up before 5am, but that\u2019s why you choose a school whose rector is a close family friend, I suppose, and, in any case, by the time the young Ren\u00e9 turned up they were probably all too tired to do much about it.</p><p>After finishing high school, he spent a couple of years at uni studying law, as per his father\u2019s wishes \u2013 his dad came from a less well-to-do branch of the Descartes family tree, and probably would have wanted Descartes to keep up appearances for the sake of holding on to posh perks like not paying taxes. It must have pained him, therefore, when after graduating with a <em>Licence </em>in both church and civil law, Descartes immediately gave it all up and went on an extended gap year. \u2018As soon as my age permitted me to pass from under the control of my instructors, I entirely abandoned the study of letters, and resolved no longer to seek any other science than the knowledge of myself, or of the great book of the world,\u2019 he would later write, like some kind of nineteen-year-old <em>Eat Pray Love </em>devotee.</p><p>\u2018I spent the remainder of my youth in travelling, in visiting courts and armies, in holding intercourse with men of different dispositions and ranks, [and] in collecting varied experience,\u2019 he continued, in his philosophical treatise-slash-autobiography <em>Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One\u2019s Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences</em>, which for obvious time-saving reasons is usually referred to as <em>Discourse on the Method</em>. Andlike so many philosophy students throughout history, there was one place he found in his travels that caught Descartes\u2019s heart and imagination more than anywhere else: Amsterdam.</p><p>Now, it is of course true that places can change a lot over the course of 400 years \u2013 at this point in history, France was being ruled by a nine-year-old autocrat and his mum, Germany didn\u2019t exist, and England was a few years short of becoming a Republic. So you might think, sure, <em>these days </em>Amsterdam has a bit of a reputation, but back in Descartes\u2019s time, it was probably a hub of quiet intellectualism and sombre, clean living.</p><p>Nope! Dynasties may rise and fall, empires spread and eventually fracture, but apparently, Amsterdam has always been Amsterdam. Descartes spent his first few years in the city living his absolute best life, studying engineering and maths under the direction of Simon Stevin \u2013 another guy you\u2019ve never heard of who made a mathematical breakthrough you almost certainly use every single day of your life, since he invented the decimal point \u2013 and dressing like an emo and throwing himself into music. He joined the Dutch army for a bit, despite being by all accounts a tiny weedy bobble-headed French guy, and, yes, he almost certainly smoked a bunch of pot along the way.</p><p>And then, one November night in 1619, while on tour in Bavaria, Descartes had a Revelation. And he had it, according to his near-contemporary biographer Adrien Baillet, inside an oven.</p><p>\u2018He found himself in a place so remote from Communication, and so little frequented by people, whose Conversation might afford him any Diversion, that he even procured himself such a privacy, as the condition of his Ambulatory Life could permit him,\u2019 Baillet writes.</p><p>\u2018Not \u2026 having by good luck any anxieties, nor passions, within, that were capable of disturbing him, he staid withal all the Day long in his stove, where he had leisure enough to entertain himself with his thoughts,\u2019 he continues, as if that\u2019s a normal thing to write and not an account of someone being so introverted that they secluded themselves miles away from anyone who knew them and then crawled into an oven for the day.</p><p>Modern biographers have suggested a few interpretations of what this oven might have been, and I\u2019m sorry to report that, of course, it\u2019s not as ridiculous as it first seems: in the seventeenth century, before we\u2019d tamed electricity and gas mains and whatnot, a \u2018stove\u2019 or \u2018oven\u2019 was more like your modern-day airing cupboard than an Aga. Just bigger. And fancier. And all your towels are on fire. Look, the analogy isn\u2019t perfect, but the point is that when Descartes said, in <em>Discourse on the Method</em>, that he had \u2018spent all day entertaining his thoughts in an oven\u2019, he wasn\u2019t being completely absurd \u2013 just, you know, kind of weird.</p><p>Depending on where you fall on the scale between \u2018Descartes was a stoner lol\u2019 and \u2018Descartes was a paragon of virtue, 10/10 no notes awesome dude\u2019, what happened next was either the result of too much weed, too much oven, or too much being a fricking genius destined to reform all of Western philosophy. Either way, he had a pretty rough night, full of strange dreams and disturbing hallucinations* that even the loyal Baillet thought might be a sign he was going a little bonkers.</p><p>\u2018He acquaints us, That on the Tenth of <em>November </em>1619, laying himself down <em>Brim-full of Enthusiasm</em>, and \u2026 <em>having found that day the Foundations of the wonderful Science</em>, he had Three dreams one presently after another; yet so extraordinary, as to make him fancy that they were sent him from above,\u2019 writes Baillet, just in case you were wondering where on that scale Descartes would put himself. In fact, so sure was he of the divine nature of his dreams that, Baillet said, \u2018a Man would have been apt to have believed that he had been a little Crack-brain\u2019d, or that he might have drank a Cup too much that Evening before he went to Bed.</p><p>\u2018It was indeed, St. <em>Martin</em>\u2019s Eve, and People used to make Merry that Night in the place where he was \u2026 but he assures us, that he had been very Sober all that Day, and that Evening too and that he had not touched a drop of Wine for Three Weeks together.\u2019</p><p>Sure, Ren\u00e9. Though honestly, the content of the dreams aren\u2019t as noteworthy as the conclusions he drew from them \u2013 unless you think \u2018walking through a storm to collect a melon from a guy\u2019 is super weird, I guess. And goodness knows how he got from cantaloupe to conceptualism, but these three dreams are said to have given him the inspiration first for analytic geometry \u2013 that is, his maths stuff \u2013 and then the realisation that he could apply the same kind of logical rigour to philosophy. And I don\u2019t want to minimise what Descartes achieved after this melon-based enlightenment \u2013 it takes guts to stand up in a world governed by strict ritual and belief and announce that not only is everyone around you an idiot, but also they probably don\u2019t even exist, so there. But have you ever heard that saying about not being so open-minded that your brain falls out?</p><p>Well, 1619 was also the year that Descartes, writing under the pseudonym \u2018Polybius Cosmopolitanus\u2019 \u2013 Polybius being an ancient Greek historian, and Cosmopolitanus being Latin for \u2018citizen of the world\u2019 \u2013 released the <em>Mathematical Thesaurus of Polybius Cosmopolitanus</em>. It kind of sounds like a Terry Gilliam movie, but it was actually a proposal for a way to reform mathematics as a whole.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019ve never heard of it. It\u2019s not as famous as the <em>Discourse</em>; in fact, it may not have ever even been completed. The important bit wasn\u2019t what was contained inside the book, but who it was dedicated to: to \u2018learned men throughout the world, and especially to the F.R.C. very famous in G[ermany].\u2019</p><p>And who was this mysterious F.R.C? Descartes was specifically referencing the <em>Fr\u00e8res de la Rose Croix</em>. In English, they were known as the Brothers of the Rosy Cross \u2013 and, today, they\u2019re called the Rosicrucians. So, you may have heard of the Rosicrucians, but it\u2019s more likely you haven\u2019t. Today, the term actually refers to two separate organisations, both of which claim to be the \u2018real\u2019 Rosicrucians and both of which denounce the other group as being a bunch of weirdos. They\u2019re equally wrong on the first point, and equally right on the second: there\u2019s no Rosicrucian group around today that is directly linked to the original group that Descartes was a fan of, and every iteration of the organisation is and always has been fucking bananas.</p><p>But people in search of a new outlook on the universe often don\u2019t get to choose which batshit philosophy the world throws at them first, and Descartes had the peculiar fortune of going through his minor mental breakdown in early seventeenth-century Germany.</p><p>Between 1614 and 1616, three \u2018manifestos\u2019 were published in Germany. They were anonymous, recounting the tale of one Christian Rosenkreuz, a man who was born in 1378, travelled across the world, studied under Sufi mystics in the Middle East, came back to Europe to spread the knowledge he had gained in his travels, was rejected by Western scientists and philosophers, and so founded the Rosicrucian Order, a grand name for what was apparently a group of about eight nerdy virgins. All of this, the manifestos said, he accomplished by the age of about twenty-nine, after which he presumably just sat on his thumbs for a long old while since the next big thing he\u2019s said to have done was die aged 106.</p><p>Now, some people have posited that everything you just read is false \u2013 a kind of early modern conspiracy theory. And yes, \u2018Christian Rose-Cross\u2019, as the name translates from German, is rather on the nose for the founder of a Christian sect, and, <em>yes</em>, it\u2019s a bit farfetched for anybody to have lived for more than a century in the 1400s, <em>and, yes</em>, OK, so the last manifesto was almost certainly actually written by a German theologian named Johann Valentin Andreae, who was attempting to take the piss out of the whole thing and publicly renounced it when he realised people were taking him seriously \u2013 but that\u2019s the thing: people <em>did take it seriously</em>. And one of the people who took it seriously seems to have been Descartes.</p><p>\u2018There is a single active power in things: love, charity, harmony,\u2019 mused the philosopher most famous for radical doubt of everything that couldn\u2019t be proved via logic alone. Not in any published work \u2013 these were the thoughts of Descartes the early-twenties guy just trying to figure his shit out, found years later in the journal he kept throughout his life.</p><p>Another: \u2018The wind signifies spirit; movement with the passage of time signifies life; light signifies knowledge; heat signifies love; and instantaneous activity signifies creation. Every corporeal form acts through harmony. There are more wet things than dry things, and more cold things than hot, because if this were not so, the active elements would have won the battle too quickly and the world would not have lasted long.\u2019</p><p>If that sounds, you know, completely ridiculous to you, that\u2019s probably because we live in a post-Descartes world, and he didn\u2019t. All this poor oven-baked idiot had at his disposal were a dream about melons, a steadfast conviction that he had been personally chosen by God to reform the entirety of Western thought up until that point, and some rumours about a weird sect of rosy German virgins who were devoted to doing just that.</p><p>You may have already guessed the next bit of the story: Descartes joins the Rosicrucians and embarks on some insane rituals and philosophies that we\u2019ve never heard of today because it doesn\u2019t fit in with our modern ideas of \u2018genius\u2019, right?</p><p>It\u2019s actually way more stupid than that. In a series of events that, once again, really feels like it was ripped straight out of some cult comedy movie, Descartes tried to join the Rosicrucians, but kept running into the problem of them not, in fact, existing. So he couldn\u2019t join the group, but what he could and did do was accidentally make everyone <em>think </em>he had joined, thus entirely screwing over his reputation as someone to take seriously.</p><p>Of course, in the grand scheme of things, this didn\u2019t matter much, because to a lot of people he was dangerous enough even without all the conspiracy stuff: his insistence that truth was something for humans, not God, to judge, and the idea that authority should or even could be questioned, made him an enemy of most established Churches, so much so that he eventually published an extremely circular and nonsensical \u2018proof\u2019 of God\u2019s existence to try to placate his attackers.</p><p>The irony was that Descartes <em>knew </em>God existed \u2013 otherwise who had told him to transform philosophy and mathematics via the medium of melons? And, ultimately, as hubristic as this claim was, Descartes did make good on it, publishing the end result of that night in the oven in the 1640s with a slew of philosophical and metaphysical treatises, which were hailed in his beloved Netherlands as \u2018heretical\u2019 and \u2018contrary to orthodox theology\u2019 and \u2018get out of our goddamn town Descartes.\u2019</p><p>Eventually, Descartes found refuge with Christina, Queen of Sweden, who was a fan of his ideas about science and love. She invited him to her court with the promises of setting up a new scientific academy and tutoring her personally. It seemed too good to be true. It was. In 1649, in the middle of winter, Descartes moved to Queen Christina\u2019s cold, draughty Swedish castle and discovered that he couldn\u2019t fucking stand his new boss or home. Worst of all for the philosopher who lived his entire life by the principle of never once waking up before noon, Christina declared that she could only be tutored at five in the morning, a demand that Descartes responded to as any night owl would: by saying \u2018I would literally rather die\u2019 and promptly proving his point by literally dying just a few months later. In his final act, the man famous for telling the world \u2018I think, therefore I am\u2019 had posed an equally unknowable philosophical conclusion: he would no longer think, and therefore he no longer existed.</p><p>Perhaps the final irony in the tale is that, as heretical as <em>cogito ergo sum </em>was considered at the time, with its previously unthinkably radical concept of doubting everything, even that which seems self-evident \u2013 modern philosophers have actually critiqued Descartes as <em>not going far enough</em>. Thinkers such as Kierkegaard have blasted Descartes for presupposing that \u2018I\u2019 exists at all, and Nietzsche for presupposing that \u2018thinking\u2019 exists.</p><p>I guess the moral of Descartes\u2019s story, if there is one, is probably this: you can\u2019t please all of the people all of the time \u2013 especially if they\u2019re philosophers. So, honestly? Why <em>not </em>just smoke a bunch of weed and crawl into an oven?</p><p></p><p>* Some modern scientists have suggested that Descartes\u2019s night in the oven may in fact be the earliest recorded experience of Exploding Head Syndrome, a sleep disorder you may well have had yourself once or twice. Despite the gnarly name, it doesn\u2019t actually involve your head exploding \u2013 that would certainly have made Descartes\u2019s future work more impressive \u2013 but it does cause you to hear loud bangs and crashes that aren\u2019t really there, and sometimes see flashes of light as well, both of which Descartes recorded experiencing that night.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-edisons-ghosts-katie-spalding-little-brown-and-company-143030441.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-edisons-ghosts-katie-spalding-little-brown-and-company-143030441.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-28 14:30:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "US judge grants final approval to Apple\u2019s $50 million \u2018butterfly\u2019 keyboard settlement", "description": "<p>A US federal court this week gave final approval to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-butterfly-keyboard-lawsuit-settlement-154210232.html\">$50 million class-action</a> settlement Apple came to last July resolving claims the company knew about and concealed the unreliable nature of keyboards on MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro computers released between 2015 and 2019. Per <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rejects-challenges-apples-50-mln-keyboard-settlement-2023-05-26/\"><em>Reuters</em></a> (via <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/26/apple-macbook-keyboard-lawsuit-payments/\"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>), Judge Edward Davila on Thursday called the settlement involving Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-12-apple-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-macbook-keyboards.html\">infamous \u201cbutterfly\u201d keyboards</a> \u201cfair, adequate and reasonable.\u201d Under the agreement, MacBook users impacted by the saga will receive settlements between $50 and $395. More than 86,000 claims for class member payments were made before the application deadline last March, Judge Davila wrote in his ruling.</p><p>Apple debuted the butterfly keyboard in 2015 with the 12-inch MacBook. At the time, former design chief <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fWMiTHyGfwE\">Jony Ive</a> boasted that the mechanism would allow the company to build ever-slimmer laptops without compromising on stability or typing feel. As Apple re-engineered more of its computers to incorporate the butterfly keyboard, Mac users found the design was susceptible to dust and other debris. The company introduced <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-13-ifixit-macbook-pro-keyboard-cover-up.html\">multiple revisions</a> to make the mechanism more resilient before eventually returning to a more conventional keyboard design with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-macbook-pro-16-inch-review-ultimate-apple-laptop.html\">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> in late 2019.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Apple won\u2019t have to admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement agreement. Before this week, some members of the class action lawsuit attempted to challenge the deal on the grounds that a proposed $125 payout for one group in the class was not enough, an appeal Judge Davila rejected. \u201cThe possibility that a better settlement may have been reached \u2014 or that the benefits provided under the settlement will not make class members 'whole' \u2014 are insufficient grounds to deny approval,\u201d Davila wrote in his ruling. The judge also rejected a request for compensation from MacBook owners who experienced keyboard failures but did not get their computers serviced by Apple. There\u2019s no word when claimants can expect their payment to be sent out, but the lawyers involved in the case said they \u201clook forward to getting the money out to our clients.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/us-judge-grants-final-approval-to-apples-50-million-butterfly-keyboard-settlement-141223797.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/us-judge-grants-final-approval-to-apples-50-million-butterfly-keyboard-settlement-141223797.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-28 14:12:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
