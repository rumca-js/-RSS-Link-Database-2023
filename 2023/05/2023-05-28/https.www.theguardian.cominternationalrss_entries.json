It is set in 2032, and Anna, a former influencer, is due to undergo an extreme surgery, Aesthetica (also the title of the book, by <a href=\"https://allierowbottom.com/\" title=\"\">Allie Rowbottom</a>), which promises to reverse every cosmetic procedure she\u2019s had on her face and body over the past 15 years. \u201cThis is the best I can hope for,\u201d Anna thinks. \u201cA clean slate before the next storm, next tragedy, next decade.\u201d As soon as I\u2019d finished reading the book, I started to read about the book.

When Kylie Jenner appeared to have dissolved her famous lip fillers, clinics reported an immediate rise in requests for similar procedures. And more celebrities started doing the same: the <em>Evening Standard</em> reported how Kate Moss\u2019s half-sister Lottie had paid \u00a3450 to get lip fillers then the same price to get them dissolved. American model Blac Chyna posted a video of her facial fillers getting dissolved. \u201cBack to the baseline\u2026\u201d she said. Courteney Cox talked on a podcast about her biggest beauty regrets: \u201cFillers,\u201d but, \u201cI was able to reverse most of that.\u201d We are seeing a shift in beauty, a living make-under montage. Almost a decade since Jenner first admitted to lip fillers (increasing Google searches for them by 11,300% in 24 hours), injectables have spread through towns and faces with remarkable speed, sometimes \u201cmigrating\u201d from eye to cheek, leaving people looking vaguely uncanny, or from famous pop stars to tired mums on a Black Friday deal.
