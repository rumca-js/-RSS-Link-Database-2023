No, this is just a good ol' fashioned line dispute where two families turned Fantasyland into an all-out brawl with fists and mouse-ear hats flying this way and that.</p><p>If you are oldhead enough like me to remember the band Ugly Kid Joe, play "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRXnoFTdlOE" target="_blank">Madman Loose in Disneyland</a>" in the background for added enjoyment.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/disney-world-descends-chaos-two-families-brawl-huge-magic-kingdom-fight?intcmp=tw_fnc" target="_blank">The incident begins</a> online for Mickey's PhilharMagic, a music concert starring Mickey, Donald Duck, and a few others. One girl left her phone somewhere and went to go get it while her family stayed in line. When the girl returned, a family behind her family wouldn't let her through. Her family waited outside for the other family for the performance.</p><blockquote>"We don't appreciate you guys pushing my younger sister."</blockquote><p>At which point, sh*t was on-sight.</p><p>Screaming led to pushing. Pushing led to punches. Punches led to all-out pandemonium. A real slobber knocker, as Western philosopher Jim Ross would say. There were injuries. One man was hospitalized with his face cut open. Three people were arrested. Even worse, the families were kicked out before they got to ride Space Mountain.</p><p>The only heroes in this are the people who took out their smartphones. They got some amazing content.</p><p>As of this writing, neither family has been signed for a rematch on former-Disney star <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jake-paul-free-speech" target="_blank">Jake Paul's next boxing spectacle</a>. But there is still time.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

No, really. They literally call themselves "Pissed Off Trannies," or "POT" for short. They are so pissed off that they dumped 90 litres of urine (a little over 20 gallons in normal units of measurement) on the Equality and Human Rights Commission building.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Here's the deal, <a href="https://reduxx.info/uk-trans-activists-stage-piss-filled-protest-in-front-of-londons-equality-and-human-rights-commission/" target="_blank">according to Reduxx</a>. The EHRC is considering alterations to a law that would "strengthen women’s sex-based rights." As we have seen in the way they treat people like <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-haters-tweet" target="_blank">JK Rowling</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-anthropologist-stumps" target="_blank">Riley Gaines,</a> trans people and their allies hate anything that strengthens women's rights to do anything. "Trans" remains ranked #1 on the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings. Women have sunk so low, they almost rank lower than Christians and Trump supporters.</p><p>What set of POT for their act was civil disobedience was Melanie Field, chief executive of the EHRC, <a href="https://jane-67706.medium.com/gender-the-ehrc-explain-a17cd4332b5" target="_blank">affirming the definition of "sex."</a> The <a href="https://jane-67706.medium.com/gender-the-ehrc-explain-a17cd4332b5" target="_blank">old-timey, pre-2021 definition</a>.</p><p>This isn't the first time POT has sprung a leak (folks, these are the jokes). Last September, there was another piss-filled protest outside the EHRC building. Only they didn't pour the urine on the building. An activist -- wearing a duck mask -- poured it ON HIMSELF.</p><p>It was to symbolize the--and I want to make sure I get this quote right--<em>"public embarrassment that trans people experience on a daily basis, using the toilet that either doesn't fit with their gender or using the one that does, and then facing the backlash of people's judgment."</em></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Very much here for people leaving bottles of piss outside the EHRC to protest its stance on trans rights. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/bexwade?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bexwade</a> for capturing it <a href="https://t.co/kGUjeGf1v8">https://t.co/kGUjeGf1v8</a><br />— Zing Tsjeng (@misszing) <a href="https://twitter.com/misszing/status/1567146970048860165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>If you think this reeks of performative slactivism and having too much asparagus, HOW DARE YOU! Not unlike UK vegans who dump milk out in the aisle of the supermarket and UK enviro wackos destroy priceless works of art, UK trans activists demand to be taken seriously. Every bit as seriously as we take them in America. </p><p>Or, at the very least, as serious as these people.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Destroying gardens to own big oil. <a href="https://t.co/xXN0j502gA">pic.twitter.com/xXN0j502gA</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1662795254880251904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Please join me in praying to the deity or deities of content that the EHRC goes through with their alterations and that POT needs to escalate their civil disobedience. And off-shoot of POT called SOT. Sh*t On Trannies.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Hollywood actress blasts Target's "performative allyship," claims non-binary 7-year-old can't shop there anymore

You have heard from the right <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/boycott-target-rap-video" target="_blank">when it comes to the Boycott Target movement</a>. Now, let's hear from the left. Actress Rachelle Lefevre is a veteran of the <em>Twilight</em> movies. On behalf of her non-binary seven-year-old, she blasted the retailer for "performative allyship" in how they celebrate Pride for only one month out of the year.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="02431" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33764837&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Forget it, she's rolling.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Munchausen’s by proxy. <a href="https://t.co/azCBB37NAC">pic.twitter.com/azCBB37NAC</a><br />— Catch Up (@CatchUpFeed) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpFeed/status/1662204625360125952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>I came in here two days ago, and my seven-year-old, who's non-binary, saw it and said: "Look, mom, it's Pride, look! They're going to celebrate me!"</blockquote><p>That conversation never happened. And let's say for the sake of argument a "non-binary" seven-year-old is a real thing (<a href="https://deadline.com/2022/05/bill-maher-real-time-claims-rise-lgbtq-trans-people-may-be-sparked-by-need-to-be-trendy-1235029488/" target="_blank">critics say it's parents pushing this on their kids to be trendy</a>), any seven-year-old regardless of how their mother claims they identify is only going to care about the toy aisle.</p><blockquote>So the next time my seven-year-old comes to Target - or rather I can't bring them here anymore, at least for the entire month of June - because if they walk in, and all the other people who walk in, and go: "Where did it go?" They're going to realize that [people who feel pushing this stuff on kids is inappropriate] are being successful in trying to erase them.</blockquote><p>There are some Target's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-internal-memo" target="_blank">who have been moving their Pride collection</a> -- not REmoving, but moving it -- to less prominent parts of the store. This specimen claims THAT is erasing her non-binary seven-year-old. But her non-binary seven-year-old will be fine shopping in July when the store goes back to ignoring Ls, Gs, Bs, etc. for another eleven months.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Lefevre is right about the "performative" part. But it's alleged adults like her who are being performative. Retailers aren't selling <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-pride-collection" target="_blank">"I'm Proud of You Always" bibs or onesies that say "Queer' four times on them</a> to children. They are selling them to woke twat parents who are looking to signal their virtue to other woke twats.</p><p>Also, because a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/target-partners-org-pushing-kids-genders-secretly-changed-schools-without-parental-consent" target="_blank">radical leftist activist group that wants to integrate gender ideology into math</a> tells them to.</p><p>And you know, fairplay to this actress. She has the same right to express her opinion as the mother who believes marketing bathing suits that boasts of being "tucking" friendly -- "tucking" is what you do to your peen when you claim you don't want it any more -- to kids is inappropriate. </p><p>Target can then decide which way they are going to lose more money. Not unlike Bud Light.<br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
