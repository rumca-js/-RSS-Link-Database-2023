## 60 Days on the Estates review – how to make a great show about social housing? Don’t involve Tory MPs

<p>This look at life on two inner-city estates is a gentle, sincere take that sees survivalist Ed Stafford spend three weeks living there. It’s a far cry from the patronising work of Michael Portillo et al</p><p>I hadn’t realised how traumatised I remain by Michael Portillo. Not so much the trousers and jackets sported on his train travel, although they remain borderline criminal, but his efforts to engage with The Poor. First in 1993, when he emulated the lifestyle of a single mother on benefits (“For someone like me, who’s never had to think about these things, it’s just boring having to think all the time about how you buy the cheapest things and whether the money’s going to last”). And then again – because those poor and their boring lives are always with us, are they not? – five years ago he gave us a feature-length documentary in which he oozed around the council estates of England in Our Housing Crisis: Who’s to Blame? If memory serves, the answer somehow wasn’t Margaret Thatcher’s reign-defining sell-off of the public housing stock (we had 6.5m council homes in 1980; nearly a third of them were transferred to private hands under the Right to Buy scheme). Instead, it was apparently the failure of councils to build replacements since. Obvious, really, especially if you are a devotee of oleaginous logic delivered with a smug but straight face.</p><p>But it all comes flooding back. As do awful memories of Matthew Parris attempting to live on benefits for a week in 1983. He considered the people he met, living “meagre and threadbare” lives, were at the right level of poverty to stay motivated, and returned 20 years later to find how things had turned out. Fortunately, in 60 Days on the Estates, Ed Stafford – who spends three weeks on a London estate then three weeks on its Brummie equivalent in next week’s episode – might be another middle-aged, middle-class white man, but he is not a Tory MP. This, it turns out, makes quite the difference.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/28/60-days-on-the-estates-review-how-to-make-a-great-show-about-social-housing-dont-involve-tory-mps">Continue reading...</a>

After the 4-1 defeat by Tottenham at Elland Road – where two goals from Harry Kane lifted the striker’s Premier League tally to 30 for the season – Allardyce had a stark, unvarnished message for the Leeds board.</p><p>“There is a lot of work to be done here next season, even in the Championship,” said the 68-year-old, who is open to remaining in charge. “Goals need to be scored and you need goalscorers to score them. The squad is a little on the young side and lacks experience. As a squad they haven’t been good enough. You can’t keep making unforced errors. We gifted Tottenham three goals today. Which way does the club want to go?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/28/sam-allardyce-leeds-dean-smith-leicester-relegation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pack up the euphoniums, lay down the drumsticks, put away the trumpets. If they thought that the Premier League would last for ever they were wrong. There is always something slightly mournful about the pre-kick-off playing of “When the Saints Going Marching In” and perhaps never more so than on Sunday with the brass band hinting it could be one of the casualties of the <a href="https://twitter.com/SaintsBrass/status/1662823610115817473">cost-cutting that will inevitably follow relegation</a>.

When it was finally over, Doucouré etched his name alongside Barry Horne, Graham Stuart and Gareth Farrelly as Everton last-day saviours and Dyche had completed a fine achievement with an imbalanced squad that has spent the majority of the campaign without a proven goalscorer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/28/everton-survive-in-premier-league-after-beating-bournemouth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For Leicester City, never has a win felt so utterly crushing. Victory over West Ham on the final day of the season was insufficient to avoid relegation to the Championship, seven years on from lifting the Premier League title here and two on from winning the FA Cup. Leicester supporters frantically refreshed their phones and a couple had transistor radios glued to their ears as they prayed for a late twist in their favour at Goodison Park, but it was not forthcoming. Twenty-four hours earlier Leicester’s women avoided relegation on the final day but a repeat proved wishful thinking.</p><p>Things had all been going so well for Leicester until news of Abdoulaye Doucouré’s goal for Everton filtered through here. Harvey Barnes’s fine first-half goal paved the way to victory but suddenly a revved-up crowd were decidedly flat, silenced as reality set in. A couple of minutes later Saïd Benrahma rattled a post and any hope of a late, great escape was nearly all over there and then. The beaming smile on the face of Wout Faes after the defender headed in a Youri Tielemans free-kick to double Leicester’s lead felt somewhat cruel.

<p>The government’s response to Alexis Jay’s report is inadequate. Ministers must step up and show victims the effort was worthwhile</p><p>The independent inquiry into child sexual abuse in England and Wales <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/20/what-is-the-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-and-why-did-it-take-seven-years" title="">took seven years</a>. Its chair, Prof Alexis Jay, was the fourth person to take up the role after three previous appointees resigned. Some survivors’ groups lost confidence in the process and decided not to participate. But 6,000 victims did contribute, along with hundreds of expert witnesses. The report into decades of child sexual abuse, and the role of multiple institutions in enabling it, was published last October.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/22/child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-compensation-scheme-england" title="">response to its 20 recommendations</a> offered last week by the home secretary, Suella Braverman, was inadequate, and justifiably regarded as insulting by many of those who were involved. Interviewed by the BBC, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001m5nc" title="">Prof Jay</a> described the measures announced as “vague, unspecific, without a timeline”. This inquiry was a monumental task that made huge demands on those involved – above all, the victims and survivors who testified and in many cases engaged closely with difficult questions about how to ensure such abhorrent events are not repeated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-survivors-deserve-better">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on excellence in the arts: not about elites | Editorial

<p>It is refreshing to hear new ideas, but dividing culture into the best and the rest won’t do anyone any good</p><p>The arts have taken such a battering in the UK over the last decade that they sometimes seem like an old ship holed beneath the waterline, with an orchestra valiantly continuing to play on deck. Nobody really knows what to do apart from bailing out water, firing occasional SOS flares and trying to keep the music going. So it is refreshing when new ideas are introduced.</p><p>Earlier this month, Sir Nicholas Hytner, a former head of the publicly funded National Theatre and now founder-director of the unfunded <a href="https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/" title="">Bridge Theatre</a>, proposed a radical solution. A future government, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/17/arts-council-britain-plan-save-new-body" title="">he wrote</a>, should follow the lead of sport and devolve arts funding into two separate bodies: one would support community initiatives, education and outreach programmes, leaving the Arts Council to focus “on making the best possible art by professional artists for the most diverse audience”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/28/the-guardian-view-on-excellence-in-the-arts-its-not-about-elites">Continue reading...</a>

## You don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness – and more friends isn’t the answer | Gaynor Parkin and Erika Clarry

<p>Recently described as a public health emergency, profound loneliness can affect anyone craving deeper connections</p><p>In the UK 25 million people report they are occasionally, sometimes, or often lonely, according to the <a href="https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/">Campaign to End Loneliness</a>. In the US the surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, recently disclosed his <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65461723">own experience</a> of “profound loneliness” as he released his national strategy highlighting just how many people experience loneliness as well as potential solutions to alleviate it. Murthy emphasised that loneliness has escalated into a public health emergency, affecting one in two Americans, with health impacts as serious as addiction and obesity, and warned it was as dangerous to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.</p><p>Murthy’s candid account of his own loneliness was picked up by multiple media outlets and resonated deeply with my client Murray*. Like many people, Murray struggled to understand that loneliness doesn’t just affect people who are socially isolated or who live alone. Murray is professionally successful, earns a higher-than-average income and lives with a partner and teenage children. He plays sport, helps with his children’s sport clubs, and keeps a busy round of dinners and social events for work. Murray sought help for anxiety which he found scary and surprising. He’d begun experiencing overwhelming panic attacks that took hold of him at unpredictable times and seemingly without warning. Murray felt ashamed and helpless and just wanted the attacks to stop. In telling me about himself he didn’t mention any feelings of loneliness.</p><p>These terms are often used interchangeably, but they’re actually different. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/nz/basics/loneliness">Social isolation</a> is the objective state of being alone. In contrast, loneliness is the subjective experience of disconnection. This means that you could be around other people, yet still feel lonely.</p><p>Why might that be? Loneliness can arise from not feeling seen, understood, or validated. It can come from spending time with people who don’t share your values or interests. It can also come from too many superficial interactions and not enough deeper connections.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/29/you-dont-have-to-be-alone-to-experience-loneliness-and-more-friends-isnt-the-answer">Continue reading...</a>

## Whether Violent Or Natural by Natasha Calder review – superbug apocalypse now

<p>The author’s first solo debut novel is a terrifying and inventive tale of rampaging deadly bacteria that keeps readers guessing</p><p>Natasha Calder’s dystopian debut, <em>The Offset</em> (2021), co-authored with Emma Szewczak, explored overpopulation and controlled procreation. Her first solo novel<em><strong> </strong></em>offers a terrifying vision of “the end of days” involving superbugs and antibiotic resistance.</p><p>Kit and Crevan appear to be the sole inhabitants of a remote island. They live in a bunker beneath a castle ruin and only venture out at night. Kit tells us she is 28, Crevan is older. There is something slippery about the pair and we are unsure of their relationship or who to trust. Crevan is protective, soothing Kit’s panic attacks and teaching her self-combat. We learn he has been hunted by “backbiters”, former doctors, who check people for illness, cull those considered a threat or “patch” them against infection, while Kit is not as helpless as she first appears. When a half-dead woman washes up on the shore, Crevan’s instinct is to save her but Kit is reluctant, fearing infection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/28/whether-violent-or-natural-by-natasha-calder-review-superbug-apocalypse-now">Continue reading...</a>

<p>All that snorting and grumbling can wreck your sleep and your relationship. But does it mean something is seriously wrong with your body? And can playing the didgerigoo really help?</p><p>It is bad for your sleep quality, it is annoying for your partner and it is almost certainly affecting your health, but you already know you shouldn’t browse Twitter before bed. What about snoring? It is tempting to write it off as a problem you can’t do anything about or an entertaining quirk, but does it signify anything about your health? And can you stop doing it?</p><p>Certain health problems will manifest through snoring, but that doesn’t mean that snoring is always a cause for concern. Fundamentally, it’s an indication that your airways aren’t functioning properly – over either the short term or the long term – as the blood vessels inside your nose fill up when you lie down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/28/should-i-worry-about-my-snoring">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You don’t go into this profession to make money. But try telling that to some pet owners</p><p>I trained as a veterinary nurse after university because I love animals, but I also enjoy the scientific aspect. One of the first and most important things I learned is that it’s much more than treating sick pets. You are also dealing with the emotions of owners, which can be really challenging.</p><p>One of the problems we are facing in veterinary practice is overwhelm. During lockdown, many people got new pets without preparing for the consequences. As well as poorly socialised dogs, we have seen a rise in the popularity of designer breeds, such as French bulldogs, dachshunds and pugs, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/27/this-is-a-calamity-the-surgeons-keeping-pugs-and-bulldogs-alive" title="">that are more prone to health problems</a> than others. At the same time, we have seen a reduction in the number of staff in veterinary clinics across the UK. This is partly due to the loss of European staff since Brexit and partly due to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/25/one-in-10-childcare-providers-in-england-likely-to-close-official-report-finds">lack of childcare options</a>.

<p>Around the world, different species are shifting their habitats upwards, with potentially catastrophic results for our ecosystems</p><p>In the Alps and Apennines of southern Europe, nearly all the longhorn beetles are moving uphill, and way up at the peaks, the isolation of a brown butterfly with orange-tipped wings is pushing it towards extinction. This is a snapshot of a global trend. With temperatures rising and pressure on biodiversity growing, insects vital to our ecosystems are not only moving north and south, but up.</p><p>Research shows many animals are making similar moves, but insects’ high levels of mobility and short generation times allow them to respond quickly to change, meaning the uphill momentum can be rapid. Bumblebees in the Pyrenees have moved upwards on average by more than a metre a year, with some species making significantly greater journeys. Moths on Borneo’s Mount Kinabalu have followed suit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/28/why-the-climate-crisis-is-making-our-insects-run-for-the-hills">Continue reading...</a>

It looked wonderful – beautiful green things – but I don’t really understand. People build gardens? Then transport them to a park, somehow? Then other people, including celebrities (mostly in the “might appear in one of those cosy Best Marigold-style TV travel shows” category), dress up to come and look at the gardens? It seems like something you’d struggle to explain to a foreign visitor (though other cultures have those: the French national agriculture show appoints a cow “muse”; this year’s, <a href="https://www.salon-agriculture.com/A-voir-sur-le-salon/La-vache-egerie/Decouvrez-la-vache-egerie-2023/OVALIE">a five-year-old heifer called Ovalie</a>, was described as “rustic, robust, docile and highly adaptable”).</p><p>Chelsea is mysterious because it’s part of a bigger British mystery: the “season”, a series of events I’ve had to consult Tatler to try to understand. The historical rationale – nearby entertainment for aristocrats who came to London at the precise time of year their country estates were at their most beautiful (why not do it in winter when most of Britain is mud?) to find a spouse who wasn’t too close a cousin – no longer exists. Yet the remnants (boat races, opera, horse stuff, tennis matches) are viewed with reverence as a quintessential distillation of the British spring and summer and another excuse to spam us with pictures of the royal family.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/28/flower-shows-tennis-opera-street-harassment-carnival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In lockdown, the Observer’s classical music critic began work on a book about the Russian composer’s later years – celebrated as a pianist but homesick and writing little. Then war, and events in her own life, began to reshape the narrative</p><p>All life goes into a book. Unless it’s a kiss’n’tell, this truth may bypass the reader. A study of steam trains or tax systems or, in my case, the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninov (I’ll come back to the spelling) will seep into the crevices of a writer’s daily existence even if the resulting text appears harnessed in cool objectivity. Decisions are made, anecdotes abandoned because of a plumbing disaster, a knock at the door or a burnt cake. Words scuttle round your head at night and you wonder what possessed you.</p><p>Where does it all start? I had to retrieve my old diary to remember how (on earth), in January 2021, I agreed to deliver, 15 months later, 90,000 words on Rachmaninov for publication this year. It was the start of the second year of lockdown. The diary was virtually empty. Appointments were on Zoom, concerts I hoped to review mostly cancelled. I had checklists about my father, in his 90s, living alone far away: what was he eating apart from tins of rice pudding and chocolate biscuits? Could he get a vaccine? I can’t remember what the rules were for visiting by that time, but all encounters were a risk: my husband, the artist Tom Phillips RA, had a long-term lung condition so was in the vulnerable category for Covid-19.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/28/goodbye-russia-rachmaninov-rachmaninoff-in-exile-fiona-maddocks">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Baltic, Gateshead</strong><br />Poignant and inclusive, the British-Ghanaian artist Larry Achiampong’s first major solo show roams through class, race and the English landscape, always circling back to his own family</p><p>There is a moment where the young black girl wandering through England in <a href="https://www.larryachiampong.co.uk/home">Larry Achiampong</a>’s latest film, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/03/wayfinder-review-larry-achiampong-poetic-lockdown-odyssey-perside-rodrigues">Wayfinder</a></em>, fetches up in a fairground at dusk. Gaudy lights reflect in her eyes. An empty carousel turns before her. All of a sudden the last carriage of a ghost train hurtles noisily through the exit doors to bang into the first, which is waiting to start. The viewer is reminded of the film’s opening words: “The beginning of every story starts at the end of another.”</p><p>Circularity is the means, the message and the ruminative shape of Achiampong’s films. The British-Ghanaian artist, born in London in 1984, is perpetually roving through time and place: the past and the present, land mass and ocean, colonial and social history. He once projected an animation on a giant screen at Piccadilly Circus that could stand as his personal avatar: a figure in a helmet and suit who might come from outer space, the boy who fell to unjust Earth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/28/larry-achiampong-wayfinder-review-baltic-gateshead">Continue reading...</a>

But it gets forgotten fairly quickly as Izzard winds us in intelligently and expertly so that this familiar story casts its spell over us anew.</p><p>Out of the bounds of standup, Izzard stays a seductive performer, pacing the narration with no sense of rush and bringing a delicate physical comedy to the stage. Izzard makes the same circular movements as in one of her gigs, and with the same polyphony of voices, in conversation with each other – here ranging from a dithery young Pip to kindly blacksmith Joe Gargery and Miss Havisham’s cold-hearted charge, Estella, with whom he falls disastrously in love.</p><p><a href="https://nimaxtheatres.com/shows/great-expectations/">Until 1 July</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/28/charles-dickens-great-expectations-review-eddie-izzard-garrick-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Exchange, Manchester</strong><br />Dario Fo and Franca Rama’s bitterly comic 1974 satire is a timely fit for today’s cost of living crisis, here impeded by a cartoonishly bright set</p><p>An everyday situation ratchets into surreal mayhem. Antonia comes home from the supermarket with her friend Margherita bearing news of spontaneous mass refusal to pay for groceries (and her own share of the spoils). In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/fo">Dario Fo</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/may/29/franca-rame">Franca Rame</a>’s 1974 satire on the capitalist system, this leads to “miracle pregnancies” (male as well as female), murder (or maybe not) and police (or maybe communist) infiltration.</p><p>Cécile Trémolières’s design almost steals the show. Vents rise from the floor and yawn, puffing vapour, over the in-the-round stage. An enormous pipe with a metal door set into its closed-off end forms one entrance; opposite, a metal slide, snaking down from the theatre’s balcony, forms the other.

Then suddenly the French actor comes into view, greeting me with a big “All-<em>ôôô!”</em>, so perkily singsong that the English equivalent would have to be “Coo-eee!”</p><p>I like the panel, I tell her. “I found it in a little shop where I used to live,” she says. “I’m crazy about glassworks and those colours. I found this, <em>et hop …</em>!” – she bought it.

<p>Croatia’s miles of isles are easy hops from Split by ferry – and next year those ferries are going electric. Eva Wiseman and family explore the country’s little pockets of paradise</p><p>Croatia’s coast is made up of 1,200 islands – some are glamorous and hotelled, some are grand rocks enveloped by gulls. Some are for naturists, some are for fishermen, some have lagoons so blue they appear Photoshopped. The most sensible and affordable way to travel between these islands is by ferry and, next year, the journeys will become more sensible still. Croatian national ferry company Jadrolinija is going electric. Designed to transport up to 1,000 passengers and 156 cars each, the new ferries will operate between Split and its nearby islands. And as well as emitting fewer harmful gases, they promise to cut down journey times by up to half an hour. It’s time to start planning your trip.</p><p>I started in Split, for a week of island hopping. My family and I had a day to kill there before our afternoon ferry – we immediately cursed ourselves for not adding another two or three. We walked through the Old Town’s white limestone streets, and took a tour of Diocletian’s Palace, a Unesco World Heritage site dating back to AD 295 (and a recent film location for <em>Game of Thrones</em>). With more than 200 buildings within an eight-acre enclosed space, the “palace” is a mini-city of its own, a fabulous tangle of streets and bars and homes which lean drunkenly against ancient walls.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/28/croatia-island-hopping-is-heavenly-and-about-to-become-electric">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Barkham conjures the life of the wild swimming champion and author of Waterlog in a bravura act of creative memoir</p><p>Not long after my first novel was published, I was invited to a writers’ symposium at UEA in Norwich. The campus is just outside the town and overlooks a lake they call the Broad, where I spent much of my time. I swam under the spell of two books: Charles Sprawson’s <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/haunts-of-the-black-masseur-9780099577249">Haunts of the Black Masseur</a></em> and Roger Deakin’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/15/waterlog-and-wonderment-my-memories-of-roger-deakin">Waterlog</a></em>, each of which made swimming feel like an expression of the liberated self, a declaration of existential intent. During those strange days in Norfolk, I also stumbled into the university library, where I found, to my delight, the Roger Deakin archive: a vast collection of notebooks, letters and journals left by the writer on his death in 2006.</p><p>A good literary biography is often a kind of joint venture between writer and subject. You think of Nicholas Shakespeare’s life of Bruce Chatwin, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/30/biography.jonathancoe">Jonathan Coe on BS Johnson</a>. In <em>The Swimmer</em>, Patrick Barkham – a fine author in his own right – takes this idea to its logical conclusion, mining and shaping that enormous, eccentric archive into a book that is, as far as we can make out, about four-fifths in Deakin’s own hand but reads like a first-person memoir. Deakin’s own observations are augmented by Barkham, who did extensive interviews with the writer’s friends, family and former lovers. There are also, fascinatingly, passages written by Barkham in Deakin’s own voice. In the introduction, he parses a brief section – Deakin’s visit to a Royal Navy ship in Venice – and tells us which paragraphs were Deakin and which Barkham. But for the rest, we have to guess.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/28/the-swimmer-the-wild-life-of-roger-deakin-by-patrick-barkham-review-a-bravura-act-of-creative-memoir">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Deluxe homemade seedy crispbread and a tangy fennel salad for ever-ready summer meals</p><p>‘Serve immediately’ is a suggestion I would rather not read on a summer’s day. “Eat at your leisure” would be far more welcome.

There has been rapid progress on salaries, but in Britain’s gig economy work is more intense and job security is low<p>Does the UK’s fast-rising minimum wage mean it’s mission accomplished on low pay?</p><p>Having surged from £3.60 an hour in 1999 to £10.42 today, our wage floor is now among the highest in the world. Rapid increases since the national living wage’s 2016 introduction have slashed the proportion of “low paid” employees (earning below two-thirds of the typical hourly wage) to 9% (versus 21% in 2015), the lowest in more than 50 years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/28/britain-world-beating-minimum-wage-is-not-as-good-as-it-appears">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Having chanced on the 80s fitness star and pop culture icon, Emma Forrest was bereft when he disappeared. Where did he go, how would she cope without him?</p><p>For as long as I lived in Los Angeles, I was looking for the angels of its name. The mural of the Virgin Mary above the local ATM. The ongoing saga of the Silver Lake convent over which pop star Katy Perry was in a legal battle with nuns. There was the Apache psychic who called, “Archangel Michael, guide us!” from the back room of her husband’s boxing studio in the Valley. And the movie star who rescued the worst of the worst addicts – people in the industry whisper “<em>H</em><em>e’s a saint!</em>”</p><p>Though instantly recognisable for his halo of hair, Richard Simmons, who arrived in the city in the 1970s, emerged too strongly from the realm of camp to receive nomination to sainthood. Once he gave up dreams of acting, he’d make his name through his <em>Sweatin’ to the Oldies </em>aerobics videos, his place in 80s pop culture recreated by <em>The White Lotus</em>’s Murray Bartlett in the most recent season of Apple’s exercise dramedy, <em>Physical</em>. Through the decades Richard was so famous he appeared regularly on <em>David Letterman</em> and <em>Howard Stern</em>, and guested on shows from <em>CHiPs</em> to <em>Arrested Development</em>. It was easy for contestants to “become” him on <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em> because his signature upbeat energy was so extreme as to appear deranged. His short shorts and tights, combined with the way his female followers loved him as they had Liberace, made him mockable in TV sketch shows. But from the moment I met him, I believed he was a kind of saint.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/28/in-search-of-los-angeles-aerobics-guru-richard-simmons">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In an age of safe-bet franchises, reboots and sequels, young talent is being squeezed out of the limelight</p><p>The movie star is dead. At least according to the group of disgruntled sales agents, production executives and Hollywood insiders that spoke to the industry paper <em>Variety</em> during the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/cannesfilmfestival" title="">Cannes film festival</a>. The argument goes that, while there are plenty of veteran stars still busily creaking out commercially tempting film fodder, there are precious few equivalently bankable talents from the newer generation waiting in the wings. And this is a looming problem for the film industry.</p><p>Harrison Ford, for example, may still just about look the part of Indiana Jones (thanks in no small measure to the wonders of de-ageing tech), in the Cannes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/18/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-review-harrison-ford-cracks-the-whip-in-taut-sequel" title="">festival hot ticket</a> <em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</em>.

<p>Whatever the specifics of Willoughby and Schofield’s quarrel, a major cause can be summarised in two words: you again</p><p>Why is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/20/will-the-phil-and-holly-saga-put-an-end-to-the-absurd-notion-of-the-tv-couple">rift between Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield</a> so diverting? Maybe you don’t find it so. Maybe current affairs interest you in direct proportion to their importance. If so, you’re lucky. For most of us, the dry detail and/or savage tragedy of momentous issues drive our minds towards triviality. I have never grasped what’s happening in Syria or why to be scared about China, so this week I’ve been digging into what’s going on with Holly and Phil.</p><p>This is not what the two people involved want. That’s one thing they would still agree on. These are not circumstances where those at the centre of a furore are feeding off it and enjoying it, like Piers Morgan or Ryanair. Having resigned as co-presenter of <em>This Morning</em> (and subsequently from ITV), Schofield will want the story to go away. The things he has come to prominence saying on television are too bland to be noticed if the viewers are all speculating on whether he’s a nightmare to work with. Similarly, as she continues on the show, Willoughby’s ability to seem sympathetic and relatable for two and a half hours every morning will be compromised by a lingering aura of anger and ruthlessness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/28/holly-willoughby-phillip-schofield-david-mitchell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>But the really wonderful thing is his approach to making friends</p><p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been taking my son to the playground. Or, rather, he’s been taking me, as it’s right beside his school and he’s taken to running straight into it with the pace of a greased pig, leaving me to chuff and bluster after him. Speed, he likes to tell me, is one of his main superpowers. He has several now, with strength and stamina close behind. It’s his speed, however, which comes in most useful here, since he knows that once he’s through its gates, I will be powerless to remove him. There will be other parents present and the social conventions of parenting among strangers mean I will be too mortified to scream after him.</p><p>I’d be annoyed if I didn’t find these trips so anthropologically compelling, and if it didn’t also give his baby sister a chance to crawl around. The surface is soft and padded, made not of that slightly spongy playground aggregate I knew growing up, but an altogether more boingy substance covered in thick, wispy fibres somewhere between artificial grass and cow’s fur. Together with the playground’s cheerily undulating topography, it gives the uncanny sense of walking over an unmade bed. It is, in short, one of the few spaces on Earth in which you could not perceive of a baby finding injury, but this is balanced out by the fact it is usually filled with children whose spatial awareness, and moral reluctance to stamping on babies’ heads, could both be termed areas for improvement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/28/seamas-oreilly-my-four-year-old-son-says-his-superpower-is-speed">Continue reading...</a>

## Northern Ireland: Living With the Troubles review – an incomplete snapshot of the conflict

<p><strong>Imperial War Museum, London</strong><br />The exhibition exploring 30 years of strife has plenty of atmosphere and features voices from all sides but lacks clarity of purpose</p><p>You enter this exhibition through a wire mesh structure as you might enter a high-security zone or a prison or, had you grown up in Northern Ireland during the most violent years of the Troubles, how you might once have entered a city centre pub. As curatorial statements of intent go, it’s a bold one, immediately establishing the sense that Northern Ireland was a place apart: confined, oppressive, defined by a collective state of alert mixed with dread.</p><p>As its title suggests, <em>Northern Ireland: Living With the Troubles</em> is a bold attempt to reflect the experience of the 30-year conflict through the often conflicting perspectives of those caught up in it. It is unfortunate timing that it coincides with the BBC’s five-part oral history series, <em>Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland</em>, which delves much deeper into similar terrain. In contrast, this exhibition falls somewhere between A Beginner’s Guide to the Troubles and a conceptual installation that attempts to evoke something of the tense, uneasy atmosphere of the time, as well as the clash of ideologues and identities that for so long made the conflict seem intractable. It almost succeeds in both aims.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/28/northern-ireland-living-with-the-troubles-review-an-incomplete-snapshot-of-the-conflict">Continue reading...</a>

A good spritz is so much more than merely refreshing<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/apr/20/tv-tonight-lisa-eldridge-examines-the-history-of-makeup" title="">Lisa Eldridge</a>, one of the best-loved and in-demand makeup artists – her celebrity clients include Oscar, Grammy and Emmy winners – is the inspiration for this week’s page. Or at least, her new mist is. Like any decent makeup artist, she understands the connection between great skincare and long-lasting makeup (healthy, hydrated skin provides a better canvas). Hence she has just launched an impressive skincare line, and the mist deserves a special mention. It includes niacinamide to tighten pores, and it also brightens, improves uneven tone and smooths. Mists with skincare benefits are the only ones worth spending money on. Caudalie’s is a longtime fave: it balances oily skins and leaves an amazing glow. As does Glow Recipe’s, which includes AHAs ( exfoliating) and hyaluronic acid (hydrating). Fancy a skin barrier-strengthening moisturiser in mist form? Dr Jart’s Ceramidin Cream Mist is excellent. For stressed skins, make a beeline for Aromatherapy Associates and SkinCeuticals’ calming options. 456 Skin’s new mist – an extension of a line developed specifically for darker skin tones – helps dissolve dead skin cells and prevent breakouts. QMS’s mist increases skin’s elasticity and absorption of Vitamin D, which boosts immunity and bone health. And both Coola and Ultra Violette mists, two of the best SPF brands, will help you top up your sun protection without ruining your makeup. Genius.</p><p><strong>1.

## Cats, peanuts, bee stings… the irritating truth about allergies

<p>More and more of us suffer from allergies, and medicine is struggling to keep up. Rebecca Seal talks to medical anthropologist Theresa MacPhail</p><p>When Theresa MacPhail was four, her brother was killed in an accident. When she was 14, her mother died in a car crash. And when she was 24, her father died from anaphylactic shock after a bee flew in through the open window of his truck and stung him in the neck. For anyone else, these devastating experiences would almost certainly have been psychologically catastrophic. “I have several friends who are psychology professors, and they’re always saying, ‘No offence but, by rights, you should be a drug addict, or have severe emotional issues,’” she says, smiling, over Zoom from her home in New York, wearing a cheerful sweatshirt covered in luminous kittens.</p><p>Instead, MacPhail decided to use what she’d been through as the bedrock for her PhD at UC Berkeley, and then her career as a medical <a href="http://theresamacphail.com/" title="">anthropologist</a>. She laughs. “I’m like the doyenne of death. I have been thinking my whole life about the things that make people ill and pass away, because of my history. These are the waters I’ve been in since I was a kid. Rather than ignoring it, I decided to go at all my fears and insecurities about mortality.

Well, wonder no more, because here’s co-writer/director Robert Rodriguez with one he prepared earlier – splattering the cinema screen with all the colours of the daft, courtesy of an A-list star, a B-movie aesthetic, a C-minus musical score, and a D/E audience rating (<em>Hypnotic</em> has already failed to mesmerise in the US).

The culprit pleaded “not guilty due to mental incapacity” after claiming to have no memory of the kidnapping, or of the child’s whereabouts. It sounds like a ruse, until Rourke finds himself playing cat-and-mouse with a criminal mastermind (William Fichtner) blessed with unholy powers of persuasion. “Are you familiar with the concept of hypnotic constructs?” asks Diana Cruz (Alice Braga), a “dime-store psychic” who delivers Basil Exposition-style speeches about “hypnotics” – people with “the ability to actually influence the brain over a psychic bandwidth. Telepaths just <em>read</em> the mind; hypnotics reshape its reality.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/28/hypnotic-review-enjoyably-preposterous-tosh-ben-affleck-robert-rodriguez">Continue reading...</a>

We must be wary of publicly declaring why people take their own life. It can do harm<p>When someone talks about taking their own life, it’s very often an anguished distress signal. But sometimes repeated suicide threats are used as the ultimate means of control in a coercive relationship. “If you leave me, I’ll kill myself” is a form of emotional abuse that can make it feel impossible to walk away.</p><p>It is because suicide is such a terrible and tragic thing – that someone might be experiencing such mental torment that they cannot see another way out – that the threat of killing oneself is so potent in abusive relationships. And it is also a reason why we have to be so careful about the way we publicly discuss suicide, its causes and how it can be prevented. Because it is so powerful, there is a risk that it gets wielded by well-meaning social campaigns in ways that not only distract from effective suicide prevention, but can do real harm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/28/suicide-tragic-shocking-act-how-we-talk-about-it-matters-if-we-are-to-save-lives">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To judge by the huge success of their podcast The Rest Is Politics, the UK still has an appetite for political ideas and debate. But how do the Labour stalwart and the Tory maverick really get on?</p><p>The Royal Hall in Harrogate has a long and interesting history. Designed by Robert Beale and the great Frank Matcham, it opened on the site of the former Cheltenham Pump Room in 1903 as the Kursaal – a name inspired by the building on which it was based, the Ostend Kursaal in Belgium (a German word, Kursaal means “Cure Hall”), and which it lost after the first world war, when something a little more patriotic was required. Whatever it was called, however, it always drew the crowds. Beneath its painted coffered ceiling – it is now Grade II* listed – Sarah Bernhardt starred in a special flying matinee of Alexandre Dumas’s <em>La Dame aux Camelias.</em><em> </em>Edward Elgar came to conduct his own work here, and Arthur Conan Doyle to deliver a lecture. Louis Armstrong and the Beatles both played it.</p><p>How times change, though. I realise that its glory days may be over. All the same, if you’d told me five years ago – or even <em>two</em> years ago – that tickets for the appearance in Harrogate of a double act comprising a former government spin doctor and a former government minister would sell out, and quickly, I wouldn’t have believed you. Who on earth, I might have asked, wants to spend their hard earned money on two hours of unfiltered chat on such subjects as a recent presidential election in Turkey, what might constitute inappropriate behaviour in the House of Commons, and whether the manager of Burnley FC would make a better prime minister than Keir Starmer? Aren’t we all a bit tired of listening to middle-aged men of a certain ilk drone on and on? Wouldn’t people rather just stay at home and watch <em>Newsnight</em>?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/28/the-rest-is-politics-podcast-alastair-campbell-rory-stewart-interview">Continue reading...</a>

He trained in biology, using statistical models to examine networks of relationships between predators and prey. In the 1990s, however, after witnessing first-hand the sudden unravelling of the Soviet Union, from which his father had been a dissident exile, he turned his analytical brain to a different set of questions. Turchin set out to discover statistical patterns in the great flood of historical data that might predict future instabilities in societies. Like all Cassandras worth their infamy, he came to his vocation at a fortunate time.</p><p>Turchin calls his method “cliodynamics”. In a series of books – <em>War and Peace and War</em> (2006) and <em>The Ages of Discord</em> (2016) – he has used his datasets to try to establish the basis on which all human civilisations in the era of cities and states have the mechanisms of their own destruction built-in.

After a three-year romance, they married and in celebration Araki published his first book, <em>Sentimental Journey</em>. The pictures in the book – including this shot of Yoko on a dreamy boat trip with her lover – were a startlingly intimate portrait of their early relationship and their wedding and honeymoon. Araki called his practice I-photography, referencing the Japanese tradition of the confessional I-novel. Though his camera dwelt on his wife and muse, it was Araki’s way of seeing, his insider’s vantage, that the viewer was invited to share.</p><p>Araki, now 83, subsequently published dozens of books and became infamous for his erotic pictures, in particular his obsessive and sometimes disturbing interest in kinbaku, or rope bondage.

This triggered <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04b15997-c4a3-4ad1-9244-db0fbb68b537" title="">a strong reaction in the bond markets</a>, pushing up the cost of government borrowing to almost the same as it was in the wake of Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget that tanked the markets last September.</p><p>It is a sobering reminder of the lasting legacy of Liz Truss’s brief premiership. In just 49 days, she and her chancellor undermined long-term investor confidence to the extent that the UK government, once able to borrow at interest rates of almost zero, now faces some of the highest borrowing costs of developed nations, with these costs liable to rise even further as a result of only moderately bad economic news. It means that for the first time in decades, the UK is subject to the same sorts of external market pressures on its investment, tax and spending decisions as much less affluent economies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/28/observer-view-on-tories-disastrous-economic-legacy">Continue reading...</a>

Neither red nor white, orange wines mean that you don’t have to make your mind up<p><strong>Viña González Bástias Naranjo Orange, Maule Valley, Chile 2022 </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>£24, </strong><strong><a href="https://thesourcingtable.com/products/gonzalez-bastias-naranjo-2020" title="">The Sourcing Table</a></strong><strong>)</strong><em> </em>With the zeal of the previously sceptical convert, I have become rather evangelical about orange wines in recent years. So here I am, clambering atop my soapbox once more, megaphone in hand, to preach to the many unconverted my message that all wine-drinkers’ lives would be richer with a little orange in their lives. It seems to me that the best of these wines combine the best qualities of white and red wines – the freshness and raciness of whites; the chew and complexity of reds – to make something original. In fact, the term orange covers such a broad spectrum of colours and styles – from wines that are all-but-indistinguishable from whites in appearance and flavour to the dark amber and nuttily sherry-like – it makes generalisations about the category every bit as flawed as they are for red wine. Better, perhaps, to treat each orange wine as an individual, capable, as Viña González Bastias’s glorious muscat-based example is, of sui generis flavours and textures such as, in this case, the combination of mouthwatering citrus pith tang and chewiness with floral, muscat grapey prettiness.</p><p><strong>Black</strong><strong>book Slow Disco </strong><strong>Sauvignon Blanc</strong><strong>, Essex, England 2021 </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>£19, <a href="https://www.blackbookwinery.com/shop/2021-slow-disco-sauvignon-blanc" title="">Blackbook Winery</a></strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong>Orange wines are effectively the red wines of the white grape world. Just as red wines get their colour, chewy tannins and much of their flavour complexity from the (red) grape skins, so orange wines are made by keeping the juice of white grapes in contact with the skins for an extended period during fermentation. Most white wines, by contrast, are made solely from the juice of white grapes, while rosé wines, which at their palest are effectively the white wines of the red grape world, are made from red grapes which have only been in very brief contact with the skins. Much of the stylistic range in orange wines derives from each winemaker’s skin-maceration recipe. Some producers, such as Battersea-based urban winery Blackbook, give their pristine, Essex-grown sauvignon blanc fruit just a few (12) days of skin contact, which gives a colour at the golden end of the white wine spectrum and a little extra texture to the classic tropical-citrus-elderflower sauvignon flavours.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/28/why-orange-wines-are-the-best-of-both-worlds">Continue reading...</a>

Help was at hand for ‘the worst routes, the least well-lit stations and the poorest, most violent neighbourhoods’<p>‘Chivalry has returned to New York,’ proclaimed the <em>Observer</em> on 15 July 1979, as it descended into the lawless New York subway underworld, accompanied by the Magnificent Thirteen Subway Patrol, AKA the Red Berets. The group had formed that February, in response to a violent crime wave. From an initial 13, they now numbered nearly 100 and their mission was to make New Yorkers feel safer. ‘They are in their late teens or early 20s, most of them have some training in the martial arts and all are as streetwise as alley cats.’</p><p>Working-class and from diverse ethnic backgrounds, most worked or studied during the day. Their leader was the charismatic Curtis ‘the Rock’ Sliwa, ‘a poor 23-year-old Polish-American who graduated in garbage collecting and street fighting’.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/28/from-the-observer-archive-the-red-berets-defend-new-york-commuters-1979">Continue reading...</a>
