Remedy should be applauded for their ambition in Quantum Break. It’s a shame all that was good about the game was marred by narrative and structural choices; every element stuffed into the game diluting each other. Is there scope for a sequel? 

In fact, is there even an appetite for it? Who knows? For now, it appears any notion of a Quantum Break sequel is firmly on the side-lines, what with Remedy’s other projects in the works. Should Quantum Break 2 ever see the light of day, there’s no doubt Remedy will tweak the transmedia formula for the better, it’s just questionable if they’ll ever get round to it.
