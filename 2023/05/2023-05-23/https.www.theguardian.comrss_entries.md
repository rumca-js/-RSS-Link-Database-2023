## Kidnapped review – Marco Bellocchio’s antisemitism drama is a classic in the making

<p>Based on the true story of a young Jewish boy kidnapped by papal authorities, this is a full-tilt melodrama that lays bare tyranny, bigotry and the abuse of power in the Catholic church</p><p>Cannes is this year becoming a counterblast to ageism. Italian director Marco Bellocchio, at the age of 83 – and almost 60 years after he first came to prominence with his 1965 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fists_in_the_Pocket">Fists in the Pocket</a> – has created a gripping, heartbreaking true-political crime story from the pages of history. It is a full-tilt melodrama with the passionate vehemence of Victor Hugo or Charles Dickens, which lays bare an ugly formative episode of Europe’s Catholic church: an affair of antisemitism and child abuse.</p><p>It is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortara_case">true story of Edgardo Mortara</a>, a young Jewish child in Bologna who, in 1858, when he was six, was taken away from his family by the papal authorities. This was done because Edgardo’s doting Catholic nursemaid had claimed that when Edgardo was a baby, and apparently in dire sickness, she had presumed to carry out an emergency baptism, because she feared Edgardo would die and go to limbo. The fanatical Inquisition authorities affected to believe that the Jewish family would therefore “sacrifice” the now-Catholic child, and jumped at the chance to punish the Jewish community and inflate their own missionary self-importance. Edgardo, extensively brainwashed, grew up to be a priest and vehement partisan of the church.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/23/kidnapped-review-marco-bellocchios-antisemitism-drama-is-a-classic-in-the-making">Continue reading...</a>

## Stuart Broad: ‘This is the biggest Ashes buildup – I’m loving the circus’

<p>Fully fit and raring to go, the England bowler has been preparing new deliveries for Australia’s best batters</p><p>Three weeks out from the Ashes, at least one of England’s quicks is in good fettle. Jimmy Anderson is worrying over a groin strain, Ollie Robinson a turned ankle, Olly Stone has a torn hamstring and Jofra Archer a fractured elbow, but Stuart Broad has never felt better. He is coming off what he describes as “the most enjoyable year of my life”, one in which he took 40 Test wickets, played in some of the most entertaining games of cricket he’s ever been involved in, became a father for the first time and, only a little less important, got to watch Nottingham Forest in the Premier League. He is beaming.</p><p>Better yet, he has an Ashes summer ahead. These days Broad enjoys the phoney war almost as much as he does the series itself. Almost. “I think it feels like the biggest buildup I can remember for an Ashes series,” he says. “I mean 2005 was arguably one of the most famous Ashes series. I was only just starting my professional journey then. But this feels on a par with it. It’s going to be pretty fascinating I think. The Aussies are coming off the back of a fantastic season, they dominated the summer over there, but England are playing in a style that is quite addictive to watch, and just draws you in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/23/england-stuart-broad-loving-the-circus-of-ashes-buildup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Expectations are high, but the obstacles faced in seizing back land from Russia remain immense</p><p>As the wait for the long-anticipated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/06/this-will-be-different-khersons-ruined-villages-come-to-life-with-counteroffensive-preparation" title="">Ukrainian counteroffensive</a> continues, two strikingly different developments in the war have seized attention. The first is that Russia appears to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks" title="">all but taken Bakhmut</a> after a long, slow and brutal fight which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/world/europe/bakhmut-ukraine.html" title="">reduced another thriving community to rubble</a>, cost a staggering number of lives and consumed huge quantities of ammunition. Each side is thought to have suffered tens of thousands of casualties in the battle for a city that is more important to Moscow symbolically than strategically. Both sides have referred to the combat there as a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/10/russia-ukraine-war-bakhmut-meat-grinder-deadlock" title="">meat grinder</a>”.</p><p>The second development is the startling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/anti-kremlin-militia-freedom-of-russia-legion-overrun-russian-border-village-kozinka" title="">raid into Belgorod</a>, a Russian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/23/belgorod-the-russian-region-being-dragged-into-putins-war-on-ukraine" title="">border region</a> – claimed by ethnic Russian, anti-Kremlin partisans, whom Kyiv says act independently; Moscow blamed the incursion on “Ukrainian militants”.

<p>Keir Starmer’s faith in the health service is genuine. But the hardest questions have still to be answered</p><p>The Conservatives’ stewardship of the NHS over the past 13 years offers an open goal to Labour. In 2010, when Gordon Brown left Downing Street, a record 70% of the public were satisfied with the NHS. Last year, satisfaction with the health service fell to a record low of<a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2023-03/Public%20satisfaction%20with%20the%20NHS%20and%20social%20care%20in%202022_FINAL%20FOR%20WEB.pdf" title=""> just 29%</a>. So Monday’s speech by Sir Keir Starmer was timed to coincide with the date when the Tories’ time in office equalled the last period of Labour government. This makes for easy comparisons. In 2010, 2.5 million people in England were waiting for hospital treatment. Thirteen years later, there are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/12/nhs-waiting-lists-inflation-rishi-sunak-national-debt-tory" title="">7.3 million</a>. (Around 2 million more are waiting for care in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.) Quoting his wife, who works for the NHS, the Labour leader said the service is not on its knees but “on its face”.</p><p>The Labour leader’s pitch is that a government led by him will put the health service back on its feet. Specifically, he pledged to reduce deaths from strokes and heart attacks by a quarter in a decade, improve the diagnosis of cancer, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/21/labour-vows-to-reverse-rise-in-suicides-in-england-and-wales-within-five-years-keir-starmer#:~:text=If%20the%20party%20takes%20power,That%20statistic%20should%20haunt%20us." title="">reduce the number of suicides</a> – currently the biggest cause of death in young people. Clearing hospital backlogs by integrating health and social care is the right policy, but its successful <a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/health-and-care-act-2022-make-sense-legislation" title="">implementation</a> has eluded the Tories.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/23/the-guardian-view-on-labours-plan-for-the-nhs-now-build-on-this-beginning">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This tale of earth-shattering events in a space-obsessed desert town leans nicely into its own artificiality, and every delicious, microscopic detail is a delight</p><p>To say that he’s done it again – yet again – is going to mean something different to fans and non-fans. But I have to say the first category is the only place to be for what is simply a terrifically entertaining and lightly sophisticated new comedy from Wes Anderson, in his signature rectilinear, deadpan style, with primary-pastel colours and his all-star repertory ensemble cast. Regulars including Jason Schwartzman and Tilda Swinton are now joined by Scarlett Johansson and Tom Hanks, who have been welcomed into the droll Anderson fold. And the director emphatically proves that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/11/wes-anderson-parodies-ai">YouTube pasticheurs</a> are like Butlin’s Elvis impersonators: they’re not quite doing it.</p><p>Asteroid City’s eccentricity, its elegance, its gaiety, and its sheer profusion of detail within the tableau frame make it such a pleasure. So, too, does its dapper styling of classic American pop culture. With every new shot, your eyes dart around the screen, grabbing at all the painterly little jokes and embellishments, each getting a micro-laugh.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/23/asteroid-city-review-wes-anderson-1950s-sci-fi-triumph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Was the Dua Lipa of SW1 too famous to join an online speed awareness course with the plebs? In her own mind, at least</p><p>I think being recognised on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/inappropriate-for-braverman-to-ask-for-one-to-one-speed-course-says-motoring-solicitor">speed awareness course</a> would actually have played quite well for Suella Braverman, suggesting she takes her slaps on the wrist like any ordinary person. Getting a speeding ticket is not the worst thing in the world. Let’s face it, it probably wasn’t even the worst thing she did that week. It would certainly have played better than trying to weasel out of the standard course, with or without the requested assistance of the civil servants she usually likes to insult as “the blob”. (Sarah Palin’s abortive pitch-for-power book was called Going Rogue. If the home secretary does write an equivalent tome during her next spell in the political wilderness, I’d like to see it called On the Blob.)</p><p>For now, there is much to enjoy in Braverman’s sense that she was simply too famous and too distracting to do an online speed awareness course with the plebs.

<p>They are the chillout masters famed for their blissful, sun-dappled sound. So why have the dance duo made an album inspired by the abandoned steelworks and poisoned shellfish of the north east?</p><p></p><p>Sally Rodgers and Steve Jones’s music has long been associated with blissful beach scenes. Early evangelists for the Ibizan Balearic aesthetic, and stalwarts of untold chillout compilations, as A Man Called Adam they make the sort of music people call “sun-dappled”. So it may surprise casual listeners to find that their new album, The Girl With a Hole in Her Heart, was inspired by abandoned steelworks, poisoned shellfish and the harsh North Sea winds of the Teesside coast where Rodgers grew up.</p><p>It’s not really a radical departure, though. It’s still full of disco, electropop and lush, lyrical downtempo moods – with the lyrics poetically abstracted rather than agit-prop or kitchen-sink realist. The pair first put it together remotely, during Covid lockdown, then together in north-east England just as allegations of corruption around Teesside’s de-industrialisation were emerging. And this, Rodgers says, “provided us with something to be angry about, something to be proud about, all kinds of emotions. It prompted me to write about my childhood, too, and gave this record a sense of place.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/23/balearics-ibiza-icons-a-man-called-adam-tune-into-teesside">Continue reading...</a>

The results are spellbinding</p><p>Tom Wood likes talking. This is not just the exuberant conversation of a man excited at opening his largest-ever UK show. Talking to people and uncovering their stories is central to Wood’s 50-year-long practice. It is how he knows that the two ladies standing proudly in their gardens are called Mrs Leigh and Miss McCabe, and how the close knit, blue-eyed family at Seaview Cafe don’t get to see each other much because the dad doesn’t have many Saturdays off.</p><p>Wood started out in the 1970s with a degree in painting from Leicester Polytechnic, but he is known for <a href="https://tomwoodarchive.com/">his photographs</a> of everyday life – many of which were captured in Liverpool and Merseyside during a period of huge social upheaval in the 80s and 90s. He chatted with people, agreed to photograph their weddings, took his camera on buses, to the shops, to football matches. Over his 25 years in Liverpool, Wood even attracted the affectionate nickname “Photie Man”, after which <a href="https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/photie-man">this exhibition</a> is named.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/23/photie-man-50-years-of-tom-wood-review-walker-art-gallery-liverpool">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yellen tells Congress there is unlikely to be any wiggle room if catastrophic default is to be avoided</p><p>Everyone in Washington DC – from <strong>Joe Biden</strong> to <strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> to congressional rank and file young and old – could see the debt ceiling standoff coming for months. The US government tracks its spending and borrowing, and as far back as last year, Treasury secretary <strong>Janet Yellen</strong> began sending ominous letters to Congress warning that action must be taken to allow the government to continue paying its bills beyond a certain date. In <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Debt-Limit-Letter-to-Congress-Members-20230522-McCarthy.pdf">her latest letter</a> sent yesterday, she made clear that the government will have little time beyond the first day of June to agree to an increase.</p><p>For the GOP, the debt limit is one of the few pieces of leverage they have over the Biden administration, and they have demanded spending cuts and the enactment of conservative priorities – such as the cancellation of the president’s effort to cancel some student debt – in exchange for their votes in the House to raise the ceiling.</p><p>Looking back on the first two years of Joe Biden’s presidency, Tim Kaine has one big regret about a largely successful stretch of Democratic rule: That his party didn’t try to raise the debt ceiling on its own last year.</p><p>The Virginia senator believes that if Democrats had tried to hike the debt limit before the House GOP swept into a majority, even Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) might have gone along with it. But Biden’s party never moved on the issue. And six months later, Democrats are stuck doing exactly what they said they wouldn’t — negotiating on the debt ceiling with Republicans.</p><p><strong>The debt limit</strong> will undoubtedly be discussed when House GOP leaders hold a press conference at 10am eastern time.</p><p><strong>A Nazi swastika flag</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/23/white-house-driver-detained-after-truck-crashes-into-security-barriers-near-residence">was found</a> in a truck that crashed into White House security barriers last night.

<p>If you blast your chocolate in the microwave, that might well be to blame – far better to melt it gently in warm cream first, says our sweet-toothed panel</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>After years of making truffles and ganache with no problem, they’re</strong><strong> suddenly seizing up and turning into an oily mess. I’ve tried different dark chocolates and melt in the microwave. What’s going on?<br /></strong><em><strong>Louise, </strong></em><em><strong>Birmingham</strong></em><strong><br /></strong>“It could be the chocolate itself, so check the ingredients, because there might be other things interfering,” says Guardian baking columnist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ravneet-gill">Ravneet Gill</a>. Baking chocolate, for example, often contains added oils and fats, which make it less reliable, so Gill suggests using a 70-72% bar from the confectionery aisle instead. And, says Joanna Brennan, co-founder of <a href="https://pumpstreetchocolate.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwjMiiBhA4EiwAZe6jQ58xIT8QyYj6fY1ZwK36Uq3zUY38z-MDAkYw8FhiH4QyuFipw6dI7xoCixsQAvD_BwE">Pump Street Chocolate</a> in Orford, Suffolk, buy the best quality you can afford: “Truffles and ganache are 100% based on the taste of the chocolate and cream.” (At their simplest, they are, after all, just two parts chocolate to one part cream.)</p><p>That said, technique is by far the most likely cause for Louise’s oily mess, and specifically her use of the microwave. “They get things very hot very quickly,” says Gill’s fellow Guardian columnist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benjamina-ebuehi">Benjamina Ebuehi</a>. “It sounds as if the temperature of Louise’s chocolate is getting really high, and causing the fat in the chocolate to separate and go oily.” For this reason, Brennan, Gill and Ebuehi all heat their cream in a pan on the stove, then pour it over the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. “You don’t want to bring the cream to a boil, but you want it hot enough that it’s steaming,” Ebuehi says. And chop the chocolate finely (and all roughly the same size): “That way, it will melt evenly, and you won’t have to agitate it as much, which can also make it split.” Once the cream and chocolate are together, Gill leaves the bowl to stand for 30 seconds to a minute, and then, using a hand whisk, “slowly mix from the middle only, until it resembles ganache. Then, use the whisk to stir from the edges into the middle.” You’re looking only to combine the mix evenly, Gill says, not to incorporate any air.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

They want to signal their difference from other wines, that they’re offering something fun, irreverent, unpredictable.

## Tate Britain rehang review – this is now the museum where art goes to sleep

<p><strong>Tate Britain, London</strong><br />Once the provocative home of artistic sensation, the gallery is now vacuous, worthy and fundamentally dull. It even seems to disapprove of the very British art it used to promote</p><p>What happened to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tatebritain">Tate Britain</a>? How did it become the kindly killer of everything that was once exciting and dangerous in British art? In the 1990s, this neoclassical building, then just the Tate, was a stage for the new, the home of sensations, a place where provocative art punched you in the face. That era is currently memorialised in the gaping Duveen space in the middle of the museum, where Vong Phaophanit’s eerily beautiful Neon Rice Field, a long dreamy array of rice divided by strips of pink light, points the way to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/whiteread">Rachel Whiteread</a>’s towering cast of the underneath of a double staircase. Whiteread and Phaophanit were both nominated for the 1993 Turner prize: the first Turner that had to be seen, in the same way that back then the latest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/22/martin-amis-literature-crusader-peers-chutzpah">Martin Amis</a> had to be read.</p><p>But today’s Tate Britain is where art goes to sleep. That’s largely because it is committed to a worthy view of art. It isn’t the ideals I object to but rather the stultifying fact that when you insist on art’s moral value, you make it predictable and dull. To try to pretend it still matters, Tate Britain ostentatiously “rehangs” its collection every few years. Not a single such rehang has ever made a convincing, coherent case for British art – and the latest is no exception. Maybe it doesn’t want to promote British art, for it seems to disapprove of much of it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/23/tate-britain-rehang-review-this-is-now-the-museum-where-art-goes-to-sleep">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Amazing but absurd’: how worm-charming is drawing Cornish art back to its roots

<p>Among artist Georgia Gendall’s projects is a riotous annual competition to lure these creatures from the soil – hopefully shifting some local cliches with them</p><p>In a field in Falmouth, a crowd is preparing for battle. “I don’t hug my enemies!” one friend tells another as they register for the town’s third annual Worm Charming Championships. It’s a war on two fronts: between man and beast, as we attempt to lure recalcitrant earthworms out of the community centre sports pitch, and between the 100 plots, each occupied by a team hoping to win one of three invertebrate-themed trophies. It’s even going down between families. “Mum, I need to warn you we’re going to win,” my friend’s four-year-old daughter Hebe says seriously.</p><p>Worm charming – or grunting, or fiddling – is an age-old art and an established competitive sport of several decades: a notched wooden stick is scraped close to the earth, the vibrations mimicking the rhythms of rain to bring worms up to the earth, where they are harvested for bait. But on this bright blue Sunday afternoon in Cornwall, traditional methods pale in comparison with the unconventional (and it’s a peaceful operation: all worms caught will be returned to the wild). The teams file in to the festive sound of <a href="http://www.gweeksilverband.org.uk/">Gweek Silver Band</a> and unload their arsenals. There are instruments, watering cans, graters; a musical saw, a lime green foam roller, papier-mache seagull feet; country dancers, croquet sets and one woman who produces an entire mini cocktail bar, her silver shaker her tool, its spoils perhaps more of a motivation than the official artist-made prizes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/23/worm-charming-cornish-art-georgia-gendall-st-ives">Continue reading...</a>

## Tokyo Stories review – artistic immersion into the city’s creative life

<p>The Exhibition on Screen documentary series delves into the boundless  energy of the Japanese megalopolis</p><p>Having achieved impressive box office results with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/18/vermeer-the-greatest-exhibition-review-best-seats-in-the-house-for-sold-out-show">its Vermeer film</a>, the Exhibition on Screen strand makes bit of a detour from its comfort zone with its latest film: an overview of artistic takes on Japan’s megalopolis and capital city, ranging from Edo-era paintings to street performance events. Having established itself by largely focusing on the golden eras of art history, dominated by the big names of the Renaissance and the late 19th century, here the net is spread to include contemporary artists who will be (mostly) not especially familiar to non-devotees. And while the conduit for the film is the <a href="https://ashmolean.org/tokyo">Tokyo: Art &amp; Photography exhibition staged by Oxford’s Ashmolean museum</a> in 2021, this is far from a standard gallery tour: the approach is near-total immersion in Tokyo itself, along with a series of interviews with a string of practitioners including “girly photographer” Mika Ninagawa, veteran pop-era painter Keiichi Tanaami, and representatives of a wacky collective called Chim-Pom.</p><p>The results are as handsome as ever, with the film dominated by spectacular photography of Tokyo’s urban landscape in all its glory. For rather obvious reasons, not much of the city survives from before the second world war, but there are traces of ancient Japan to be seen, and accounts – through 17th-century depictions of the marshy, sparsely populated locale – of the embryonic Edo before it became the fortress of the Tokugawa shogunate. These days we are of course much more familiar with the Blade Runner-esque city of glowing neon and retrofitted chaos, but Tokyo as shown here seems to have moved on again, with plenty of pristine new-builds and fancy monuments.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/23/tokyo-stories-review-artistic-immersion-into-the-neon-megalopolis-exhibition-on-screen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Microsoft is betting on winning business with its subscription service, Game Pass, and looking beyond markets in western Europe and east Asia</p><p>Microsoft has been in the video game business for over 20 years, but its Xbox console has been the perpetual runner-up. 2020’s Xbox Series S/X console is being significantly outsold by Sony’s PlayStation 5 – in keeping with its predecessor, 2013’s Xbox One, which was outsold more than 2:1 by the PlayStation 4. It’s currently suffering from a lack of big-ticket exclusive games, and its most recent, Redfall, was a critical disappointment. What’s more, its huge $70bn merger with Activision Blizzard, a deal that would go a long way towards solving its content problem by buying it Call of Duty and much more, is currently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/02/why-microsofts-mega-merger-with-activision-blizzard-is-stalling">being held up</a> by UK regulators.</p><p>Looking rather downtrodden on a recent episode of gaming show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKwfEQ1eEyM&amp;ab_channel=KindaFunnyGames">Xcast</a>, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said that he was “not in the business of out-consoling Sony or out-consoling Nintendo”, intimating that the long-running console war between Xbox, Nintendo and PlayStation was a losing battle for Microsoft. Instead of touting Xbox sales figures, for the past few years the company has presented its subscription service Game Pass as its metric for success: how many games it has, how many subscribers, how many hours they have played. It is betting on a post-console future, on being able to play games on any screen with the help of cloud servers – a streaming and subscription-centric future that has already transformed music, film and TV.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/23/the-post-console-future-where-xbox-is-looking-for-its-next-big-hit-microsoft-game-pass">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When I started reporting on an infamous serial killer, I had to navigate my way through the genre’s ethical minefields</p><ul><li> Francisco Garcia is a journalist and author of We All Go Into The Dark: The Hunt for Bible John</li></ul><p>In a 1996 essay for Granta, the late Gordon Burn set down his experience covering the trial of Rose West. “There was nothing much to see and it was always much the same,” he wrote. “But the heavy media presence was in itself justification for having the story high in the running order.” Burn was a writer of unusually versatile brilliance, who returned repeatedly to the most violent, sordid corners of British life. But even in the mid-1990s, he was to diagnose a growing weariness at the sheer number of crime stories on offer. “There are now so many … that only the most sensational or brutal or those which contain unusual elements stand any chance at all of making it on to the news agenda.”</p><p>Having just published my own book on a historical crime, I know all too well that Burn’s diagnosis can be applied today with minimal alteration. True crime is in the midst of an exceptionally well-documented boom. Real-life tales of murder, rape, robbery and fraud are deeply ingrained in the Anglo-American cultural landscape, arguably long past the point of oversaturation. We are more than familiar with the arguments as to why this may be a bad, or at least unedifying, thing. It sometimes feels that for every Serial or Dahmer, there is an accompanying viral essay restating the baked-in exploitation and muddied ethics implicit in packaging grisly crimes of the recent past as entertainment.</p><p>Francisco Garcia is a journalist and author of We All Go Into The Dark: The Hunt for Bible John</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/23/true-crime-unedifying-business-so-why-am-i-drawn-to-writing-about-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Club has spent wisely not recklessly under new ownership to secure a Champions League return after 20 years’ absence</p><p>Gary Neville pointed to the floor. “I really feel Newcastle could go like that,” said the Sky Sports pundit, explaining that fifth place was, almost certainly, the very best Eddie Howe’s side could hope for this season.</p><p>It was early March and, if Neville’s comments irritated St James’ Park season-ticket holders, they could at least reflect that he had modified his stance since 2015. “Does any top player now want to go and live in Newcastle?” queried the former Manchester United and England right-back in a newspaper column speculating that England’s north-east was “being eased off football’s map” and heading for “irrelevance”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/23/how-eddie-howe-found-the-formula-to-lead-newcastle-back-into-the-elite-champions-league">Continue reading...</a>

On Monday, Facebook was handed a record fine for a GDPR breach. The social network’s parent company, Meta, was hit with a bill for more than a billion pounds over its ongoing data transfers from the EU to the US. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/22/facebook-fined-mishandling-user-information-ireland-eu-meta">From our story</a>:</p><p><em>The [Irish Data Protection Commission] punishment relates to a legal challenge brought by an Austrian privacy campaigner, Max Schrems, over concerns resulting from the Edward Snowden revelations that European users’ data is not sufficiently protected from US intelligence agencies when it is transferred across the Atlantic.</em></p><p><em>Meta has also been given six months to stop “the unlawful processing, including storage, in the US” of personal EU data already transferred across the Atlantic, meaning that user data will need to be removed from Facebook servers.</em></p><p><em>A number of experts who spoke to Wired</em><em> suspect that Google is using Bard to send a message that the EU’s laws around privacy and online safety aren’t to its liking. But more than this, it could be a sign that generative AI technology as it exists now is fundamentally incompatible with existing and developing privacy and online safety laws in the EU.</em></p><p><em>The uncertainty around Bard’s rollout in the region comes as the bloc’s lawmakers are negotiating new draft rules to govern artificial intelligence via the fledgling AI Act. A number of existing laws, from GDPR to the Digital Services Act (DSA), may also be holding up the rollout of generative AI systems in the bloc.</em></p><p><em>The UK government risks sleepwalking into a confrontation with WhatsApp that could lead to the messaging app disappearing from Britain, ministers have been warned, with options for an amicable resolution fast running out.</em></p><p><em>Montana’s new law, which will take effect 1 January, prohibits downloads of TikTok in the state and would fine any “entity” – an app store or TikTok – $10,000 per day for each time someone “is offered the ability” to access the social media platform or download the app. The penalties would not apply to users.</em></p><p><em><strong>Talk directly with your audience and peers. </strong>Create with text and attach links, photos and videos.

<p><strong>Shakespeare’s Globe, London<br /></strong>This bright, bold show tries to balance humour and darkness but tends to land on the silly side of things</p><p>Michelle Terry’s Puck is an agent of chaos. She slinks and scurries around the stage, revelling in the mess she has made. There is something of the Grinch to her green-gold costume, which makes her look like a creature dragged up from deep beneath the forest floor. Her unnerving performance steals every scene, and will be sure to haunt a child or two’s dreams.</p><p><a href="https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/whats-on/a-midsummer-nights-dream-2023/">Elle While’s giddy production</a> attempts to tread the line between Shakespeare’s glittering humour and the dark undertones of abused power.

<p>Alastair Evans’s documentary details the struggle to preserve Hang Son Doong caves in Vietnam, which were discovered in 1991</p><p>“There was quite a substantial breeze coming out. A substantial breeze normally would signify a substantial cave.” A nice piece of Brit understatement about what is a late-breaking entry for a wonder of the world: Vietnam’s Hang Son Doong, the largest cave system on the planet by volume, stumbled upon by jungle logger Ho Khảnh in 1991 and only surveyed in 2009. The stupefying shots here of towering limestone buttes, skylight dolines and sodden subterranean rainforest look computer-generated, like something from Avatar.</p><p>Another visitor points out that where other caves echo each other, Hang Son Doong feels like nothing else on Earth. Predictably, this exceptionalism has dollar signs spinning in the eyes of the Vietnamese government and big business, who are sizing up the grotto for a cable car transit system. Alastair Evans’s slightly ungainly documentary (we only get the history of the cave’s discovery 20 minutes from the end) very thoroughly details the campaign to preserve Hang Son Doong in its natural state in the context of Vietnam’s breakneck economic boom in the period since it was discovered.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/23/a-crack-in-the-mountain-review-scrupulous-look-at-the-exploitation-of-a-natural-wonder">Continue reading...</a>

<p>No one would describe it as a perfect competition logistically but the URC may be better placed than other leagues to cash in</p><p>Here’s a quiz question as an eventful domestic rugby season enters its closing days: which of the two leagues staging grand finals in Twickenham and Cape Town respectively this weekend has had the better campaign? As the Premiership braces itself for the financial demise of a third club inside nine months, a clear winner is increasingly emerging.</p><p>No one would describe the United Rugby Championship as a perfect competition from a logistical perspective, other than for long-haul travel experts specialising in flights to and from southern Africa. But credit where it is due. While tickets for Saturday’s final between Munster and Stormers in Cape Town were relatively inexpensive, all 55,000 available seats were sold within three hours. Given the short notice involved, it has further bolstered the case for South African involvement. The URC took a punt and, for the moment, it is paying off in terms of extra interest and enhanced playing standards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/23/united-rugby-championship-south-africa-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’m not going to lie: being sober is not a hot-air balloon ride. It’s more like a hike in the mountains</p><p>Every day, hiking in the mountains with my husband and our two dogs, I experience a moment of grounded exhilaration. I think of it as my “How did I get here?” moment. And a big part of the answer is always: “Because now I’m sober.”</p><p>For decades, I was a hard drinker, a lush, a boozy romantic who could and did drink anyone under the table and prided myself on it. This lasted from the age of 27 until after 50, a golden time during which I felt very sorry for ex-drinkers and people who couldn’t or wouldn’t drink. How did they knuckle through social situations, especially parties? What did they do at the end of a workday to celebrate and relax? How did they get through <em>life</em>? Not drinking, ever, struck me as nothing but miserable asceticism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/23/sober-happy-not-drinking">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Today’s IMF report shows “a big upgrade to the UK’s growth forecast” says Jeremy Hunt, after annual healthcheck on Britain’s economy</p><p><strong>Shares in Pennon Group, which owns South West Water, have dropped over 2.5% this morning after regulators launched an enforcement probe into water leakage.</strong></p><p>Pennon told shareholders that Ofwat have announced an investigation into South West Water’s 2021/22 operational performance data relating to leakage and per capita consumption.</p><p>This operational performance data was reported in South West Water’s Annual Performance Report 2021/22. This report is subject to rigorous assurance processes which include independent checks and balances carried out by external technical auditor.</p><p>We will work openly and constructively with Ofwat to comply with the formal notice issued to South West Water as part of this investigation.</p><p>We want to be held to account …” said Ruth Kelly, the new public face of the English water companies, last week, briefly raising hopes of a moment of reckoning for the industry’s past (and current) sewage spills. Then the chair of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water">Water</a> UK clarified what her version of accountability covers. The companies wish to be held to account “… for putting it right”.</p><p>The past 30 years, we were invited to think, should be considered an unfortunate chapter in which the industry, terribly unfortunately, didn’t give sewage spills enough attention while other investments were prioritised. That was the gist of her apology. “By and large, the water companies were carrying out their legal responsibilities but … what’s legal is not necessarily the right answer or what people expect,” she argued on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/may/23/inflation-uk-budget-deficit-april-john-allan-barratt-bank-of-england-imf-economy-business-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Story of a misbehaving sprite who gets access to the human world, and a fellow rebel, looks good but the story is a little flat</p><p>This German-Luxembourgian animation is a passable if unambitious hour and a half for under-10s, heavily in the orbit of Pixar both in terms of visuals and in its central conceit of the business of tooth-fairying as a Deliveroo-esque big-tech courier outfit. But unlike Inside Out and Soul’s pint-sized explainers of the psyche, there’s virtually no philosophical sprinkling on the cupcake here. Not that that will stop the young ’uns from gobbling it up anyway – but they might have enjoyed something more nutritious.</p><p>The exam to become a fully accredited tooth fairy seems easy enough. As the would-be disco earworm at the start of My Fairy Troublemaker has it, “Sneak inside, take the tooth, make the toy, and disappear!” Cookie-scoffing, misbehaving Violetta (voiced by Jella Haase) is the only apprentice who fails to make the grade, unlike her swotty mate Yolando (Julian Mau). Stuck in her belief that she’s really “the most special tooth fairy ever”, she steals a gem that allows her access to the human world. But in hijacking Yolando’s assignment to obtain an incisor from city kid Sami (John Chadwick), she finds an ally in his older stepsister Maxie (Lisa-Marie Koroll) when she is trapped in our reality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/23/my-fairy-troublemaker-review-sweet-tooth-animation-will-be-gobbled-up-by-young-uns">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He wrote the music for Dury’s biggest hits, then struck out for Studio 54 in a brilliant but misfiring solo career. Jankel recalls his strange path through pop – and dodging Dury’s drunken rages</p><p>Chaz Jankel walked cautiously down a corridor backstage at the Greyhound pub on Fulham Palace Road. Steam emerged from a dressing room, as if from a Turkish bath. Holding court in the middle of the musicians crammed inside, one of them eyeballed him. “Ere, do I know you? Well fuck off then!”</p><p>This was the inauspicious beginning of one of the greatest partnerships in British pop music, between Jankel, a middle-class north Londoner in love with Black American funk and soul, and Ian Dury, a confrontational, wildly charismatic pub rock singer. Jankel soon wrote the music for songs such as Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock’n’Roll, Spasticus Autisticus, and the 1979 UK No 1 single Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick, with Dury delivering raunchy screeds on top. But this was just the first chapter in a remarkable story for Jankel, who would go on to become the darling of America’s club scene, be courted by Quincy Jones, and continue releasing music to this day: aged 71, he released his newest solo album last week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/23/ian-dury-was-a-voice-for-the-disenfranchised-chaz-jankel-the-man-who-made-the-blockheads-funky">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whatever you think of Manchester City’s wealth or Newcastle’s or PSG’s owners, football’s regulatory framework has never been fit for purpose</p><p>In 2008 Speedo introduced the LZR Racer, a body-length swimsuit lined with stiff polyurethane plastic panels that dramatically reduced drag in the water. Essentially it turned the swimmer into a smooth aerodynamic tube, trapping little pockets of air to improve buoyancy. The technology was introduced in time for the Beijing Olympics, where 23 world records were set by swimmers wearing the LZR.</p><p>The impact on the sport was cataclysmic. Athletes who enjoyed the benefits of the new “super suit” described the sensation as like flying. Those who had signed deals with other manufacturers were faced with the choice of breaking their contracts or seeing their careers ruined. And, of course, the records continued to tumble. After Michael Phelps – wearing the LZR – was beaten at the 2009 world championships by the unknown Paul Biederman, wearing a successor suit made entirely of polyurethane – his coach Bob Bowman threatened to pull him out of swimming entirely. In the space of 17 months in 2008 and 2009, a total of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/24/swimming-swimsuits-ban" title="">140 world records were set using the LZR</a>. Fifteen still stand. As Bowman put it at the time: “We’ve lost all the history of the sport.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/23/perhaps-one-day-this-whole-age-of-football-will-require-an-asterisk-manchester-city-premier-league-title">Continue reading...</a>

But while I had a dress – a black one with pretty red peonies that I kept rolled up in my bag when her illness began to accelerate during the summer – we were in lockdown so the shops were shut, and I wasn’t going to wear Birkenstocks. Eventually, I found some brogues on eBay and, after wiping them with Dettol, tried everything on. I looked nice, put together. But this was the problem. Looking “put together” seemed like the wrong response when I felt anything but. On the day of her funeral, I wore my mother’s navy skirt suit.

<p>On the border with Ukraine, Belgorod has been plagued by unclaimed attacks, explosions and Russian friendly fire since the outbreak of the conflict</p><p>On a cool night in April, a Russian warplane dropped a bomb on to a busy city, ripping up the road and sending debris flying across the highway.

<p>This fabulously detailed account of the great collector’s treasures, artist friends and the Cambridge art gallery home he built with his wife, Helen, is a fitting testament to his cunning, determination and impeccable taste</p><p>On New Year’s Day 1956, <a href="https://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/collection/jim-h-s-ede/">Jim Ede</a>, then 60, wrote to his friend, the painter and poet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/10/soldier-poet-painter-david-jones-britains-outsider">David Jones</a>, of a “quixotic scheme” he had for the remaining years of his life. Ede, who had been a curator at the Tate Gallery before the second world war, and a pioneering collector of the art of his friends and heroes – Jones, and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/jun/27/superstars-of-st-ives-in-pictures">St Ives group of painters</a>, and Miró and Brancusi – outlined in that letter an impulse to create a modest and lasting monument to what he had learned about art and about life.</p><p>Ede had in mind, he wrote, “a place of beauty in a town”, a home that would be open to students and to the public and allow him to share “all that I have in pictures and lovely objects”. It took him the best part of that year to find and buy four semi-derelict cottages just over Magdalene Bridge in Cambridge, once home to a playhouse owned by a Mr Joseph Kettle. Ede set to work making every corner of his Kettle’s Yard gallery a still life. For nearly 20 years he and his wife, Helen, welcomed the curious into their home. Ede, who died in 1990 aged 95, gave personal tours of the paintings and sculptures and the favourite found objects – pebbles and feathers and shells. He encouraged students to borrow original pieces to decorate undergraduate walls. Visitors were invited to sit down at the kitchen table with Jim and Helen for tea in china cups and hot buttered toast with marmalade cold from the fridge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/23/ways-of-life-jim-ede-and-the-kettles-yard-artists-by-laura-freeman-review-an-intimate-account-of-a-life-in-art-ben-nicholson-david-jones-barbara-hepworth-alfred-wallis-henri-gaudier-brzeska">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When can you visit? What should you talk about? How long should you stay? It’s a minefield</p><p>I always assume that when a person gets a new dog, the household lives for a period in new-baby territory. That is to say, anyone is allowed to visit whenever they like as long as they bring something diverting and indulgent – a card trick, vodka – and don’t expect so much as a glass of water. This turns out not to be true. I had to lobby for weeks to be invited to meet my friend’s new dachshund and when we arrived, it turned out “lunch” meant actual lunch, which wasn’t what I meant at all. I was thinking more, have some Frazzles, hug the dog, hug the older dog so it didn’t feel left out, do that a few more times, then go for a walk.</p><p>The etiquette is the opposite of new-baby rules: you have to think of some things to talk about that aren’t the dog. You shouldn’t really make minute-by-minute observations about the activities of the dog, or speculate about its feelings, or hypothesise about the extent of its consciousness or comprehension. Its owners have already had these conversations; they were hoping you would arrive with something new.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/23/whats-the-difference-between-a-baby-and-a-puppy-i-know-how-to-behave-when-friends-get-a-baby">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Alexander Abaturov’s stunning film captures the resilience of villagers in remote Shologon, but feels contextless</p><p>Due to a combination of climate change and state neglect, giant wildfires raged through millions of hectares of land in northeastern Siberia in the summer of 2021. Classified as “control zones” by the Russian government, the region gets little aid from officials; the cost of combating fires is considered to be excessive compared to the damage done. Focusing on the rural village of Shologon, Alexander Abaturov’s evocative documentary chronicles the heroic efforts of the indigenous community to protect their homes.</p><p>Largely populated by elderly people, women and children, Shologon has little equipment to slow the deadly spread of “the Dragon”, the locals’ nickname for the powerful forest fires. What they possess in spades, however, is astonishing resilience and camaraderie in the face of unprecedented calamity. Images of the villagers swathed in clouds of black smoke are accompanied by a child’s reading of an ancient folk tale, which speaks of a mighty and toxic wind – a profound juxtaposition that connotes how their fight for survival has existed for generations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/23/paradise-review-visually-striking-account-of-siberian-wildfires-leans-towards-abstraction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How a mind-altering, addictive substance was used as a weapon by one empire to subdue another </p><p>Humans are an exquisitely intelligent and capable species of ape. Our physiology has been fine-tuned for efficient long-distance running; our hands are elegantly dextrous for manipulating and making; and our throats and mouths give us astonishing control over the sounds we make. We are virtuoso communicators, able to convey everything from physical instructions to abstract concepts, and to coordinate ourselves in teams and communities. We learn from each other, from our parents and peers, so new generations don’t have to start from scratch. But we’re also deeply flawed, physically and mentally. In many ways, humans just don’t work well.</p><p>We’re also riddled with defects in our biochemistry and DNA – data-corrupted genes that no longer work – which means, for instance, that we must eat a diet more varied than almost any other animal to obtain the nutrients we need to survive. And our brains, far from being perfectly rational thinking machines, are full of cognitive glitches and bugs. We’re also prone to addictions that drive compulsive behaviour, sometimes along self-destructive paths.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/23/out-of-our-minds-opium-imperial-history-opium-wars-china-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The boy from Minnesota worried about capsizing as he canoed through the Canadian Northwest Territories. What he encountered was more terrifying than any white water</p><p>Late one afternoon, on what was supposed to be a six-week white-water canoe trip through the Canadian wilderness, 17-year-old Alex Messenger left his campsite to climb a steep ridge that promised panoramic views of the tundra. It was the highest point for at least 50 miles. “You could see lake after lake, after lake,” he says. Then, directly across the ridge, Messenger saw something else – a flicker of brown. His body recognised it before his conscious mind did. “It triggered all of the physiological responses in a fraction of a second,” he says, “before I even realised it was a grizzly bear.”</p><p>Four weeks earlier, in July 2005, Messenger’s group of six had set out on their summer adventure from Lake Wholdaia, in the remote Canadian Northwest Territories.<strong> </strong>They had been told that they would be lucky even to see a<strong> </strong>bear.<strong> </strong>“I felt like I had a good appreciation of what risks we were likely to encounter,” Messenger says. “Top of my mind was flipping the boat, and other things that can happen in white water.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/23/17-year-old-versus-600lb-grizzly-bear-i-was-going-to-die-alex-messenger-ordeal-wilderness">Continue reading...</a>
