Windows 11 is finally introducing RGB lighting standards", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever felt a little guilty for blinging out your PC with a Christmas tree&rsquo;s worth of RGB lighting, don&rsquo;t. Microsoft believes in RGB enough that it&rsquo;s bringing the technology to Windows with an upcoming Dynamic Lighting feature. (Perhaps, they even heard our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/606964/hey-microsoft-you-know-whatd-make-windows-11-irresistible-universal-control-over-rgb.html\">complaints</a>!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft unveiled a grab bag of new, upcoming features for Windows 11 at Microsoft Build, including changes to the Taskbar and<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/&amp;xcust=2-1-1928248-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"> alterations to how Windows widgets</a> work. But one of the weirdest has to be the addition of Dynamic Lighting controls, which are usually controlled by specialized utilities that ship with your PC or peripherals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Lighted accessories have been on the rise and can add energy and emotion to your PC experience,&rdquo; according to a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/&amp;xcust=2-1-1928248-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a> by Microsoft chief product officer Panos Panay. &ldquo;Today, many of these accessories rely on third-party apps and integrations that are highly fragmented. With Dynamic Lighting, Windows users will be able to effortlessly set up and customize their devices with RGB lights directly from Windows Settings. It has never been easier to help all your RGB accessories seamlessly work together for Windows apps. This month, we are making the Dynamic Lighting preview available to Windows Insiders so that developers and hardware partners alike can experiment with new integrations for RGB accessories and components.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, we haven&rsquo;t seen the Insider build that Panay references, nor do we know which channel it will appear in. (Windows Insider Release Preview and Beta Channels are for code that will definitely arrive on your PC, while the Dev and Canary Channels don&rsquo;t offer any guarantees.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also unclear whether Windows will offer anything better than the surprising number of RGB utilities already on the market, from SignalRGB, OpenRGB, RGB Fusion, and others. New hardware features also often necessitate a complementary feature in the accompanying software utility, and it isn&rsquo;t clear that Windows will be able to keep up with everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we do know, however, is that apparently you won&rsquo;t need to always rely on a piece of third-party code to keep the party pumping. Besides, can you really game without a swirling rainbow of lights in the background?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more from Microsoft Build, check out our stories on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html\">Windows Copilot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1923887/microsoft-will-restore-your-pcs-layout-plus-your-data-on-a-new-pc.html\">how Microsoft will make moving to a new PC easier</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1923985/microsoft-rolls-out-its-first-business-browser-edge-for-business.html\">changes coming to Microsoft Edge</a>.</p>\n\nComputer Accessories, Windows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928248/dynamic-lighting-will-be-windows-tool-to-manage-your-pcs-bling.html", "date_published": "2023-05-23 19:46:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Adobe Photoshop\u2019s AI art tools are now available for you to try", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>An Adobe Photoshop beta with AI art tools from Adobe Firefly has begun shipping, with the general release scheduled for the second half of 2023, Adobe said. The magic word? &ldquo;Generative Fill,&rdquo; the feature that will tap Firefly for creating backgrounds and other digital objects via AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades, Adobe Photoshop has been synonymous with creating images that don&rsquo;t correspond to real life. Adobe tip-toed further into this realm earlier this year with Firefly, a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1672975/the-best-ai-art-generators-for-you-midjourney-bing-and-more.html\">superb AI art generator</a> that was then a standalone project. Adobe characterized Firefly as one of its most successful beta launches, with users creating hundreds of millions of digital images. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, Firefly and the Generative Fill function will be incorporated across Adobe&rsquo;s Creative Cloud product portfolio, the company said. Adobe characterized Firefly and Generative Fill as a &ldquo;creative copilot,&rdquo; the name also given to Microsoft&rsquo;s AI assistants like the new <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html\">Windows Copilot</a>, too. For now, you can <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:2-3-1928107-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">download the Photoshop beta</a> from Adobe&rsquo;s website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s something else that Microsoft and Adobe will share, too: a digital watermark, which will identify the resulting image as AI-generated. Adobe calls this &ldquo;Content Credentials,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s the same principle that Microsoft is using with its own <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1923811/microsoft-will-id-its-ai-art-with-a-hidden-watermark.html\">AI digital watermarking scheme</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how the new Generative Fill tool for Photoshop will work:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, the new Generative Fill feature looks very similar to what other AI art generators do: Designers can highlight the subject of an image, for example, and then place it in an AI-constructed background. The tool also allows &ldquo;outpainting,&rdquo; where you can highlight a region outside of the original image (such as an image of a seascape, for example) and Generative Fill will &ldquo;extend&rdquo; the image beyond its original limits, filling in the details using AI. Photoshop can also use AI to add a detail within a given region of the image using the Magic Lasso, such as a sign hanging on a wall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these features are enabled via a text prompt. Firefly allows you to select a particular style, then choose a representative image that you liked best. Photoshop will presumably do the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Firefly beta was excellent, generating images that had been trained on Adobe stock imagery. Photoshop looks like it could presumably carry that even further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nProfessional Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928107/adobe-photoshop-ships-beta-with-ai-art-tools-from-firefly.html", "date_published": "2023-05-23 18:45:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Windows 11\u2019s widgets will finally become useful", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>As Microsoft readies its AI-powered Windows Copilot for a public preview in June, the company is also disclosing even more new features that may arrive on your PC in the next few weeks. including tweakable Widgets, some great new Taskbar improvements, new VPN badging, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft made the announcement at Build, its developer conference. We can expect to see Microsoft talk more about Windows over the next few days, but the company has already announced several updates: the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html\">AI-powered Windows Copilot</a>, tweaks to Edge, and its first business browser, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1923985/microsoft-rolls-out-its-first-business-browser-edge-for-business.html\">Edge for Business</a>, as well as an <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1923887/microsoft-will-restore-your-pcs-layout-plus-your-data-on-a-new-pc.html\">improved setup process for new PCs</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft will begin pushing these new features to your PC over the next few weeks, especially if you&rsquo;ve already opted in to frequent updates on your PC. (Go to the Windows 11 Settings menu, then Windows Update, and toggle &ldquo;Get the latest updates as soon as they&rsquo;re available&rdquo; to &ldquo;On.&rdquo;) Otherwise, they&rsquo;ll debut as part of the &ldquo;June 2023 optional non-security preview release of all editions of Windows 11, version 22H2,&rdquo; according to Microsoft, which will be pushed to your PC automatically in June. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft earlier released some of these new features within a beta release of Windows 11, part of the next <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1858854/new-windows-test-build-signals-key-changes-are-coming-for-your-pc.html\">&ldquo;moment&rdquo; release Microsoft detailed</a> earlier in May. That preview release detailed several features that will be coming to Windows PCs, including a Content-Aware Brightness control, new Widgets picker, and more. Microsoft said today that even more new features will be rolling out over the next few weeks as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the major update to Windows will be <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html\">Windows Copilot, the AI-powered assistant for Windows</a>. It will preview in June. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-windows-11-taskbar-is-improving\">The Windows 11 Taskbar is improving</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be some significant Taskbar improvements, too. In a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/&amp;xcust=2-1-1927896-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a>, chief product officer Panos Panay also disclosed even more features arriving on the Taskbar. It&rsquo;s not clear whether Microsoft will be rolling these features out as part of Insider releases, or if these are being pushed out to the general public. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key improvement will be easier determination of the which apps are hiding where on the Taskbar. For example, you may have multiple instances of a browser running, all grouped together. Any app running on the Taskbar can be identified with a single click, Panay said. They&rsquo;ll all be labeled, too. (It&rsquo;s not clear whether this will be controllable via a setting.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even better, you can now right-click and kill an app on the Taskbar, too. Today, you can hover over the app and click the small &ldquo;X&rdquo; to close the app, but this doesn&rsquo;t always work. This new behavior eliminates the need to open the Task Manager, then kill the app. Finally, you can now hide the time and date on the taskbar, which Microsoft believes will be useful for screen captures.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Widgets picker\" class=\"wp-image-1875936\" height=\"956\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Windows-widget-picker.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>You&rsquo;ll have a Widgets picker to help guide your choices.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"smaller-updates-coming-to-windows-11-in-june\">Smaller updates coming to Windows 11 in June</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Widgets:</strong> Perhaps the most significant addition to Windows is a tweak to Widgets, which will allow a dedicated space for user-pinned apps. To date, Microsoft has largely dictated the layout and content of Widgets, and Microsoft will now allow users greater control. The default view will now feature a larger layout with dedicated space for user-pinned apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Windows will now support Bluetooth Low Energy Audio, a first for PCs. The low-power audio standard is supported by earbuds like the Galaxy Buds2 Pro, and that&rsquo;s coming to the PC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Microsoft account badging:</strong> One of the &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; you may not want is account badging, which is another name for the notifications that you&rsquo;ll see in the Start menu when your account needs attention. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Microsoft is allowing you to turn off presence sensors, if your PC supports them, when you leave your PC. If you use a VPN, you&rsquo;ll see badging on your taskbar that will indicate that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Win32 isolation:</strong> Intel has already proposed an X86S architecture, which essentially eliminates the legacy 32-bit code environment in favor of dedicated 64-bit code. A 32-bit app would be run in emulation. Microsoft is backing that transition by allowing Win32 apps to run in isolation, preventing them from having unauthorized access to Windows processes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story was updated at 10:15 AM on May 23.</em></p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1927896/microsoft-confirms-tweakable-widgets-will-arrive-in-windows.html", "date_published": "2023-05-23 17:16:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Microsoft is making migrating to a new PC much easier", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to upgrading to a new PC, it takes some fiddling to back up, migrate, and then set up your apps and data. Thankfully, Microsoft is making that process a step simpler with Restore Apps for Windows 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company announced at Microsoft Build that it will preserve the setup of your old PC onto the new one, migrating the layout as well as the data. In other words, if you have a particular app pinned to the taskbar, that will copy over. Any icons that you have scattered around the desktop (hopefully not many!) will transfer over, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Restore Apps looks optional, in that it can be turned off if you prefer to start afresh with a clean setup. If you do choose to take advantage of it, though, you&rsquo;ll need to be registered with a Microsoft account to take full advantage. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1921608/how-to-set-up-a-local-account-in-windows-11.html\">Setting up Windows 11 with a local account can be done</a>, but the company preserves its best features for those who provide the company with a Microsoft account. (Microsoft recently chose to limit conversations in Bing Chat to just a handful of interactions, for example, versus a full twenty if you&rsquo;re logged in).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, the process from moving your data from one PC to another remains the same. Assuming that it&rsquo;s all backed up to the OneDrive cloud, Microsoft will restore your documents, photos, files, and apps. It will also upload and backup any apps stored on your PC desktop by default, though this can be turned off. The company&rsquo;s demonstration video showed the user clicking on the taskbar and apparently downloading and installing the app as part of the process.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Restore Apps transfer apps\" class=\"wp-image-1923915\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Restore-apps-transfer-apps.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Once your Taskbar transfers over, you may see a small loading bar the first time you access the app..</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft said that Restore Apps is in preview and will be rolled out to Windows Insiders today.

Microsoft calls the new Edge the &ldquo;standard browser experience for organizations,&rdquo; with its own separate logo and icon on your taskbar. You&rsquo;ll see more in the Edge sidebar, too: the inclusion of Microsoft 365 Copilot, web apps, and a new &ldquo;Workspaces&rdquo; collection of tabs that can be simultaneously shared and browsed with coworkers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft Edge already allows you to browse and open windows in both a personal and business account. But Microsoft is promising that Edge for Business, now in preview, will automatically separate personal browsing from your company&rsquo;s business environment, backup, and management. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to check your Gmail or your child&rsquo;s grades, for example, Edge will automatically open another window with its own separate cache and storage location. You can also exclude personal information from being swept up in syncing or backing up on your company&rsquo;s server.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Edge for Business\" class=\"wp-image-1923996\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Microsoft-Edge-Edge-for-Business-Automatic-Switching-GIF-800px.gif\" width=\"800\" /><figcaption>Microsoft Edge for Business promises to automatically swap between business and personal accounts for new web pages.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft will also beef up Edge in general with even more AI options. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661514/microsoft-365-copilot-is-microsofts-ai-powers-applied-to-work.html\">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a> has previously been targeted at Microsoft&rsquo;s Office apps, including Teams. Now you&rsquo;ll begin to see it within Edge, provided you&rsquo;re signed in to a corporate Microsoft account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incidentally, Microsoft is leaning heavily into plugins within Microsoft 365, after <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1808784/1808784.html\">announcing them for Edge</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 50 plugins from partners will be available for customers as part of an early access program for Copilot plugins, including Atlassian, Adobe, ServiceNow, Thomson Reuters, Moveworks and Mural, with thousands more to be added by the time Microsoft 365 Copilot is available widely, Microsoft said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"edges-sidebar-keeps-adding-more\">Edge&rsquo;s sidebar keeps adding more</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft will also begin adding web apps to the Edge sidebar, too. Recall that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/920637/the-new-edge-sidebar-adds-widgets-that-actually-make-sense.html\">we&rsquo;ve already seen Edge sidebar apps</a>, which Microsoft calls Tools. Now, in addition to Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft is encouraging web app developers to add a few lines of code to turn them into Edge sidebar apps, too. That probably means you&rsquo;ll be able to stick <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507212/how-to-run-chatgpt-or-bing-as-a-windows-app.html\">web apps like ChatGPT</a> inside the Edge sidebar&mdash;though that probably won&rsquo;t be <em>that</em> much different than a bookmark. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Edge Workspaces\" class=\"wp-image-1923997\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Microsoft-Edge-WorkspacesGIF_800px.gif\" width=\"800\" /><figcaption>Microsoft is a big believer in the new Workspaces feature.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the oddest update to Edge will be a collection of web pages, called Microsoft Edge Workspaces, that Microsoft will roll out in the next few months. Workspaces sound a lot like Edge Collections, the grouped tabs that you can store for planning a beach vacation, for example. Workspaces, though, allow you to view these tabs simultaneously with coworkers, which sounds&hellip;fun? Microsoft sure thinks so, noting that the test pool of beta users was over-subscribed twice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the enthusiasm, Microsoft will roll out Edge Workspaces for consumers and businesses over the next few months. If nothing else, expect Edge to get a lot more cluttered in the months ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nInternet, Professional Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1923985/microsoft-rolls-out-its-first-business-browser-edge-for-business.html", "date_published": "2023-05-23 15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Microsoft will ID its AI art with a hidden watermark", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Artists concerned about others passing off AI-generated art as their own will now be able to breathe a bit easier: Microsoft has agreed to sign all AI art that its apps generate with a cryptographic watermark indicating it was made with an algorithm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authority (C2PA) began work in 2021 to develop an open standard for indicating the origin of digital images, and whether they were authentic or AI-generated.

Microsoft only supports image creation in both Image Creator and Designer, though companies like Runway have already launched the ability <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1665235/ai-already-turns-text-prompts-into-stunning-art-next-up-video.html\">to generate AI video</a> in short clips. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"AI art signals C2PA\" class=\"wp-image-1923874\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/C2PA-spec-image.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The C2PA specification provides rules for informing readers which art is AI-generated, and which isn&rsquo;t, via icons or popups.</figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.1/ux/UX_Recommendations.html#_appearance&amp;xcust=2-2-1923811-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">C2PA</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"establishing-digital-ownership-of-ai-art\">Establishing digital ownership of AI art</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Who exactly creates AI art&mdash;and thus who owns it, and who can profit off of it&mdash;has become a major concern in the creative world. Stock imagery giant <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1475597/getty-sues-stability-ai-and-the-future-of-ai-art-could-be-at-stake.html\">Getty has sued Stable Diffusion</a> in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, arguing that AI art algorithms have no right to train themselves on copyrighted images. The U.S. Copyright Office has taken a middle ground, arguing that AI-generated art is not subject to copyright unless it can be proven that the original AI generation has been substantially modified by a person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft is also addressing another angle: AI art as disinformation. At Build, Microsoft is also announcing Azure AI Content Safety, a service that will allow AI to either assist or replace content moderators. The AI assigns a content score to images scanned by the AI, and flags human moderators. The service will launch in June, for $1.50 per 1,000 scanned images, Microsoft said. Watermarking its own AI-generated content, and encouraging others to do so, will simplify the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concern over AI content has become so critical that camera makers Leica and Nikon are building the C2PA standard directly into cameras to authenticate images as real, and not AI-generated, according to Adobe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1923811/microsoft-will-id-its-ai-art-with-a-hidden-watermark.html", "date_published": "2023-05-23 15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Windows Copilot will bring AI inside Windows 11", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows Copilot will usher an AI assistant into Windows 11, eight years after Microsoft launched its Cortana assistant alongside Windows 10&mdash;then killed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows Copilot will debut in June, Microsoft will announce this week at its Build developer conference, as a preview for Windows 11. That will most likely set up Windows Copilot for a potential feature release in the fall, though Microsoft hasn&rsquo;t said when it will release the new feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that AI has emerged as a top priority at Microsoft. However, Microsoft has introduced AI to its users first as a web service with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html\">Bing Chat</a>, integrating AI <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1656353/microsoft-edge-copilot-adds-ai-content-creation-to-your-browser.html\">within the Edge Copilot</a>, then adapting it via the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661649/forget-bing-microsoft-365-copilot-looks-like-ais-killer-app.html\">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a> to Office apps like Word, Excel, and Teams, and later to Edge. The Windows Copilot sounds more like the latter feature, with<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1515160/microsoft-is-making-bing-chat-less-weird.html\"> Bing Chat&rsquo;s AI personality potentially dialed way down</a> in favor of a more matter-of-fact assistant. You can expect to see more and more AI integrated into basic Windows services and apps, as Microsoft pushes the throttle to the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Windows will be the first PC platform to centralize AI assistance with the introduction of Windows Copilot,&rdquo; Microsoft said as the Microsoft Build conference kicked off. &ldquo;Together, with Bing Chat and first- and third-party plugins, users can focus on bringing their ideas to life, completing complex projects, and collaborating instead of spending energy finding, launching, and working across multiple applications.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows Copilot in action\" class=\"wp-image-1927797\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Windows-Copilot-snapshot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Windows Copilot in action.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft has managed to pull <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html\">Bing Chat into Windows 11</a>, though it feels a little deceitful. Windows 11 now includes a shortcut to Bing Chat within the Windows 11 search box, but it&rsquo;s just a link to the Bing.com website which opens Microsoft Edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows Copilot, meanwhile, sounds like much more of a productivity assistant. &ldquo;Windows Copilot can be docked in a side pane so that it stays persistent next to any of a user&rsquo;s apps, always there to provide assistance no matter what they&rsquo;re doing&mdash;getting inspired, planning, communicating, creating,&rdquo; Microsoft says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s ironic, of course, because AI has been a central feature in Windows before. Windows 10 launched with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/428642/meet-cortana-the-ultimate-guide-to-windows-10s-helpful-digital-assistant.html\">Cortana as part of the operating system</a>, writing emails on command, setting reminders, and reading emails. But Cortana&rsquo;s role within Windows steadily diminished, and today the assistant is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/398829/microsofts-new-cortana-app-doesnt-know-the-answer-to-22.html\">little more than an app</a> that you can launch like any other. Was Cortana simply ahead of what consumers wanted, or will Copilot and Cortana eventually merge?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Today, we announce new AI experiences and tools for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows11?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-2-1924008-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">#Windows11</a> to empower developers.

The Windows Store is getting a bit of an AI makeover, with an &ldquo;AI hub&rdquo; of the best AI experiences. Microsoft will even use AI to generate searchable keywords for each entry, and use its AI-powered summarization features to provide a comprehensive interpretation of user reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft is also taking cues from ChatGPT, the AI-powered chat service developed by OpenAI on the ChatGPT foundation that Bing also uses. ChatGPT already announced plans to browse the web (which Bing does) and use plugins (which ChatGPT has delivered on, and Bing so far has not.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To improve both platforms, OpenAI and Microsoft agreed to use a common plugin format so that both companies could benefit from third-party development. Microsoft is also working on plugins for Microsoft 365 Copilot, and will announce at Build that about 50 are in the works from Atlassian, Adobe, ServiceNow, Thomson Reuters, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story was updated with additional information at 8:15 AM.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html", "date_published": "2023-05-23 15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "This $58 Logitech wireless gaming mouse has amazing battery life", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re into puzzle adventures or first-person-shooters, gaming sessions can often be long and intense.

Technical decisions also make it unappealing for 1440p gamers, unlike its predecessor.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>At first blush, Nvidia&rsquo;s $399 GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (8GB) looks like it should be a smashing success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its predecessor, 2020&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393767/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review.html\">$399 GeForce RTX 3060 Ti</a>, was one of the best GPUs in a strong RTX 30-series generation, offering impeccable 1080p and spectacular 1440p gaming performance at a reasonable price. The new RTX 4060 Ti sticks to the same price while weaving in Nvidia&rsquo;s latest killer RTX 40-series features, like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html\">DLSS 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html\">Reflex</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525299/nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution-tested.html\">RTX Video Super Resolution</a>, best-in-class ray tracing, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1375901/tested-nvidias-geforce-rtx-4090-is-a-content-creation-monster.html\">AV1 encoding</a>, stunning power efficiency, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But peel back the hood and things aren&rsquo;t quite so clear cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia made technical decisions&mdash;reducing core counts and altering the memory subsystem&mdash;that allow the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti to scream at 1080p resolution but make it unappealing for 1440p gaming. It also makes the 4060 Ti a mediocre generational upgrade in terms of raw firepower. The decision to outfit this card with 8GB of memory means it won&rsquo;t be able to run all games with eye candy maxed out even at 1080p, by Nvidia&rsquo;s own admission. And while the addition of DLSS 3&rsquo;s AI-generated frames is certainly welcome, image upsampling technologies create noticeable visual artifacts at the less pixel-packed 1080p resolution, rendering DLSS&rsquo;s performance-boosting advantages less of a factor here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess the bottom line is: Are you willing to pay $400 for a 1080p graphics card with 8GB of memory in the year of our lord 2023?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"what-are-the-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-tis-specs-and-price\">What are the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti&rsquo;s specs and price?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia revealed some high-level details for the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB in its announcement (which also revealed a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1921195/nvidia-unveils-3-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-gpus-dlss-3-goes-mainstream.html\">$299 RTX 4060 and $499 RTX 4060 Ti 16GB</a>, both coming in July) but didn&rsquo;t provide deeper technical information. Here that is, compared against the RTX 3060 Ti:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"rtx 4060 ti vs 3060 ti specs\" class=\"wp-image-1925936\" height=\"1199\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/specs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=911\" width=\"911\" /><figcaption> Correction: The L2 cache for the 3060 Ti should read 4MB, not 4KB.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A few key details leap out straight away. First, the RTX 4060 Ti&mdash;built upon Nvidia&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Ada Lovelace&rdquo; GPU architecture&mdash;is tremendously power efficient and offers much higher GPU and memory clock speeds than before. Bravo, Nvidia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, this new card actually holds <em>significantly</em> fewer CUDA, tensor, and RT cores than the RTX 3060 Ti it replaces. Because of this, the RTX 4060 Ti can actually be <em>slower</em> than its predecessor in some situations, and only offers a middling performance uplift overall. Best-case scenarios top out at around 15 to 20 percent faster than the RTX 3060 Ti, but you&rsquo;ll see essentially static gen-on-gen performance in many more games and resolutions. It&rsquo;s a testament to Lovelace that this GPU shows any speed upgrades considering how many fewer CUDA cores it has, especially given the ultra-low power draw, but it&rsquo;s still deeply <em>meh</em> as a generational upgrade.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 Ti\" class=\"wp-image-1925941\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC02133.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, Nvidia adjusted the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti&rsquo;s memory subsystem to more closely mirror AMD&rsquo;s Radeon Infinity Cache setup, plopping a big L2 cache on-die while nerfing the memory bus width all the way down to 128 bits. (The 3060 Ti has a 256-bit bus.) Nvidia also kept memory capacity identical to its predecessor at 8GB of GDDR6, in an era when modern games can now eat more than that even at 1080p resolution. And when it comes to VRAM capacity, either you have enough or you don&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The memory configuration prevents the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti from being a viable High/Ultra 1440p gaming option in the long-term, and even in many situations now. We explained why in our analysis during the RTX 4060 Ti&rsquo;s initial reveal:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&ldquo;The memory bus width is being slimmed down, from 256-bit in the RTX 3060 Ti to just 128-bit in the 4060 Ti.

A hundred cars move much faster on a four-lane highway than a single lane dirt road, and that speed is analogous to the card&rsquo;s overall memory bandwidth. Ostensibly, the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti offers 288GB per second of overall memory bandwidth, compared to the 3060 Ti&rsquo;s 448GB/s&mdash;a huge gulf.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that simple though.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 family\" class=\"wp-image-1921200\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ampere-cache-mem-perf.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>An illustrative example of how traditional GPU memory works, without a larger on-die L2 cache.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 family\" class=\"wp-image-1921201\" height=\"679\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ada-cache-mem-perf.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>A comparison image showing how the larger L2 cache in Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 40-series (&ldquo;Ada Lovelace&rdquo;) GPUs helps result in far fewer calls to traditional memory.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Nvidia</p></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Nvidia swiped a page from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393733/rdna-2-deep-dive-inside-amd-radeon-rx-6000-graphics-cards.html\">AMD&rsquo;s killer Infinity Cache technology</a>&nbsp;for RTX 40-series offerings, dropping a large on-die cache onto the GPU itself, and the RTX 4060 family is no different. Not only does the closer physical proximity mean this cache is faster, but deploying it also reduces the need to send many requests out to the memory chips arrayed around the GPU itself, as illustrated in the slides above. While AMD&rsquo;s Infinity Cache uses an L3 cache, Nvidia opted for a 32MB L2 cache instead (versus just 4MB on the 3060 Ti). The company says the larger L2 cache particularly helps improve ray tracing and DLSS performance, and results in the &ldquo;effective&rdquo; memory bandwidth shown in the technical specifications slide.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the thing though: As evidenced in our review of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394984/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-asus-rog-strix.html\">last-gen Radeon RX 6600 XT</a>, which had 32MB of Infinity Cache and a 128-bit bus, pairing a big on-die cache with a neutered bus width helps the GPU perform exceptionally&mdash;both in performance and power&mdash;at the display resolution it&rsquo;s targeted for, but usually results in lower-than-expected results at higher resolutions. Higher resolutions have higher memory needs, which results in fewer successful on-die cache hits. When that happens, the memory requests go out to traditional memory&mdash;and the RTX 4060 Ti&rsquo;s much smaller 128-bit bus might falter when that happens.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve tested the RTX 4060 Ti, we can confirm that it indeed slows down at the higher 1440p resolution. In fact, it can&rsquo;t even hang tough at 1440p with the RTX 3070, which cost $500 in 2020. You&rsquo;d expect a new card to at least rival an older GPU that cost just $100 more than it 2.5 long years ago, but the RTX 4060 Ti fails to clear that low bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia seems to be hitching the 4060 Ti&rsquo;s star to Lovelace&rsquo;s power efficiency and the company&rsquo;s GeForce feature set, which is admittedly killer: <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html\">DLSS 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525299/nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution-tested.html\">RTX Video Super Resolution</a>, Nvidia Broadcast, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1375901/tested-nvidias-geforce-rtx-4090-is-a-content-creation-monster.html\">cutting-edge AV1 encoding</a>, class-leading ray tracing, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html\">Nvidia Reflex</a>, and more are on tap, and they&rsquo;re all truly <em>excellent</em>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 Ti\" class=\"wp-image-1925937\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC02135.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re testing Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 4060 Ti Founders Edition, a manageable two-slot iteration of the company&rsquo;s tried-and-tried and <em>gorgeous</em> in-house design.

We now test with PCIe Resizable BAR (also known as Smart Access Memory on Ryzen systems) active, as most modern gaming PCs released in the last four years support the performance-boosting feature, either natively or via a motherboard firmware update. Nvidia also recommends turning on the optional &ldquo;Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling&rdquo; in Windows to let the RTX 40-series stretch its legs to the fullest, so we&rsquo;ve made that tweak as well.

Each game is tested using its in-game benchmark, sanity checked by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/frameview/&amp;xcust=2-3-1925928-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nvidia&rsquo;s FrameView tool</a>, at the highest possible graphics presets unless otherwise noted, with VSync, frame rate caps, real-time ray tracing or DLSS effects, and FreeSync/G-Sync disabled, along with any other vendor-specific technologies like FidelityFX tools or Nvidia Reflex.

Outside of esports, we&rsquo;ve limited our benchmarks to 1440p and 1080p resolutions, as the 4060 Ti truly isn&rsquo;t built for 4K gaming. We test features like ray tracing and DLSS in a separate section, as upscaling features like DLSS and AMD&rsquo;s rival FSR tweak the look of games to help them run faster.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually we present our data in a series of per-game bar charts, but given some severe time constraints, we&rsquo;re running our data in raw charts today and supplementing it with additional performance commentary instead.

We also included results for the Radeon RX 6700 XT. This AMD GPU features 12GB of VRAM and a 256-bit bus, sidestepping concerns with the RTX 4060 Ti&rsquo;s memory configuration. It can be found for roughly $350 these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new RTX 4060 Ti generally leads its RTX 3060 Ti predecessor, albeit by a slim to negligible margin in most games, as evidenced by the average FPS shown at the end of the chart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one exception? The legendary <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>, one of the most-played games on the planet. GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs have consistently failed to beat their predecessors in <em>CSGO</em>, likely due to the much narrower memory bus widths that Nvidia slapped on this generation. If you exclude <em>CSGO </em>and its ultra-high frame rates from the averaged results, the RTX 4060 Ti&rsquo;s lead widens, hitting 130fps on average versus the RTX 3060 Ti&rsquo;s 119&mdash;still a paltry 9 percent uplift overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-1440p-gaming-performance\">Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 1440p gaming performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We also tested these cards at 1440p resolution, adding in the $500 RTX 3070 from last generation and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html\">new $599 RTX 4070</a> for good measure (literally).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 Ti 1440p perf\" class=\"wp-image-1925935\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1440p.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Right-click and open in new tab to see in full resolution.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, all these graphics cards turn in a respectable showing, and once again, the new RTX 4060 Ti lands uncomfortably close to its predecessor. Factoring in <em>CSGO</em>&rsquo;s high frame rates and slower RTX 40-series performance, the 3060 Ti actually holds the lead in the averaged frame rate here. Oof. That&rsquo;s a bit misleading though, because the RTX 3060 Ti is <em>so much faster</em> than the RTX 4060 Ti at 1440p that it skews the overall picture. Exclude <em>CSGO </em>and the RTX 4060 Ti is roughly 7 percent faster than the RTX 3060 Ti. Still oof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That oof becomes an OOF when you consider the RTX 3070&rsquo;s performance. It smashes the RTX 4060 Ti to the tune of a 13.7 percent average with <em>CSGO </em>included, or by 5 percent with <em>CSGO </em>excluded. Not being able to beat a card that cost just $100 more 2.5 years ago is deeply embarrassing for Nvidia&rsquo;s new GPU, and an indication of why the RTX 4060 Ti&rsquo;s new technical configuration makes it unsuitable for long-term 1440p gaming performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of, peep that Radeon RX 6700 XT at both resolutions. It performs similarly on average to the RTX 3060 Ti, which as we just established is within spitting distance of the RTX 4060 Ti, but comes with 12GB of memory and a wider 256-bit bus for $350. If you&rsquo;re worried about 8GB not being enough VRAM for modern games, or want to dabble in 1440p gaming and don&rsquo;t mind giving up DLSS and other Nvidia features, it&rsquo;s worth considering&mdash;especially at $50 less than Nvidia&rsquo;s new GPU. When it comes to VRAM capacity, either you have enough or you don&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>DLSS 3 Frame Generation is a feather in the cap of the RTX 4060 Ti&mdash;just flip it on and watch the frame rate fly.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-ray-tracing-dlss-and-dlss-3-performance\">Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti ray tracing, DLSS, and DLSS 3 performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So the RTX 4060 Ti is a mediocre generational upgrade when it comes to traditional gaming horsepower. Nvidia is seemingly hitching this GPU&rsquo;s hat on power efficiency (more on that later), ray tracing, and&mdash;given the nature of the performance metrics Nvidia unveiled in the card&rsquo;s announcement&mdash;the power of AI-enhanced DLSS performance improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, many of the games in our carefully chosen test suite include ray tracing and image upscaling (Nvidia DLSS/AMD FSR) options. We test the games at native, native with RT on Ultra, and with RT on Ultra and DLSS/FSR on Balanced to evaluate each experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BUT!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that I think DLSS/FSR image upscaling looks terrible at the 1080p resolution this graphics card was built for. Image upscaling works by internally rendering a frame at a lower resolution, then using AI and/or software tricks to upscale the final image to match your chosen resolution. It lets you get faster performance with minimal to no loss in image quality&mdash;at least at higher pixel-packed 1440p and 4K resolutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activating image upscaling isn&rsquo;t so simple at 1080p. At this lower end of the scale, the image upscaling technology is pulling from so many fewer pixels that the visuals that appear onscreen can look blurry and jagged, even at higher-quality DLSS/FSR presets. The internal image being used to render games at 1080p resolution with DLSS Balanced on is <em>under</em> 720p&mdash;and it looks like it, in my opinion, though DLSS looks superior to AMD&rsquo;s FSR at this resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t buy a 1080p graphics card with upscaling in mind, full stop. Unfortunately, the lower upscaled image fidelity also makes running ray tracing more difficult at 1080p, as it takes away from the enhanced visuals that ray tracing can provide. The best lighting in the world doesn&rsquo;t look great when it&rsquo;s paired with jagged, blurry models, alas. It&rsquo;s <em>fine enough</em> if need be, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image upscaling is just part of the DLSS value proposition with the RTX 40-series however. This generation also marks the introduction of DLSS 3 Frame Generation, which leverages the tensor cores and enhanced optical flow accelerator within Nvidia&rsquo;s Lovelace GPUs to insert fully AI-generated frames between every traditionally rendered frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This</em> is a true potential feather in the cap of the RTX 4060 Ti. You don&rsquo;t have to activate DLSS 2 image upsampling and downgrade image fidelity to run DLSS 3&mdash;you can just flip on Frame Generation and watch the frame rate fly, especially in CPU-bound games like <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em>. It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, DLSS 3 isn&rsquo;t quite set-and-forget either. Inserting AI frames can sometimes result in visual artifacts in select games, especially around UI elements. And since you can&rsquo;t actually control inputs during those AI-generated frames, latency is added. DLSS 3 requires developers to also integrate Nvidia Reflex to combat those concerns, which often helps games be slightly more responsive than when rendering natively, but it doesn&rsquo;t result in the jump in responsiveness you&rsquo;d normally expect when supercharging your frame rates. That means the <em>feel </em>of the game might not match what your brain and hands expect&mdash;a game might be running 50 percent-plus faster with frame generation on, for example, but only feel 10 to 20 percent faster in responsiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DLSS 3 makes games look amazing to be sure, but that detail is kind of weird, and worth noting. Our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html\">DLSS 3 deep dive</a> goes into everything about the technology in much greater detail.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 Ti 1080p perf\" class=\"wp-image-1925934\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dlss-and-ray-tracing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Right-click and open in new tab to see in full resolution.</p>Note that Watch Dogs doesn&rsquo;t support FSR, hence the 0 FPS on AMD GPUs there.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested ray tracing and DLSS at both 1440p and 1080p resolution, but are only revealing the 1080p results above, given a combination of time constraints and the fact that you should only really consider the RTX 4060 Ti for 1080p gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see from these numbers, the RTX 4060 Ti maintains Nvidia&rsquo;s ray tracing lead in this segment, though it doesn&rsquo;t functionally extend it beyond what the 3060 Ti was already capable of years ago for the same price. We test at Ultra, but if you dial some graphics settings back to High or Medium, you can come close to 60fps performance at 1080p in many games even with ray tracing enabled and DLSS off. DLSS 3 is a game changer when it&rsquo;s available, but note that it&rsquo;s only currently available in about 50 titles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"how-are-the-rtx-4060-tis-power-efficiency-and-thermals\">How are the RTX 4060 Ti&rsquo;s power efficiency and thermals?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We test power draw by looping the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we&rsquo;ve benchmarked everything else (to warm up the GPU) and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you&rsquo;re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GeForce RTX 4060 Ti absolutely sips power despite flinging out fast frame rates, drawing 83 fewer watts than the RTX 3060 Ti despite being 7 to 9 percent faster in performance.

If you&rsquo;re still on a GTX 1060 or RTX 2060, the RTX 4060 Ti will be a fantastic upgrade (albeit expensive).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;ll be a hard sell for many folks, though&mdash;just like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">RTX 4080</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html\">4070 Ti</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html\">4070</a> have been so far this seemingly lost generation.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4060 Ti\" class=\"wp-image-1925939\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC02130.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia pitches the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti as &ldquo;a 1080p performance champ,&rdquo; and if you&rsquo;ve followed along with our technical dissection and benchmarks, that&rsquo;s exactly what it is. Memory and GPU configuration decisions made by Nvidia keep this GPU from flexing its muscles at 1440p (though you can certainly game at 1440p if you don&rsquo;t mind tweaking graphics settings). That&rsquo;s exacerbated by its 8GB of onboard memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh7kFgHe21k&amp;xcust=2-3-1925928-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hardware Unboxed recently chronicled</a>, 8GB of memory isn&rsquo;t enough to run all modern games maxed-out now that developers are taking advantage of the 16GB shared memory pools in the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. In Nvidia&rsquo;s own <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1921195/nvidia-unveils-3-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-gpus-dlss-3-goes-mainstream.html\">early RTX 4060 Ti performance teasers</a>, it had to reduce graphics settings in <em>A Plague Tale: Requiem</em> and <em>Resident Evil Remake</em> even at 1080p, while recent games like <em>The Last of Us </em>and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> also struggle with 8GB at the lower resolution unless you drop settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frame Generation is pretty damned cool, but Nvidia&rsquo;s vaunted DLSS upsampling loses quite a bit of its luster at 1080p (along with AMD&rsquo;s rival FSR) because of the limited amount of pixels available at this resolution. I wouldn&rsquo;t run 1080p games with DLSS or FSR active aside from the specific DLSS 3 Frame Generation feature. Even then, while <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html\">DLSS 3 is off to a hot start</a>, it&rsquo;s only currently available in around 50 games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RTX 4060 Ti is also a deeply uninspiring upgrade gen-on-gen when it comes to raw GPU horsepower, only besting the RTX 3060 Ti by 9 percent at 1080p resolution and 7 percent at 1440p. It has fewer CUDA, RT, and tensor cores than its predecessor, which is disappointing. It flat-out loses to the RTX 3070 at 1440p, which is even more disappointing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So: Are you willing to pay $400 for a 1080p graphics card with 8GB of memory in the year of our lord 2023? I&rsquo;m not, especially with DLSS/FSR advantages minimized in this segment. (Given the RTX 4060 Ti&rsquo;s overall performance, I don&rsquo;t think the $500 16GB version will be very appealing when it launches in July either.)</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"our-favorite-affordable-1080p-gpu-for-60hz-gaming\">\n\t\t\t\t\tOur favorite affordable 1080p gpu for 60Hz gaming\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"radeon-rx-6600-swft-210\">Radeon RX 6600 Swft 210</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Radeon RX 6600 Swft 210\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/XFX-Radeon-RX-6600-Swft-210-8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/543823/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-finally-a-true-1080p-graphics-card.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HHLX543?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-3-1925928-5-543966-11000&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$209.99 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>If you <em>have</em> to buy right now, I&rsquo;d rather spend my money on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/543823/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-finally-a-true-1080p-graphics-card.html\">a Radeon RX 6600</a> for around $200 if I was gaming on a 1080p/60Hz monitor, or opt for the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394249/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review.html\">Radeon RX 6700 XT</a> and its 12GB of memory on a 256-bit bus for $350 if you&rsquo;re thinking about dabbling in 1440p, worried about 8GB of VRAM being enough at 1080p, and don&rsquo;t mind giving up DLSS 3. (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1799919/intel-arc-gpus-how-much-improvement-has-intel-made-in-6-months.html\">Intel&rsquo;s $330 Arc A770</a> offers 16GB of VRAM, on that note.) Since the RTX 4060 Ti doesn&rsquo;t provide a tangible performance upgrade over the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393767/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-founders-edition-review.html\">RTX 3060 Ti</a> and is slower than the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393649/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-founders-edition-review-vs-2080-ti.html\">RTX 3070</a>, you might also be able to snap up either of those on sale to take advantage of Nvidia&rsquo;s awesome features, though note that those both lack DLSS 3 support and are also limited to 8GB of memory, so look for steep sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I&rsquo;d hold my horses if I could. Nvidia already teased a $299 RTX 4060 with DLSS 3, AV1, and extreme power efficiency for July. Plus, the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-rx-7600-gpu-specs-confirmed-navi-33-xl-with-2048-stream-processors-and-8gb-vram&amp;xcust=2-3-1925928-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">rumor mill is screaming</a> that AMD could launch a $300 Radeon RX 7600 any minute now. That price point is a lot more palatable for 1080p gaming on 8GB if you don&rsquo;t need Nvidia&rsquo;s deep feature set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GeForce RTX 4060 Ti would have been more appealing if it offered 16GB of memory for $399 and ditched the 8GB option, or offered 8GB of memory with the same level of performance for $300 to $325. As it stands, Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 40-series upgrades remain uninspiring at best and this GPU sadly falls into a no-man&rsquo;s land of sorts. Look elsewhere.</p>\n\nGaming, Graphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html", "date_published": "2023-05-23 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Laptop ports explained: Every symbol and connector identified", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern laptops come with a dizzying array of ports&mdash;or maybe only one, in the case of some <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1072047/best-ultraportable-laptops.html\">extremely svelte ultraportables</a>. But how can you know what they all do, or what you might want in a new system? Below we explain every single laptop port, past and present, along with photos to help you identify their symbols. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually located along the sides or back of a laptop, these ports help expand functionality and provide connection points for input devices, external drives, networking, and more. Understanding these ports, and knowing which of your peripherals will connect easily&mdash;and which will need adapters&mdash;will help you make better-informed decisions when looking for the perfect laptop to suit your needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our coverage of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html\">best laptops you can buy today</a>, we&rsquo;re careful to note which ports are available. We do the same in our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1787210/best-portable-monitors.html\">best portable monitors</a>, in case you&rsquo;re looking for an on-the-go display to pair with your notebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"audio-jack\">Audio jack</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3.5mm audio jack, also known as a headphone jack, is the most common audio port on modern laptops. Along with inputting and outputting audio, it also allows for connections to the majority of wired headphones and speakers. Some older laptops have two audio jacks that split mic and audio, but current models use the same port for both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Audio Jack Port\" class=\"wp-image-784656\" height=\"1068\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Audio-Jack.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Audio jack laptop port</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some laptop manufacturers have opted not to include the audio jack in recent models. If this is the case, you will need a USB wireless dongle to connect to your wireless headphones and speakers, or you&rsquo;ll need to connect via Bluetooth if your audio gear supports that. Conversely, many wired headphones work via USB rather than analog 3.5mm jacks, and those could also be an option. If you only have wired 3.5mm headphones but no 3.5mm audio jack in your laptop, you&rsquo;ll need to get either a USB or USB Type-C to 3.5mm adapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"displayport-mini-displayport\">DisplayPort/mini DisplayPort</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DisplayPort is a digital display connection used to output video and audio from your laptop to a video display, such as a monitor. While some TVs come with DisplayPort connections, it is more commonly found on PCs and PC monitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally designed to replace VGA and DVI connections between computers and monitors, it has become the most advanced display connection available on laptops today, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/457147/hdmi-vs-displayport-which-display-interface-reigns-supreme.html\">challenging HDMI for display interface supremacy</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest iteration is DisplayPort 2.0 released in 2019, which has an increased bandwidth up to 77.37Gbps. Unlike other connections, DisplayPort allows multiple monitors to be run off of a single connection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, DisplayPort supports both <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html\">AMD&rsquo;s FreeSync and Nvidia&rsquo;s G-Sync technology</a>, allowing for so-called &ldquo;tear-free gaming&rdquo; (so long as your monitor supports these technologies as well). Each iteration of DisplayPort has seen improvements in data rate as well as higher resolution and higher refresh rates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>DisplayPort 1.2: Supports up to 4K resolutions at 60Hz</li><li>DisplayPort 1.3: Supports up to 4K resolutions at 120Hz or 8K resolutions at 30Hz</li><li>DisplayPort 1.4: Supports up to 8K resolutions at 60Hz and supports HDR</li><li>DisplayPort 2.0: Supports 16K resolutions (with HDR) at 60Hz and 10K resolutions (without HDR) at 80Hz</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most laptops nowadays use the smaller, mini DisplayPort connection or use USB Type-C ports to send out DisplayPort signals. Unlike regular DisplayPorts, mini DisplayPorts will need a multi-stream Transport (MST) hub to output to more than one display.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"DisplayPort mini\" class=\"wp-image-784657\" height=\"1078\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DisplayPort-mini.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption><p>DisplayPort mini laptop port</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"dvi\">DVI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DVI (Digital Visual Interface) is used to connect a video source, such as a laptop, to a display, such as an external monitor. It was developed in the late 90s with the aim of replacing analog VGA technology with lossless digital video. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not such a common port on modern laptops, it is still found on many external monitors with full-HD resolutions or lower. A single DVI connection can output up to UXGA 1920&times;1200 resolutions at 60Hz but needs a special dual-link DVI connection to output at higher resolutions.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"DVI Port\" class=\"wp-image-784658\" height=\"1144\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DVI.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>DVI laptop port</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>DVI is often your best option to output video from your laptop to external budget displays that lack more recent connections such as HDMI or DisplayPort. One thing to note, however: DVI connections only support video signals and do not output audio. If you have a laptop with no DVI port, but you want to connect to an external display using DVI, you will need an HDMI-to-DVI or DisplayPort-to-DVI cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ethernet\">Ethernet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethernet ports allow laptops to connect directly into wired networks. While Ethernet ports are becoming less common on laptops due to the proliferation of Wi-Fi, a wired connection via Ethernet is still the most reliable way to connect to high-speed internet. In areas where wireless signals may be weaker, Ethernet allows you to overcome this through a direct connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today&rsquo;s Ethernet is also known as Gigabit Ethernet, meaning the connection speeds are rated at 1Gbps or higher. Ethernet connections are rated by Category (or Cat) type, and the latest Cat 8 standard connection allows for max speeds of up to 40Gbps while maintaining backward compatibility with older category types.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Ethernet Port\" class=\"wp-image-784659\" height=\"1167\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ethernet.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Ethernet laptop port</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Many newer and slimmer consumer laptop models no longer have Ethernet ports, but they can still be found in many business laptops. If your laptop doesn&rsquo;t have an Ethernet port built in, you can purchase a USB-to-Ethernet adapter, or alternatively you can use a docking station.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"hdmi\">HDMI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) is the most common way to connect your laptop to a video display or home entertainment device. Many TVs, external computer monitors, and projectors also have HDMI ports. HDMI connections can transfer both high-definition video and audio digitally from your laptop to an external display. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, several versions of HDMI have been rolled out and despite their differences in capabilities, the physical ports themselves have remained the same between versions. The latest version, HDMI 2.1, released in 2017, allows for a 48Gbps transmission bit rate and supports 4K resolutions at 120Hz or 8K resolutions at 60Hz. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>HDMI 2.1 also offers backward compatibility meaning it can be used with HDMI ports on older devices without the new 2.1 features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"HDMI Port\" class=\"wp-image-784660\" height=\"771\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/HDMI.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>HDMI laptop port</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to HDMI&rsquo;s widespread use, many inexpensive adapters are available to connect HDMI and other ports, such as DVI and USB Type-C. HDMI cannot output to dual displays from a single port, and some laptops are now being sold with mini HDMI ports, meaning you will need an adapter if you wish to use it with regular HDMI (pictured above).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"kensington-lock-slot\">Kensington Lock Slot</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Also known as a K-lock or K-slot, the Kensington Lock Slots are small, reinforced holes commonly found on laptops that are used to attach a physical security lock to your device. It was implemented in consumer laptops beginning in the year 2000. Depending on the laptop model, this lock slot can be found either on the side or back of your laptop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many laptops have a Kensington lock slot built-in, they seldom come with the cable locking mechanism itself. Using a compatible cable lock inserted into the lock slot, the other end of the cable can be attached to a secure location, thereby anchoring the laptop and preventing theft. The lock slot is often marked with a small lock icon next to the opening.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lock Slot\" class=\"wp-image-784661\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Lock-slot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Laptop lock slot</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"sd-card-reader\">SD Card Reader</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The SD card reader slot is primarily used to read memory cards from digital cameras. SD Cards can be hot-plugged and hot-swapped, meaning you can insert and remove them without restarting your laptop. Data transfer speeds vary widely, and depend on what SD cards the reader supports. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>UHS-III SD Cards can theoretically transfer data at rates of up to 624Mbps, but if your SD reader only supports the earlier UHS-I version, you will only be able to transfer your data at the maximum UHS-I speed of 104MBps.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"SD Card Reader Port\" class=\"wp-image-784663\" height=\"893\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SD-Card-Reader.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>SD Card Reader laptop port</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>SD card readers are not available in all laptops, and as modern laptops have become thinner, they are being phased out. However, you can still find new <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/560670/best-laptops-for-video-editing.html\">laptops built for photo and video editing</a> with SD Card Reader slots installed. If your laptop does not have an SD card reader slot, you can easily buy an inexpensive USB adapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"microsd-card-reader\">MicroSD Card Reader</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>MicroSD cards and card readers were introduced by SanDisk in 2005 to accommodate smaller memory cards in mobile phones. Similar to the larger SD card reader, the microSD card reader is meant to read smaller memory cards now most commonly used for external storage in smartphones. MicroSD cards are also hot-pluggable and hot-swappable just like the larger SD cards.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"microSD Card Reader\" class=\"wp-image-784665\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/microSD-Card-Reader.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1138\" width=\"1138\" /><figcaption><p>microSD Card Reader laptop port</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Laptops with limited onboard storage, such as <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html\">some Chromebooks</a>, sometimes utilize microSD cards for additional storage capacity. Every year the storage size of SD and microSD cards increases, with the current largest available consumer models sitting at 1TB. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>MicroSD cards are electrically compatible with large SD cards and with the help of a simple adapter, can be used in laptops that accept SD cards as well. If your laptop does not have a microSD card reader or an SD card reader, you can use a USB adapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"usb\">USB</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>USB (Universal Serial Bus) is the most common expansion port on modern laptops and dates back to 1996. It typically has a rectangular shape and connects to a vast universe of peripherals, such as keyboards, mice, printers, and external hard drives. USB ports come in a variety of types and each has its own distinctive functionalities and characteristics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>USB Type-A is the original 4-pin connector and is differentiated by its generations. Each subsequent generation saw an improvement in both power management and data transfer speeds. All newer generations are backward compatible with older generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>USB 2.0 is usually distinguished by black or gray port colors and offers data transfer speeds of up to 480 Mbps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"USB 2.0 Port\" class=\"wp-image-784667\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/USB-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>USB 2.0 laptop port</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>USB 3.0 (now known as USB 3.1 Gen 1) usually sports blue or turquoise colored ports and can reach a theoretical maximum transfer rate of 5 Gbps, which is 10 times faster than USB 2.0.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"USB 3.0 Port\" class=\"wp-image-784668\" height=\"913\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/USB-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>USB 3.0 laptop port</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest standard of USB Type-A ports is USB 3.1 Gen 2. It looks the same as USB 3.1 Gen 1 but provides a significant increase in data transfer rates of up to 10 Gbps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Type-A, USB Type-B ports and connectors are square-shaped. They are not commonly found on laptops, but many printers, scanners, docking stations, and hubs use these as an input port. While adapters are available, most USB Type-B cables already come with a USB Type-B connector on one end and a USB Type-A on the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"usb-type-c\">USB Type-C</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>USB Type-C is the newly adopted standard connector for most modern laptops and devices, and deserves its own distinct place on this list due to its unique functionality. Owing to its small and narrow footprint, the USB Type-C port can fit on most ultra-thin laptops being manufactured in today&rsquo;s market. This, along with the fact that USB Type-C can accept Thunderbolt connections in the same port, gives it the edge over other USB types.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-best-usb-c-hub-overall\">\n\t\t\t\t\tThe best USB-C hub overall\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"anker-7-in-1-usb-c-hub-a83460a2\">Anker 7-in-1 USB-C Hub (A83460A2)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Anker 7-in-1 USB-C Hub (A83460A2)\" class=\"product-widget__image\" src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31tFIIIvMzL.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZVKTP53?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-3-706969-5-392389-15070&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$34.99 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>USB Type-C ports can support a variety of different standards. Unlike the rectangular-shaped Type-A with a 4-pin connection, the USB Type-C comes with a 24-pin connector allowing it to handle higher currents and faster transfer speeds. The ability to handle higher currents allows for devices to charge in less time using a Type-C connection by providing up to 100W of power. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Type-C devices can support USB 3.1 Gen 2 transfer rates of 10Gbps. If it doubles as a Thunderbolt port (recognized by the lightning bolt icon next to the port), Type-C connections can even produce lightning-fast speeds of up to 40Gbps. Furthermore, it can allow for video-out DisplayPort signals if equipped with alt-mode functionality.&nbsp;That versatility helps <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\">well-equipped USB-C docks and hubs</a> serve as a backbone for laptops with few ports.

While these connections are backward compatible, they will reduce the functionality and transfer rates between USB types.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"micro-usb\">Micro-USB</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;re not likely to see the micro-USB port (and the slightly larger mini-USB port) in modern laptops, but they can still be found in many peripherals and accessories. In fact, not a single laptop in PCWorld&rsquo;s vast inventory of machines has this port, so we&rsquo;re using a photo of a micro-USB B cable instead.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Amazon Basics Micro-USB cable\" class=\"wp-image-784950\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Micro-USC-B-cable.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Amazon</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Micro-USB is generally used for legacy smartphones, low-power tablets such as Amazon Kindles, some external hard drives, and random electronic devices. They most often support USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480 Mbps, but occasionally support USB 3.0, and micro-USB connections can be used interchangeably in both supported ports. USB Type-A and Type-C to micro-USB adapters are available if you wish to connect your supported device to a laptop without a micro-USB port.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"thunderbolt\">Thunderbolt</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thunderbolt is the fastest connection available in today&rsquo;s market. It combines PCIe, DisplayPort, serial signals, and DC power altogether in one port. This allows the Thunderbolt connection to be deployed for a variety of purposes, ranging from peripheral connections to laptop power charging. Thunderbolt ports can often be identified by a small lightning bolt icon next to the port.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Thunderbolt Port\" class=\"wp-image-784671\" height=\"871\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Thunderbolt.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Thunderbolt laptop port</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest versions, Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4, can transfer data at a blazingly fast rate of 40Gbps, which is four times faster than the USB 3.1 gen 2. Even legacy versions such as the original Thunderbolt have transfer rates as high as 10Gbps or Thunderbolt 2 at 20Gbps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A single Thunderbolt 3 or 4 connection is also capable of outputting to two 4K monitors at once thanks to its usage of dual DisplayPort signals. Some newer external graphics cards even come equipped with Thunderbolt ports, allowing for laptops to be connected for high-end gaming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-best-budget-thunderbolt-dock\">\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best budget thunderbolt dock\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"iogear-thunderbolt-3-travel-dock-gtd300\">IOgear Thunderbolt 3 Travel Dock (GTD300)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"IOgear Thunderbolt 3 Travel Dock (GTD300)\" class=\"product-widget__image\" src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31zmgM+JBgL.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>From Thunderbolt 3 onward, the port uses USB Type-C connections and therefore can double as USB Type-C ports. Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2 ports use mini DisplayPort connections, so you will need an adapter if you wish to attach legacy Thunderbolt devices to Thunderbolt 3 or higher. Given Thunderbolt&rsquo;s abundant functionality, the port can also be used as the central hub for a lot of other connections.

It is the main interface between computers and older CRT monitors and even more modern projectors. Since it is analog, VGA is susceptible to signal degradation over longer cable distances and only has a maximum resolution of 640&times;480 with a 60Hz refresh rate. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"VGA Port\" class=\"wp-image-784672\" height=\"1114\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/VGA.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>VGA laptop port</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the larger size of the 15-pin VGA port and the increase in the use of digital video, these ports are mostly being phased out. Laptop manufacturers are producing slimmer laptops nowadays and using HDMI or DisplayPort connections in place of VGA. While you cannot convert VGA to any other display standard (HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort), you can convert any of them to VGA (with a subsequent drop in quality) by using the proper cable or adapter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This article was updated to add links to to various new applicable monitor roundups that take advantage of these technologies.</em></p>\n\nAccessories</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/706969/laptop-ports-symbols-explained.html", "date_published": "2023-05-23 11:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Upgrade to Windows 11 Pro for a discount", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone wants to run the latest tech.
