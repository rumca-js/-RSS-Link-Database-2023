## Show HN: Cosmic – Headless CMS and API toolkit v2.0

<p>Hello HN,<p>I’m Tony, the CEO of Cosmic (YC W19). We just released Cosmic 2.0. This release is the result of two years of dedicated work by our team which we are proud to share with you.<p>Our new website: <a href="https://www.cosmicjs.com">https://www.cosmicjs.com</a><p>Documentation: <a href="https://www.cosmicjs.com/docs">https://www.cosmicjs.com/docs</a>.<p>Sign up for the new Cosmic dashboard (<a href="https://app.cosmicjs.com/signup">https://app.cosmicjs.com/signup</a>). Free plans available.<p>Cosmic is an API-first (headless) CMS that offers a web dashboard to create content and API tools to deliver content to any website or app. Our customers use Cosmic to avoid the pain of building and maintaining their own content management infrastructure. (We originally launched on HN in 2019 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19330262" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19330262</a>)<p>Problem: I started building Cosmic back in 2014. As a full stack web developer working at a web design and development agency, I found it tedious to build each project with the same open-source tech stack (WordPress), performing the same plugin installation, configuration set up, hosting, etc. Plus, I found that we would run into the same issues after a website was finished: clients would blow up their website by installing a rouge plugin, constant battles with bot armies, and other limitations with developing on a monolithic CMS website.<p>Solution: I thought, “wouldn’t it be great to have a single easy-to-use dashboard interface to manage content, and dedicated API endpoints to deliver content to any website or app, regardless of tech stack or device? The result would be a website that is lighter, faster, and more secure.” Then began developing the solution I wanted.<p>Cosmic was born, and it satisfied my needs. I then let others try it. They would build stuff using Cosmic, break stuff, I would fix it, they would break something else, rinse and repeat. Eventually I met others who were willing to work on the problem with me…<p>Cosmic 2.0<p>Fast forward to today, after years of building, talking to customers, getting lots of feedback, and from that learning, building a brand new version of Cosmic that, we as a team, are really proud of. Rebuilt from the ground up, Cosmic 2.0 aims to satisfy the same needs that I had years ago: provide an intuitive dashboard to create content and powerful tools to deliver content to any website or app. Some notable improvements and new features include:<p>1. Overall faster, more responsive dashboard experience.<p>2. New JavaScript SDK <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmicjs/sdk" rel="nofollow">https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmicjs/sdk</a><p>3. Darkmode theme option.<p>4. Stricter Object type modeling and more types including video, audio, color picker, emoji, and more.<p>5. Content folders for better content organization.<p>6. Global search dashboard command palette (Command + k).<p>Along with a new dashboard, we’ve got a brand new website, rebuilt from the ground up using: - Next.js - TypeScript - Tailwind CSS - Content managed by Cosmic (of course! We are dog-fooding our own CMS)<p>Let us know if you have any questions in the comments below!</p>

## Show HN: Accelerated Docker builds on your local machine with Depot (YC W23)
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36046319](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36046319)

<p>Hello HN! We just launched a new feature we built at Depot that accelerates Docker image builds on your local machine in a team environment, and we wanted to share some of the details with you all.<p>The launch blog post: https://depot.dev/blog/local-builds<p>Depot is a hosted container build service - we run fully managed Intel and Arm remote build machines in AWS, with large instance sizes and SSD cache disks. The machines run BuildKit, the build engine that powers Docker, so generally anything you can `docker build`, you can also `depot build`.<p>Most people use Depot in CI, and you could also run `depot build` from your local machine as well. That would perform the build using the remote builder, with associated fast hardware and extra fast datacenter network speeds.<p>But then to download the container back to your local machine, BuildKit would transfer the <i>entire</i> container back for every build, including base image layers, since BuildKit wasn’t aware of what layers already existed on your device.<p>The new release fixes this! To make it work, we replaced the BuildKit `--load` by making the Depot CLI itself serve the Docker registry API on a local port, then asking Docker to pull the image from that localhost registry. The CLI in turn intercepts the requests for layers and fetches them directly using BuildKit’s content API.<p>This means Docker only asks for the layers it needs! This actually speeds up both local builds, where you only need to download changed layers, as well as CI where it can skip building an expensive tarball of the whole image every time!<p>We ran into one major obstacle when first testing: the machine running the Docker daemon might not be the same machine running the `depot build` command. Notably, CircleCI has a remote Docker daemon, where asking it to pull from localhost does not reach the CLI’s temporary registry.<p>For this, we built a "helper" container that the CLI launches to run the HTTP server portion of the temporary registry - since it’s launched as a container, it does run on the same machine as the Docker daemon, and localhost is reachable. The Depot CLI then communicates with the helper container over stdio, receiving requests for layers and sending their contents back using a custom simple transport protocol.<p>This makes everything very efficient! One cool part about the remote build machines: you can share cache with anyone on your team who has access to the same project. This means that if your teammate already built all or part of the container, your build just reuses the result. This means that, in addition to using the fast remote builders instead of your local device, you can actually have cache hits on code you haven’t personally built yet.<p>We’d love for you to check it out, and are happy to answer any questions you have about technical details!<p>https://depot.dev/docs/guides/local-development</p>

## Show HN: File-by-file AI-generated comments for your codebase

<p>My friends and I were complaining about having to decipher incomprehensible code one day and decided to pass the code through GPT to see if it could write easily understandable comments to help us out. It turns out that GPT can but it was still a hassle to generate comments for large files.<p>So we decided to develop a basic web application that automatically integrates with your Github repository, generate comments, create a pull request and send you an email when it is all done.<p>There is definitely a lot more that can be done but we wanted to gain feedback on whether this is a problem that you face too. Do you often find it challenging to understand complex code? Do you have difficulties in writing informative comments? And if so, would you find value in a tool that can automatically generate comments for your code?<p>Really appreciate any feedback and suggestions! Thanks in advance!</p>

## Launch HN: Common Paper (YC W23) – SAFEs for Commercial Contracts
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36043944](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36043944)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage

<p>Hey HN, we’re Ben and Jake, founders of Common Paper (<a href="https://commonpaper.com">https://commonpaper.com</a>). We provide standard, open-source contracts and a platform for getting them signed quickly.  See <a href="https://youtu.be/f7maIapJpU4" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/f7maIapJpU4</a> for an overview, and <a href="https://youtu.be/A1PWjWiheFk" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/A1PWjWiheFk</a> for a demo of sending and signing a contract.<p>I (Jake) was a co-founder of two B2B SaaS companies, RJMetrics (where Ben and I met), and Stitch. Everything about contracts was frustrating, both at those startups and the larger companies that acquired us.<p>Way too often, the contracting process with a customer got adversarial—arguing over whose template to use, emailing Word docs back and forth, huge legal fees, and unpredictable delays that made it hard to know if a deal would ever close.  Then, when we finally got the customer to sign, we had to keep track of all of the promises embedded in the contract.  This is difficult when you have hundreds of customers and contract PDFs full of unstructured text.<p>The breaking point came when one of our customers was acquired by Oracle. They wanted to keep using our product, but had to move from our original contract to the one that Oracle uses. In exchange for this, they were willing to increase the price they were paying from $6,000 to $24,000 per year.<p>It took us 9 months to get the new contract in place, just to enable them to keep using the product. We spent more on attorneys than we gained from the upsell. And there was basically nothing we could do to improve that process as a single company operating in a system where standards don’t exist.<p>Contrast that to the standardization that the SAFE, or Simple Agreement for Future Equity, brought to seed investments, and the potential is obvious. (Past discussion of the SAFE at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33639191" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33639191</a>)<p>If you’re a startup raising money on a SAFE, the process is simple, whether you’re raising $10k from an angel or $1M from a VC. Everyone already uses, or at least is familiar with, the same basic contract.  There are a few variables that change on a deal-by-deal basis, but the transactions are vastly more efficient because everyone is on the same standard contract.<p>If you start with standard contracts, you can build very different software to manage them compared to traditional contracts. Our business model is to provide the standard contracts for free and charge money from companies who use our software to sell to their customers (more on this below).<p>The standard contracts we create are all related to buying and selling B2B software. This includes a non-disclosure agreement, (<a href="https://commonpaper.com/standards/mutual-nda/">https://commonpaper.com/standards/mutual-nda/</a>), sales contract (<a href="https://commonpaper.com/standards/cloud-service-agreement/">https://commonpaper.com/standards/cloud-service-agreement/</a>), SLA, DPA, ToS, etc. The full list is at <a href="https://commonpaper.com/standards/">https://commonpaper.com/standards/</a>.<p>The process for creating and revising the contracts is modeled after an open-source software project, and they are released for free (as in both speech and beer) under the Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license.<p>We have a committee of 40+ attorneys from tech companies and law firms who are analogous to code contributors (<a href="https://commonpaper.com/committee">https://commonpaper.com/committee</a>). An attorney on our team, who you can think about like a maintainer, collects all of their feedback and synthesizes it into a version for release (eg the Design Partner Agreement v1.0). We post the agreements as DOCX, PDF, and HTML on our website and host markdown on Github.<p>Most of the usage of the agreements happens outside of our platform, and we don’t have any visibility into that unless people choose to tell us. However, we do know that thousands of companies have signed the agreements, and millions of dollars worth of deals have been closed on them.<p>Each agreement is split into two sections: the standard terms, which are the same across all instances, and a cover page, with variables that can be customized for a particular company and deal. The latter is basically a schema for each agreement type, and that leads to the fundamental trade-off in how we build our software. We have less flexibility around types of contracts (because we’re focused on the standard agreements, not arbitrary DOCX files), but in exchange, every agreement type has a consistent data model, which means that we can build integrations and features that work across all customers. This gain is huge.<p>For example, we can use the data in the fees section of our standard Cloud Service Agreement to automatically generate invoices and subscriptions using Stripe. Similarly, it’s trivial to use our API (<a href="https://api.commonpaper.com/docs">https://api.commonpaper.com/docs</a>) to check if an active NDA is in place before sharing confidential information or to keep a spreadsheet up to date with the SLA obligations for different customers.<p>Traditional contract management tools are built around adding electronic signatures to documents full of unstructured text and/or creating a custom data model from a particular company’s bespoke contract. There’s no way they can offer features like this without a custom project for each particular contract. It’s basically the difference between custom software and a software product.<p>Part of our feature set overlaps with the traditional tools. We can do things like send a contract to the other side, propose changes, approve, and sign. But our negotiation model is different in that it encourages both sides to keep changes narrowly scoped to the variables in the cover page. That makes it faster both to propose the changes and for each side to understand, and accept or reject, the changes proposed by their counterparty.<p>We believe that, just as with SAFEs in the investment world, the potential efficiency gains and positive side effects of this model are so big that the transition is inevitable. We’d love for you all to try it out and let us know your feedback and suggestions. The agreements are free forever, and our software is free as well until you use it to close deals with 5 customers. <a href="https://commonpaper.com/product/">https://commonpaper.com/product/</a>.<p>We’re interested to hear about any experiences you’ve had with contracts and how you’ve worked with them.  We look forward to your comments!</p>
