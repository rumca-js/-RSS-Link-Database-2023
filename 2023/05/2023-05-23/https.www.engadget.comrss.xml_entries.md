<p>Last August, SoundCloud <a href="https://www.engadget.com/soundcloud-is-laying-off-20-percent-of-its-workforce-121048907.html">cut its workforce by 20 percent</a>, citing &quot;the challenging economic climate&quot; for the layoffs. That's been a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html">common refrain</a> among companies reducing staff in recent years — with companies like Google, Meta, Amazon and more framing layoffs as restructuring or cost cutting measures. Now, SoundCloud says it will be cutting staff by an additional 8 percent, telling staff that the reduction is a &quot;challenging but essential decision to ensure the health of our business and get SoundCloud to profitability this year.&quot;</p><p>That goal was baked into the company's last round of layoffs too, with the 2022 cuts being positioned as putting SoundCloud on &quot;a path to sustained profitability.&quot; This new &quot;headcount reduction&quot; seems to be the next step in that plan, with <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/soundcloud-layoffs-job-cuts-further-investment-profit/">sources telling Billboard</a> that the company hopes to be profitable by Q4. SoundCloud leadership has also reportedly said that it's courting new investors.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although SoundCloud's layoffs follow the same gruesome pattern we've seen across different tech brands recently, the company has actually been slowly reducing staff for some time. In addition to last year's cuts, the company slashed its workforce by 40 percent back in 2017.</p><p>Check out Engadget's look at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html">biggest tech layoffs of 2023</a> for more details.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/soundcloud-will-lay-off-eight-percent-of-its-staff-in-hopes-of-becoming-profitable-204510023.html?src=rss

<p>Microsoft Build 2023 kicked off with an opening keynote from CEO Satya Nadella, followed by two other keynote sessions. Surprising absolutely no one, there was a big focus on AI. While we have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/build-2023/">coverage of all the big news,</a> if you want to hear the updates straight from the source without watching the entire thing, you can check out our supercut below.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest announcement is that Microsoft will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-copilot-ai-panos-panay-interview-150044298.html">soon embed AI deeply into Windows 11</a>. Windows Copilot, which you'll be able to try a preview of next month, can be used in a similar way to Bing AI. So, you can ask it general questions <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html">like you would of the search engine chatbot</a>.

<p>The White House has made responsible AI development a focus of this administration in recent months, releasing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/white-house-unveils-its-blueprint-for-an-ai-bill-of-rights-175912494.html">Blueprint AI Bill of Rights</a>, developing <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework">a risk management framework</a>, committing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-will-invest-140-million-to-launch-seven-new-national-ai-research-institutes-090026144.html">$140 million to found seven new National Academies</a> dedicated to AI research and weighing in on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-white-house-is-examining-how-companies-use-ai-to-monitor-workers-174217114.html">how private enterprises are leveraging the technology</a>.  On Tuesday, the executive branch announced its next steps towards that goal including releasing an update to the National AI R&amp;D Strategic Plan for the first time since 2019 as well as issuing a request for public input on critical AI issues. The Department of Education also dropped its hotly-anticipated report on the effects and risks of AI for students.</p><p>The OSTP's National AI R&amp;D Strategic Plan, which guides the federal government's investments in AI research, hadn't been updated since the Trump Administration (when he gutted the OSTP staffing levels). The plan seeks to promote responsible innovation in the field that serves the public good without infringing on the public's rights, safety and democratic values, <a href="https://www.nitrd.gov/pubs/National-AI-RD-Strategy-2019.pdf">having done so until this point</a> through eight core strategies. Tuesday's update adds a ninth, establishing &quot;a principled and coordinated approach to international collaboration in AI research,&quot; per the White House.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;The federal government plays a critical role in ensuring that technologies like AI are developed responsibly, and to serve the American people,&quot; the OSTP argued in its release. &quot;Federal investments over many decades have facilitated many key discoveries in AI innovations that power industry and society today, and federally funded research has sustained progress in AI throughout the field’s evolution.&quot;</p><p>The OSTP also wants to hear the publics thoughts on both its new strategies and the technology's development in general. As such it is inviting &quot;interested individuals and organizations&quot; to submit their comments to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OSTP-Request-for-Information-National-Priorities-for-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf">one or more of nearly 30 prompt questions</a>, including &quot;How can AI rapidly identify cyber vulnerabilities in existing critical infrastructure systems and accelerate addressing them?&quot; and &quot;How can Federal agencies use shared pools of resources, expertise, and lessons learned to better leverage AI in government?&quot; through the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/">Federal eRulemaking Portal</a> by 5:00 pm ET on July 7, 2023.

## Peloton's revamped fitness app restricts most equipment workouts to new, more expensive tier

<p>Big changes are coming to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pelotons-workout-app-apple-tv-170430595.html">Peloton app</a>. As of today, the software offers three different standalone subscription tiers. To start, there’s a new free option, with no credit card required, that comes with access to more than 50 classes – though live workouts are off the table. It joins Peloton’s existing service, which will be known as App One. For $13 per month, App One grants you access to nine of Peloton’s 16 “modalities,” meaning you can watch the company’s pilates, yoga and outdoor running classes. However, the tier limits you to just three equipment-based cycling, treadmill and rowing classes per month, with scenic and lanebreak variants excluded. For unlimited access to those, you will need to pay for Peloton’s new App+ subscription, which costs $24 per month.</p><p>Effectively, the change means those who used the Peloton App to enjoy the company’s cycling and treadmill on their non-Peloton equipment will need to pay more to keep doing that. If you’re a current annual subscriber, you will continue to have access to all of the classes Peloton offers through its app until your membership renews. At that point, you will need to decide if you want to upgrade to the App+. Even with today’s change, it’s worth noting the Peloton App won’t replace the company’s equipment subscription, which will you will still need to access its classes on your Bike, Tread or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-row-ergometer-rowing-machine-connected-110014923.html"><ins>Row</ins></a> machine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Separately, Peloton is adding tutorials for strength training. The company says the app’s new “Gym” component features “self-paced, whiteboard-style” classes for those who prefer exercising outside of their home. The service will be available in the coming days, with the new App+ tier launching in the US, Canada, Australia, German and UK.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/pelotons-revamped-fitness-app-restricts-most-equipment-workouts-to-new-more-expensive-tier-190522723.html?src=rss

## Netflix starts charging for account sharing in the US

<p>Netflix has been quick to act on its plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-is-about-to-crack-down-on-account-sharing-in-the-us-205918694.html">charge for account sharing</a> in the US. The streaming service is <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/update-on-sharing-may-us">notifying</a> American customers that they'll need to pay $8 per month for viewers outside of the household who want to share the account. As in other countries, you can add one extra member with the Standard plan, and two with the Premium tier. You can convert profiles into paying extra member accounts.</p><p>The company rolled out account sharing in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-is-about-to-crack-down-on-account-sharing-in-the-us-205918694.html">this February</a> after trialing the change in Latin America. You can still watch outside of your home, but you'll have to establish the household's boundaries either manually through a smart TV app (which looks for devices on the same WiFi network) or automatically (based on IP addresses, device IDs and activity). Netflix says it doesn't know your exact location, but it may ask you to verify a device if you're travelling or otherwise using a different connection.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix has been direct about the reasoning behind its initiative. The media giant has pinned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q2-2022-earnings-subscriber-loss-204003713.html">some of its recent financial troubles</a> on users borrowing passwords to effectively get free service. The sharing theoretically converts some of these people into paying customers, even if it also risks sending them into the arms of competitors like Amazon and Disney.</p><p>There have been criticisms of this approach. It could prove a hassle for college students that previously used the family account for in-dorm viewing. And while $8 per month isn't a high price for a streaming service, there are some viewers who may simply drop Netflix altogether. However, it's doubtful the company is going back. It said it was &quot;pleased&quot; with the results from the February launch, suggesting that paid sharing is here to stay.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netflix-starts-charging-for-account-sharing-in-the-us-185133792.html?src=rss

## Universal Music Group partners with Endel for AI-generated wellness soundscapes

<p>Universal Music Group (UMG) is partnering with Endel, an “AI sound wellness company” specializing in personalized algorithmic soundscapes, the companies <a href="https://endel.rockpaperscissors.biz/dispatch/pu/28808">announced</a> today. The partnership aims to let UMG artists create machine-learning-generated sounds for activities like sleep, relaxation and focus. Endel previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/grimes-endel-ai-powered-lullaby-174840113.html">partnered with synth-pop artist Grimes</a> on a lullaby app.</p><p>The record label “will use Endel’s proprietary AI technology to enable UMG artists to create science-backed soundscapes,” the companies said. The soundscapes can contain new music and updated versions of back-catalog tracks. The companies emphasize that the project “will always respect creators’ rights and put artists at the center of the creative process,” adding that musicians and their teams have the final say on the results. UMG and Endel say they’ll announce “the first wave of soundscapes” from the partnership in the coming months.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Endel uses artist stems to make soundscapes “driven by scientific insights into how music affects our mind-state.” The companies describe the collaboration as a way to “provide artists and rights holders new opportunities to generate additional revenue for their catalogs” while letting performers dip their toes into new areas and “support wellness for the listener.” But it’s hard not to see the irony of UMG quickly stomping out AI-generated music that threatens its business model — like when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/copyright-in-spotlight-after-streaming-platforms-pull-ai-generated-drake-song-183513972.html">fake Drake and The Weeknd tracks</a> went viral — while putting out rapturous press releases when it sees a potential profit. (Although, to be fair, cloning artists’ voices without their permission would never fly for long, regardless of UMG’s response.)</p><p>“At UMG, we believe in the incredible potential of ethical AI as a tool to support and enhance the creativity of our artists, labels and songwriters, something that Endel has harnessed with impressive ingenuity and scientific innovation,” said Michael Nash, EVP and Chief Digital Officer at UMG. “We are excited to work together and utilize their patented AI technology to create new music soundscapes — anchored in our artist-centric philosophy — that are designed to enhance audience wellness, powered by AI that respects artists’ rights in its development.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/universal-music-group-partners-with-endel-for-ai-generated-wellness-soundscapes-183951335.html?src=rss

## Comcast launches $20 live TV streaming service with 60 channels

<p>Comcast is launching a live TV streaming service to rival Sling, FuboTV, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV and all the rest. It’s called Now TV and it has something competitors lack, an extremely attractive price tag. Now TV includes 60 live channels and a Peacock subscription all for $20 each month.</p><p>There’s a slight catch. Now TV will only be available to Comcast Xfinity Internet customers and will operate as an add-on to any pre-existing service plan. A bare-bones Comcast cable plan costs $50 to $60 each month and doesn’t include Internet, so this is still a decent bargain.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The platform gives access to 40 premium cable channels, including standouts like AMC, Discovery, A&amp;E, IFC, The History Channel, TLC, Lifetime and many more. It also comes with 20 hours of DVR storage and allows for three simultaneous streams. You also get 20 free ad-supported television (FAST) channels, like NBC News NOW, Sky News and a slew of genre-based channels. The service has some glaring omissions, however, as it doesn’t feature local broadcast TV or sports channels.</p><p>Of course, Now TV also includes a premium, though ad-supported, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-9-million-subscribers-annoucement-171757606.html"><ins>subscription to Peacock,</ins></a> so you can watch the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mrs-davis-review-damon-lindelof-nun-vs-ai-peacock-150006136.html"><ins>deliriously bonkers </ins><em><ins>Mrs. Davis,</ins></em></a> the hangout comedy <em>Grand Crew</em> and nearly 1,000 <em>SNL</em> episodes.</p><p>When the service launches in a few weeks, it’ll be accessible through the Xfinity Stream app and supported gadgets like Xfinity flex, Amazon Fire TV, iOS devices and Android devices. As for why Comcast would undercut competitors here on price, the cable arm of the company has been hit particularly hard by cord cutters, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/comcast-q1-profit-earnings-broadband-advertising-peacock-1235596427/"><ins>losing over 600,000 subscribers</ins></a> in just the first quarter of 2023.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/comcast-launches-20-live-tv-streaming-service-with-60-channels-174058537.html?src=rss

## Sony's ZV-1 II has a wide lens so you can fit your whole face in while vlogging

<p>Sony has <a href="https://pressroom.pixelshift.studio/sony-electronics-announces-newest-ultra-wide-angle-zoom-vlogging-camera-the-zv-1-ii">launched</a> a successor to its popular compact ZV-1 vlogging camera, the ZV-1 II, which addresses a big issue with the past model. Namely, it has a new wider lens that lets you fit your entire face into the frame with e-stabilization turned on, addressing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-zv-1-vlogging-camera-review-162822651.html">biggest complaint</a> I and others had with the ZV-1. It also offers new settings that provide a more cinematic look, but otherwise, the camera is largely a rehash of the previous model.</p><p>As before, the ZV-1 II has a 1-inch (16mm diagonal) stacked BSI sensor borrowed from Sony's RX100 V, just like the original ZV-1. The body is unchanged and the controls are the same, and it has a nice flip-out display as before — but no electronic viewfinder.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Sony's ZV-1 II has a wide lens so you can fit your whole face in while vlogging" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/be830740-f988-11ed-b7ff-341657b4c99c" style="height: 1288px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>The built-in 3-capsule microphone deliver better sound quality than the built-in mics on most cameras, and it has a 3.5mm microphone jack (but no headphone port, sadly) and multi-interface shoe that supports select Sony mics.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest addition is a new 18-50mm (35mm equivalent) f/1.8-4 lens that's wider than the 24-70mm f/1.8-2.8 lens on the past model. With the latter, the ZV-1 was barely wide enough with electronic stabilization off. With e-stabilization enabled, it was effectively too tight for vlogging unless you have super-long arms. The new lens is now equivalent to 23mm with stabilization on, which is wide enough, though just barely.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Sony's ZV-1 II has a wide lens so you can fit your whole face in while vlogging" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/d36bcfc0-f988-11ed-bd60-84b6395b5189" style="height: 1937px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>There are some drawbacks, though. While the ZV-1 had optical stabilization on the lens that was good for handheld shooting (but not vlogging), the ZV-1 II is lacking that function. And of course, you lose 20mm of zoom range, and the new lens is also slower at the 50mm end. So buyers will need to choose between the new model's wider field of view or the longer and faster lens on the original ZV-1.&nbsp;</p><p>Video is largely unchanged, with 4K limited to 30fps despite the fast stacked sensor. While you do get S-Log2 and S-Log3 shooting modes, it only supports 8-bit and not 10-bit video, so the log modes won't considerably improve dynamic range.

## US Surgeon General says social media can pose 'a profound risk' to teens' mental health

<p>US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/youth-mental-health/social-media/index.html"><ins>has stated</ins></a> in an advisory that &quot;we cannot conclude <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/social-media/"><ins>social media</ins></a> is sufficiently safe for children and adolescents.&quot; Murthy argued that the potential harms of social media outweigh the benefits for younger users.</p><p>Citing &quot;a substantial review of the available evidence” on the impact of social media, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf"><ins>the advisory</ins></a> says &quot;there are ample indicators&quot; it can &quot;have a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.&quot; It states that, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media-teens-pew-resaerch-youtube-tiktok-instagram-facebook-twitter-snapchat-tumblr-twitch-164456016.html"><ins>according to Pew Research</ins></a>, as much as 95 percent of US teens aged 13 to 17 use social media while 19 percent said they were on YouTube &quot;almost constantly.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Children and adolescents who spend more than 3 hours a day on social media face double the risk of mental health problems including experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety,&quot; the advisory reads. &quot;This is concerning as a recent survey showed that teenagers spend an average of 3.5 hours a day on social media.&quot;</p><p>The advisory calls on tech companies to take &quot;immediate action to mitigate unintended negative effects&quot; of online interactions. It also asks lawmakers to &quot;strengthen protections to ensure greater safety for children and adolescents interacting with all social media platforms.&quot;</p><p>However, some evidence suggests that social media can be a net benefit for teens. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/survey-teens-social-media-pew-research-193509564.html"><ins>According to a recent Pew Research study,</ins></a> most say they're more connected to their friends through social media. The study indicated that a majority of 13 to 17-year-olds in the US felt that social media provided them with a space to express their creativity, find support and feel more accepted.</p><p>Murthy acknowledged that social media can provide benefits to younger users. However, he has been sounding the alarm bell about youth and teen use of such services for some time.</p><p>In January, he told <em>CNN </em>that 13 was &quot;too early&quot; for young people to be on social media (companies in that space typically don't allow under 13s to use their services without consent from a parent or guardian). “If parents can band together and say you know, as a group, we’re not going to allow our kids to use social media until 16 or 17 or 18 or whatever age they choose, that’s a much more effective strategy in making sure your kids don’t get exposed to harm early,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/29/health/surgeon-general-social-media/index.html"><ins>Murthy told the broadcaster</ins></a>.</p><p>There have certainly been well-documented instances of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-research-instagram-teen-mental-health-slides-003452675.html"><ins>social media negatively impacting teens' mental health</ins></a><ins>.</ins> Still, the advisory is being published at a time when there is a growing appetite among lawmakers for regulating teen use of social media.&nbsp;</p><p>A bill was introduced to the Senate last month that aims to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-bill-would-require-parental-consent-for-teens-to-use-social-media-172601557.html"><ins>block teens</ins></a> from using social media without parental consent (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/utah-passes-laws-requiring-parental-permission-for-teens-to-use-social-media-223302739.html"><ins>Utah</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arkansas-passes-social-media-law-requiring-age-verification-230716388.html"><ins>Arkansas</ins></a> have both passed statewide legislation on that front). A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-group-reintroduces-a-revised-kids-online-safety-act-212117992.html"><ins>separate Senate bill</ins></a> called the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) aims to force social media companies to add more protections for younger users. The bill was reintroduced after it failed to reach the Senate floor last year.</p><p>Critics say such legislation can infringe on the right to privacy and freedom of speech, among other concerns. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/04/27/social-media-ban-for-kids-under-13-isn-t-constitutional/569b8ec0-e4fe-11ed-9696-8e874fd710b8_story.html"><ins>among others</ins></a>, has <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/law-should-not-require-parental-consent-all-minors-access-social-media"><ins>argued</ins></a> that social media parental consent laws deprive both young people and adults of their First Amendment rights. As for KOSA, American Civil Liberties Union senior policy counsel Cody Venzke said the bill's “core approach still threatens the privacy, security and free expression of both minors and adults by deputizing platforms of all stripes to police their users and censor their content under the guise of a ‘duty of care.’”&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-says-social-media-can-pose-a-profound-risk-to-teens-mental-health-170517411.html?src=rss

## The Backbone One PlayStation Edition controller finally arrives on Android

<p>The popular <a href="https://www.engadget.com/backbone-one-ios-gamepad-review-143015385.html">Backbone One</a> is an excellent accessory that brings a controller-like experience to your iPhone or Android device. It was so successful that the company collaborated with Sony last year to build a PlayStation Edition. This model replaces all of the face buttons with the traditional PlayStation controller layout, with a white finish to match. The PlayStation Edition has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/backbone-one-playstation-edition-announced-specs-price-availability-150054365.html">exclusively available for iPhone</a>, until today. Backbone and Sony have collaborated once again to bring the PlayStation Edition variant to Android devices.</p><p>As a refresher, the Backbone One PlayStation Edition is an accessory designed in collaboration with Sony that is the closest you’ll get to having a DualSense controller while on the go. Sony says that it will be detected as a DualSense controller within its own PS Remote Play app. That means you’ll be able to play your PS4 or PS5’s catalog of games with something that looks and feels similar to a standard DualSense controller, regardless of whether you have an iPhone or an Android device. Though, you don’t necessarily need this controller specifically to play your games through PS Remote Play. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mobile-game-controllers-140023505.html">Other controllers will work</a> similarly, just without the special controller detection.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, you’re not exclusively tied to PS Remote Play. The Backbone One will be compatible with other game streaming apps including Xbox Game Pass, Nvidia GeForce Now and Microsoft Luna. The controller accessory will also work with any other games that support standard hardware controllers such as <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>. The Backbone One PlayStation Edition for Android will be available starting today for $99.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-backbone-one-playstation-edition-controller-finally-arrives-on-android-170046670.html?src=rss

## Amazon again accused of breaking labor laws at unionized warehouse

<p>Amazon has been accused again of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-once-again-broke-labor-laws-during-new-york-unionization-drive-nlrb-rules-091134410.html">illegal anti-union behavior</a>. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed a complaint Monday, saying the company changed its policies to squash union support at its only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fails-to-overturn-staten-island-warehouse-vote-to-unionize-064010341.html">unionized warehouse</a> in Staten Island, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-22/amazon-ceo-s-anti-union-comments-broke-law-labor-board-alleges">reported by</a><em>Bloomberg</em>. The complaint says Amazon changed policies to prohibit onsite union meetings while bypassing labor negotiations for providing paid leave for COVID-19 cases, among other violations. The accusations paint a picture of a corporation essentially dismissing the union, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-staten-island-jfk8-warehouse-vote-to-unionize-161459629.html">voted to organize</a> in 2022, as illegitimate — an image that lines up with its CEO’s public comments.</p><p>The NLRB accuses Amazon of changing a policy to prevent unionized workers from accessing the Staten Island warehouse during their time off. In addition, the agency says the company terminated two employees because of their association with the Amazon Labor Union (ALU) and changed its paid-leave policy for COVID-19 cases unilaterally — without negotiating with the workers’ organization.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The complaint also alleges that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy broke federal labor laws by saying unionized employees would be less empowered and have difficulty enjoying direct relationships with supervisors in <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vbGl2ZS8yMDIyLzExLzMwL2J1c2luZXNzL2RlYWxib29rLXN1bW1pdC1jb25mZXJlbmNlI2EtZmFsdGVyaW5nLWVjb25vbXktbGVmdC1hbWF6b24tbGl0dGxlLWNob2ljZS1idXQtdG8tZXhlY3V0ZS1tYXNzLWxheW9mZnMtYW5keS1qYXNzeS1zYWlkIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxZGM5ZmE0Yy1kYTk5LTQ2NjQtOTY5Yy1lMzNhZmIwM2EzODgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdM4sbmp6g1OU76YDOHiREKSd4NDELixgR_oIkNkOxbA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Flive%2F2022%2F11%2F30%2Fbusiness%2Fdealbook-summit-conference%23a-faltering-economy-left-amazon-little-choice-but-to-execute-mass-layoffs-andy-jassy-said">an interview</a> at <em>The New York Times</em> DealBook Summit in December. “That has a real chance to end up in federal courts,” Jassy added about the workers’ establishment of “bureaucratic” unions. Amazon has argued that the union’s establishment should be overturned because of “misconduct.”</p><p>The NLRB complaint describes Jassy’s comments as “interfering with, restraining and coercing employees,” saying his quotes about losing access to managers were an illegal threat. The NLRB filed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/nlrb-says-amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-violated-labor-laws.html">a previous complaint</a> in October following similar anti-union comments from Jassy. “All these <em>Succession</em>-style billionaires should be held accountable for unlawful actions, and that’s what we’re doing,” said ALU attorney Seth Goldstein. “[The complaint] is going to send a strong message to the union-busters and to CEOs like Jassy who think that they can say whatever they want to and they won’t be held accountable.”</p><p>In cases like this, NLRB prosecutors’ complaints are sent to agency judges, whose rulings can be appealed to labor board members in Washington and, if it stretches beyond that, to federal court. But, unfortunately, although the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) allows the independent agency to make employers reinstate wrongly terminated workers and change policies, it can’t issue fines to them (or individual executives like Jassy). So don’t be shocked if this saga makes its way through the courts as Amazon flexes its muscle to try to avoid meaningful consequences and prevent the lone unionized warehouse from sparking a broader movement within the corporation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-again-accused-of-breaking-labor-laws-at-unionized-warehouse-165523220.html?src=rss

## Ford will add AM radio to EVs following concerns over emergency alerts

<p>The next big update to your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-gt-first-drive-video-150011920.html">Ford EV</a> might bring some decidedly old technology. Ford chief Jim Farley has <a href="https://twitter.com/jimfarley98/status/1661024295110463491">revealed</a> that the brand will add AM broadcast radio to its 2023 Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning models through a software update following discussions with politicians about the emergency alert system. It will also be included on all 2024 Ford and Lincoln vehicles, including the previously announced Mustang coupe.</p><p>Ford cut AM radio from its 2023 EVs after data showed that less than 5 percent of customers used it, according to spokesperson Alan Hall. The company was also concerned about interference with the EV system, and was trying to reduce cost and manufacturing challenges. You could still stream AM stations, but conventional broadcasts weren't available.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4b39da35cc384fb28997a90056bc8a24"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">After speaking with policy leaders about the importance of AM broadcast radio as a part of the emergency alert&nbsp;system, we've decided to include it on all 2024 <a href="https://twitter.com/Ford?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Ford</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnMotorCo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LincolnMotorCo</a> vehicles.

They believe AM is &quot;essential&quot; during emergencies, and that removing it could put public safety at risk. A trade group that includes Ford, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, claimed the measure was unneeded as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) can deliver alerts through FM, satellite and streaming.</p><p>This isn't an altruistic gesture, then, and it's unclear how Ford will address potential interference problems. Even so, this may be good news if you live in an area prone to natural disasters. You can buy EVs from Ford knowing you'll get potentially life-saving warnings. This also applies pressure to BMW, Tesla and other vendors that have dropped AM radio in newer cars.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ford-will-add-am-radio-to-evs-following-concerns-over-emergency-alerts-164841361.html?src=rss

## Uber will offer Waymo robotaxi rides and deliveries in Phoenix starting later this year

<p>Beginning later this year, Phoenix area residents and visitors will be able to hail Waymo taxis through Uber, thanks to a new “multi-year” partnership the two companies <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2023/05/waymo-and-uber-partner-to-bring-waymos.html"><ins>announced on Tuesday</ins></a>. The pact will see a “set number” of Waymo vehicles made available to Uber users for rides and deliveries. The announcement comes after Waymo recently doubled its Phoneix service area to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-doubles-service-area-for-its-fleet-of-robo-taxis-163353714.html"><ins>180 square miles</ins></a>. Waymo spokesperson Katherine Barna <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23733547/uber-waymo-robotaxi-phoenix-delivery-autonomous-ridehail"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> the robotaxis the company is making available to Uber users wouldn’t be exclusive to the platform. Phoenix residents can continue to turn to the Waymo One if they want an autonomous ride somewhere.</p><p>“We’re excited to offer another way for people to experience the enjoyable and life-saving benefits of full autonomy,” said Waymo co-CEO <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-steps-down-190610549.html"><ins>Tekedra Mawakana</ins></a>. “Uber has long been a leader in human-operated ridesharing, and the pairing of our pioneering technology and all-electric fleet with their customer network provides Waymo with an opportunity to reach even more people.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Notably, the partnership sees two companies that were once rivals coming closer together. In 2017, Waymo parent company Alphabet <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-23-alphabet-sues-uber-over-waymos-self-driving-car-tech.html"><ins>sued Uber</ins></a> for stealing trade secrets. At the center of that legal battle was Otto, a self-driving truck startup founded by former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski. In 2018, Uber settled with Alphabet four days after the case went to trial. As for Levandowski, he was later <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-27-feds-charge-former-waymo-engineer-stealing-trade-secrets.html"><ins>charged</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-levandowski-sentenced-042932212.html"><ins>convicted</ins></a> of stealing materials from his previous employer. On the last day of his administration, former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anthony-levandowski-uber-pardon-063551985.html"><ins>pardoned Levandowski</ins></a>.</p><p>Tuesday’s announcement only alludes to that history, noting Waymo and Uber “have in their own ways each revolutionized access to mobility.” That’s not surprising. In 2018, <em>The Information</em> reported Uber, following its settlement with Waymo, was open to collaborating with the company. Last year, the two partnered to work <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-freight-waymo-via-long-haul-autonomous-trucking-173218101.html"><ins>together on autonomous trucking</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/uber-will-offer-waymo-robotaxi-rides-and-deliveries-in-phoenix-starting-later-this-year-163435980.html?src=rss

<p>If you can't stand your web browser's default gray look, Google may have just what you're looking for. <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/">The company</a> recently updated Chrome on desktop with a side panel that makes it easier to change the app's theme and color. Click &quot;Customize Chrome&quot; in a new tab and you can browse theme packs or set colors in real time. You can upload custom images, or set a daily rotating background if you crave variety.</p><p>There's no mention of a similar change coming to mobile. The confines of a phone screen wouldn't make this customization as practical as it is on a computer, though, so we wouldn't count on a direct equivalent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Browser customization isn't new, of course. However, you've typically had to dive deeper into the settings to access the feature, even in other Chromium-based browsers. Microsoft's Edge, for instance, requires visiting an appearance section in settings to make similar changes. The Chrome update theoretically encourages more people to give themes and colors a try. That, in turn, may keep them using Chrome instead of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/firefox-can-now-automatically-remove-tracking-from-ur-ls-115228742.html">switching to rivals</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/chrome-makes-it-easier-to-customize-your-browsers-look-160059034.html?src=rss

## The Arturia KeyLab Essential mk3 is full-featured, eco-friendly and reasonably priced

<p>Arturia's <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/hybrid-synths/keylab-essential/">KeyLab Essential</a> series is kind of the sweet spot in its lineup. It has most of the same core features as the company's flagship <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/hybrid-synths/keylab-mkii/overview">KeyLab</a> series, but with a less premium build and a few less hands-on controls. But it's they're also about half the price. The new KeyLab Essential mk3 delivers even better value with more controls, a bigger screen and a more eco-conscious build.&nbsp;</p><p>The mk3 will initially be available in 49- and 61-key varieties, in both black and white finishes. While there was no announcement of an upgraded 88-key model, I wouldn't be surprised if Arturia added one down the line. On the surface the KeyLab Essential mk3 doesn't look terribly different from its predecessor. There's still nine knobs and nine faders on the right that provide immediate access to range of parameters in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-4-soft-synth-vst-free-update-160036317.html">Arturia's softsynths</a>. But there are also control scripts for a number of popular DAWs, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-new-ableton-push-is-an-mpe-enabled-standalone-music-production-powerhouse-081118260.html">Ableton Live</a>  that allow you to do think like mix tracks using the faders or stop and start recordings.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The one immediately noticeable difference is the much larger screen in the middle of the keyboard. It should make navigating presets in Analog lab and other Arturia instruments much easier. There's also four contextual button below it allowing for more control over your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturias-augmented-brass-plugin-is-built-for-synthwave-and-sci-fi-scores-150043349.html">plugins</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Arturia also expanded the controls at your disposal, including adding a second bank for the eight pads so, at least with a bit of work, you can take advantage of a full 16 pad drum rack in Live. There's also new scale and chord modes with presets, as well as a hold function and an arpeggiator. The company also upgraded the pedal input to allow for use with an expression pedal instead of just sustain. The software bundle included (which was already pretty great) has been expanded to include Native Instruments The Gentleman, Loopcloud and Melodics, in addition to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-11-daw-hands-on-review-upgrades-explained-160047192.html">Ableton Live Lite</a>, Analog Lab V and UVI Model D.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly Arturia has committed to lessening its environmental impact by making the KeyLab Essential mk3 out of at least 40 percent recycled plastic and moving to 100 percent recyclable packaging. And despite all this, the keyboards are actually significantly cheaper than the mk2 models. The 61-key KeyLab Essential mk3 is $269 (down from $320 for the mk2), while the 49-key version of the mk3 is only $219 (down from $269).&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-arturia-keylab-essential-mk3-is-full-featured-eco-friendly-and-reasonably-priced-151520351.html?src=rss

<p>Unlike Meta, Microsoft doesn't need to change its name to prove it's committed to an entirely new tech platform: It's doing so through action. After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html">debuting its AI-infused Bing search engine </a>earlier this year, the company unveiled the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-365-copilot-uses-ai-to-automate-everyday-tasks-in-multiple-apps-151133434.html">Microsoft 365 Copilot for Office apps</a>. And even before those consumer reveals, Microsoft delivered an AI tool for developers in 2021 with <a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/">GitHub Copilot</a>. Today at its Build developer conference, Microsoft is making the inevitable next step: It's making AI an integral part of Windows 11.</p><p>The new Windows Copilot tool lives in the Windows sidebar and, just like Bing's AI chat, you can use it as a super-powered search engine by typing in general questions. But true to its name, it's also deeply integrated with Windows. You can ask it to accomplish tasks within the OS — like turning on the night light mode, or changing your desktop background — without fishing around for specific settings. Windows Copilot can also function as a genuine virtual assistant by summarizing documents, or launching a photo app to accomplish a few edits before sending it off to a group of your coworkers. Cortana would never.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Panos Panay, Corporate Vice President for Surface Computing demonstrates the new Microsoft Surface Studio computer at a live event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, October 26, 2016. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/01f8cb60-f8d8-11ed-bcb3-45a83b7ddf53" /><figcaption>Microsoft CVP Panos Panay introducing the Surface Studio.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lucas Jackson / reuters</div></figure><p>&quot;I think about Windows and the role of AI as such an opportunity,&quot; said Panos Panay, Microsoft Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer, in an interview with Engadget ahead of Tuesday’s launch. &quot;We have hundreds of millions of people [using Windows], bringing the power of AI to Windows 11 gives you the opportunity to not only get more creative and get more productive, but ultimately just let every Windows user become a power user.&quot;</p><p>Windows Copilot, which will be available to preview in June, also has the potential to reach far more users than the revamped Bing. The company's search engine clearly received plenty of buzz thanks to AI — Microsoft said it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bing-crossed-100-million-daily-active-users-080138371.html">hit 100 million daily active users</a> a month after the AI chat feature launched — but <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/desktop/worldwide">according to StatCounter</a>, Bing has also lost market share over the past few months. It hit 7.2 percent in April, down from a recent high of 9.92 percent last October.</p><p>That's not entirely surprising, though. Microsoft's battle against Google has always seemed like a hopeless endeavor. The company launched its first attempt, MSN Search, in 1998 soon after Google arrived, and amid Yahoo's dominance as the go-to web portal. MSN Search turned into Live Search, which ultimately evolved into Bing in 2009.</p><p>Microsoft has always been a company that's dabbled in search, but it's not a <em>search company</em>. But Windows is another matter entirely. It's a product with a devoted user base, many of whom have decades of experience with the OS. <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25ld3MubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9ieXRoZW51bWJlcnMvZW4vd2luZG93c2RldmljZXMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ2NTU4ZDAyLTk2ZjItNDkzMC1iOGJmLWUxNjJmOTRkNGRkOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfo_7DgfZwrKPrNQXgtGuekZSjfjdOhpx3bMTjLKmJMf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.microsoft.com%2Fbythenumbers%2Fen%2Fwindowsdevices">According to Microsoft</a>, there are over 1.4 billion<em>&nbsp;</em>monthly active devices running Windows 10 or 11. (And of course, that doesn't include the PCs running older Windows versions.) Microsoft previously tried to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-bing-ai-windows-11-taskbar-140056212.html">bring Bing's AI capabilities into the Windows taskbar in February</a>, but that ultimately just amounted to a shortcut that launched Bing's AI chat in the Edge browser. Windows Copilot actually weaves AI into the core Windows 11 experience.</p><p></p><section><img alt="Windows Copilot helping with coding" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/80b711f0-f973-11ed-9d9f-7d0a506f9bee" /></section><p>&quot;There's so much depth in this product from the '90s on,&quot; said Panay. &quot;Our job is to responsibly, of course, push it forward to users that need both the past and need to get to the future [...] We have so many kinds of users that use Windows in its simplest form, like browsing, Mail, and Office [...] And then we've got the hardcore devs who get right down to the depth of the product. And I think both are so vital to the platform. But now I think every developer can move forward as an AI developer and every user can be a power user on Windows. I think it just makes Windows that much better.&quot;</p><p>Windows Copilot is currently a text-only tool, but Panay envisions it evolving into something you can interact with on your own terms. It has the potential to be the powerful voice assistant that Cortana, the Siri competitor Microsoft pushed for years, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cortana-shutdown-harman-kardon-invoke-ios-android-191700426.html">never amounted to</a>. (And to be fair, pretty much every virtual assistant ended up being a disappointment. Siri remains confounding and inaccurate, while Google's Assistant is mainly useful for preemptively delivering information, rather than dealing with voice commands.)</p><figure><img alt="Windows Copilot choosing music in Spotify" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/80b6eae0-f973-11ed-abff-5aa7b1c8ba54" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>The simple, text-based approach to AI also makes sense for Microsoft. For many users, Windows Copilot will be the first time they've interacted with any sort of generative AI product. Better to let general users warm up with a few text strings before overwhelming people with voice commands. And hopefully by the time Microsoft adds voice support, it'll be closer to the <em>Star Trek</em> computer than the frustrating assistants of yore. (I'm dreaming of the day when I can shout at my computer to look up information as I'm writing feverishly on deadline, or ask it to transcribe and summarize a meeting.)</p><p>Windows Copilot, just like Bing Chat, will also support the same third-party plugins that OpenAI's ChaptGPT uses. That means any developer will be able to easily connect their apps to AI, an essential move to make these products more useful. Every software platform needs a thriving third-party ecosystem to survive — just think of what iOS or Android would be like if you were stuck using only Apple or Google's apps.</p><p>&quot;AI is going to be the single largest driver of innovation for Windows in the years to come,&quot; said Panay. &quot;It's going to change the way you work, change your interaction models to make it easier. It's going to understand so much about what you need.&quot;</p><figure><img alt="Windows Copilot sending an edited images to a Teams group" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/80b62790-f973-11ed-afd6-f1dfb9450ea6" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Panay stressed that Microsoft is also focused on making your AI interactions secure and private. Windows Copilot could end up juggling some sensitive information if you start asking questions about specific health questions, for example. A potentially bigger concern is misinformation: Windows Copilot and Bing Chat can answer your questions confidently, but it may not always be accurate. And it's a bigger problem than standard web searches since it's unclear where AI chatbots are pulling information from.</p><p>&quot;We have to approach AI with innovation but also optimism,&quot; Panay said when I asked about how Microsoft is planning to deal with AI misinformation. &quot;To your point, we have to prioritize both people’s safety and privacy. Also, at the end of the day, if you do it in a frame of humility, where we're always learning, this is going to be vital to your point.&quot;</p><p>It's clear that Microsoft still has plenty to learn from Windows Copilot. The preview period, which kicks off next month, is a chance for the company to see how it's used in the wild, and to make adjustments before it's officially released. Panay says that the Bing team is already working to make sure its results come from grounded references, and that they're also holding to Microsoft's responsible AI standards.</p><figure><img alt="Microsoft CVP Shilpa Ranganathan" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/02276000-f8d9-11ed-bffc-50b4fee8ac1e" /><figcaption>Microsoft CVP Shilpa Ranganathan</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>According to Shilpa Ranganathan, a Microsoft Corporate Vice President leading the Windows team, the company has been talking a lot about how Copilot results are displayed, as well as communicating the uncertainty of some answers to customers. “We're going to build it into the experience as a learning experience for us as well […] I don't want to take a path that allows us to lose trust with customers,” she said. “We believe that's most important. I'd rather say, hey, we're not 100 percent sure. Help us make this better or if this didn't help you, I would like feedback now so that we never show this to another customer again.”</p><p>Panay hopes to get to a point where &quot;as a product maker, I have the confidence that what we're handing to our customers is exactly what they need when we launch into the full availability [of Windows Copilot].&quot; He added, &quot;It's about humility. If you give it time and the right innovation, then we can get to that point of creating the guardrails needed to keep it safe and remove the misinformation.&quot;</p><p>Given the state of the web today, where less reputable websites employ a variety of SEO tricks to rank higher in search results, it’s unclear if we’ll ever be truly rid of AI misinformation. The next content war will be entirely focused on websites vying for placement within AI search results. The problem for users is that it’ll be harder to tell if bad information is coming from a seemingly reputable source, rather than an obviously scammy website filled with junk content.</p><p>Windows Copilot has the potential to fundamentally reshape the way we use Windows. But hopefully, it won’t erode user trust in the process.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-copilot-ai-panos-panay-interview-150044298.html?src=rss

## AI is headed to the Microsoft Store on Windows

<p>As Microsoft unveiled more of its plans for AI domination at its Build developer conference today, no aspect of its business will be left untouched by AI. In addition to bringing its &quot;Copilot&quot; to Windows 11 and Edge, the company also shared details on how it will be infusing the Store with AI, beginning with the new AI Hub.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a &quot;new curated section in the Microsoft Store where we will promote the best AI experiences built by the developer community and Microsoft,&quot; the company said in a press release. It will use this area to &quot;educate customers on how to start and expand their AI journey, inspiring them to use AI in everyday ways to boost productivity, spark creativity and more.&quot; Examples include apps like Luminar Neo, Descript, Podcastle, Copy.ai, Kickresume, Play.ht and other services that let users tap AI to help them create content.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Store will also get AI-generated review summaries that takes feedback left by other users on apps and games and generates a concise rundown of what was said. This way, people won't have to sift through the &quot;thousands of reviews,&quot; that Microsoft says some popular apps have.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're a Windows Insider, you'll be able to try out a new feature in preview that will restore your Store app icons when you're transitioning to a new Windows 11 device. You'll have to be moving from a Windows 10 or 11 setup to begin with, and when you switch over, icons for your Store apps will &quot;automatically get restored right where [you] had them — on the Start menu and Taskbar.&quot;</p><p>Developers will also be getting some AI support, like automatically generated keywords and suggested Search Tags in the Partner Center. This will use AI to &quot;consumer your metadata, as well as other signals, and help you improve the discoverability of your app in the Microsoft Store search results.&quot; The company is also adding the ability to list your app in multiple categories.</p><p>Microsoft Store Ads are also expanding in a few ways. First, they'll be added to search results on Bing starting next month, so people using their browsers to look for stuff will also be aware of relevant Windows apps. Next month, they'll also be reaching outside the US market to more than 150 regions around the world. Developers will also get the option to display rich advertising in the spotlight section of the Store.</p><p>Most of the consumer-facing features announced for the Microsoft Store today will be available &quot;soon,&quot; and more specific timeframes have yet to be shared. Still, it's clear the company is intent on bringing AI to every part of its business and all its products and the onslaught is nigh.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai-is-headed-to-the-microsoft-store-on-windows-150035716.html?src=rss

## Microsoft is helping developers build their own ChatGPT-compatible AI copilots

<p>Microsoft has a lot of news at this year's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-the-microsoft-build-keynotes-here-starting-at-12pm-et-023009440.html">Build conference</a> around its AI &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-confirms-365-copilot-ai-will-be-natively-integrated-into-edge-150007852.html">copilots</a>&quot; for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-copilot-ai-panos-panay-interview-150044298.html">Windows 11</a> and other products, but it wants third-party developers in on the action too. The company announced that it has expanded its AI plugin ecosystem and provided a framework for building AI apps and copilots. At the same time, it's adopting the same open plugin standard that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpts-new-plugins-will-deliver-real-time-stats-182900388.html">OpenAI uses for ChatGPT</a> to ensure it'll work alongside its Windows 11, 365 and other copilots.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft introduced the idea of copilots nearly two years ago. Those are applications that use AI and LLMs (large language models) to help users with complex cognitive tasks like writing sales pitches, generating images and more. For example, ChatGPT on Bing is actually a copilot, and Microsoft has also launched copilots for Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Security, among others.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now, it's adding features that let developers build their own using new &quot;plugins&quot; that allow copilots to interact with other software and services. &quot;You may look at Bing Chat and think this is some super magical complicated thing, but Microsoft is giving developers everything they need to get started to go build a copilot of their own,&quot; said Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott. &quot;I think over the coming years, this will become an expectation for how all software works.&quot;</p><figure><img alt="Microsoft wants developers to build their own AI Co-pilots and plugins " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/8ff91af0-f95f-11ed-bfff-0e49ac648e89" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>In addition, Microsoft said it's adopting the same open plugin standard used by Open AI so that all of Microsoft's copilots can potentially work with ChatGPT. &quot;That means developers can now use one platform to build plugins that work across both business and consumer surfaces, including ChatGPT, Bing, Dynamics 365 Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot and Windows Copilot,&quot; it wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of that platform, Bing is adding plugin support for third-party companies including Instacart, Kayak, Klarna, Redfin and Zillow. That's on top of those <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apps-and-services-for-new-graduates-130003658.html">previously announced</a> by Open AI including OpenTable and Wolfram. Developers can also extend Microsoft 365 Copilot using ChatGPT and Bing plugins, as well as Teams message extensions and Power Platform connectors. Developers will also be able to build their own plugins with the Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Microsoft announced that Azure AI Content Safety is now in preview. It's designed to ensure copilots avoid creating outputs that are &quot;biased, sexist, racist, hateful, violent&quot; or encourage self-harm, said Microsoft product manager Sarah Bird. The models detect inappropriate content across images and text, then flag them and assign severity scores so that human moderators can see anything that requires urgent action. &quot;It’s part of the safety system that’s powering the new Bing... [and] we're now launching it as a product that third-party customers can use,&quot; said Bird.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-helping-developers-build-their-own-chatgpt-compatible-ai-copilots-150029815.html?src=rss

<p>There are vanishingly few places in Microsoft's business ecosystem that remain untouched by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-openai-investment-expansion-152302151.html">January's OpenAI deal</a>, with GPT-4 backed chatbot and generative capabilities coming to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-365-copilot-uses-ai-to-automate-everyday-tasks-in-multiple-apps-151133434.html">Office products</a> like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-could-show-off-ai-powered-versions-of-word-and-outlook-this-march-153514888.html">Word and Excel</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-begins-making-bing-chat-ai-searches-available-to-everyone-102506412.html">Bing Search</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-ai-copilot-184033427.html">integrated directly into the Edge browser</a>. During the Microsoft Build 2023 conference on Tuesday, company executives clarified and confirmed that its 365 Copilot AI — the same one going into Office — will be &quot;natively integrated&quot; into the Edge browser.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft 365 Copilot essentially takes all of your Graph information — data from your Calendar, Word docs, emails and chat logs — and smashes them together, using the informatic slurry in training an array of large language models, to provide AI-backed assistance personalized to your business.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;You can type natural language requests like 'Tell my team how we updated the product strategy today,'&quot; Lindsay Kubasik, Group Product Manager, Edge Enterprise wrote in a Tuesday blog post. &quot;Microsoft 365 Copilot will generate a status update based on the morning’s meetings, emails and chat threads.&quot;</p><p>By integrating 365 Copilot into the browser itself, users will be able to request additional context even more directly. &quot;As you’re looking at a file your colleague shared, you can simply ask, 'What are the key takeaways from this document?'” and get answers from 365 Copilot in real-time. Even on-page search (ctrl+F) is getting smarter thanks to the deeper integration. The company is also incorporating the same open plugin standard launched by OpenAI, ensuring interoperability between ChatGPT and 365 Copilot products.&nbsp;</p><p>But it's not ready for rollout just yet and there's no word on when that will change. &quot;Microsoft 365 Copilot is currently in private preview,&quot; a Microsoft rep told Engadget. &quot;Microsoft 365 Copilot will be natively integrated into Microsoft&nbsp;Edge, and we will have more to share at a later date.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Microsoft's digital co-working product, Edge Workspaces, will be moving out of preview altogether in the coming months, Kubasik noted. Workspaces allows teams to share links, project websites and working files as a shared set of secured browser tabs. Furthermore, the company is &quot;evolving&quot; its existing work experience into Microsoft Edge for Business. This will include unique visual elements and cues — which should begin rolling out to users today — along with &quot;enterprise controls, security, and productivity features&quot; designed to help keep remote workers' private lives better separated from their work lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The company recognizes the need for &quot;a new browser model that enhances users’ privacy while maintaining crucial, enterprise grade controls set at the organizational level,&quot; Kubasik wrote. &quot;Microsoft Edge for Business honors the needs of both end users and IT Pros as the browser that automatically separates work and personal browsing into dedicated browser windows with their own separate caches and storage locations, so information stays separate.&quot;</p><p>Microsoft Edge for Business enters preview today on managed devices. If your organization isn't already using the Edge ecosystem, fear not, a preview for unmanaged devices is in the works for the coming months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-confirms-365-copilot-ai-will-be-natively-integrated-into-edge-150007852.html?src=rss

## Windows 11 is getting better live captions and Bluetooth LE audio support

<p>It'll be some time before we have a full picture of what the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-to-reportedly-focus-on-security-and-ai-in-next-version-of-windows-201316103.html">next version of Windows</a> looks like, but that's not stopping Microsoft from rolling out a few updates to Windows 11 amid this year's Build developer conference. Today the company announced a list of feature updates for the operating system focusing on privacy, security and accessibility. Although  most of the new tools are aimed at businesses and IT departments, there are some handy features average users may want to know about.</p><p>To start, Microsoft says that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-bluetooth-audio-low-energy.html">Bluetooth Low Energy Audio</a> is coming to compatible devices, starting with the May 2023 non-security preview release. The company said its working with Intel and Samsung to bring the audio standard to the PC ecosystem for the first time, specifically calling out the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review-160057740.html">Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> as a potentially compatible set of earbuds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Speaking of audio content, you'll be able to understand more of it than ever. Starting this week, live captions for Windows 11 will support 10 new languages, including simplified and traditional Chinese, Danish, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portugueses and Spanish.</p><p>Most of the update focuses on &quot;new and improved features for businesses,&quot; but there's still one last item you might want to pay attention to: the glanceable VPN icon.

<p>ChatGPT no longer needs to rely on its own models or plugins to provide information to users: Microsoft has announced Bing Search is integrating into ChatGPT to provide more relevant — and potentially newer — responses. Bing will act as the &quot;default search experience,&quot; allowing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-now-has-an-official-iphone-app-181454446.html">ChatGPT</a> to pull answers from the internet and provide citations.</p><p>Microsoft and OpenAI have worked together closely over the last few months, with Bing, itself, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-confirms-bing-runs-on-the-new-gpt-4-model-184121316.html">running on GPT-4</a> (with some tailoring for searches). Bing works by displaying responses in detailed or summary form and sources facts and suggestions with footnotes of sorts — features it can bring to ChatGPT to, possibly, provide more precise information. Previously, ChatGPT relied solely on individual plugins to access any recent information.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other new Bing updates are plugin-centric, including a single platform for developers to create and submit them for ChatGPT, Bing, Microsoft 365 Copilot and more. Bing is adding a slew of companies to its in-chat plugin options, such as Expedia, Zillow and Klarna, for targeted communication on topics like travel and shopping. The common plugin platform is also being natively integrated into Microsoft Edge — where Bing is already built-in.</p><p>The exact timeline for each of these developments isn't entirely clear beyond Bing's immediate integration into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-chatgpt-plus-subscription-205027758.html">ChatGPT for Plus subscribers</a>. According to Microsoft, free ChatGPT accounts will be able to access Bing through a plugin &quot;soon,&quot; and company plugin experiences will become available in the &quot;coming weeks.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bing-search-is-coming-to-chatgpt-150001606.html?src=rss

## Binance reportedly mixed customer funds with company revenue at a US bank

<p>Cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/binance/">Binance</a> reportedly mixed its revenue with customer funds at a US bank in 2020 and 2021. A source said to have direct knowledge of company finances told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/crypto-binance-money/"><em>Reuters</em></a> that commingling happened almost daily in Binance accounts at Silvergate Bank and concerned sums that ran into the billions.</p><p>The news agency said it reviewed records showing that, in February 2021, Binance mixed $20 million from a corporate account with $15 million from one into which customer funds were placed. <em>Reuters </em>noted that it found no evidence of client funds being stolen or lost. Still, under US financial regulations, customer money must be kept separate from business revenue.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Binance has denied commingling customer funds and its revenue. “These accounts were not used to accept user deposits; they were used to facilitate user purchases” of cryptocurrencies, Binance spokesperson Brad Jaffe told <em>Reuters</em>. “There was no commingling at any time because these are 100 percent corporate funds.” Jaffe added that users weren't depositing funds when they sent money to the account, but instead were purchasing BUSD, a stablecoin issued by Binance and Paxos that's pegged to the US dollar.</p><p>However, in late 2020 and during 2021, Binance's website is said to have stated that customer dollar transfers were "deposits" that were credited to trading accounts in BUSD. The site also reportedly informed users that they'd be able to "withdraw" deposits in USD. Former US regulators suggested to <em>Reuters </em>that the language "created the expectation that clients’ funds would be safeguarded in the same way as traditional cash deposits."</p><p>Binance is already in hot water with US authorities. In March, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crypto-giant-binance-charged-with-violating-us-trading-and-derivatives-laws-170817954.html">accused the company</a> of operating in the US illegally and said it had broken several financial laws. In its complaint (<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/8351/%20enfbinancecomplaint032723/download">PDF</a>), the CFTC said Binance had "commingled funds." The agency is seeking permanent trading and registration bans against the defendants, who include Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=46b325c0-22ee-4002-8619-163c4534e02a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Binance&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0NmIzMjVjMC0yMmVlLTQwMDItODYxOS0xNjNjNDUzNGUwMmEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluYW5jZS5jb20vZW4vYmxvZy9mcm9tLWN6L2N6cy1yZXNwb25zZS10by10aGUtY2Z0Yy1jb21wbGFpbnQtMjQwODkxNjQ5MzAwNTg5MDI4MiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFiNzI1ZjYtMzVmOC00MDg3LWFkZjEtOTAyMmU0MGYzNDRlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWBcjPa2gp-Fe6tyn3-cZw7Wu-7fpBvwp2kL2Ghx34Ga&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.binance.com%2Fen%2Fblog%2Ffrom-cz%2Fczs-response-to-the-cftc-complaint-2408916493005890282">In a blog post</a>, Zhao claimed that Binance blocks US users on several bases, including nationality, IP address (including common VPN access points) and mobile carrier.</p><p>Earlier this month, reports suggested the Justice Department was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crypto-giant-binance-is-reportedly-facing-us-probe-for-violating-russian-sanctions-094505840.html">investigating the company</a> over potential violations of sanctions imposed on Russia.

Some of the parts will be made in American facilities, including a key Broadcom manufacturing base in Fort Collins, Colorado.</p><p>The companies didn't say which products would use the 5G tech, but the arrangement isn't necessarily limited to the iPhone. Apple is believed to have started work on in-house 5G <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-in-house-cellular-modem-045611093.html">in 2020</a>, a year after buying the majority of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-apple-buys-intel-smartphone-modem-business.html">Intel's phone modem business</a>. The company hasn't been shy about its plans, as it has recruited 5G developers and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-06-apple-san-diego-qualcomm.html">set up shop in Qualcomm's hometown</a> of San Diego. It also established a wireless-focused office in Munich.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rumors suggest Apple's 5G modems will first reach shipping products in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wireless-chips-iphone-to-replace-broadcom-qualcomm-143010106.html">late 2024 or early 2025</a>. Neither Apple nor Broadcom has confirmed this, but Qualcomm <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/qualcomm-ceo-says-planning-for-apple-to-make-own-iphone-modems-from-2024-.html">told <em>CNBC</em></a> in March it assumes it won't provide iPhone modems in 2024.</p><p>This could be a significant blow to Qualcomm. While the company has diversified its chipmaking with in-car tech and low-power hardware, it's still heavily dependent on cellular modem sales and counts Apple as <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=dc008fcb-e3da-4d5b-bfcf-3ffc75d29fd0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Motley+Fool&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkYzAwOGZjYi1lM2RhLTRkNWItYmZjZi0zZmZjNzVkMjlmZDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9vbC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nLzIwMjIvMDkvMjgvMS1iaWctcmVhc29uLXF1YWxjb21tLW5vLWxvbmdlci1mZWFycy1sb3NpbmctYXBwbGUvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwNTVmMDlhOC02MzljLTQxMDItOWUyOS1hOTkzNzc4YThkZTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZy9qbAFkVwPmK-kPlE1TxC5_b_tuw_etU8hQe941IF2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2022%2F09%2F28%2F1-big-reason-qualcomm-no-longer-fears-losing-apple%2F">one of its largest customers</a>.

The company has long tried to reduce its dependency on third parties, most notably switching to its own CPUs starting with the A4-based iPad in 2010. While Apple may need Broadcom's help, it won't be closely tied to Qualcomm's hardware release schedule — and might not risk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-01-qualcomm-reveals-revenue-from-apple-settlement.html">expensive patent disputes</a>, either.

## Moog celebrates 70th anniversary with musical web app

<p>It’s hard to believe, but iconic <a href="https://moog.hummingbirdmedia.com/moog-celebrates-70th-anniversary--return-of-iconic-minimoog-model-d-with-virtual-experience-exploring-generations-of-electronic-music"><ins>synth manufacturer Moog is turning 70.</ins></a> Synthesizers didn’t become mainstays in popular music until the 1970s, but Bob Moog started manufacturing and selling theremins in 1953, with actual synths following in 1963. To celebrate the anniversary, the company <a href="https://minimoogmodeld.com/"><ins>launched a web app</ins></a> filled with interactive experiences for music historians and casual fans alike.</p><p>The app places a distinct focus on the company’s iconic Model D synthesizer, which was first released in 1970 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moog-model-d-170040518.html"><ins>recently reissued for $5,000.</ins></a> To that end, there’s a jukebox with nearly 50 of the most influential songs that feature the synthesizer, including disco, reggae, hip-hop, pop and more. The theater page goes a step further by showing a full range of videos of the 50-year-old synth in action, with both live stage performances and in-studio sessions. The archives section is for true historians, with interactive information chronicling the entire history of the Model D and the people who designed it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>History is nice and all, but synthesizers are made to be played. The app’s practice room let you do just that, choosing from famous leads, bass sounds and percussion sounds via a faithful digital recreation of the Model D. You can fool around with sounds, sure, but the app even lets you save and share original recordings using riffs from famous songs as a starting point. These creations can only be around a minute long. For the ultimate digital Model D experience, there’s a $30 app for iOS devices, though it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moog-ios-mac-synth-app-sale-free-plugin-165725712.html"><ins>sometimes goes on sale. </ins></a></p><p>Finally, the app includes a couple of quirky little add-ons. You can print out a PDF for making your own Minimoog decoration, so long as you have enough tape. The Instagram filter, codenamed Face Synth, quite literally turns your face into a musical instrument. Use facial expressions and body movement to trigger the Model D’s control parameters. The web app’s available today, so have at it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/moog-celebrates-70th-anniversary-with-musical-web-app-140043922.html?src=rss

<p>Bluesky, the Jack Dorsey-backed decentralized Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-backed-bluesky-is-having-a-moment-133039184.html"><ins>alternative</ins></a>, isn’t even out of beta yet but it’s already drawing the attention of more mainstream platforms. Now, Flipboard is adding Bluesky to its news reading app so users can browse their feeds alongside the app’s curated magazines.</p><p>The update is part of a broader effort by the company to embrace the growing crop of decentralized social media platforms in the wake of Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter. The company released a similar integration <a href="https://www.engadget.com/flipboard-is-leaning-into-mastodon-and-away-from-twitter-160036103.html"><ins>with Mastodon</ins></a> earlier this year, and will soon add <a href="https://pixelfed.org/"><ins>PixelFed</ins></a>, an open source Instagram alternative, to its app as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At a basic level, the changes make Flipboard an increasingly useful utility for people who want to keep up with the happenings on decentralized platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky. Flipboard, which has long been praised for its design, could also serve as a more intuitive way to browse newer services that are sometimes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternatives-mastodon-223221883.html"><ins>criticized</ins></a> for being confusing to newcomers. It could also help increase the visibility of posts on Bluesky, which is still limiting new sign-ups, as users can “flip” content from their Bluesky feeds into Flipboard magazines.</p><p>But for Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, embracing these upstart social platforms — sometimes collectively referred to as <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/leaving-twitters-walled-garden"><ins>the Fediverse</ins></a> — is also a more fundamental shift. McCue, an early Twitter advisor and board member, has become <a href="https://twitter.com/mmccue/status/1656685483420778498"><ins>disillusioned</ins></a> with the company he once advised. He now believes that decentralized platforms, and the protocols that power them, will define the future of social media just as closed platforms like Twitter and Facebook did more than a decade ago.</p><p>“I was one of the early people helping to build the business model, and was a big believer in Twitter, and I think it's very sad,” McCue says of the current state of the Musk-owned company.  “On the other hand, I think that this kind of change is extremely positive for the industry.”</p><p>Among Silicon Valley insiders, McCue may be one of the most vocal advocates for this vision. But Flipboard isn’t the only legacy social app paying attention to the rise of decentralized platforms. Tumblr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/tumblr-to-add-support-for-activitypub-the-social-protocol-powering-mastodon-and-other-apps/"><ins>has said</ins></a> it plans to adopt ActivityPub, the protocol that powers Mastodon, PixelFed and other federated platforms. Meta, known for watching potential rivals closely, is also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-rumored-twitter-competitor-could-launch-as-early-as-next-month-181625616.html"><ins>working on</ins></a> a decentralized Twitter alternative that will tie into Instagram. The effort, reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-decentralized-twitter-competitor-071316333.html"><ins>codenamed P92</ins></a>, is rumored to run on ActivityPub. Meanwhile Bluesky is building out its own protocol, the <a href="https://atproto.com/"><ins>AT Protocol</ins></a>, which could eventually power multiple other services as well.</p><p>All of these efforts are still in a very early stage, but it could be the start of something much bigger. “This is a really important moment when the death of Twitter is going to lead to the birth of the social web,” McCue says.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/you-can-now-use-flipboard-to-browse-bluesky-140012427.html?src=rss

<p>The UK <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-regulator-orders-facebook-to-sell-giphy-111540661.html">ordered Meta to sell Giphy</a> at the end of 2021, and now the social media heavyweight is following through. Stock photo provider Shutterstock has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shutterstock-to-acquire-giphy-the-worlds-largest-gif-library-and-search-engine-301831611.html">reached a deal</a> to buy Giphy from Meta for $53 million. Notably, this won't break compatibility — Meta is entering a programming interface agreement that ensures Giphy's GIFs work properly across services like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>The sale is expected to close in June. Shutterstock says the purchase will boost its stake in &quot;casual conversations&quot; by adding GIFs and stickers to its catalog, not to mention Giphy partners like Microsoft, TikTok and Twitter. The buyout will also help foster Shutterstock's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shutterstock-ai-generated-stock-images-dall-e-133903619.html">generative AI strategy</a>, particularly in mobile, and should help the company reach more advertisers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta (then Facebook) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-144640114.html">bought Giphy</a> in 2020 to fold its GIF library into platforms like Instagram. The deal was reportedly worth $400 million. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) soon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-investigates-facebook-giphy-acquisition-141604075.html">launched an investigation</a> to determine if the acquisition would hurt competition, though, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-fines-facebook-70-million-for-breaking-rules-related-to-its-giphy-purchase-110227187.html">fined Meta $69.6 million</a> for continuing with merger plans without the regulator's approval. A year later, the CMA told Meta to sell Giphy after finding that the takeover would unfairly cement Meta's market dominance.</p><p>We've asked Meta for comment. The firm fought the CMA, arguing that Giphy neither operated in the UK nor counted as display advertising that justified a split. Meta also contended that Giphy and users alike were better off with its resources at their disposal.</p><p>The swap shouldn't change things much if you use Meta's social networks. This may affect Shutterstock's customers, though. Chief executive Paul Hennessy hopes Giphy will help commercialize Shutterstock's GIF collection — don't be surprised if animated images play a prominent role in Shutterstock's offerings.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-sells-giphy-to-shutterstock-at-a-loss-following-uk-order-131932973.html?src=rss

<p>While the performance of its gaming chips often steals most of the attention, AMD's processors have made some serious jumps in power efficiency over the past few years. And as part of the company's goal to bring even better battery life to mobile devices, today AMD is announcing a handful of new 6nm Ryzen and Athlon 7020 C-series APUs for Chromebooks.&nbsp;</p><p>The two fastest new chips will be the Ryzen 3 7320C and Ryzen 5 7520C which both feature four cores and total of eight threads with 6MB of cache, a 15-watt TDP and Radeon 610M graphics. Meanwhile, the new Athlon Gold 7220C and Athlon Silver 7120C will sport slightly slower performance with either 2-core/4-thread or 2-core/2-thread chips with up to 5MB of cache and the same 15-watt TDP and Radon 610M graphics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="The new Ryzen and Athlon 7020 C-series family will consist of four chips with up to 6MB of cache, Radeon 610M graphics and 4-core/8-thread designs.

More importantly, the new C-series processors should also deliver a significant boost in longevity with AMD claiming upwards of 17 hours of battery life for the Ryzen 3 7320C chip, which is about three and a half hours longer than what you'd get from either MediaTek's Kompanio 1380 or Intel's Core i3-N305.</p><p>In addition to extended battery life and improved performance, AMD's new Chromebook chips come with support for Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2 and faster memory bandwidth for LPDDR5 RAM. And thanks to AMD's Radeon 610M graphics, devices based on these chips should also be capable of sending video out to three 4K/60Hz external displays.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Compared to competing Intel and MediaTek chips, AMD claims the Ryzen 3 7320C processor will deliver an additional 3.5 hours of battery life.

Dell and ASUS already have plans to release new Chromebooks sometime in Q2, with Dell's Latitude 3445 Chromebook sporting a standard clamshell design, a range of new C-series silicon and up to 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Alternatively, ASUS' Chromebook CM34 Flip will be a 2-in-1 with a 360-degree hinge, a 16:10 14-inch touchscreen, a built-in fingerprint sensor and up to a Ryzen 5 7520C processor, and later this year we're expecting to see even more systems with these chips from Acer and ECS.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amds-new-ryzen-and-athlon-chips-for-chromebooks-promise-big-battery-improvements-130052201.html?src=rss

## NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti (8GB) review: Better 1080p ray tracing for $399

<p>To say that I loved <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3060-ti-review-170018640.html">NVIDIA's RTX 3060 Ti </a>is an understatement. It was the ideal balance of price and performance — something that became even more true when GPU prices fell back down to Earth. With NVIDIA's RTX 40-series cards <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-gpu-unholy-amounts-power-130020430.html">skyrocketing to pricey new heights</a>, I began to worry that the company was drifting away from affordable GPUs. Well, worry not. The $399 RTX 4060 Ti proves that NVIDIA can still deliver plenty of value under $500.</p><p>To be clear, it's not the dramatic leap forward that the 3060 Ti was (and if you have one of those cards, just sit tight for now!). But if you're still running an RTX 2060 GPU, or something older, the 4060 will be a worthwhile upgrade. It excels at gaming in 1080p with ray tracing at high framerates, and it can also handle 1,440p decently in less demanding games.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We reviewed the 8GB 4060 Ti, but there's also a model with 16GB of VRAM coming in July for $499. And if you're looking for the cheapest option, there's also a $299 plain 4060 on the horizon too. Judging from the current Steam stats, I'd wager that card will end up being the most popular. But the $399 model may make sense if you want to future-proof a bit, even if you don't plan to move beyond 1080p gaming.</p><figure><img alt="NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti rear view" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/f4ae80a0-f920-11ed-bbfa-86d9121faa39" style="height: 1145px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Founder's Edition 4060 Ti we're reviewing has the same basic cooling setup as the rest of the 40-series: A premium metal case surrounding a bevy of heatsink fins, along with dual rear fans. The GPU is noticeably lighter than the RTX 4070, and its dual-slot design makes it ideal for small-form factor systems. Under the hood, the 8GB 4060 Ti is powered by 4,352 CUDA cores, and it can reach up to 2,535 MHz boost clock (up from a 2,310 MHz base clock). One major upgrade is its 32MB of L2 cache, a huge step forward from 4MB on the previous two generations of '60 cards.</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>3DMark TimeSpy Extreme</p></td><td><p>Port Royal (Ray Tracing)</p></td><td><p>Cyberpunk</p></td><td><p>Blender</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti (8GB)</p></td><td><p>6,599</p></td><td><p>8,170/37 fps</p></td><td><p>1080p RT Ultra DLSS: 86.4fps</p></td><td><p>4,435</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti</p></td><td><p>5,408</p></td><td><p>6,989/32.36 fps</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>3,012</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 4070</p></td><td><p>8,610</p></td><td><p>11,195/52 fps</p></td><td><p>1080p RT DLSS: 160 fps</p></td><td><p>6,020</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 3070</p></td><td><p>6,226</p></td><td><p>8,032/37 fps</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>3,500</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I knew the RTX 4060 Ti was a winner as soon as I started benchmarking <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. It averaged 86.4 fps in 1080p with ultra ray tracing settings and DLSS 3 enabled. That's smooth enough to look great on any monitor, especially if it supports NVIDIA's G-SYNC frame synchronization, which would help to reduce screen tearing. Without ray tracing, <em>Cyberpunk </em>hit an impressive 158 fps. (I'd rather take the ray tracing over those extra frames for a single-player game, though.)</p><p>In 1,440p, <em>Cyberpunk</em> hit a steady 60fps with ultra ray tracing settings and DLSS 3. That would still look great on most screens if you're not chasing the dream of high frame rates. The 4060 Ti clearly isn't meant to be a 1,440p card with ray tracing, but it's capable in a pinch.</p><figure><img alt="NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti rear ports" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/f4adbd50-f920-11ed-af7b-8f6586bfff1b" style="height: 1173px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I saw similar results in <em>Halo Infinite: </em>The 4060 Ti averaged 148 fps in 1080p with maxed out graphics settings, and a serviceable 83 fps in 1,440p. If you think you'll be spending more time in 1,440p, you may want to consider going straight to the $599 RTX 4070. (While the extra RAM on the 16GB 4060 Ti sounds nice, I wouldn't bet on that making a dramatic difference in 1,440p.) Thanks to its excellent cooling setup, the GPU never went beyond 65 Celsius after extensive benchmarking.&nbsp;</p><p>In most tests, the 4060 Ti performed slightly better than the two and a half-year old RTX 3070. That card retailed for $499, but its street price was far higher long after its debut. The 4060 Ti makes a more impressive performance leap when compared to the 3060 Ti, but again it's not big enough to demand an immediate upgrade.</p><figure><img alt="NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti top down front view" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/f4ae3281-f920-11ed-9ff5-b611e9a0b497" style="height: 1284px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>For the most part, the RTX 4060 Ti seems like a reward to gamers who stuck with their older GPUs for years. It'll be a welcome introduction to the world of ray tracing for GTX 1060 owners. And for people upgrading from the RTX 2060, the performance leap with DLSS 3 will be dramatic. If you're on the fence, though, it may be worth waiting to see how the rest of AMD's Radeon RX 7000 family looks<a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Premilinary-RX-7800-XT-and-RX-7700-XT-performance-and-specifications-leak-alongside-possibly-doomed-RX-7800-XTX.709899.0.html">. Recent rumors</a> point to more of those Radeon cards appearing next month.</p><p>While I'm more excited to see what NVIDIA can eke out from its $299 RTX 4060, the 4060 Ti remains a solid ray tracing performer that many gamers can actually afford.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review-1080p-ray-tracing-130042416.html?src=rss

## Amazon's latest Fire tablet is a $230 Android-powered 2-in-1

<p>Guess Android tablets aren't dead just yet. Following Google's official launch of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-tablet-hands-on-basically-a-500-smart-display-with-a-detachable-screen-185151133.html">the Pixel Tablet</a> last week, Amazon has unveiled a new Fire tablet called the Max 11. For <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9maXJlbWF4MTE_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8temYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImEzOTU1ZWJjLWY4MDgtNDhmNy1hZmU2LTQ0NThiMDYwMWE4ZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATG8Xbu6p35JAM0kNTvd8LG0ukXrWu4X9CLZPKSmEW3a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Ffiremax11">just $230</a>, the Fire Max 11 offers an 11-inch LCD screen, slim aluminum frame and smart home controls courtesy of Alexa. I was able to briefly check out a sample at a briefing last week and am impressed by how much Amazon is offering for the money.</p><p>This isn't your average Fire tablet, by the way. While the company's previous slates have found a niche as affordable, kid-friendly mobile entertainment devices, the Max 11 is all grown up. With slimmer bezels, a more-premium aluminum build and weighing just over a pound, it's designed for those who also want to do some work and multi-tasking. To that end, the tablet uses an octa-core MediaTek processor that Amazon said is almost 50 percent faster than its "next fastest tablet."&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There's a fingerprint sensor embedded in the power button, making the Maxx 11 the company's first tablet to offer this feature. The 11-inch screen, which Amazon says is its "biggest, most vibrant... tablet display," has a 2,000 x 1,2000 resolution and is certified for low blue light. It also supports WiFi 6 and runs Fire OS 8, which offers some split-screen and picture-in-picture features to let you fire off emails while keeping an eye on your favorite YouTube livestream (like <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1xWjlIWWxBM3NiQSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTM5NTVlYmMtZjgwOC00OGY3LWFmZTYtNDQ1OGIwNjAxYThmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYrnITh0k1H1Yenp1DbVkY0YSVwvcP2oD5beyhfhMx4N&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqZ9HYlA3sbA">the Engadget Podcast</a>, perhaps?).&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, though, the company also made a keyboard case and stylus for the Max 11 that you can get for an additional $100. If you don't need the pen ($35), you can get just the case for $90. It attaches to the device magnetically and connects via pogo pins, too. I like that the cover comes with a kickstand, and in my brief experience it was sturdy enough to prop the tablet up and various angles. The keyboard is detachable so you can peel it off when you don't want it in the way. Its keys were surprisingly springy and deep, with a well-spaced layout. Though I think the trackpad is a little small, I'm glad that Amazon at least included one instead of ditching it altogether.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="The Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet in an empty space, propped up by the kickstand on the back of its case." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/b1c33990-f91e-11ed-b8f9-502e03e3ba3c" style="height: 5000px; width: 5000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>I also enjoyed casually scribbling my name and random greetings with the "Made For Amazon Stylus Pen," which uses a replaceable AAA battery that the company said should last six months. Palm rejection on OneNote was effective during the briefing, and you can also write directly into search and message fields, and the Max 11 will convert your scrawl into text that you can submit.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, this is quite a different device from the Pixel Tablet, which comes with a speaker base that keeps it charged and turns into a smart display when attached. But lest you forget, Amazon already offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-amazon-fire-hd-10-for-kids-show-mode-dock.html">Show Mode on its tablets</a>, which turns them into dashboards for your connected home, a la its Echo Shows. The same is true for the Max 11, and with the kickstand on the case, you can basically turn it into a smart display. Sure, it won't always remain charged unless you plug it in, nor will it have a superior audio system when left standing. But you can sort of replicate the Pixel Tablet experience here for $150 less. Alexa can always be listening, too.</p><p>The Max 11 itself will last 14 hours on a charge, according to Amazon, and 64GB and 128GB models will be available. For those who are curious, the device will have 4GB of RAM and 8-megapixel front and rear cameras. And in case you're clumsy or expect the kids in your life to fight over this tablet, it should be reassuring to know that Amazon claims the Max 11 is "three times as durable as the iPad 10.9' (10th generation)."</p><p>Like the company's other tablets, the Fire Max 11 supports comprehensive parental controls and multiple user profiles so you can share this with some peace of mind. For just $330, the Fire Max 11 offers plenty of features that make it seem like a solid value. It's certainly cheaper (when you include the price of the keyboard case) than the Galaxy Tabs, Surfaces and iPads that have long dominated the tablet market. There are companies like Lenovo to look out for, of course, but given the strong foothold Amazon has had in the family-oriented slate space, the Max 11 appears poised to find its home in the backpacks of many school-going children soon. You can pre-order the Fire Max 11 starting at $230 today.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazons-latest-fire-tablet-is-a-230-android-powered-2-in-1-130022727.html?src=rss

## Samsung's new Sensor OLED display can read fingerprints anywhere on the screen

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-latest-mobile-display-can-both-fold-and-slide-105017526.html">Samsung</a> has unveiled a new display technology that could lead to new biometric and health-related capabilities in future phones and tablets. The tech giant has debuted what it calls the <a href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31165">Sensor OLED Display</a> that can read your fingerprints regardless of what part of the screen you touch at this year's SID Display Week in LA. While most smartphones now have fingerprint readers on the screen, their sensors are attached under the panel as a separate module that only works within a small designated area. For Sensor OLED, Samsung said it embedded the fingerprint sensor into the panel itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the display technology can read fingerprints anywhere on the screen, it can also be used to monitor your heart rate and blood pressure. The company said it can even return more accurate readings than available wearables can. To measure your blood pressure, you'd need to place two fingers on the screen. OLED light is apparently reflected differently depending on your blood vessels' contraction and relaxation. After that information is returned to the panel, the sensor converts it into health metrics.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung explained in its press release: &quot;To accurately measure a person’s blood pressure, it is necessary to measure the blood pressure of both arms. The Sensor OLED display can simultaneously sense the fingers of both hands, providing more accurate health information than existing wearable devices.&quot; The company has yet to announce if it's planning to use this new technology on devices it's releasing in the future, but the exhibit at SID Display already shows it being able to read blood pressure and heart rate.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to Sensor OLED, Samsung has also showcased the Rollable Flex screen that can expand more than five times in length when unrolled. Meanwhile, its Flex In &amp; Out phone concept shows a Galaxy Fold-like device that you can vertically fold inward or outward. It eliminates the need for an external display, which could lead to thinner foldable phones.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="A photo of Samsung's Flex In &amp; Out phone concept." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/672f2e90-f962-11ed-bfa7-99e336ec0c82" style="height: 973px; width: 1600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-new-sensor-oled-display-can-read-fingerprints-anywhere-on-the-screen-121346659.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/skullcandy/"><ins>Skullcandy</ins></a> is well known for offering decent, affordable audio gear and the brand's latest earbuds are even less expensive than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/skullcandy-dime-true-wireless-earbuds-specs-price-120012848.html"><ins>the $25 Dime from 2021</ins></a>. The Smokin’ Buds True Wireless Earbuds will set you back just $20.</p><p>The company is promising plenty of bells and whistles with these earbuds, such as &quot;clear, full range sound backed by impressive bass depth.&quot; In addition, Skullcandy says users can expect &quot;expertly tuned&quot; drivers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are EQ modes designed to help you get the most out of music, movies and podcasts. Each earbud has a microphone, so you can wear either one at a time. There are touch controls for volume, calls and EQ modes, and you'll be able to activate a voice assistant by tapping either earbud.</p><p>Skullcandy says the Smokin’ Buds have a comfortable, noise-isolating fit thanks to an ergonomic, oval design.

The brand also says a rapid charging feature can add two hours of playtime after just 10 minutes of charging.

<p>Finally. Starting today, you'll be able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-finally-lets-you-fix-typos-in-sent-messages-153017357.html">edit WhatsApp messages </a>you’ve already sent. You'll need to act fairly swiftly as you'll only get a 15-minute window. To do so, you just have to long press on the typo-riddled message and tap Edit. Messages will be labeled as ‘edited’ if you do so, but no-one will see the edit history, or the mistakes you made. The messaging app is catching up with rival messaging services: iOS users have been able to edit their texts sent in iMessage for a while now. Apple’s messaging service also includes an unsend option.</p><p>WhatsApp's update is rolling out to all users now.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Adobe adds generative AI editing to Photoshop

<p>As generative AI has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">taken the tech world by storm</a>, it was only a matter of time before Photoshop got in on the action. Adobe announced today that a new Generative Fill feature is coming to its ubiquitous photo-editing software later this year. The company promises “a magical new way to work” as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-fireflys-new-ai-tools-aim-to-cut-down-drudge-work-for-editors-130005412.html">Firefly-powered</a> feature lets you add, remove and extend visual content based on natural-language text prompts. “Generative Fill combines the speed and ease of generative AI with the power and precision of Photoshop, empowering customers to bring their visions to life at the speed of their imaginations,” said Ashley Still, Adobe’s senior VP of Digital Media.</p><p>Adobe’s Generative Fill is equivalent to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/open-a-is-dall-e-2-produces-fantastical-images-of-most-anything-you-can-imagine-170056814.html">DALL-E 2’s</a> inpainting (generating AI content within a section of an image) and outpainting (AI-generated content extending beyond the image’s borders). So, for example, if you want to inpaint the sky to look surreal in a photo you took, select that area and type something like “surreal sky with strange colors” into the prompt field. Or, if you took a picture that you wish had a wider aspect ratio, you can select the area outside of it and prompt it to extend the scene.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Adobe says the feature matches the original scene’s perspective, lighting and style, allowing you to alter images radically with minimal legwork. The company provided a marketing video showing three AI-generated results to choose from for each text prompt.</p><figure><img alt="Split-screen image (before and after) from Adobe’s Generative Fill AI feature. On the left, an original image of a deer in a forest (the deer is outlined as a selection).

As generative AI makes it increasingly difficult to separate the organic from the algorithmic — and as artists worry about their work <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dall-e-generative-ai-tracking-data-privacy-160034656.html">being plagiarized</a> by career-killing machines — Adobe’s more transparent approach is refreshing.</p><p>Generative Fill will be available in the Photoshop desktop beta starting today. Adobe adds that the feature will be “generally available in the second half of 2023.” Finally, Generative Fill is also available today on the web as a module in the (invite-only) <a href="https://firefly.adobe.com/">Firefly beta</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/adobe-adds-generative-ai-editing-to-photoshop-110034887.html?src=rss

<p>Netflix's latest updates to its mobile app make it easier to search through bookmarked content in the &quot;My List&quot; feature, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/22/netflix-updates-my-list-feature-so-users-can-find-content-they-have-yet-to-watch/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> has reported. New filters let you sort titles by movie, series, release date, alphabetical order, and date added.</p><p>The most interesting are the &quot;Started&quot; and &quot;Haven't Started&quot; filters, though. A lot of folks bookmark content, start watching it and then don't finish for whatever reason. Now, if you're looking for something you added to &quot;My List&quot; but have yet to start watching, you can see all of it at once, rather than needing to painfully look through everything.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Netflix update makes it easier to find content you've bookmarked but haven't watched" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/03c857a0-f94e-11ed-b3e7-24ea5ff85f4a" style="height: 2607px; width: 3465px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Netflix</div></figure><p>Netflix added the My List feature nearly 10 years ago, but until now, there have been no filters — the only way to find things was to scroll through the list.

The new feature will come to Android devices first, and hit iOS over &quot;the next few weeks,&quot; Netflix said.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with that update, Netflix is adding a &quot;Coming Soon&quot; row to its TV apps. The idea is to provide a preview of any upcoming content, and you can set a reminder when upcoming shows are available. That will put future content front and center, as it was previously hidden in the &quot;New &amp; Popular&quot; tab.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netflix-makes-it-easier-to-find-titles-youve-added-to-your-list-but-havent-watched-yet-104554461.html?src=rss

<p>HBO Max is completing its transformation into Warner Bros. Discovery's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/max-hbo-max-rebrand-analysis-194800553.html">&quot;Max&quot; streaming service</a> today, and it's launching with a new tier especially made for 4K ultra HD viewing. The Ultimate Ad-Free tier will set you back $20 a month or $200 if you're paying for a whole year, making it the service's most expensive subscription option yet. A subscription will give you access to over 1,000 4K movies and TV show episodes, which is nearly eight times more than previously available 4K content. It will also give you the ability to stream on up to four devices at the same time and to store up to 100 offline downloads.</p><p>Ultimate Ad-Free's arrival, however, could spell the end of 4K availability for regular ad-free subscribers. While Warner Bros. didn't say it outright, the company included a line in its <a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/max-announces-expanded-roster-4k-programming-available-stream-its-ultimate-ad-free">announcement</a> to reveal that &quot;existing HBO Max subscribers will still have access to their current plan features for a minimum of six months following launch.&quot; We've asked the company for clarification. To note, Warner Bros. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-price-increase-ad-free-170242563.html">raised its subscription prices</a> in January, so you now have to pay $16 a month for the ad-free tier and $10 for the ad-supported one.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For the Ultimate Ad-Free tier, Dolby Atmos and Vision will also be available for select content and devices. The company plans to keep growing its 4K library every month going forward, but for now, the ultra HD shows and movies you can stream with a subscription include <em>Game of Thrones</em>, <em>House of the Dragon,</em><em>The Last of Us</em>, the Harry Potter movies, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Dark Knight trilogy and The Matrix films. Further, all Warner Bros. movies released this year and in the future will be added to the tier's 4K library when they arrive on Max.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-max-streaming-service-launches-with-new-20-4k-tier-092756959.html?src=rss

## Dyson says its 360 Vis Nav has 'twice the suction' of any other robot vacuum

<p>Dyson's first robot vacuum, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-20-dyson-360-eye.html">360 Eye</a>, was not a great success in the US as it was quickly pulled from the market shortly after it went on sale. Now, the UK company is trying again with the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=491ba8bc-5d19-4b5e-ad79-d1fcb8d0dc18&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dyson+Australia&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0OTFiYThiYy01ZDE5LTRiNWUtYWQ3OS1kMWZjYjhkMGRjMTgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZHlzb24uY29tLmF1L25ld3Nyb29tL3VwZGF0ZXMvZHlzb24tMzYwLXZpcy1uYXYiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIwMDNlMDNhLTUyOWQtNDY5ZS1iZTQ4LWZkMDRkZDgyYzhkNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeq2B33iJxhzZnwgyVdZm9s_50w_bgJR4nPHpxGxyAdH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com.au%2Fnewsroom%2Fupdates%2Fdyson-360-vis-nav">360 Vis Nav robovac</a>, which just launched in Australia and is expected to come to the US later this year. While it lacks features like self-emptying, Dyson is promising &quot;twice the suction&quot; of any other robot vacuum, a new vision/navigation system and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The motor speed has increased from 78,000 RPM on the last model to 110,000, which supposedly delivers six times the suction of other robot vacuums. It also offers a &quot;triple-action&quot; brush bar that allows for optimal cleaning on different surfaces. Namely, it uses soft nylon for hard floors, anti-static carbon fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 360 Vis Nav has a top-mounted fish-eye lens and looks for recognizable landmarks to navigate its way around using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) tech. It promises better low-light performance than the last model by using eight LEDs around the lens to better spot landmarks, particularly in dark locations like underneath your couch. It also uses 26 sensors to detect obstacles so it won't get stuck in tight spots like under a chair.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Dyson says its 360 Vis Nav has 'twice the suction' of any other robot vacuum" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/accac100-f942-11ed-bff5-d02767f4c96f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dyson</div></figure><p>Perhaps the niftiest feature is an arm that pops out when the 360 Vis Nav is cleaning against a wall. It gets right to the edge and redirects suction, picking up dirt that eludes most robovacs and ensuring you don't need to finish the job with a hand vacuum.&nbsp;</p><p>With all that suction power comes a bit less battery life than other models, however. It can clean for 50 minutes before automatically going back to the dock to charge, but it does pick up right where it left off when charging finishes. You can schedule and monitor cleaning using Dyson's app, and it will clean more efficiently over time as it creates dust maps of your home.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no word on pricing or US availability yet, but the 360 Vis Nav just launched in Australia for $AUD 2,399 (about $1,590), considerably more than the 360 Eye was at launch.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Dyson says its 360 Vis Nav has 'twice the suction' of any other robot vacuum" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/1a1740d0-f943-11ed-a7f7-e710ce25bc59" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dyson</div></figure><p>Along with the 360 Vis Nav, Dyson launched the latest versions of its famous cordless vacuums, the Gen5detect and Gen5outsize. Using the fifth generation of Dyson's Hyperdymium motors, they're &quot;smaller, faster and more powerful&quot; than past models and even capable of &quot;capturing viruses from your home,&quot; Dyson promised.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Dyson says its 360 Vis Nav has 'twice the suction' of any other robot vacuum" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/e1ea9b80-f942-11ed-9bdf-e2ab2ee1c954" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dyson</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, the Dyson Submarine is the company's first ever wet vacuum cleaner. It has a wet roller head that attaches to the new V15s Detect Submarine and V12s Slim submarine vacuums (but not any older models). It can not only remove dust and stains from hard floors, but even handle spills like ketchup. Finally,  Dyson has introduced the Big+quiet Formaldehyde, a new air purifier designed for large homes. It can purify air over a 32 foot range, removing pollutants (including formaldehyde, of course), dust and more. Again, there's no word yet on US pricing or availability.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Dyson says its 360 Vis Nav has 'twice the suction' of any other robot vacuum" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/3f964090-f943-11ed-bffb-666d36cb9d76" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dyson</div></figure>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/dyson-says-its-360-vis-nav-has-twice-the-suction-of-any-other-robot-vacuum-084003155.html?src=rss

## The new Ableton Push is an MPE-enabled standalone music production powerhouse

<p>Rumors have been swirling around Ableton’s Push 3 for years. Arguably the best hardware controller for one of (if not <em>the</em>) most popular DAWs (digital audio workstation), the Push 2, was released in 2015. And nearly eight years later it’s still head and shoulders above much of the competition. But there are some modern amenities that it’s lacking. And Native Instruments changed the game in 2020 when it released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/native-instruments-maschine-plus-review-133002156.html">Machine+</a>, a controller for its desktop suite that could also function as a standalone music production box thanks to an Intel Atom CPU and 4GB of RAM.</p><p>Considering the long lead times required for product development, it’s safe to assume that Ableton was already hard at work on its new controller when Maschine+ was announced. But I’d also venture to guess that the company watched the reaction to Native Instruments’ box closely and tweaked its plans accordingly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The result is the Ableton Push – not Push 3, not Push+ – just Push. And it makes a hell of a first impression. It comes in two configurations, a basic controller for $999 and with a processor for $1999. With a processor it can function as a fully standalone instrument, like the Maschine+. But it still also offers tight integration with Ableton Live 11 when connected to a computer. It has 64 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-11-2021-mpe-comping-daw-music-110000821.html">MPE enabled pads</a>, that pair perfectly with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-11-daw-hands-on-review-upgrades-explained-160047192.html">Live’s latest updates</a>. It has a built-in battery for truly untethered creation. And, in a pleasant surprise, even if you stick with the controller only variant to start, you’ll be able to upgrade it with a DIY kit later this year for full standalone operation.</p><figure><img alt="Ableton Push" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/421354b0-f926-11ed-a3bf-b148336fd8b4" style="height: 1126px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>But let’s start with the hardware. Physically the new Push and the Push 2 are very similar. They’re both hulking black slabs that seem like they were ripped out of the control panel of an alien spaceship. The screen appears to be exactly the same. And that’s not a bad thing. It’s a large, reasonably high resolution LCD with excellent viewing angles. It refreshes fast enough that you actually watch your MIDI notes scroll by in real time as you record them. The UI itself is simple and intuitive but attractive. There’s no unnecessary graphics or anything, just clean lines and text.</p><p>The knobs, buttons and pads all feel great. One of the new additions to the controls is a large jog wheel to the right of the screen that is a delight. It’s reminiscent of the one on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polyend-tracker-groovebox-sampler-review-170118746.html">Polyend’s Tracker</a>, but more noticeable detents. (Another fun feature Push borrows from Tracker is auto generated project names, which comes in handy.) And the pads. Well. They’re the first I’ve encountered that truly give Akai’s a run for their money. I think I still have a <em>slight</em> preference for the feel of an MPC’s larger pads but, those aren’t MPE capable so, Ableton wins? My only complaint about the hardware really is that the pads might be too sensitive. But that can easily be fixed by going into the settings. Which you should probably do anyway to tweak the responsiveness to your liking since MPE can be fickle and unforgiving at times.</p><figure><img alt="Gnarl preset in Superberry by Fors running on the Ableton Push." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/021f7ee0-f928-11ed-bf7d-6da964a2bf4b" style="height: 1126px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Around back you’ll notice you’ll find a bunch of new connections too. There’s USB-C for connecting to a computer to control Live, a 12v DC connector, and two jacks for connecting sustain pedals just like on a Push 2. But those pedal jacks can also send CV now, so you can control modular gear. There’s also a USB-A port for connecting class compliant MIDI controllers, so if pads aren’t your thing you can connect a keyboard, or play one instrument with the keyboard while knocking out drum tracks on the Push directly. You’ll also find ⅛” MIDI in and out ports.</p><p>More importantly, there are two audio ins and two audio outs, plus a headphone jack and two ADAT jacks for connecting to other audio gear. See, the new Push – even without a processor in it – is also an audio interface. Granted it only has ¼” jacks (switchable between balanced and unbalanced), so not ideal if you’re recording vocals and need an XLR jack with phantom power. But if you’ve got another audio interface already with ADAT you can connect it to the Push and then suddenly you’ve got eight or 12 or however many inputs to work with. It is truly capable of being the centerpiece of a recording studio now.</p><figure><img alt="Ableton Push rear panel" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/af86d5c0-f92c-11ed-8f7f-065fac3a5bd9" style="height: 1126px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you opt for the Push with a processor you’ll find an 11th Core i3 inside, with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB hard drive. That might not sound like much, but it’s plenty of power to handle most audio processing, especially without the overhead of trying to handle a windowing system and security software and those 16 Firefox tabs you haven’t closed in about three months. In fact, I noticed far less latency working with live audio on the Push directly than I do on my XPS 15 with a 8th gen Core i7 CPU, 32GB of RAM and a second generation Focusrite Scarlett interface. If you’re concerned about your $2,000 MIDI controller / groovebox becoming obsolete though, Ableton says it expects to make processor upgrades available in the future.</p><p>That Intel NUC Compute Element does chew through the battery pretty quickly, though. Ableton estimates that Push can get two to two-and-a-half hours out of the battery, which lines up with my anecdotal experience so far. The Push is kinda big and heavy at 8.7 pounds, I wouldn’t exactly call it portable. But it’s actually been great to sit down on my couch at night, after the kids go to bed and chip away at this review without an elaborate setup or being tied to an outlet.</p><figure><img alt="Max for Live on Ableton Push" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/8eb9dea0-f927-11ed-9eff-0e2eb2816cf9" style="height: 1126px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Hardware is all well and good, but what is really going to make or break the experience here is the software and, well, so far so good. A few intriguing things to note at the top, the Push is running Linux. Which means that, technically, Ableton Live 11 has been ported to Linux. I don’t think you should get your hopes up about an official port being made available for that Mint box you’ve been building, though. I’ve also been told that VST support on Push is technically possible, though obviously that would require getting developers on board and converting their plugins.</p><p>There is one way of getting third party instruments on Push though – <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/maxforlive">Max for Live</a>, a development platform inside the DAW. Support for Max is huge as it can really open the possibilities of the Push as a standalone instrument. Ableton even recently released a pack of <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/building-max-devices/#?">building blocks and tutorials</a> to encourage people to build their own <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/">Max for Live</a> devices. And there’s companies like <a href="https://fors.fm/">Fors</a> that build incredible commercial products that run on Max. Support right now can be spotty since the controls need to be properly mapped for Push. And even some of Ableton’s own Max devices like the Inspired by Nature series don’t work properly at the moment.</p><figure><img alt="Ableton Push Packs" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/2b0349f0-f927-11ed-afff-876d95b528c2" style="height: 1126px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>But don’t worry, Ableton’s built-in devices are excellent. And while I might be sad not having access to my <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-4-soft-synth-vst-free-update-160036317.html">favorite softsynth</a> in standalone mode, you can easily build a complete and highly polished track using nothing but the default Live instruments and effects. But if you do need more variety, you can install Ableton sound packs directly over wifi. You can also drag over your own sample library using the Continuity feature in Live 11. You’ll see Push showup in the sidebar when connected to the same wifi network. Though, oddly, you can’t transfer over USB.</p><p>In addition to dragging over samples you can pull over presets, collections and favorites. I highly recommend, by the way, that you use the Collections in Ableton to organize your goto sounds, effects, et cetera. While the jog wheel is certainly an improvement, it can still be a bit of a slog navigating through long lists of presets and samples. Organization – not my strong suit – is clearly key to getting the most out of Push as a standalone instrument.</p><p>One incredible feature of continuity though, is being able to connect to your Push and pull a project you started in standalone mode into the desktop app for final arrangement. Which is kind of essentially because, while Push seems great for jamming, live performance and sketching out ideas, you can’t do fine tuned arrangement editing or mix down to audio.</p><figure><img alt="Continuity in Ableton Live 11" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/ea5d2600-f926-11ed-ad7f-9ebf836fee70" style="height: 1012px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Terrence O'Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Obviously the price is going to be an issue, though. The standalone configuration costs $1,999, while the controller only variant will set you back $999. The DIY upgrade kit is expected to ship later this year for $1,049. That's a lot for a MIDI controller, even one as nice as this. And while I'm fairly certain there aren't any DAWs in a box as powerful as what Ableton has put together, they're also not nearly as expensive. Even Maschine+ is only $1,199.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve only had Push for about a week and am still coming to grips with the workflow. So this is really more of an extended hands-on than a full review. While Ableton is my DAW of choice and I own a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-24-ableton-push-review.html">Push 1</a>, the differences are significant. Plus there are still some software kinks to iron out. I’ve encountered a handful of bugs, especially when trying to edit MIDI notes in the piano roll. And once the entire unit froze up on me. But the Push is currently running prerelease firmware and requires a beta version of Live 11 to take advantage of Continuity. I plan to continue testing Push and revisit it for a longterm review.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-new-ableton-push-is-an-mpe-enabled-standalone-music-production-powerhouse-081118260.html?src=rss

## Amazon's Kindle Scribe updates include support for direct on-page writing

<p>We were enamored with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-scribe-review-e-ink-reader-tablet-pen-drawing-price-battery-life-140019784.html">Kindle Scribe when we reviewed it</a>, but we weren't blind to its shortcomings, including its limited editing capabilities. Now, Amazon has <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/kindle-scribe-updates">rolled out an update</a> for the device, which solves some of the issues we had with it and makes it a much better option for note-taking. One of the new features is the ability to write directly on page. It's still not available for every book, but the Kindle Store on the Scribe now has a new section called "Write-on Books" where you can find titles that support the feature.&nbsp;</p><p>At the moment, the selection of books with direct on-page writing is mostly made up of guided journals, as well as games like crossword and sudoku. In other words, books that don't make sense on a device where writing on them is not supported. If you're checking out titles on a laptop or a phone, you can also see if they support the feature by looking for "On-page writing" under their product details section. For books that don't support on-page writing, you'll still have to create a sticky note and write within a designated rectangle. You'll have to keep your fingers crossed for the ability to doodle and take notes on the margin of a book if that's something you've been wishing for.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you want to share or upload notes you've written on the Scribe, the update also gives you the capability to easily convert them to text. You'll find a new option that reads "Convert to text and quick send" in the share menu and another that says "Convert to text and email." Both options share your handwritten notebooks as a .txt file, but for the latter, you'll be given the the chance to review and edit the converted text before sharing them via email to five addresses.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also a new lasso select tool to move your notes and doodles around. You simply have to circle your handwritten text or drawings with it to resize them, drag them to another location or to cut, copy and paste them within a sticky note, a notebook or a PDF.
