California laws have made shoplifting all but legal under a certain amount. While you who do right and aren't a criminal douche are stuck restocking shelves, paying higher prices, and being a productive member of society. Of course, you're a Californian so it's your fault for reelecting the same progressives who support pro-crime laws over and over and over again. But still, I can understand the frustration from out here in real America.</p><p>But chasing a guy who stole from your Dollar Tree with your car?</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This Dollar General manager deserves a raise. She has had enough of this mans thieving ways and runs him down with her car and retrieves some of the stores merchandiseü§£ü§£ <a href="https://t.co/aiGEYHoukY">pic.twitter.com/aiGEYHoukY</a><br />‚Äî ‚Ä¢ ·ó∞IS·ëï·ïºI·ó¥·ñ¥ ‚Ñ¢ ‚Ä¢ (@4Mischief) <a href="https://twitter.com/4Mischief/status/1659997986284355586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Allegedly, this woman is a Dollar Tree manager. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12111929/Dollar-General-worker-mows-shoplifter-car-tried-making-bicycle-getaway.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail wrote to Dollar General for confirmation</a> that's the case but did not receive a response. And the thief is a thief. A guy who saw a bunch a stuff he wanted but didn't want to pay for.</p><p>I get the frustration at the crime. My initial reaction when <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shoplifter-walmart-greeter" target="_blank">I see citizens</a> getting <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-shopliffter-california-fights-back" target="_blank">fed up enough to act</a> is to say, "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-walgreens" target="_blank">Hell yeah, brother!</a>" But it would be one thing if you were helping a local business. Dollar Tree is a ginormous retail chain that doesn't care about the thievery, because if they did the owners of these large companies and corporations wouldn't keep donating money to those same progressive politicians.</p><p>But also, they don't care about you. If you stop a shoplifter and that shoplifter turns around and sues the store, they'll be the ones with the settlement and you'll be the one unemployed.</p><p>If you're fed up with the crime and thievery where you live, you have one very simple action to take. Stop voting for the people who make it that way.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Mother of girl who lost state championship opportunity to male runner speaks out: "Kids are forced to celebrate it"

Critics are saying she was robbed because placing second place was Athena Ryan who, while claiming to be a girl now, ran track as a boy up until 2021. That was only two years ago. By critics, I mean... hi. It's me. I'm the critics. It's me.</p><p>Me and an army of other parents, one of whom was the mother of one of the other runners who saw an opportunity taken from them. <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/05/23/mother-trans-athlete-daughter-track-race/?utm_source=piano&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=breaking&amp;pnespid=qbtiFTgbL69K1P3PuiqtEojTp06gWJxocPKmxOg4qgVmSigNer523UqUTpdRe7Dh04zcC05N" target="_blank">She spoke to the Daily Caller</a> anonymously.</p><blockquote>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs heartbreaking to see what happens to these kids and how scared they are to even show the slightest bit of body language that might indicate that they aren‚Äôt happy with it. They‚Äôre, like, forced to celebrate it.‚Äù</blockquote><p>Telling girls to celebrate having opportunities taken from them is where the "debate" is most maddening. A teammate of Lia Thomas -- the trans NCAA champion who was mid at best when she was a he named Will Thomas -- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out" target="_blank">spoke out to Matt Walsh last year</a>. It was made clear to the girls BY ADULTS that "if you speak up about it, your life will be over in some way, you‚Äôll be blasted all over the internet as a ‚Äòtransphobe,‚Äô [‚Ä¶] you‚Äôll never be able to get a job."</p><blockquote>"If you even bring up the fact that Lia‚Äôs swimming might not be fair, you‚Äôre immediately shut down and called a hateful person, or transphobic."<br /><br />"So, Penn actually brought in people high up in the athletic department to talk to us, like brought in someone from the LGBTQ center, they brought in someone from psychological services."<br /></blockquote><p>Here is where we're at in America. <span></span>One side of the debate, the side that believes in biology, feels that because boys are born with certain biological advantages in strength and athletics, it is unfair for them to compete against girls. Effectively robbing girls of opportunities like scholarships and being able to discover themselves as they learn, grow, and develop. Also, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/locker-room-vermont-speaks-out" target="_self">forcing young girls to change with classmates who have male body parts</a> is weird and people who support forcing them to do so should feel disgusted with themselves because you're a gross person. That is one side of the argument.</p><p>The other side of the argument thinks you're a homophobic transphobe. It's also the side that controls the White House, Hollywood, and 99.86% of the media.</p><p>Tell me where the middle ground is. Or even better, tell the parents who are having their daughter's future and opportunities ripped away from them by cheaters.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## John Cleese forced to cut popular "men having babies" seen from "Life of Brian" stage show and you can guess why

Though I don't think anyone is a "former" Python member. Kinda like once a Marine, always a Marine. The story is based on the 1979 film satirizing the life of Jesus Christ. You can still do that in 2023. But the one thing you can't do in 2023 has been cut out of the play.</p><p>You can't mock men claiming they can have babies like they do here:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

You haven't got a womb! -- Where's the fetus going to gestate?! You going to keep it in a box?!</em></p><p><em>LORETTA: [crying]</em></p><p>In 1979, this was silliness. In 2023, it's a conversation between a woke activist and a normie on Twitter. Right after the woke activist celebrates the normie's daughter <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-track-star-california" target="_blank">having her hopes and dreams</a> crushed <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/skateboarding-29-year-old" target="_blank">by a trans athlete</a>.</p><p>John Cleese addressed the upcoming production while on tour and broke the news that the preceding scene has just been sacked. He had a read-through with New York actors. The words "New York" and "actors" give everything away.</p><blockquote>At the end, I said to the American actors: 'What do you think?' And they said: 'We love the script, but you can't do that stuff about Loretta nowadays.</blockquote><p>No one ever asks why. It's like when the say <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mindy-kaling-office" target="_blank">you can't make <em>The Office</em> today</a>, even though it's still the most popular streamed show. WHY can't you do that stuff? Show your work.</p><blockquote>So here you have something there's never been a complaint about in 40 years, that I've heard of, and now all of a sudden we can't do it because it'll offend people. What is one supposed to make of that? But I think there were a lot of things that were actually, in some strange way, predictive of what was actually going to happen later.</blockquote><p>It is a shame that a small minority <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/john-cleese-phobic" target="_blank">of Cleese-phobic activists</a> have such veto power over what art does and doesn't get made or isn't allowed to be seen. Maybe one day, these people who do the sacking can be sacked themselves.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

She took to Twitter to proclaim she attempted to ask serious questions of Ron DeSantis, and the Florida Governor ran away from her. Little did she know, she was being recorded as well.</p><p>Palmeri wanted to create content about DeSantis allegedly not being someone who enjoys engaging with humans. To prove this point, she said she tried asking him questions as he was leaving the Florida Statehouse, but he ran away. The clear implication was that she was attempting to do a serious journalism and ask DeSantis things like if he is too focused on the culture wars. Maybe get his thoughts on GOP primary polling.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I tried once more w/ DeSantis at the State House, peaceably following him down a stairwell asking him more questions, each of which he ignored.

The first is shout out to Team DeSantis if always having a camera running is part of their campaign. Back when I was a member of the dreaded consultant class, I was a firm believer that if Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) were going to track our clients, we should track them too. This way we had the FULL CONTEXT of whatever out of context video came out.</p><p>The second is that while some on the right believe yelling and insulting reporters is the way to go (which is understandable), Team DeSantis believes <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/desantis-forbes-report-woke" target="_blank">making them look stupid</a> is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-apologizes-team-desantis" target="_blank">a more effective tactic</a>.

Then they uninvited them when they discovered people find that offensive. Now they re-invited them after being bullied by LGBTQ organizers and a Los Angeles politician.</p><p>First, <a href="https://www.outkick.com/los-angeles-dodgers-lgbtq-pride-night-sisters-perpetual-indulgence-apology-invite/" target="_blank">the drag nuns known as</a> the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. </p><blockquote>The ‚ÄúSisters‚Äù of Perpetual Indulgence use ‚Äúgo and sin some more‚Äù as their motto, and frequently dress as Jesus, Mary and other religious figures. Members also hold pub crawls that mock the Stations of the Cross, and even the Eucharist.</blockquote><p>You may remember them from such blog posts last this 2019 classic, "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/another-child-sex-offender-discovered-at-drag-queen-story-time" target="_self" title="view post: ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'">ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'</a>."

Not when drag queens rank #2 on the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-track-star-california" target="_blank">behind trans people</a>).  LA Pride felt these Catholic-mocking nuns were such an important part of their agenda, they pulled out of the event.
