Cowboys in the Campfire is the latest project from revered musician Tommy Stinson and his friend and collaborator, Philadelphia guitarist Chip Roberts. "Wronger," the album from Cowboys in the Campfire, is set to release on June 2, 2023, on Cobraside Records. 

Back in April, while in town for a show at the Turf Club in St. Paul, Stinson visited The Current to play acoustic versions of a couple of songs from "Wronger," including this song, "Fall Apart Together."
