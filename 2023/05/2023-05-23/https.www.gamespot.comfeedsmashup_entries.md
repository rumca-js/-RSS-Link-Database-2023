<p>Square Enix reportedly doesn't have plans for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi/">Final Fantasy 16</a> day-one patch.</p><p>This comes by way of a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2023/05/22/a-day-one-patch-for-final-fantasy-16-is-not-currently-planned">Game Informer</a> report, which explains that Square Enix is confident with the current Final Fantasy 16 build. In addition, producer Naoki Yoshida feels that games should work as expected on launch, especially since not everyone has access to the internet needed to download a day-one patch.</p><p>That's not to say Final Fantasy 16 won't get updates in the future. The game's director Hiroshi Takai did confirm that the team is currently searching for bugs, so it's possible Final Fantasy 16 will receive updates after it launches.

<p>Mojang has announced a crossover with Sega to bring Sonic and his buddies to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a>. The latest DLC will be a new texture pack that will make your world look like it's straight out of Green Hill Zone.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-getting-dungeons-dragons-crossover/1100-6512731/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-x-joins-minecraft-in-new-dlc/1100-6511694/">Mega Man X</a> DLC, this texture pack won't offer any story modes. Instead, it can only be used when playing Survival or Creative mode. It'll feature "custom animations, nostalgic callbacks, and some fun changes to your inventory" to fit into the world of Sonic.

In addition to the references, the texture pack's creator hinted that Dr. Eggman would make an appearance as one of the bosses.

<p>A new season means a new patch for Destiny 2, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-deep-release-date-armor-story-and-everything-we-know/1100-6513865/">Season of the Deep</a> update is a big one. Over the last couple of weeks, Bungie has been detailing just how substantial the changes will be for Destiny 2, and as you can see in the <em>very long </em>patch notes below, there's a lot going on here. In case you missed those briefings, here's a quick rundown of what you can expect to change this season.</p><p>In the Exotics department, both armor and weapons are getting fine-tuned. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dozens-of-destiny-2-exotic-armor-pieces-are-getting-overhauled-in-season-21/1100-6514000/">A lot of legacy armor is being overhauled</a> to offer new functions so that they can tie in better with last year's Light subclass reworks, and several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-cool-dubstep-gun-and-several-other-exotics-are-getting-an-upgrade-next-season/1100-6514292/">older Exotic weapons in Destiny 2 are being changed</a> to be more in line with the game's current meta.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-best-supers-are-getting-big-upgrades-in-season-21/1100-6513817/">Several roaming Supers are being changed</a>, and for most classes, you can expect these ultimate abilities to pack more of a punch. Fists of Havoc, Golden Gun, and Chaos Reach are a few standout examples here, as these particular Supers should be on a more level playing field when you log into Destiny 2 this week.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-deep-patch-notes-reveal-overhaul-exotics-beefed-up-supers-and-buffed-armor-mods/1100-6514474/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## After Us Review - Abstract Dystopia

<p>Nothing quite compels you to buy into a game's stakes like happening upon the decaying carcass of a dog who's starved to death. This is the first of several emotional moments in After Us. The surrealistic set dressing of this 3D platformer is regularly morbid but it makes for quite a compelling dystopian world to explore, if only to satiate an innate curiosity--how did the Earth end up like this and is there anyone left? The simple combat and good-but-not-great platforming mechanics bog down the experience a bit but After Us' incredible environmental storytelling of a doomed world clinging to a feeble hope more than makes up for it.</p><p dir="ltr">In After Us, you play as Gaia, a young spirit tasked with tracking down and salvaging the souls of the last creatures on Earth. These include animals like the aforementioned canine, the last dog who died of hunger, and coming across others lead to plenty of somber moments of human cruelty--the last eagle caged and plucked, for instance, and the final whale to be harpooned. There's a present-day storyline that runs parallel that isn't all that interesting as it's difficult to relate to the mostly-silent Gaia, who displays small signs of emotion during certain cutscenes but seems to largely view the world around her with passivity. The history of this Earth's past, which you uncover in your pursuit of the lost animal souls and optional collectibles, is far more captivating and works as a strong narrative backbone for the platformer.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4142176-forest.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4142176-forest.jpg" /></a></figure><p dir="ltr">Running and jumping are Gaia's primary ways of navigating the world, and these actions are complemented by other platforming staples like hovering, rail-grinding, wall-running, and dashing. She's a bit too floaty and loose to control in certain platforming segments--there were quite a few moments where a frustrating mistiming meant I accidentally leaped over a floating chunk of freeway and plunged to my death or sprinted a step too far and skidded off the top of a skyscraper. Most often, failure was the result of the controls working against me, not my own mistakes. Thankfully, the checkpoint system in After Us is relatively forgiving so even the most irritating of deaths are only small setbacks.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/after-us-review-abstract-dystopia/1900-6418068/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> Goddess Statue quests are a series of objectives that you can tackle while you're exploring. In it, you'll have to find specific items that can only come from dragons. Here's our guide to help you with the Goddess Statue quests in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">How to complete all Goddess Statue quests in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">General tips: How to reach dragons and how to get claws</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Goddess Statue of Wisdom and Naydra</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="How_to_complete_all_Goddess_Statue_quests_in_The_Legend_of_Zelda__Tears_of_the_Kingdom">How to complete all Goddess Statue quests in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h2><h3 id="General_tips__How_to_reach_dragons_and_how_to_get_claws">General tips: How to reach dragons and how to get claws</h3><p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Goddess Statue quests come from three specific locations, which we tackle in this guide. However, before we get to those, here are some general tips:</p><ul><li>Upon completing your first quest (regardless of which one you tackle), you'll need to visit the Mother Goddess Statue. <strong>It can be found in the Forgotten Temple with coordinates: -1071, 2682, -0081</strong>. It's also the same place where you'd find the main map of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-geoglyphs-dragons-tears-guide/1100-6514026/"><strong>Geoglyphs/Dragon's Tears</strong></a>.</li><li>Each Goddess Statue quest requires you to get a claw from a specific dragon. We'll talk about their locations in a bit. Sufficed to say, though, each dragon follows a predetermined flight path that takes them across two regions in the Surface World, down through the Depths via a Chasm, then back again to the Surface World.</li><li>If you spot them in the sky, then you'll want to use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-skyview-towers-locations-guide/1100-6514025/"><strong>Skyview Towers</strong></a> or floating islands. You can also chase after them in the Depths, but it might be harder to see down there if you haven't tagged nearby Lightroots.</li><li>There are also environmental hazards to consider, so make sure you're wearing protective gear if you have it.</li><li>As for the claws themselves, you'll need to fly near them, then shoot their toes or claws. This can be iffy since the item doesn't immediately drop. Just keep trying and, if you really can't get it, you can reload your save, then rest overnight in-game.</li><li>If you manage to dislodge a claw item, it will be suspended in mid-air for a few seconds, before plummeting straight to the ground. Make sure you skydive to where it fell so you can pick it up.</li><li>To complete each objective, return to the Goddess Statue that requested the item. Then, drop the claw on the tile in front of them.</li></ul><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4141098-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-goddess-statue-quests-guide-1a.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1816/18167535/4141098-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-goddess-statue-quests-guide-1a.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4141099-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-goddess-statue-quests-guide-1b.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1816/18167535/4141099-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-goddess-statue-quests-guide-1b.jpg" />     </a>   </div>    <figcaption>Left: Mother Goddess Statue location/map; Right: Shooting Farosh&#039;s claw</figcaption> </figure><h3 id="Goddess_Statue_of_Wisdom_and_Naydra">Goddess Statue of Wisdom and Naydra</h3><p>For this Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Goddess Statue quest, you'll want to go to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-skyview-towers-locations-guide/1100-6514025/"><strong>Mount Lanayru Skyview Tower</strong></a>.

## Lego 2K Drive Review - Oh Snap

<p dir="ltr">Lego thrives on versatility and variety. The brand has become associated with everything from model towns to outer space to licensed franchises like Star Wars to original IP like Bionicle and Ninjago. Lego 2K Drive is relatively narrow compared to the wide array of Lego iconography, but that laser-like focus works in its favor. The team at 2K and Visual Concepts has made a great racing game first, allowing the Lego elements to organically add both an astounding amount of customization and flavorful visual flourishes to make a lively and enjoyable open-world driving experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Under the hood, Lego 2K Drive is a combination of open-world racing games like Burnout Paradise or Forza Horizon and kart racers like Mario Kart or Sonic All-Stars. The main campaign has you exploring three big biomes, each with their own wide variety of activities and events, punctuated by kart races against rival drivers who run these regions. But part of what makes both exploring and racing so fun is how toy-like it feels, thanks to some smart systems that remove any possible friction from exploration.</p><p dir="ltr">When driving around in a typical open-world racer, you may have to set a waypoint to your next objective and spend a few minutes making your way over by following the roads. In Lego 2K Drive, your vehicle auto-switches from roadster to off-road vehicle to boat based on whatever you need at a given time. The click-clack of your vehicle instantly reconstituting itself into something new when you hop from a road to a river just feels great every time. A generous nitro boost and a dedicated jump button mean you can hop over obstacles and scale hills with ease. Other cars or small buildings in the way? No problem, just smash right through them and they'll explode into a thousand Lego bricks, building your boost meter in the process. This effectively makes the whole world your playground, letting you carve paths through it. There's almost never a hard barrier between you and the fun.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-2k-drive-review-oh-snap/1900-6418067/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun Review - Purge And Tear
 - [https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-boltgun-review-purge-and-tear/1900-6418066/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-boltgun-review-purge-and-tear/1900-6418066/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

<p dir="ltr">The Boltgun is perhaps Warhammer 40,000's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glu0GmyTJyo&amp;ab_channel=GameSpot">most iconic weapon</a>, yet it took until now for a video game to really nail its pulverizing impact. The Space Marine's Bolter (as it's commonly known) is not the machine gun equivalent it's often portrayed as in other games. This powerful firearm is essentially a rapid-fire rocket launcher, capable of penetrating almost any armor and then blowing up the Imperium's enemies from the inside out. Developer Auroch Digital clearly understood the assignment with Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, as the eponymous weapon is tremendously fun to use as you rip and tear your way through eight hours of '90s-inspired first-person shooting. The Bolter roars with an emphatic racket, and each pull of the trigger packs an almighty punch, ferociously propelling these explosive rounds through flesh and bone until the battlefield is little more than a crimson pile of viscera and sinewy chunks.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Classic retro shooters like Unreal Tournament and Quake are obvious inspirations behind Boltgun's fast-paced and frenetic combat, but it's the original Doom that feels like the principal source of reverence. The use of 2D sprites alongside 3D environments, color-coded keycard hunting, and garish, over-the-top violence all harken back to id Software's seminal title. Boltgun is unashamedly a Doom clone with a Warhammer skin, but Auroch has sprinkled in some modern touches, too, from the dizzying amount of particle effects on screen at any one time, to the intricate level of detail found on each and every weapon, to the sheer scale of some of its environments. Verticality is also heavily emphasized, with a jump and mantle animation giving you the chance to scramble and leap off ledges, much like in 2016's Doom reboot. All of this leads to Boltgun managing to capture a tangible sense of nostalgia while also tapping into the fluidity and pacing of a contemporary shooter. It's a familiar but potent mix, resulting in a viscerally satisfying game that's relatively easy to pick up and play.</p><p dir="ltr">The story is suitably paltry, however, providing just enough setup to explain why you're on a distant planet mowing down anything that breathes in the name of the Inquisition. As battle-hardened Space Marine Malum Caedo, you're dispatched to the Adeptus Mechanicus Forge World of Graia to investigate some concerning goings-on. As it turns out, the Ad Mech were running experiments that have predictably gone awry and spawned a Chaos invasion. After a botched landing leaves you as the lone survivor, you're put to work cleansing the forces of Chaos armed with an ever-expanding supply of powerful weaponry.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-boltgun-review-purge-and-tear/1900-6418066/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Blizzard Is Reportedly Set To Unveil Its Own AI Tool For Concept Art

<p dir="ltr">Blizzard has apparently trained an AI image generator for concept art, and the company plans to display its capabilities internally sometime this year. The New York Times obtained an email to this effect from the company's chief design officer Allen Adham, who told employees that they should "prepare to be amazed" at what the tool can do.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/arts/blizzard-diffusion-ai-video-games.html">New York Times report</a>, the tool is called Blizzard Diffusion, which is an apparent reference to the popular AI image generator Stable Diffusion. Adham further claimed that the well-known studio is "on the brink of a major evolution in how we build and manage our games."</p><p dir="ltr">However, as the report notes, Blizzard has already abandoned one AI-powered tool that was supposed to help create environmental textures like stone and brick. Blizzard's vice president of global insights, Andrew Guerrero, told the Times that tool was not effective. But he also said that the goal of these AI tools was to "remove a repetitive and manual process and enable artists to spend more time on creativity." He further stated: "Our goal with AI has been, and will continue to be, to try to make creative work easier."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-reportedly-set-to-unveil-its-own-ai-tool-for-concept-art/1100-6514464/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Finally, Miles Morales is swinging into the Item Shop as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>'s latest Spider-Man skin--and he's bringing Miguel O'Hara, aka Spider-Man 2099, with him. But that's not all. With the conclusion of the Star Wars-themed Find the Force event, battle royale will once again have a distinctly spider-y flavor with the return of the Web-Shooter mythic, which now looks like Miles' black glove.</p><p>The Item Shop got an early morning reset to mark the start of this Spider-party. In the shop you'll find two new Spider-Men that you can pick up: the Spider-Man (Miles Morales) skin and the Spider-Man 2099 skin. Like the Spider-Gwen skin from the Chapter 3 Season 4 battle pass, Miles comes with a mask-off style in addition to his standard Spider-Man look--sorry, no jacket-and-shorts style here. Miles' back bling is the very trippy Spider-Verse Portal, and Spider-Ham's Mallet is his pickaxe. And the Mallet comes with the Put 'Er There emote, which lets you summon the Mallet regardless of what pickaxe you have equipped.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4141659-fortnitespider-man%28milesmorales%29cosmeticset.jpg"><img alt="Miles Morales' cosmetics set" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4141659-fortnitespider-man%28milesmorales%29cosmeticset.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Miles Morales' cosmetics set</figcaption></figure><p>The Spider-Man 2099 skin, meanwhile, does not have an unmasked style, but he does come with the reactive 2099 Web Cape back bling, which does this cool shimmer effect when you get an elimination. The 2099 set also includes the 928 Axes dual-wielding pickaxe.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-miles-morales-and-spider-man-2099-skins-debut-alongside-spider-verse-quests/1100-6514447/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Rumors of Keanu Reeves appearing in a Fast and Furious movie have been swirling for years, and it looks like the John Wick star was pretty close to landing a part in Fast X. Actor Alan Ritchson, who plays a villain named Aimes in Fast X, said he was not the first choice.</p><p><a href="https://ew.com/movies/alan-ritchson-fast-x-aimes-role-originally-keanu-reeves/?utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_entertainmentweekly&amp;utm_content=new&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_term=646bfd1adcfd9f00018d0e6b">Speaking to Entertainment Weekly</a>, Ritchson said it was "just a little stroke of luck and good timing" that he appeared in Fast X. Ritchson said he was filming Ordinary Angels with Hilary Swank when he got a call telling him that "things had shifted in the plans with Keanu Reeves." Ritchson would eventually sign on to play the role said to have been offered to Reeves.</p><p>"Tough act to follow," Ritchson said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-almost-appeared-in-fast-x/1100-6514458/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
