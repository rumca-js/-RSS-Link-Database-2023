When the kids were little and we were at the kind of event where they
might get separated from us, I'd write my phone number on tape
and stick it to their backs:

The kids are getting older now, and are playing independently enough
that it would be good if they always had my phone number.  Lily (9yo)
has had a piece of paper in her backpack for a while now, but unless
she's going to or from school she won't have it with her.  Several
rounds of "repeat after me" weren't working, so this weekend we made
up a song for it.  After just a few times singing it she has it down.

This may be a trick that works unusually well for Lily, since she's
pretty musical, but the popularity of <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhoneNumberJingle">jingles
for phone numbers</a> in advertising makes me think this would work
for others?
