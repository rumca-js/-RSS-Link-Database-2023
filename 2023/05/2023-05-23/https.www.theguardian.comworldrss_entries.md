<p>He had personal audiences with Queen Elizabeth II and held national treasure status – until the world discovered the awful truth</p><p>When Rolf Harris died at 93, he ended his life as a convicted paedophile. Since his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/19/rolf-harris-released-prison-after-almost-three-years">release from prison</a> in 2017, after serving almost three years, he had lived as a virtual recluse with his wife of 64 years, Alwen Hughes. He had neck cancer, and the only visitors to their house in Bray, Berkshire were carers and nurses.</p><p>It was a long way from his days as a national treasure. Once, the artist, musician and entertainer had spent much of his time visiting Buckingham Palace to collect a series of honours. He made two appearances on the UK version of This Is Your Life and performed his music at high-profile gigs across the country. His paintings, which once fetched six-figure sums, can now be picked up for a fraction of their former value.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/23/from-childrens-entertainer-to-convicted-criminal-the-downfall-of-rolf-harris">Continue reading...</a>

In a message seen by the Guardian, a senior Democratic Senate staffer predicted disaster. “I think we will default”, the staffer said. “I think most House Republicans want a default so even if McCarthy could make a deal, he won’t have the votes to pass it.”</p><p><strong>What else is happening in Washington DC?</strong> A Nazi swastika flag has been found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/23/white-house-driver-detained-after-truck-crashes-into-security-barriers-near-residence">after a rented truck crashed into security barriers</a> on Lafayette Square, adjacent to the White House grounds in Washington DC.

<p>Former deputy PM becomes 37th Conservative MP to announce they will stand down</p><p>Good morning. ‘Where you still up for Raab?” used to be a niche Westminster joke about the next general election, highlighting the fact that <strong>Dominic Raab</strong>, the former deputy PM, was widely expected to be one of the most high-profile Tory losses on election night last year, just as Michael Portillo was in 1997. It was never a particularly good comparison, because Portillo’s defeat was unexpected, whereas Raab’s is already priced in, but now the only thing it can refer to is the moment the Daily Telegraph dropped last night, with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/05/22/dominic-raab-quits-politics-family-pressure-resignation/">the story</a> that Raab is standing down. Our version is here.</p><p>Raab, who is only 49, has written a letter to the chair of the Conservative association in Esher and Walton, his constituency, saying that one of the factors behind his decision is “the pressure the job has placed on my young family”. He has two sons, aged 10 and eight. This may well be true. But at Westminster it will be taken for granted that he is announcing his decision to stand down now because he assumes he will lose his seat. His majority over the Liberal Democrats at the last election was just 2,743, and Esther and Walton is one of their top targets.</p><p>The local elections in May showed people are fed up with Conservative MPs taking them for granted. It’s not just Dominic Raab who should go, it’s this whole sleaze-ridden Conservative government.</p><p>We will be fighting hard at the next election to finally give the people of Esher and Walton the strong local champion they deserve.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/may/23/dominic-raab-conservatives-lib-dems-election-rishi-sunak-suella-braverman-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>
