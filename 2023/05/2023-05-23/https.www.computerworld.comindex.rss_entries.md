<p>Microsoft is all in on artificial intelligence (AI) for a very simple reason: it believes <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3691895/how-microsoft-became-tech-s-top-dog-again.html">its lead in the technology will make it the tech world’s top dog again</a>. Microsoft is far behind Google in search and browsers, but it believes AI can help it eat into that lead, or even make Microsoft dominant.</p><p>The stakes couldn’t be higher. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood recently told analysts that <a href="https://money.yahoo.com/microsofts-bing-is-the-first-threat-to-googles-search-dominance-in-decades-210913597.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a single percentage point of market share in search advertising is worth $2 billion</a>.

So, there’s a lot of upside for Microsoft to reap billions if it can edge closer to Google. And that’s just in search. Microsoft sees more <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3694091/here-s-how-microsoft-plans-to-reap-billions-from-ai.html">billions in additional AI-driven money in the cloud, productivity tools and more</a>.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3697014/ethics-what-ethics-for-microsoft-its-full-speed-ahead-on-ai.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
