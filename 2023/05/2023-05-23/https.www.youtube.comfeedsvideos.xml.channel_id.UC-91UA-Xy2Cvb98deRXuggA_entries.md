In this eye-opening video, we delve into the world of the ultra-wealthy and their astonishing ability to pay little to no taxes! Discover the legal strategies and controversial loopholes used by businesses and wealthy individuals to avoid hefty tax bills while staying incredibly rich. We clarify the distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion to shed light on how these tactics are within the bounds of the law.

Join us as we explore fascinating methods like the "double Irish arrangement," where companies move profits from high-tax countries to subsidiaries in low-tax countries by purchasing their own intellectual property. We also uncover the power of depreciation, where companies spread asset costs over time to reduce taxes.

Learn about stock options, research and development tax credits, debt financing, using losses to offset income, and accelerated depreciation—these are just a few of the clever techniques employed by the wealthy to slash their tax liabilities.
