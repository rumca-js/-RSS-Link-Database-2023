## Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai review – lesser yet passable animated prequel

<p>The much-loved Gremlins movies get a serviceable kid-friendly series that looks back at an origin story with increasing elements of fan service</p><p>In this era of particularly craven IP mining, trading on particularly grotesque bouts of seemingly incurable nostalgia, it’s a wonder that a couple of major Amblin-produced classics from the mid-1980s, Back to the Future and Gremlins, have managed to escape any major big-screen revival since their sequels ran out in 1990.</p><p>The closest thing to Back to the Future Part IV was either a theme-park ride, a video game, or a short-lived Saturday morning cartoon; now an animated approximation of Gremlins 3 arrives on HBO’s newly rechristened streaming service Max. Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai isn’t exactly like the cheesy Saturday morning brand-extensions of old, but it’s a refreshingly kid-friendly offshoot – a fun bit of ancillary material for older fans and (presumably) their offspring that doesn’t get too self-serious about (gag) the Gremlins mythology. In fact, one of the best things about Secrets of the Mogwai is the way that mythology weaves Gremlins backstory in with a bunch of other folklore.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/23/gremlins-secrets-of-the-mogwai-movie-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Just like Kier Starmer’s Labour, Biden’s Democrats need to stop taking young people’s support for granted. It’s not enough to say that they’re better than the competition</p><p>Donald Trump started it. In March 2020 the former president froze federal student loan repayments as an emergency pandemic measure. Since then the payment pause has been extended eight times by two administrations. More than 40 million Americans haven’t had to pay a penny on their federal student loans for three years, and there was hope that the extensions would keep coming. Those hopes were dashed last week, however, when the White House confirmed that the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4006848-pause-on-student-loan-payments-about-to-end-for-millions/">pandemic emergency was over</a> and payments will resume later this year.</p><p>So when is D-day? Bear with me here, because the US government doesn’t like making things simple. Payments are to resume 60 days after 30 June or<em>, </em>if it comes first, 60 days after the supreme court issues its ruling on whether or not president Joe Biden is allowed to follow through on his campaign promise of forgiving up to $20,000 of student loans for millions of borrowers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/23/payment-pause-on-student-loans-coming-to-an-end-for-millions-of-us-borrowers-arwa-mahdawi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anti-abortion legislators are trying to change the state’s ballot initiative rules to require a supermajority for a ballot to pass</p><p>On 10 May, a group of religious leaders huddled to pray in a circle in front of the Ohio state capitol. Inside the statehouse, Republicans were voting on a <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/05/11/ohio-lawmakers-send-60-supermajority-amendment-to-the-ballot/">bill</a> that could thwart advocates’ efforts to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.</p><p>In the group of clergy was the Rev Terry Williams, a pastor who lives in a small town about 50 miles (80km) south of Columbus. When a congregant confided in Williams in 2012 that she needed an abortion, the pastor struggled to find a clinic – there are currently only six in the state of Ohio.

## Blood of the Virgin by Sammy Harkham review – to live and cry in LA

<p>The cartoonist’s singular book, 14 years in the making, imbues the tale of a harried 1970s B-movie editor with panoramic scope </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/21/the-faber-observer-comica-graphic-short-story-prize-2023-enter-now">Enter the Faber/Observer/Comica graphic short story prize 2023</a></li></ul><p>I mean it as a compliment when I say that Sammy Harkham’s <em>Blood of the Virgin</em> is a very nerdy kind of comic; if you’re a fan of cartoonists such as Joe Matt or Seth, and their intense feeling for lonely, hapless men, you’ll find plenty to enjoy here. Like some of their work, superficially it’s a nostalgic beast, one set mostly in the Los Angeles film industry. It’s 1971, the year of <em>Dirty Harry, Diamonds Are Forever</em> and <em>The French Connectio</em>n, though you’d never know it: in Harkham’s universe, the Hollywood sign is far, far away. But there’s a lot going on here besides. Its hero, Seymour, is a 27-year-old movie editor at an exploitation film company who also happens to be a Jewish Iraqi immigrant. If the book is about one man’s struggle to become an artist in a city that cares nothing for losers, it’s also about the Jewish experience in the period when thousands of Holocaust survivors were still around to tell their stories. It is, in other words, as much about inherited guilt as it is about rank ambition.</p><p>Seymour, self-absorbed and chaotic, spends his days in the dark, splicing together the terrible B-movies churned out by his toad-like boss, Val. His days are long, and at the end of them, he goes home to a small baby, his first child, who’s apt to let neither one of his parents get any sleep. In the small rented house he shares with his wife, tension is sky-high, and not only because of Junior. Ida feels neglected by her husband, and as an Ashkenazi (her family’s roots are Hungarian), she ’s treated like an alien by Seymour’s relatives. Half the time, they refuse even to believe she is Jewish. While the couple dote on their son – “Put him between two slices of bread and eat him all up!” says Ida, when Seymour admits he could squeeze him half to death – they kvetch constantly, and eventually, Ida disappears to New Zealand to be with her silent, damaged parents.</p><p><em>Blood of the Virgin</em> by Sammy Harkham is published by Pantheon Graphic Library (£25).

One, because I thought he would, and should, play a few more years. He was still in game shape and could bring a veteran scoring presence to any team in the NBA.</p><p>The second reason is because I am in the middle of the most consequential separation of my adult life with the woman I still consider my soul mate. Like with Anthony, or Melo, as he is known affectionately by his fans, there was no obvious inciting incident. Melo and the game seemed to drift apart and neither could give the other what they wanted. The same can be said for my former partner and me. The <a href="https://twitter.com/carmeloanthony/status/1660639136242343936">video he released</a> showcasing his amazing journey from the gang-infested streets of Baltimore, to the mountaintop of Syracuse, to becoming the ninth leading scorer in NBA history broke me. I had yet to cry for the ending of my relationship, but Monday’s news brought it my grief to the fore: one of our favorite rituals was watching the NBA and cheering for the Knicks together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/23/carmelo-anthonys-flawed-genius-hit-different-because-i-saw-his-faults-in-myself">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Karelian bear dogs are being used to scare wild bears from human settlements and reduce human-wildlife conflict</p><p>The dog is moving through the grasses of the open meadow, closely followed by bear biologist Carrie Hunt, who is observing his reactions as he sees the grizzly bear carcass for the first time. “Find it,” says Hunt, encouraging the two-month-old puppy. The puppy’s ears and tail are up as he approaches the bear cautiously, but with the confidence that Hunt is looking for in a bear conflict dog.</p><p>This is a Karelian bear dog, a hardy breed from Finland known to be fearless and capable of standing up to large mammals such as brown bears and moose. People once used the dogs to hunt big game in regions that now are part of Russia and Finland.
