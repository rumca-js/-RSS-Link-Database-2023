While Ryu is very much the main character of the Street Fighter franchise, Ken Masters is not far behind him in the pecking order.

Ken in particular is set to play an important role in the upcoming sequel, so ahead of the game's imminent launch, here, we're going to take a look at his story in the Street Fighter series so far.

After Us doesn't reinvent the wheel in platforming and exploration, but it offers very compelling gameplay in both areas. The abstract art style is vivid and raw - all over the place, at times, but in a good way, while the environmental story-telling (outside of the Memories) is solid. 

Mild performance hiccups can be annoying, and the combat is mostly fine without being extraordinary. However, if you can face your future failures, it's a somber yet endearing journey down the rabbit hole.

Silent Hill is back with Bloober Team working on a remake of the critically acclaimed Silent Hill 2. How that will ultimately pan out remains to be seen, but it's looking gorgeous. It's also working on a new survival horror IP published by Private Division, which isn't out until 2025, but maybe we'll see an announcement before the year is out.

In the meantime, Bloober Team, along with Anshar Studios, has...Layers of Fear. You're probably wondering if this is the same as the 2016 first-person psychological horror title, which brought more attention to Bloober Team's potential (for better or worse). With a release date of June 15th, what can fans expect? What are some differences between it and the first game in the series? Here are 11 of the biggest changes you should know about.

Miasma Chronicles is a great extension of what made Mutant Year Zero fun. It combines turn-based tactical gameplay with a fun story set in an immensely-interesting and fleshed-out world. 

While its gameplay isn’t going to seem too deep for anyone that’s spent some time with modern real time strategy games, it still manages to offer a decent amount of challenge and tactical options, especially once you start unlocking magical abilities that help you manipulate the battlefield. Despite its sometimes-awkward writing, Miasma Chronicles is certainly a game worth your time.
