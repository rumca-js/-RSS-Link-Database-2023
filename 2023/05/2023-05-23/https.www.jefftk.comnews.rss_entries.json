Lily (9yo)\nhas had a piece of paper in her backpack for a while now, but unless\nshe's going to or from school she won't have it with her.  Several\nrounds of \"repeat after me\" weren't working, so this weekend we made\nup a song for it.  After just a few times singing it she has it down.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis may be a trick that works unusually well for Lily, since she's\npretty musical, but the popularity of <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhoneNumberJingle\">jingles\nfor phone numbers</a> in advertising makes me think this would work\nfor others?\n\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/phone-number-jingle", "date_published": "2023-05-23 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
