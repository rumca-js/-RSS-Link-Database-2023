Sometimes the hero you are meant to be lies just beneath the surface. Check out the new trailer for Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, an upcoming DreamWorks Animation film starring Lana Condor, Jaboukie Young-White, Toni Collette, Jane Fonda, Annie Murphy, Colman Domingo, Sam Richardson, and Blue Chapman. The film also stars Will Forte, Nicole Byer, Liza Koshy, Ramona Young, Eduardo Franco, and Echo Kellum.

This summer, DreamWorks Animation dives into the turbulent waters of high school with a hilarious, heartfelt action comedy about a shy teenager who discovers that she’s part of a legendary royal lineage of mythical sea krakens and that her destiny, in the depths of the oceans, is bigger than she ever dreamed. 

Sweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor) is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible. 

She’s math-tutoring her skater-boy crush (Jaboukie Young-White), who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she’s prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom (Toni Collette), has forbade Ruby from ever getting in the water. 

But when she breaks her mom’s #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother (Academy Award® winner Jane Fonda), the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas. 

The Kraken are sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There’s one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school’s beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Annie Murphy) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most. 

The film is directed by Kirk DeMicco and produced by Kelly Cooney Cilella, with Faryn Pearl serving as co-director.

Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken will be available in theaters on June 30, 2023.

## Warhammer 40K: Boltgun Review

Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun reviewed by Jon Bolding on PC. Also available on Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.

Boltgun impresses with Warhammer 40K chops and a fully realized vision of the famous franchise as a modern retro-shooter, light on story but heavy on action and nods to the tabletop game. The level design of its many fast-paced arena fights is enjoyable, but the momentum drags once the new weapon and enemy types run out about halfway through. Nonetheless, the quality's high enough that I never got bored – but I think someone who isn't hungry for a retro-shooter or any 40K game they can get their hands on might be a bit let down.

After Us reviewed by Gabriel Moss on PlayStation 5. Also available on PS4, Xbox, and PC.

After Us is difficult to recommend for its platforming alone, though its nature-focused kitsch gives way to gorgeous visuals as you breathe life back into its post-apocalyptic world. Some of its levels left a grin on my face, whereas others had me begging for sweet release from the inconsistent controls and directionless world. At least there’s a silver lining in that its beautiful art direction and entrancing musical score make for some really cool sequences. And yet I can’t help but feel like After Us is too heavy-handed about its environmentalist themes for a video game that hardly characterizes its protagonist and has literally no dialogue. By the end, I felt like I’d have done less environmental damage had I simply chosen to skip it.
