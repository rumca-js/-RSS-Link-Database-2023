There\u2019s one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school\u2019s beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Emmy winner Annie Murphy, Schitt\u2019s Creek) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most. \n\n\u25ba Learn more: https://www.fandango.com/?cmp=Trailers_YouTube_Desc \n\nWatch More:  \n\u25ba Rotten Tomatoes Originals: http://bit.ly/2D3sipV    \n\u25ba Fresh New Clips: https://bit.ly/3mJePrv    \n\u25ba Hot New Trailers: http://bit.ly/2qThrsF   \n\u25ba New TV This Week: https://bit.ly/3Or3I2w   \n \nRotten Tomatoes TRAILERS delivers hot new trailers, exclusive content, and first looks for all the best upcoming movies.
