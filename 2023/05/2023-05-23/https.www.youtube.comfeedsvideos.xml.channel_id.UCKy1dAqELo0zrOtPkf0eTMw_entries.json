Check out the new trailer for Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, an upcoming DreamWorks Animation film starring Lana Condor, Jaboukie Young-White, Toni Collette, Jane Fonda, Annie Murphy, Colman Domingo, Sam Richardson, and Blue Chapman. The film also stars Will Forte, Nicole Byer, Liza Koshy, Ramona Young, Eduardo Franco, and Echo Kellum.\n\nThis summer, DreamWorks Animation dives into the turbulent waters of high school with a hilarious, heartfelt action comedy about a shy teenager who discovers that she\u2019s part of a legendary royal lineage of mythical sea krakens and that her destiny, in the depths of the oceans, is bigger than she ever dreamed. \n\nSweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor) is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible. \n\nShe\u2019s math-tutoring her skater-boy crush (Jaboukie Young-White), who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she\u2019s prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom (Toni Collette), has forbade Ruby from ever getting in the water. \n\nBut when she breaks her mom\u2019s #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother (Academy Award\u00ae winner Jane Fonda), the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas. \n\nThe Kraken are sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There\u2019s one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school\u2019s beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Annie Murphy) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most. \n\nThe film is directed by Kirk DeMicco and produced by Kelly Cooney Cilella, with Faryn Pearl serving as co-director.\n\nRuby Gillman, Teenage Kraken will be available in theaters on June 30, 2023.\n\n#IGN #Dreamworks #Movies", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdWo2te83GE", "date_published": "2023-05-23 19:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "The Callisto Protocol - Official Riot Mode Bundle Trailer", "description": "The Callisto Protocol has launched a new game mode called Riot Mode enabling players access to the ultimate test to compete for high scores.
