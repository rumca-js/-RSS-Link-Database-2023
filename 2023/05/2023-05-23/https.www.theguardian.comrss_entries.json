This was done because Edgardo\u2019s doting Catholic nursemaid had claimed that when Edgardo was a baby, and apparently in dire sickness, she had presumed to carry out an emergency baptism, because she feared Edgardo would die and go to limbo. The fanatical Inquisition authorities affected to believe that the Jewish family would therefore \u201csacrifice\u201d the now-Catholic child, and jumped at the chance to punish the Jewish community and inflate their own missionary self-importance. Edgardo, extensively brainwashed, grew up to be a priest and vehement partisan of the church.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/23/kidnapped-review-marco-bellocchios-antisemitism-drama-is-a-classic-in-the-making\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/23/kidnapped-review-marco-bellocchios-antisemitism-drama-is-a-classic-in-the-making", "date_published": "2023-05-23 22:05:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Pep Guardiola calls for quick verdicts on Manchester City charges", "description": "<ul><li>Club faces more than 100 charges of financial wrongdoing</li><li>Manager says he will stay while matter is unresolved</li></ul><p>Pep Guardiola has urged the Premier League to speed up its handling of the case against Manchester City, after sowing confusion over whether he plans to stay at the club.</p><p>The manager, who called for a verdict \u201cthis afternoon\u201d or \u201ctomorrow\u201d, insisted he would continue next season even if more than 100 charges were unresolved after raising doubt over his future when asked whether he could leave if the treble was won.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/23/pep-guardiola-calls-for-quick-verdicts-on-manchester-city-charges\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/23/pep-guardiola-calls-for-quick-verdicts-on-manchester-city-charges", "date_published": "2023-05-23 21:30:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Justin Welby proposes amendments to \u2018morally unacceptable\u2019 illegal migration bill", "description": "<p>Archbishop of Canterbury calls on ministers to implement strategies on human trafficking and the refugee crisis </p><p>The archbishop of Canterbury has proposed two amendments to the government\u2019s flagship illegal migration bill that he had earlier deemed \u201cmorally unacceptable\u201d.</p><p>With the controversial plans to enter the committee stage in the House of Lords on Wednesday, Justin Welby called on ministers to implement 10-year strategies for tackling human trafficking and for an international collaboration to solving the refugee crises.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/may/23/justin-welby-proposes-amendments-to-morally-unacceptable-migration-bill\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/may/23/justin-welby-proposes-amendments-to-morally-unacceptable-migration-bill", "date_published": "2023-05-23 21:29:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Stuart Broad: \u2018This is the biggest Ashes buildup \u2013 I\u2019m loving the circus\u2019", "description": "<p>Fully fit and raring to go, the England bowler has been preparing new deliveries for Australia\u2019s best batters</p><p>Three weeks out from the Ashes, at least one of England\u2019s quicks is in good fettle.

Baking chocolate, for example, often contains added oils and fats, which make it less reliable, so Gill suggests using a 70-72% bar from the confectionery aisle instead. And, says Joanna Brennan, co-founder of <a href=\"https://pumpstreetchocolate.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwjMiiBhA4EiwAZe6jQ58xIT8QyYj6fY1ZwK36Uq3zUY38z-MDAkYw8FhiH4QyuFipw6dI7xoCixsQAvD_BwE\">Pump Street Chocolate</a> in Orford, Suffolk, buy the best quality you can afford: \u201cTruffles and ganache are 100% based on the taste of the chocolate and cream.\u201d (At their simplest, they are, after all, just two parts chocolate to one part cream.)</p><p>That said, technique is by far the most likely cause for Louise\u2019s oily mess, and specifically her use of the microwave. \u201cThey get things very hot very quickly,\u201d says Gill\u2019s fellow Guardian columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benjamina-ebuehi\">Benjamina Ebuehi</a>. \u201cIt sounds as if the temperature of Louise\u2019s chocolate is getting really high, and causing the fat in the chocolate to separate and go oily.\u201d For this reason, Brennan, Gill and Ebuehi all heat their cream in a pan on the stove, then pour it over the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to bring the cream to a boil, but you want it hot enough that it\u2019s steaming,\u201d Ebuehi says. And chop the chocolate finely (and all roughly the same size): \u201cThat way, it will melt evenly, and you won\u2019t have to agitate it as much, which can also make it split.\u201d Once the cream and chocolate are together, Gill leaves the bowl to stand for 30 seconds to a minute, and then, using a hand whisk, \u201cslowly mix from the middle only, until it resembles ganache. Then, use the whisk to stir from the edges into the middle.\u201d You\u2019re looking only to combine the mix evenly, Gill says, not to incorporate any air.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?
