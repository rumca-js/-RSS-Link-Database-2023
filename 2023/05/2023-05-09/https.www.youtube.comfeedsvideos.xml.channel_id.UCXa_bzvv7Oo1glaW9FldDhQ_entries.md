In the coming months and years, Xbox will have to go through a period of self reflection and rebuilding, and I imagine they will have to decide how best to proceed in the market from here on out. I wish them all the luck (because I really do want them to do well), but they need to understand the centrality of games to this whole exercise - games need to be at the center of everything they do, and they need to design what informs and guides their engagement with games as a creative medium to begin with. 

Failure to do this will only continue to result in more misfires and third place finishes for Xbox in the future.
