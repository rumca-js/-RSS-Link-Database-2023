The Rubber Ducky? Basic. The Flipper Zero? Child’s play. This is the O.MG Cable, a stealthy, powerful hacking tool that allows the attacker to log your keystrokes, access your device, and emulate both keyboard and mouse movements. It's priced accessibly for the average consumer, and could be used to juice jack your phone or laptop. How do you protect yourself from such a device?
