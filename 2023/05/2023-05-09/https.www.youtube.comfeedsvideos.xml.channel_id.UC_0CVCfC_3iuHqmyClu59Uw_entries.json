In my experience Oculink is Cheaper and faster than Thunderbolt or USB4 so this is pretty awesome that they have added an external port! By adding a Graphics card over oculink you can easily turn the GPD Win Max 2 into a full Desktop Gaming PC! We test out A Radeon RX6600 but you can whatever card you want.\n\nBuy The Oculink Kit Here: https://amzn.to/44DPKTH\nPower Supply:https://amzn.to/3HQgzu8\nRX6600: https://amzn.to/3VL9yk7\nPVC Sheet, PALIGHT:https://amzn.to/41gpGer\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nEquipment I Use:\nMonitor: Pixio 277 Pro On Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PGUBwe\nElgato HD60 X Screen Capture Device: https://amzn.to/3GkP2AL\nTool Kit: https://amzn.to/3Wo8bpX\nCamera: https://amzn.to/3XJfFoI\n\nDISCLAIMER: This video and description contains affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, I\u2019ll receive a small commission at no extra cost to you!\nUnder section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \u201cfair use\u201d for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, and research.\nNo Games Are Included Or Added\n\nThis video and Channel and Video are for viewers 14 years older and up.
