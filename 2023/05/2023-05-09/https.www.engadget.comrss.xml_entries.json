It can link text, images / videos, audio, 3D measurements (depth), temperature data (thermal), and motion data (from inertial measurement units) \u2014&nbsp;and it does this without having to first train on every possibility. It\u2019s an early stage of a framework that could eventually generate complex environments from an input as simple as a text prompt, image or audio recording (or some combination of the three).</p><p>You could view ImageBind as moving machine learning closer to human learning. For example, if you\u2019re standing in a stimulating environment like a busy city street, your brain (largely unconsciously) absorbs the sights, sounds and other sensory experiences to infer information about passing cars and pedestrians, tall buildings, weather and much more. Humans and other animals evolved to process this data for our genetic advantage: survival and passing on our DNA. (The more aware you are of your surroundings, the more you can avoid danger and adapt to your environment for better survival and prosperity.) As computers get closer to mimicking animals\u2019 multi-sensory connections, they can use those links to generate fully realized scenes based only on limited chunks of data.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>So, while you can use Midjourney to prompt \u201ca basset hound wearing a Gandalf outfit while balancing on a beach ball\u201d and get a relatively realistic photo of this bizarre scene, a multimodal AI tool like ImageBind may eventually create a video of the dog with corresponding sounds, including a detailed suburban living room, the room\u2019s temperature and the precise locations of the dog and anyone else in the scene. \u201cThis creates distinctive opportunities to create animations out of static images by combining them with audio prompts,\u201d Meta researchers said today in a developer-focused blog post. \u201cFor example, a creator could couple an image with an alarm clock and a rooster crowing, and use a crowing audio prompt to segment the rooster or the sound of an alarm to segment the clock and animate both into a video sequence.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"Series of two graphs with the title \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/d4b8b710-ee90-11ed-bc76-f0a440a4a7c9\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Meta\u2019s graph showing ImageBind\u2019s accuracy outperforming single-mode models.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Meta</div></figure><p>As for what else one could do with this new toy, it points clearly to one of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-reconfirms-its-commitment-to-the-metaverse-120640616.html\">Meta\u2019s core ambitions</a>: VR, mixed reality and the metaverse. For example, imagine a future headset that can construct fully realized 3D scenes (with sound, movement, etc.) on the fly. Or, virtual game developers could perhaps eventually use it to take much of the legwork out of their design process. Similarly, content creators could make immersive videos with realistic soundscapes and movement based on only text, image or audio input. It\u2019s also easy to imagine a tool like ImageBind opening new doors in the accessibility space, generating real-time multimedia descriptions to help people with vision or hearing disabilities better perceive their immediate environments.</p><p>\u201cIn typical AI systems, there is a specific embedding (that is, vectors of numbers that can represent data and their relationships in machine learning) for each respective modality,\u201d said Meta. \u201cImageBind shows that it\u2019s possible to create a joint embedding space across multiple modalities without needing to train on data with every different combination of modalities. This is important because it\u2019s not feasible for researchers to create datasets with samples that contain, for example, audio data and thermal data from a busy city street, or depth data and a text description of a seaside cliff.\u201d</p><p>Meta views the tech as eventually expanding beyond its current six \u201csenses,\u201d so to speak. \u201cWhile we explored six modalities in our current research, we believe that introducing new modalities that link as many senses as possible \u2014 like touch, speech, smell, and brain fMRI signals \u2014 will enable richer human-centric AI models.\u201d Developers interested in exploring this new sandbox can start by diving into <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookresearch/ImageBind\">Meta\u2019s open-source code</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/metas-open-source-imagebind-ai-aims-to-mimic-human-perception-181500560.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/metas-open-source-imagebind-ai-aims-to-mimic-human-perception-181500560.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-09 18:15:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "A robot puppet rolled through San Francisco singing Vanessa Carlton hits", "description": "<p>With an instantly recognizable hook and effervescent melody, Vanessa Carlton\u2019s debut single <em>A Thousand Miles</em> hit the 2002 Billboard Charts like a neutron bomb, earning nominations for the Grammy Award for Song of the Year and the Billboard Music Award for Top 40 Track of the Year.

Earlier this year, the US Marshals Service division of the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/major-us-marshals-service-hack-compromises-sensitive-info-rcna72581\">became a target</a>, when hackers stole personal information about investigation targets, personnel and more.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The attacks were targeted, usually seeking out some type of sensitive state information. But we all have sensitive information stored throughout federal agencies like our social security numbers or home addresses. Probably even more information is at stake if you utilize federal services like Medicare, student loans or SNAP benefits. We have no choice but to give the federal government access to our personal information in exchange for certain services, unless you\u2019re reading this while living off grid.</p><p>\u201cIf we want to live in the information age, and we're using some of these systems, we are inherently giving up control,\u201d Kevin Cleary, clinical assistant professor of management science and systems at University at Buffalo, told Engadget. \u201cYou have to trust that agency has put forward all the best controls and practices.\u201d</p><p>In response, the federal government has developed agencies like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to lead better security initiatives across departments. In part, this is intended to help you feel a little bit better about storing your data within federal servers by setting higher standards for how it safeguards your data. According to Michael Duffy, associate director of the cybersecurity division at CISA, since the agency\u2019s establishment in 2018, it\u2019s spearheaded the most progress he\u2019s seen in his federal cybersecurity career.</p><p>So, things are improving, and you can probably trust the federal government to keep your data safe in the same way you trust the companies you interact with everyday. What makes the government so different, though, is that it\u2019s a high profile target. Adversarial countries want in on state secrets while, at the same time, it\u2019s hard to prioritize spending on security measures. Getting tax-payer funds to fill a pothole on your local highway is hard enough when the damage is tangible and obvious, while security is hard to quantify the benefits of until an attack occurs. In other words, the value of security investments aren\u2019t proven until it\u2019s already too late.</p><p>This has gotten better. Security investments in the federal government <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/budget/2023/03/federal-it-spending-in-2024-request-up-by-13-in-part-thanks-to-cyber-cx-plans/\">largely trend upwards</a>. Still, it\u2019s not enough. \u201cSometimes their budgets don't allow them to take every step or to everything that they would like to do, because you just simply don't have the money,\u201d Marisol Cruz Cain, director of information technology and cybersecurity at GAO, said.</p><p>But the reason why the federal government may appear less secure is because of its obligation for transparency. There\u2019s a responsibility to share lessons learned after an incident, and make sure citizens know what happened. That\u2019s actually a big part of CISA\u2019s job. \u201cWe are really looking at ways that we are making it more acceptable to raise the hand and say this is the way that we were attacked or an incident occurred,\u201d Duffy said.</p><p>The government also interacts with a ton of outside businesses. So, say a government contractor experiences a breach or security incident, that means that data held in federal tech could be exposed. This opens up a slew of new attack vectors, and possibilities for malpractice.</p><p>You can actually see how secure certain agencies are thanks to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and legislation like the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act. The latter <a href=\"https://fitara.meritalk.com/\">documents tech modernization efforts across major agencies</a>, including cyber readiness. GAO, for its part, audits cybersecurity efforts and develops <a href=\"https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/privacy-impact-assessments-pia\">privacy impact assessments</a> that are publicly available descriptions about what information the agency collects, how they use it and more.</p><p>But with all these audits come a relatively bleak conclusion. Agencies aren\u2019t evaluating their policies and procedures to make sure that high profile incidents don\u2019t happen on a regular basis, Cruz Cain said. Your information will be on those servers whether you like it or not.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-government-is-very-hackable-and-they-have-your-data-163034576.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-government-is-very-hackable-and-they-have-your-data-163034576.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-09 16:30:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K Max drops back to $35", "description": "<p>When it comes to streaming devices, there\u2019s almost too much choice out there.

Apart from that, it's largely identical to the S6.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While most details remain a mystery, there are some likely improvements. The S8 is still built using an old 7-nanometer manufacturing process, while an S9 is more likely to be made on a denser and more efficient 5nm or 4nm process. That could not only boost performance, but extend battery life. Apple has historically introduced new Apple Watches in September.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple Watch Series 9 is otherwise believed to be an iterative update. Gurman previously suggested there will be no major design or feature changes. You may get the Bluetooth 5.3 support that came with the Ultra, but there might not be much incentive to upgrade if you already have a Series 7 or newer. For owners of older models, however, a speedier processor may help justify an upgrade on top of all the refinements from recent years.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-9-may-finally-get-a-new-processor-151516259.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-9-may-finally-get-a-new-processor-151516259.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-09 15:15:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The 'Fall Guys' level creator promises more chaos than ever", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/fall-guys/\"><em><ins>Fall Guys</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is getting a shot in the arm this week with the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fall-guys-nintendo-switch-xbox-172125114.html\"><ins>long-awaited level creator</ins></a>, which players can use to build their own levels (known as rounds).

Hopefully, that's something Mediatonic addresses swiftly.</p><p>Aside from that, creating a level is a cinch. It doesn't take long to build a tower with fans, bounce pads and boxing gloves that can send beans off the map and back to the start line if they're not careful. You can't go too off the rails with your rounds, though. There's a limit on how many objects you can include and you'll need to beat your levels yourself before you can publish and share them.</p><p>The creative mode had to be robust, since Mediatonic is using the same tools to build its own levels. The toolset has allowed the developers to create 50 new rounds for this season, more than ever before.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/23652011/fortnite-unreal-editor-creative-2-0-modding-tools-release-date\"><ins>Extensive options</ins></a> for creativity have helped <em>Fortnite </em>enshrine itself as one of the biggest games in the world.

I made one, Marie Kondo-inspired level in <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> and then went back to trying out other players' creations.

The company plans to test a similar program for Reels creators on Instagram in the \u201ccoming weeks.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Notably, Meta is structuring the program a bit differently than typical revenue sharing arrangements. The company says it will pay creators using \u201ca new payout model that pays creators based on the performance of their public reels, not the earnings of ads on their reels\u201d and that \u201cinitially, payouts in the test will be determined by the number of plays.\u201d In other words, creators who rack up the highest number of views will earn the most, regardless of other engagement metrics or how much ad revenue their clips generate.</p><p>The decision to prioritize views apparently came as a result of the company\u2019s earlier tests, with Meta noting that payments based on ad performance can sometimes negatively impact creators for things out of their control, like the company\u2019s own ad inventory. Those terms are also likely a reflection of the fact that while Reels drive a lot of engagement for Meta, the feature hasn\u2019t proven to be as <a href=\"https://qz.com/one-meta-feature-is-cannibalizing-its-facebook-feed-and-1850381645\">easily monetized</a> as its feeds and stories features. (The company says in its blog post that it\u2019s continuing to \u201coptimize the ad experience for advertisers,\u201d on Reels.)</p><p>It\u2019s also not yet clear just how much creators can expect to make through the new program. Meta had previously promised Reels creators monthly bonuses up to $35,000 a month when it launched the Reels Play bonus program in 2021. But the company reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/6/23013399/instagram-reels-payments-cuts\">slashed</a> those payments last year, before \u201cpausing\u201d the program entirely in march. According to a  Meta spokesperson, the \u2018overarching goal\u201d is for creators to be able to earn consistent payouts, but these numbers \u201cwill vary widely by creator.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-accelerating-plans-to-bring-more-ads-to-reels-on-facebook-and-instagram-150004225.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-accelerating-plans-to-bring-more-ads-to-reels-on-facebook-and-instagram-150004225.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-09 15:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "LinkedIn is laying off 716 staff and closing its job search app in China", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/linkedin/\">LinkedIn</a> is the latest notable tech company to announce a round of mass layoffs.

Other touch input makes it easy to reorder and edit clips, Apple claims. Things get better if you have an Apple Pencil. You can draw directly on your content, and hover over the timeline (on iPad Pro M2 models) to skim footage. You can edit HDR video on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and there's even a pro camera mode that lets you adjust elements like white balance and (on M2 iPads) record in the ProRes format.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"5dabe5376990425ebaa4ee34010c2e1c\"></div><p>At the same time, Apple wants to reassure creators that Final Cut Pro for iPad can fit into a familiar workflow. It supports multi-camera video editing as well as customizable graphics and auto-adjusting soundtracks. You can easily remove background images or noises, and automatically crop to fit common video aspect ratios. Projects created on the iPad can be sent to a Mac (and vice versa), and you can bring in video from iMovie for iOS.</p><p>The apps also represent a change in Apple's pricing strategy. Where Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for Mac are one-time purchases, you'll have to subscribe to the iPad versions for either $5 per month or $49 per year. There's a one-month free trial. The move isn't surprising given Apple's increasing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/strong-iphone-sales-arent-enough-to-offset-a-big-downturn-in-mac-shipments-210358753.html\">reliance on services</a> for revenue, but it may be disappointing if you were hoping to avoid the industry's subscription trend.</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-bringing-final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-to-ipad-on-may-23rd-132957320.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-bringing-final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-to-ipad-on-may-23rd-132957320.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-09 13:29:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best travel gear for graduates", "description": "<p>Three years after the start of the pandemic, travel is once again a rite of passage for many new grads, and as a parent, you probably want to ensure your child has a great time exploring the world.

It\u2019s a small gift, but one that your child will appreciate for its practicality.</p><h2>DJI Osmo Mobile 6 Gimbal</h2><p></p><p>If your grad has a relatively recent phone like the iPhone 14 or the Samsung Galaxy S23, they don\u2019t need a dedicated camera to take great-looking video during their trip. But what can elevate their footage is a smartphone gimbal like the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEI3WEQ3UjQzP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8teGEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZmMmI0ZmI3LTgzMGEtNGZhMC1iYWM5LTBmZDQ1Y2MyMjIwYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfKuqfrl7qdEG1sPvZ6MiOhTOGVS8GbW57YF7LMJh-e-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B7XD7R43%3Fth%3D1\">Osmo Mobile 6</a> from DJI. The company makes some of the best drones you can buy, so it knows a thing or two about camera stabilization. The Osmo Mobile 6 will help your grad film smooth and cinematic videos while they\u2019re on their trip. The company\u2019s latest gimbal features a built-in extension rod that makes it easier to snap the perfect selfie. Plus, it only weighs 309 grams, so it\u2019s a lightweight addition to almost any travel kit.</p><h2>Bellroy Lite Duffel</h2><p></p><p>If there\u2019s one piece of advice I have for novice travelers it\u2019s to use a duffel bag instead of a roller suitcase for your carry-on luggage. Over about a decade of flying, I\u2019ve never had a gate agent ask me to check in one of my duffel bags, even when I was about to board a full flight. Bellroy makes a few great duffels, but I like the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3a8ee27e-ede5-433b-be86-c7b2742ab647&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Bellroy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzYThlZTI3ZS1lZGU1LTQzM2ItYmU4Ni1jN2IyNzQyYWI2NDciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9iZWxscm95LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9saXRlLWR1ZmZlbD9jb2xvcj1jaGFsayZtYXRlcmlhbD1kaWFtb25kX3JpcHN0b3Ajc2xpZGUtMyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmYyYjRmYjctODMwYS00ZmEwLWJhYzktMGZkNDVjYzIyMjBhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAb7Z6qrQmVP-UUgb5RhXAswdBr4Vt-stfwxnl75PlYBI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbellroy.com%2Fproducts%2Flite-duffel%3Fcolor%3Dchalk%26material%3Ddiamond_ripstop%23slide-3\">Lite model</a> for its lightweight yet durable construction and army of pockets.

After many years of using a backpack for that purpose, I recently switched to a hip pack. I like the weight savings and added security they offer. If your giftee ever feels like their belongings are at risk, they can carry their hip pack at the front of their body. After trying a few different models, I eventually settled on the <a href=\"https://www.fjallraven.com/us/en-us/bags-gear/backpacks-bags/travel-bags/ulvo-hip-pack-medium\">Ulvo Hip Pack</a> from Fjallraven. I like the medium version for its waterproof construction, 2L capacity and backside security pocket. I\u2019ve found the Ulvo to be big enough to carry my passport, wallet and mirrorless camera, making it perfect for day trips.</p><h2>Fujifilm X-E4</h2><p></p><p>The Fujifilm X-E4 is the successor to the X-E3, a camera I\u2019ve packed on every trip I\u2019ve taken since 2017. What I love about the X-E3 is its unimposing exterior and size. It strikes the perfect balance between portability and image quality. The <a href=\"https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-e4/\">$849 X-E4</a> makes an already ideal travel camera even better by adding a tilting 3-inch LCD touchscreen, USB-C connectivity and Fujifilm\u2019s 26.1-megapixel X-Trans 4 CMOS sensor. And did I mention it\u2019s the company\u2019s smallest interchangeable lens camera and weighs less than a pound? Add to that Fujifilm\u2019s film simulations and Bluetooth connectivity, and you have a camera that will allow your kid to take great photos and easily transfer them to their phone to share over social media.</p><p>What\u2019s more, you can buy the X-E4 with a 27mm pancake lens. Don\u2019t judge this lens by its small size, though: It\u2019s sharp across its entire aperture range and has a field of view that will make composing shots easy. It\u2019s worth noting Fujifilm has one of the best and most comprehensive lens ecosystems of any camera manufacturer. For almost every expensive piece of glass like the 56mm f/1.2, the company offers a more affordable f/2 alternative that is light, compact and weather-sealed. That makes the X-E4 the perfect starter camera.</p><h2>Twelve South AirFly Duo</h2><p></p><p>If your grad already owns a decent set of Bluetooth earbuds, you can instead gift them the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CbHVldG9vdGgtVHJhbnNtaXR0ZXItTm9pc2UtQ2FuY2VsbGluZy1IZWFkcGhvbmVzLUFpcnBsYW5lcy9kcC9CMDdaMTNINFRQLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXhhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZjJiNGZiNy04MzBhLTRmYTAtYmFjOS0wZmQ0NWNjMjIyMGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYEdpGFb50b5OvBem997r6hqUEL8NmW48cR0oPCDmyx7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBluetooth-Transmitter-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-Airplanes%2Fdp%2FB07Z13H4TP%2F%3Fth%3D1\">AirFly Duo</a>. It\u2019s a device that will allow them to use their wireless headphones with a plane\u2019s inflight entertainment system. All they need to do is pair the AirFly Duo with their earbuds and it into their seat\u2019s headphone jack. If they\u2019re flying with a friend or partner, they can even use the AirFly Duo to stream movie audio to two pairs of headphones.</p><h2>Amazon Kindle</h2><p></p><p>Every trip involves some amount of downtime. Between long flights and train rides, as well as lengthy layovers, there are plenty of opportunities to catch up on some reading.

Our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ereader-130013808.html\">favorite budget e-reader</a>, the standard Kindle, features a 300ppi display, 16GB of storage and USB-C charging. Best of all, with a battery that can go up to six weeks on a single charge, there\u2019s one less cable and charger for your grad to carry on their next trip.</p><h2>Peak Design Tech Pouch</h2><p></p><p>Peak Design is known for making some of the most practical camera bags and accessories you can buy. But over the last few years, it has also made a name for itself in the travel bag space. If you want to help your grad organize all their cables and gadgets before they leave for their next trip, look no further than the company\u2019s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8747aed1-6586-46eb-856d-c95a5318901b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peak+Design&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4NzQ3YWVkMS02NTg2LTQ2ZWItODU2ZC1jOTVhNTMxODkwMWIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVha2Rlc2lnbi5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvdHJhdmVsLWJhZ3MvcHJvZHVjdHMvdGVjaC1wb3VjaD8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImZmMmI0ZmI3LTgzMGEtNGZhMC1iYWM5LTBmZDQ1Y2MyMjIwYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATAZxFtohEBgfKeB004H4PSZTCLlyhbKTupFCmtP2-kg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fcollections%2Ftravel-bags%2Fproducts%2Ftech-pouch%3F\">Tech Pouch</a>. Exterior handles make it easy to open and hold the pouch, even on a plane flying through turbulence. Inside, you\u2019ll find loops and Peak\u2019s signature origami dividers that make it easy to organize things like pens, SD cards and batteries. Another handy detail is a cable passthrough that allows you to keep a power bank in its interior and connect it to your phone in the front pocket. Plus, the nylon exterior is water-resistant, so your grad can relax knowing all their electronics are secure from most accidental water damage.</p><h2>Otterbox Fast Charge</h2><p></p><p>At some point during their trip, the battery on your grad\u2019s phone is likely to run low or even die at a critical moment.

The company says they\u2019re also 100 percent effective at blocking out any light, a claim I\u2019ve found to be accurate.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-travel-tech-for-graduates-123028465.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-travel-tech-for-graduates-123028465.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-09 13:15:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Artiphon\u2019s Minibeats AR app creates music from movement and gestures", "description": "<p>Artiphon, the company behind the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/artiphon-orba-review-music-fidget-toy-mpe-midi-synthesizer-looper-130020266.html\">Orba handheld synth and MIDI controller</a>, launched a new AR music creation app today that you don\u2019t need a musical background to enjoy.

The SX5 series had a three-speed gear system, and while it had a torque sensor to assist, adaptive motor support is new for these cheaper e-bikes. While the gear system may be different, the company expects the range to be equivalent to both the SA5 and older SX3 e-bikes, 60-150 km, depending on riding conditions and rider.

Musk apparently told NPR in their email exchange that Twitter's policy is to &quot;recycle handles that are definitively dormant&quot; and that &quot;same policy applies to all accounts.&quot; It's worth noting that it's been less than a month since NPR quit Twitter and that it definitely hasn't been &quot;several years&quot; yet.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>At the moment, though, the website has yet to update its <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-twitter-accounts\">inactive account policy page</a>, which only states that users need to log in every 30 days to keep their account active. That part of the policy is pretty new, because Twitter had only required users to log in every six months as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/twitter-starts-purging-inactive-accounts-after-quiet-policy-change/\">recently as April 19th</a>. Twitter's policy still also states that it &quot;cannot release inactive usernames at this time,&quot; but Musk hinted in a follow-up tweet that the company will be changing that rule. &quot;[I]t is important to free up abandoned handles,&quot; he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>When urged to rethink his decision, because killing inactive accounts will also delete tweets by deceased users, Musk responded that their accounts will be archived. What that means exactly remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-going-to-purge-and-archive-inactive-accounts-101557246.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-going-to-purge-and-archive-inactive-accounts-101557246.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-09 10:15:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Volvo\u2019s compact electric SUV will be called the EX30", "description": "<p>Volvo has revealed the name for its upcoming fully electric small SUV in a teaser showing its official launch date.

However, Nintendo did predict this would happen, saying <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-sales-slow-this-year-093831775.html\">last year at this time</a> that it expected sales of the console to keep slowing down.&nbsp;</p><p>That's to be expected for a six-year-old console that has sold extremely well in its lifetime (125.62 million units, third best of all time) and effectively saturated the market.

The service, called VIZ Manga, features manga published by Shogakugan and Shueisha and costs $2 a month. Its current \"simulpub\" or simultaneous publication catalogue has 15 titles that include <em>Inuyasha</em> sequel <em>Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon</em> and <em>Mao</em> by Rumiko Takahashi. Fans can even read their three most recent chapters for free. The subscription service also gives fans access to a library with over 10,000 chapters, including Junji Ito's <em>GYO</em> and <em>Uzumaki</em>, Yuu Watase's <em>Fushigi Yuugi</em>, Rumiko Takahashi's <em>Ranma 1/2 </em>and Ai Yazawa's <em>Nana</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Due to the explosive success of the Shonen Jump digital service, this new development will exponentially expand VIZ Media\u2019s digital offering,\" the company said in its announcement.

VIZ Media said this is the first time English-speaking fans can get titles from the publishers \u2014 legally, that is \u2014 at the same time Japan does. The hope is likely to steer fans away from unauthorized translations, which could come out as soon as a few hours after a chapter is published in Japan, and to ultimately address the industry's piracy problem.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>According to the Tokyo-based Content Overseas Distribution Association, the Japanese manga industry <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/04/22/business/tech/online-piracy-japan-losses/\">lost</a> 395.2 billion (US$2.9 billion) to 831.1 billion Yen (US$6.2 billion) in 2021 due to online piracy.

Webtoons are digital comics optimized for smartphones, and their publishing format makes them much easier to consume in this day and age. Manga has always been a print-first industry, but publishers have been looking for ways to expand their digital presence.&nbsp;</p><p>At the moment, VIZ Manga is only available in the US and Canada, accessible through the company's Android or iOS app and its website. (Subscriptions, however, can only be purchased through the app.) VIZ Media plans to expand the service's availability to other regions, though, so fans outside those two countries may want to keep an eye out for future announcements.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"cfcd61b4799e457b945d1f4e8550806a\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/viz-manga-subscription-service-releases-english-chapters-the-same-time-japan-gets-them-045723571.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/viz-manga-subscription-service-releases-english-chapters-the-same-time-japan-gets-them-045723571.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-09 04:57:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
