The future of our people depends on you,\u201d Putin said.</p><p><strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary force said he was told he and his mercenaries would be regarded as \u201ctraitors\u201d if they abandoned their positions.</strong> Prigozhin threatened to withdraw his troops from the city in east Ukraine, which has been the site of a long-running battle since 2022 to try to capture it, because of a lack of ammunition. He then rowed back on it, but has again threatened to do so.</p><p><strong>Britain is set to formally blacklist Wagner as a terrorist organization to increase pressure on Russia,</strong> The Times newspaper reported on Tuesday.

The poems themselves seem slightly surprised by their existence, as if given half a chance, they might remove themselves from the page.
