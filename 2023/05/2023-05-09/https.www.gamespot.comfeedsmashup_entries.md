<p dir="ltr">Activision is reportedly eyeing early August to pull back the curtain on the next Call of Duty game. The FPS is still unnamed at this time but thought to be spearheaded by developer Sledgehammer Games, which was behind Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, WWII, and Vanguard.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2023-reveal-date/">Insider-Gaming</a> says the reveal will happen through some sort of in-game event on Tuesday, August 1. There is precedent for this model, as Sledgehammer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-vanguard-official-reveal-dropping-august-19-in-warzone/1100-6495194/">Call of Duty: Vanguard was unveiled in August 2021 inside Warzone</a>. It could be the case then that Call of Duty 2023 will get teased in Warzone 2. Regardless, this timeframe would rule out the FPS popping up at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-showcase-coming-soon-report-says/1100-6513917/">a rumored PlayStation Showcase happening later this month</a>. </p><p dir="ltr">Activision declined to comment when approached by GameSpot.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2023-reveal-coming-early-august-report/1100-6513962/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2's</a> latest update adds a new limited-time event that has players picking sides in an intergalactic struggle between rebels and an evil empire, alongside a significant batch of balance updates and the addition of hero-specific settings.</p><p dir="ltr">From May 9 to May 22, players will be able to queue up and compete as either the Watcher rebels or the Infinite Empire in a new limited-time game mode called Starwatch: Galactic Rescue. Those fighting for freedom will need to escort the rebel leader Bonebreaker (aka Doomfist) as he seeks to free the imprisoned droid 3CH-0 (aka Echo) from the clutches of the empire. The rebels will need to hold various capture points, but it won't be easy. Players on the side of the Infinite Empire, led by Galactic Emperor Sigma and aided by security turrets, will be there to hold the line. Completing event challenges will unlock various cosmetics, like the Asteroid Wrecking Ball skin, a weapon charm, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">While the event is the star of the space-themed update, various balance changes have also been introduced to many of the game's heroes. As detailed in the official <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/">patch notes</a>, those changes include a damage buff to Orisa's primary weapon, a Biotic Grenade healing nerf for Ana, and an increase to the damage radius of Winston's Jet Pack ability.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-update-adds-star-wars-inspired-event-balance-changes-and-hero-specific-settings/1100-6513961/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## A Dash Of PvP Adds A Competitive Edge To Evercore Heroes' Enthralling MOBA-Like Gameplay

<p>Evercore Heroes is a competitive PvE game in which each match sees your squad of four participating in missions against hordes of AI-controlled enemies, but you're doing so at the same time as three other teams all on the same map. So it's a little PvP too in terms of each match being a race between four different teams. It's a creative idea for Vela Games' debut title, upping the ante of PvE scenarios with the competitive drive of PvP. This setup works--I left a preview event for Evercore Heroes wishing I could play just one more match, which is my go-to benchmark for whether a free-to-play multiplayer game has that magic touch to make it in the increasingly crowded live-service market. If you can make your players go, "Okay, one more game," then you've stumbled onto something special.</p><p>In Evercore Heroes, you play as one of several Heroes--there will be 14 at the game's launch--who fall into your traditional roles of damage, tank, or support. Your team of four then loads onto a map alongside three other teams. Each team has free reign to do what they want to prepare for the first wave of enemies coming to destroy your spawn point. You could capture an objective to secure resources to upgrade your characters, for example, or kill a miniboss to upgrade your chosen hero's unique abilities.</p><div>          </div><p>As you race around the map, you can see the opposing teams completing objectives as well, represented as small glowing sprites within your world. Once a task has been completed on the map, it counts as completed for every team, so your squad has to decide whether it's worth racing against the other teams for the bigger payoffs or completing the smaller, often-ignored objectives. You can also use special PvP items like a frost grenade that can stun all the opposing players around you, slowing them down on whatever objective you're trying to finish first.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-dash-of-pvp-adds-a-competitive-edge-to-evercore-heroes-enthralling-moba-like-gameplay/1100-6513960/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie just launched in theaters last month, but it looks like it’ll be heading to home theaters sooner than expected.

<p>GTA parent company Take-Two publishing label Private Division is partnering up with Pokemon developer Game Freak for a new game.

## Former FTC Lawyer Blasts UK Agency For Blocking Microsoft-Activision Deal

<p dir="ltr">Everyone has an opinion on the blockbuster merger of Microsoft and Activision Blizzard, but not everyone has served as a top lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission. In a recent <a href="https://truthonthemarket.com/2023/05/04/uk-blocking-of-microsoft-activision-merger-is-anticompetitive-and-anti-innovation/">article</a>, former General Counsel of the FTC Alden Abbott opined that the UK's Competition and Markets Authority should not have blocked the deal from proceeding, saying that the body did not fully consider the facts.</p><p dir="ltr">In the piece, Abbott argues that the CMA overstated the impact of cloud gaming in the short-term, pointing out that the promising technology has yet to make significant inroads with consumers yet. "Although cloud gaming does not require the purchase of specific gaming devices, it does require substantial bandwidth, stable internet connections, and subscriptions to particular services," he writes.</p><p dir="ltr">He also agrees with a common argument advanced by advocates of the deal, which is that Microsoft is unlikely to remove Call Of Duty from PlayStation as a platform because it simply makes so much money, and the company faces competition from many other players in the space besides Sony. He concludes by stating that the decision may threaten similar "efficiencies-generating" acquisitions in the future. It's worth noting that though the CMA's initial decision has been made, the case is still ongoing, with Microsoft and Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-queens-lawyer-is-now-helping-activision-fight-the-blocked-microsoft-acquisition-in-the-uk/1100-6513937/">appealing the decision</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-ftc-lawyer-blasts-uk-agency-for-blocking-microsoft-activision-deal/1100-6513957/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Honkai Star Rail Stellar Jade Farming Guide

<p dir="ltr">Farming <strong>Stellar Jade in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/honkai-star-rail/">Honkai Star Rail</a></strong> is your ticket to more characters and weapons, and you don’t even have to pay for it. While some methods of obtaining Stellar Jade are limited--completing missions or clearing certain objectives, for example--others are recurring and reward you with substantial amounts of the space crystals.</p><p dir="ltr">You can also buy them outright by purchasing Oneiric Shards from the in-game store. However, we don’t recommend doing that. You could wind up with nothing decent from the Warp banners, which means you just chucked your money out the window. Here we'll go over why you should work to obtain Stellar Jade, how you can do so efficiently, and what you can spend the currency on.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is Stellar Jade for in Honkai Star Rail?</h2><p dir="ltr">Stellar Jade is an in-game currency you can exchange for Rail Passes or Special Rail Passes, which you use on Warps. That’s Star Rail-speak for character and Light Cone banners, which is gacha-speak for “how you get new characters and weapons.”</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-stellar-jade-farming-guide/1100-6513927/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Warner Bros. has released a new trailer for Meg 2: The Trench, and it's a wild action spectacle. The trailer reminds us that for 65 million years, dinosaurs ruled the planet. But all the while, there was actually a far bigger and deadlier apex predator than the T-Rex--the megalodon shark.</p><p>In Meg 2: The Trench, multiple gigantic megalodons are now on the loose and killing people left and right. Thankfully, action movie hero Jason Statham is here to save the day. Statham's character, along with a researcher played by Wu Jing, must fight off not only the big sharks but also an evil mining company.</p><p>"Pitted against colossal Megs and relentless environmental plunderers, our heroes must outrun, outsmart, and outswim their merciless predators in a pulse-pounding race against time," reads a line from the description of the movie that I cannot wait to see.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/giant-shark-eats-t-rex-in-new-trailer-for-meg-2-the-trench/1100-6513953/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's Scavenger Droids Were Designed To Be Horrible Little Metal Jerks

<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has no shortage of enemies on which to test your lightdsaber skills, but between Trade Federation battle-droids, Stormtroopers, and space pirates, one enemy stands above them all as the most devious. During your adventures across Jedi: Survivor's new planets, you might spot an unassuming little scavenger droid that'll make a quick getaway when you get too close to them.</p><p>Sure, these pose <em>zero </em>threat to Cal Kestis, but the jerks do contain valuable resources within their shells that you should chase down. The only problem is that scavenger droids are deceptively quick, and the second you attempt to yank them towards you with a Force Pull, they'll burrow underground. Now you'll never get that rare resources that can unlock a fancy new jacket that pairs well with the goatee that you just unlocked for Kestis. A true fashion crime has been committed.</p><p>These little droids aren't just annoying, but also possess a level of evil that can give Emperor Palpatine a run for his money. After the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/Daily_SWGames/status/1655257215920402432">Daily Star Wars Games</a> quizzed players about which enemy type they hate the most in the game, several people responded with pure disdain for scavenger droids, leading Jedi: Survivor senior writer Pete Stewart to respond about the droids. And he did not mince his words when he spoke about the automated automatons that he had a hand in creating.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivors-scavenger-droids-were-designed-to-be-horrible-little-metal-jerks/1100-6513952/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

This week's update isn't too massive, and is mostly focused on the Guardian Games and a few weapon issues. According to the patch notes, an issue where progress on the Heir Apparent quest and its catalyst aren't advanced by certain objectives. Another issue related to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-easily-farm-platinum-medallions-in-destiny-2-guardian-games-2023/1100-6513809/">Champ Seal</a> not being gilded has also been resolved.</p><p>For those players who found that progress on the Fly the Flag bounty was taking too long, that task should now operate at the speed that Bungie intended it to. Outside of the Guardian Games, an issue where the Enhanced Eager Edge perk would deactivate earlier than intended has been addressed and an exploit that allowed players to gain a massive damage boost by swapping from a slug shotgun to another shotgun has been plugged. Related to that particular exploit, Bungie has added a two-second window where a weapon cannot be fired after swapping to it from the inventory screen.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-season-of-the-deep-release-date-armor-story-and-everything-we-know/1100-6513865/">Season of the Deep</a> kicking off on May 23, Bungie has been doing some fine-tuning on Destiny 2 ahead of its next major storyline. Getting those <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-making-it-easier-to-get-those-craftable-weapons-you-really-want/1100-6513864/">craftable weapons</a> that you <em>really </em>want will be easier from next season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-getting-glorious-new-golden-exotics-as-part-of-trials-in-season-21/1100-6513863/">Trials of Osiris has some terrific golden gear to win</a> when Season of the Deep begins, and there'll be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-new-strand-aspects-revealed-for-hunters-titans-and-warlocks/1100-6513859/">new Strand Aspects</a> to unlock soon.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-patch-targets-a-shotgun-exploit-and-fixes-guardian-games-issues/1100-6513945/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## WoW Community Discord Program Faces Backlash For Requiring Users To Not Disparage Blizzard

<p>An official and newly announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a> community Discord program has faced swift backlash from fans over parts of its member agreement. The agreement requires users agree to not make negative statements about developer Blizzard. In addition, Discord servers participating in the program would be required to install tracking software, which Blizzard would be granted access to.</p><p dir="ltr">On paper, the <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/23935249/introducing-the-community-discords-program">community Discord program</a>, which initially was only for European Discord communities, seemed like a no-brainer. By agreeing to the program member agreement, community Discords would receive various perks, including occasional developer Q&amp;As and more official means to feedback to Blizzard to help make WoW a better experience.</p><p dir="ltr">However, once potential Discord managers started reading the <a href="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/8l/8LPPTKSM4OIS1683313493815.pdf">fine print</a>, it became clear that joining the program would come with some serious downsides. Users would have to agree to a non-disparagement clause where members of the community would be banned from making "any disparaging or negative statements or representations, written or oral, about Blizzard…or Blizzard's products or servers, except as otherwise permitted by law." Community Discord managers were also alarmed by a requirement that Discord's joining the program would have to maintain tracking software "and grant Blizzard permissions (as instructed by Blizzard from time to time) to such software."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-community-discord-program-faces-backlash-for-requiring-users-to-not-disparage-blizzard/1100-6513949/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Nvidia Set To Announce RTX 4060 Ti With More VRAM Than RTX 4070 - Report

<p>Nvidia might be planning to reveal several different versions of its next GPU, the RTX 4060, at Computex later this month, with the latest report suggesting a variant with more VRAM than the recently released RTX 4070.</p><p>According to leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/Zed__Wang/status/1655813545479794688">MEGAsizeGPU</a>, and reported by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-to-launch-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-this-month-16gb-model-planned-for-july">Videocardz</a>, Nvidia is gearing up to announce both the RTX 4060 and two versions of the RTX 4060 Ti during its Computex keynote. The two RTX 4060 Ti versions will differ only when it comes to VRAM, with one shipping with 8GB and the other 16GB. That would give the latter a full 4GB more than the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-rtx-4070-officially-announced-retails-for-599/1100-6513190/">RTX 4070</a>, albeit across a much narrower 128-bit memory bus that is shared across all RTX 4060 models.</p><p>Aside from the differences in VRAM, the RTX 4060 Ti models are expected to be identical otherwise. Both will reportedly feature the same AD106-350 GPU, with 4352 CUDA cores and an expected TDP of 160W. The slower RTX 4060 will be significantly cut down, with just 3072 CUDA cores but a much lower TDP of just 115W.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-set-to-announce-rtx-4060-ti-with-more-vram-than-rtx-4070-report/1100-6513948/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3: 20 Easter Eggs and Things You Missed In The Latest MCU Adventure

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135463-0cover.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The MCU has struggled to find its footing and larger purpose since Avengers: Endgame. And although Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 doesn't solve that problem--it's almost entirely self-contained, narratively speaking--it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-review-one-last-emotional-ride/1900-6418061/">unabashedly fun and varied</a>, reminding us why we loved these movies so much in the first place.</p><p dir="ltr">There's the signature comedic wit and superhero action, but there's also space for genuine sentiment and unsettling, creepy body horror. The story springs from the characters rather than the plot. And it relies on the past movies to build its emotional stakes, instead of setting up tangential narratives that might pay off years from now.</p><p dir="ltr">The Guardians are also some of the final members of the MCU old guard—the original team-up of superheroes that beat Thanos and saved the universe. And now that their arc is complete, Marvel must rely on its Phase 4 characters to carry things forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 debuted with a domestic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-dethrones-the-super-mario-bros-movie-with-282-million-opening-weekend/1100-6513898/">weekend gross of $118.4 million</a>, more than Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but not as much as these movies used to earn in the MCU's heyday before the pandemic. It's going to take something really special to match those prior heights.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are 20 Easter Eggs and trivia facts in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 that you might have missed.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Marvel Studios Intro</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135464-1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The movie does not have the standard Marvel intro. Instead of the flybys of Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, we get a montage of clips and quotes from the prior Guardians movies (plus the Holiday Special). It drives home that this is Gunn's final Guardians movie before he heads over to DC.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. I'm A Weirdo</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135465-2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The song that Rocket is singing to himself during the opening credits is an acoustic version of Radiohead's "Creep," which was originally released in 1993.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. The Good Ship Bowie</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135466-3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The new Guardians ship is called The Bowie, after rock musician David Bowie. It is their third ship; Quill's first ship was The Milano, after Quill's childhood crush Alyssa Milano. After The Milano was destroyed in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2., the Guardians got a new ship named The Benatar, after rock singer Pat Benatar.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Magus?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135467-4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">We get the debut of Marvel character Adam Warlock in this movie. In the comics, Adam is one of the most powerful beings in existence, and was engineered by the High Evolutionary to be perfect. In the movie, he has the same basic origin, but he's a bit childlike and immature; his mother says he was removed from his cocoon too early. He starts the movie as a villain who's hunting down Rocket, though he eventually becomes a hero and a member of the new Guardians team under Rocket's leadership.</p><p dir="ltr">In the comics, Adam has an evil counterpart version of himself named Magus, who could be a high-level MCU villain sometime in the near future.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. "Hurts"</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135468-5.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Rocket's first word is "hurts," which really drives home the cruelty with which the High Evolutionary experimented on him.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. 2001: A Space Odyssey</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135469-6.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The multicolored space suits are a homage to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which also deals with the evolution of lower life forms into intelligent beings.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Jennifer Holland Cameo</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135470-7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The woman who Gamora shoots in the leg is played by actress Jennifer Holland, who is James Gunn's wife in real life and one of the stars of HBO Max's Peacemaker, which Gunn also writes and directs.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Lylla Retcon</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135471-8.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>When Nova Corps arrests Rocket in the first Guardians movie, his dossier mentions that one of his affiliates is Lylla. Lylla is the otter that Rocket meets in the High Evolutionary's lab, along with Teefs and Floor. But Lylla gets killed before Rocket even escapes the facility, which contradicts the prior movie's claim that she was an affiliate in Rocket's criminal activity. It'll be interesting to see if the MCU retcons this entirely on Disney+. In the past, the studio has made continuity corrections on both <em>Ms. Marvel</em> and <em>WandaVision</em> to better align with the movies and maintain consistency. So there is precedence for this type of post-production tinkering.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Statue Of Liberty</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135472-9.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>On Counter-Earth, we can see a reimagined version of the Statue of Liberty, with the High Evolutionary as Lady Liberty carrying a monkey rather than a tablet. This is right up there the ape Abraham Lincoln statue at the end of Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, in terms of sheer ridiculousness.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Prisoner 24601</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135473-10.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The way that the High Evolutionary spits out Rocket's test subject number as 89P13 is highly reminiscent of how in the Broadway musical Les Miserables, Inspector Javert refers to Jean Valjean as Prisoner #24601. Like Javert, the High Evolutionary is obsessed with capturing his foe. And like Valjean, Rocket spares his pursuer when he has the chance to kill him.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Howard the Duck And More</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135474-11.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>There are lots of cameos during the card game on Knowhere. We see Cosmo the dog, of course, but we also see Howard the Duck, who, like Cosmo, was part of the Collector's collection. We also see The Broker, who declined to buy the Power Stone from Quill in the first Guardians movie.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Sean Gunn's Many Roles</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135475-12.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>James Gunn's younger brother plays multiple roles in the Guardians movies. He plays Kraglin, and he does most of the motion capture work for Rocket. In Vol. 3, Gunn also plays the voice of Young Rocket during the flashback scenes.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Abilisk</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135476-13.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Guardians last fought an Abilisk in the opening sequence of Vol. 2, where it's portrayed as a fearful beast nearly capable of defeating the entire group by itself, So when the Guardians run into three Abilisks, it's meant to demonstrate how screwed they are. Last time, however, they didn't have Mantis with them, who is able to quickly bring them under her control.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. F-Bomb</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135477-14.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Vol. 3 has the MCU's first uncensored F-bomb, which Quill yells at Nebula while she's trying to open the car door. To get the F-Bomb past the ratings board, it has to occur deep into a movie, and it needs to be used in a pejorative context, not a sexual context.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Face-Off</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135478-15.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Quill says, multiple times, that he's not walking into a trap with the High Evolutionary; he's having a faceoff. And at the film's climax, when the Guardians rip the High Evolutionary's face off, they fulfill this claim literally.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. Creation Of Adam</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135479-16.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>At the moment where Adam Warlock saves Quill, they are posed exactly how Michelangelo posed God and Adam on the Sistine Chapel's ceiling.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>17. "I love you guys."</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135480-17.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>We hear Groot say " I love you guys," but many fans are theorizing that he actually said, "I am Groot." The implication is that after three movies, we as an audience finally understand Groot, and this is James Gunn's way of letting us into his world.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>18. Dancing To Florence</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135490-18.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The final song that the Guardians dance to is "Dog Days are Over" by Florence + The Machine. It is the first time that Drax dances after demonstrating multiple times, across three films, that he dislikes dancing and thinks it's for losers. The kids, however, are able to push him to it. Nebula's right: He's a father, first and foremost.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>19. Mid-Credits Scene</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135481-19.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>We see the latest iteration of the Guardians in the mid-credits scene, consisting of Rocket, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, Adam Warlock, Phyla-Vell, and Blurp. In the comics, Phyla-Vell is conceived from the DNA of Kree warrior Mar-Vell, who was the first Captain Marvel that predated Carol Danvers.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>20. Post-Credits Scene</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4135482-20.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The final scene is of Peter and his grandfather sitting at the kitchen table together. If you look at the newspaper, you can see that Kevin Bacon is telling the story of how he was abducted by aliens, which is a direct reference to the events of the Holiday Special</p></h3></p><br />

## Call Of Duty Fans Criticize New UAV Bundle Deemed "Pay-To-Win"

<p dir="ltr">Over the past few weeks, Activision has released a number of paid bundles for Call Of Duty: Warzone 2's DMZ mode that players have deemed "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-call-cod-warzone-2-new-dmz-bundles-pay-to-win/1100-6513231/">pay-to-win</a>," as they include mechanical benefits that free players simply don't get. The recent release of the new Roze and Thorn bundle has garnered the most pushback yet from fans, as it includes a free UAV effect that some are calling <a href="https://twitter.com/StodehTV/status/1655621941473030159">mode-ruining</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">UAVs reveal an enemy's location in Call Of Duty, which gives the user a huge advantage over the other team, allowing them to obtain better positioning.

But that hasn't stopped Call Of Duty fans from expressing their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/13c20ft/slowly_becoming_a_mobile_game/">dismay</a> with the move, with many worrying that this heralds a change in the game's design philosophy.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">THIS one is the WORST.<br />3 Man team all pay for this.

## Scarlett Johansson Reflects On Her Black Widow Lawsuit Against Disney

<p>Actress Scarlett Johansson has commented on her high-profile lawsuit against Disney over Black Widow, saying she continues to believe in the "magic of Disney." Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/features/scarlett-johansson-disney-lawsuit-child-actor-interview-1235605851/">Variety</a>, Johansson said it was just business. The creative department and the business department at Disney are not the same, she said.</p><p>"I think it's because I could separate the creatives at Disney from their business affairs department," she said. "I've had such great working relationships with so many creatives there and continue to. I believe in the magic of Disney. I'm able to still appreciate that and not let the callousness of that interaction sully my relationship and history with them, because they're two separate things."</p><p>Johansson's legal team argued that 2021's Black Widow was written as a theatrical exclusive in her contract. When Disney opted to move the film to Disney Plus, it denied Johansson bonuses she could have earned from the success of the movie in theaters, her team said. The film did release in theaters, too, but this was during the pandemic, and box office results came in relatively low. Johansson eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scarlett-johansson-and-disney-settle-black-widow-lawsuit/1100-6496732/">settled with Disney for a reported $40 million.</a></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scarlett-johansson-reflects-on-her-black-widow-lawsuit-against-disney/1100-6513943/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><h2>Apex Legends Season 17: Arsenal Battle Pass Rewards</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1752/17528202/4135419-bpimage.jpg" /><br /><em>The Arsenal battle pass features new cosmetic skins for Wattson, Lifeline, Gibraltar, and more.</em><br /><h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-17-ranked-changes-new-legend-ballistic-weapon-mastery-and-everything-we-know/1100-6513623/">Apex Legends Season 17: Arsenal</a> is now live, as is the season's corresponding battle pass. After getting a taste of this season's cosmetics via the Arsenal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wattson-skin-steals-the-show-in-apex-legends-season-17-battle-pass-trailer/1100-6513905/">battle pass trailer</a>, players can now get their hands on these stylish new skins by purchasing one of the game's premium battle pass options.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 17's debut legend, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-ballistic-abilities-lore-and-everything-we-know/1100-6513514/">Ballistic</a>, is all about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-17-arsenal-launch-trailer-shows-off-ballistics-slick-battlefield-tactics/1100-6513593/">looking good while getting the job done</a>, but if cosmetics aren't your thing, the Arsenal battle pass still has plenty to offer. From stat trackers to Apex Coins, Apex Packs, and other valuable loot, the Arsenal battle bass isn't all style and no substance. Suffice it to say there's something for everyone in this loot-packed, 110-level season pass.</p><p dir="ltr">As is always the case, Season 17's premium battle pass comes in two flavors: the standard battle pass and the "premium bundle."</p><p dir="ltr">The standard premium battle pass is available for 950 Apex Coins ($950 USD), and gives players access to the battle pass's premium cosmetics. It also instantly unlocks the following items:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Boiling Point transition screen</li><li dir="ltr">+10% XP Boost</li><li dir="ltr">Technomancer Ballistic legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir="ltr">Hot Drop Gibraltar legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir="ltr">Sundown Surgeon Lifeline legend skin (Epic)</li><li dir="ltr">Pulse Eater devotion weapon skin (Legendary)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Option two, the "premium bundle," is a little more expensive at 2,800 Apex Coins ($28 USD), but it offers the additional benefit of an instant, 25-level battle pass boost (while also offering all the loot included in the standard premium battle pass). The premium bundle is a great choice for players who are short on time (or patience) and want to get a head start.</p><p dir="ltr">But players who don't purchase either premium battle pass option aren't entirely out of luck when it comes to battle pass goodies. These players will still unlock loot through the battle pass's free reward track, which is available to all players, regardless of whether or not they've paid for a premium battle pass. Completing the free battle pass will earn players the following items:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Boiling Point transition screen</li><li dir="ltr">Arsenal music pack</li><li dir="ltr">200 Apex Coins</li><li dir="ltr">7 Apex Packs</li><li dir="ltr">Mech Ness Monster weapon charm (Epic)</li><li dir="ltr">Orange Slice Spitfire weapon skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">They Call Us Apex Legends transition screen</li><li dir="ltr">Orange Slice G7 Scout weapon skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">Carbon Shredder P2020 weapon skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">Carbon Shredder Sentinel weapon skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">Overclocked Upgrade L-STAR weapon skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">Space Circuit R-99 weapon skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">Overclocked Upgrade Alternator weapon skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">Apex Legends Museum Opening In 2735 transition screen</li><li dir="ltr">Overclocked Upgrade Havoc weapon skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">Ballistic music pack</li><li dir="ltr">Carbon Shredder Kraber weapon skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">Modified Mayhem Mad Maggie legend skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">Safety Protocol Mastiff weapon skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">Safety Protocol 30-30 Repeater weapon skin (Rare)</li><li dir="ltr">Looking Back To The Thunderdome transition screen</li><li dir="ltr">stat trackers for all legends</li><li dir="ltr">Arsenal season badge (Legendary)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">As always, the new battle pass includes two Legendary-tier reactive weapons skins. This season's reactive skins are for the CAR SMG--the Frontier Faithful weapon skin unlocks at level 100, with the Outlands Obliterator unlocking at level 110, which can only be reached by manually grinding out the finally 10 bonus levels of the battle pass, which--unlike levels 1 through 100--cannot be purchased.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to non-cosmetic items, players will find Apex Coins, Apex Packs, Crafting Metals, and XP Boosts at the following levels:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Apex Coins</strong> can be found in sets of 100 at levels 3, 5, 21, 29, 37, 45, 61, 69, 77, 85, 93, 95, and 100.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Apex Packs</strong> can be found at levels 5 (Legendary), 7 (x2), 21, 39, 58, 61, 63, 66, 77, 84, 85, 87, and 99 (Epic). All Apex Packs are Rare-tier unless otherwise specified.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Crafting Metals</strong> come in sets of 120, and can be unlocked at levels 4, 13, 20, 28, 36, 44, 53, 60, 68, and 76.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>XP Boosts</strong> give you a 10% XP bonus that stacks with each XP Boost you unlock. XP Boosts are found at levels 1, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, 54, 62, and 70.</p><p>Check out the gallery below for a closer look at all of Season 17's flashy battle pass cosmetics, and stay tuned for more

But Kurt thinks that bad games, even the most aggressively mediocre ones, can be great games in their own right.

<p dir="ltr">Torchlight Infinite officially launches today on mobile devices and PC. The latest installment in the action-RPG series--and the first that's free-to-play--has been in Early Access (or open beta) since October 2022.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the global release, a new season is starting in Torchlight Infinite called Cube of Rapacity. This cube brings about monsters named Malice Incarnations that will drop Desire Crystals, which can then be used to redeem rewards after defeating a stage boss. Players can also pick up Desire Cores to summon the seasonal boss, The Law Bearer.</p><p dir="ltr">The new season will also introduce Escapist Bing to Torchlight Infinite. This hero is all about bombing enemies alongside his projectiles. Expect new legendary gear with the Cube of Rapacity as well.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cant-wait-for-diablo-4-torchlight-infinite-is-out-today-for-free/1100-6513939/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Dark And Darker Dev Delays Early Access Launch Amid Legal Turmoil

<p dir="ltr">The extraction shooter Dark And Darker was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-and-darker-removed-from-steam-following-dispute-with-nexon/1100-6512733/">forced off Steam</a> weeks ago thanks to an ongoing lawsuit from Korean game company Nexon, but it seems that its promised Early Access launch will also have to wait. Developer Ironmace posted an announcement on its <a href="https://discord.gg/darkanddarker">Discord</a>, stating that the launch has been delayed due to unspecified difficulties.</p><p dir="ltr">"We truly hate not being able to communicate as freely as we usually do, however due to the sensitive nature of our current situation, we can’t divulge too much information right now," the message reads in part. "I know this isn’t the announcement everyone wanted to hear, but we needed to let our fans know that the Early Access release has been delayed a bit." Ironmace further promises that they're "working on a ton of things" to get the game out as soon as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">As we covered previously, Dark And Darker's legal situation stems from Nexon claiming that the project was built using stolen code and assets from a project called P3. Though Ironmace is comprised of former Nexon employees who did work on P3, the smaller company says that Nexon's claims are false and that the gaming giant is essentially trying to trademark a video game genre.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-and-darker-dev-delays-early-access-launch-amid-legal-turmoil/1100-6513940/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Across the Next-Gen, Xbox Game Studios, and Start Your Engines Sales, there's a pretty good list of games that have been marked down.</p><p>This includes a number of recent releases, cult-classics, and a few evergreen titles, all of which are highly rated and run well on Xbox consoles. One of the highlights in this sale is this year's remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-space-remake-review-hits-the-marker/1900-6418021/">Dead Space</a>, a gruesome but captivating showcase of what the Xbox Series X|S consoles are capable.

A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-frontiers-review-sonic-is-that-you/1900-6417995/">surprise hit</a> from late last year, Sonic's latest adventure has speed, charm, and a massive open-world to explore that is cathartically challenging. Sega is also regularly releasing free DLC for the game throughout 2023, extending its lifespan and making a great game even better. For another impressive slice of Xbox Series X|s power, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is hard to beat.

## Here's How Much Money Nintendo Could Take Home From Super Mario Bros. Movie

<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie has earned more than $1 billion at the box office so far, and it's still putting up big numbers. Nintendo did not make the movie, of course, but the company still stands to earn substantial funds from its massive success.</p><p>Gaming analyst Hideki Yasuda from Tokyo Securities told <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Nintendo-expects-Switch-sales-to-slow-further-this-year">Nikkei</a> that if The Super Mario Bros. Movie reaches $1.5 billion USD at the box office, Nintendo would see a contribution to its own revenue of more than $220 million USD. Nintendo owns the license and worked out a deal with animation studio Illumination to develop and distribute the movie. The exact terms of the deal have not been made public, however.</p><p>Should The Super Mario Bros. Movie come to a streaming subscription service like Netflix, Yasuda estimated that Nintendo could earn "billions of yen" per year in revenue. (1 billion yen equals about $7.4 million USD). It's also just one part of ongoing revenue for The Super Mario Bros. Movie after it ends its run in theaters.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-much-money-nintendo-could-take-home-from-super-mario-bros-movie/1100-6513934/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Starfield's Post-Sex Dialogue Sure Is Weird

<p dir="ltr">Bethesda Game Studios has spent years building Starfield full of mysteries and locales to explore--as well as apparently some silly pillow talk. <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39293/starfield/">The Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> has slapped an M rating on the sci-fi RPG and described exactly why the sci-fi RPG deserves that label.</p><p dir="ltr">For starters, the ESRB says Starfield has "some suggestive material" for players "after sharing a bed with characters." One specific example is: "Life is a sexually transmitted disease that's a hundred percent fatal." There's also a goofy line like this: "I'm all for getting a little wild, but next time let's try it without the jetpacks."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the pillow talk, Starfield apparently features a drug called Aurora. The narcotic has a "prominent" role in the spacefaring game, according to the ESRB, with players able to steal, buy, and use it. This more than likely explains why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-drug-use-pushes-rating-in-australia-above-bethesdas-past-games/1100-6512434/">Starfield's rating in Australia is above Bethesda's past games</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-post-sex-dialogue-sure-is-weird/1100-6513935/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Nintendo Switch has received a new firmware update ahead of the much-anticipated release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on May 12.</p><p>The new firmware update delivers "general system stability improvements," Nintendo said in the official patch notes. Dataminer <a href="https://twitter.com/OatmealDome/status/1655741751661821953">OatmealDome on Twitter</a> dug into the patch a little more and found that it fixes some bugs related to save data. Sometimes Switch patches include more than the patch notes say, but OatmealDome said "no other changes" are in this newest update.</p><p>In any event, this update comes just days before Tears of the Kingdom releases on Friday, May 12. It's good news to know that the Switch should perform even better than before for when Nintendo's most highly anticipated game of the year releases.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-patch-notes-improve-stability-ahead-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-launch/1100-6513933/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor developer Respawn has a fresh patch arriving this week for its Fallen Order sequel, which launched with several bugs on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 last month. The console patches will be available today, with the PC patch arriving later this week.</p><p>One major issue being fixed on PS5 specifically is an HDR value mismatch that would cause HDR setups to display incorrectly for PS5 users. On both consoles, expect a number of bugs to be addressed, ranging from various crash fixes to a "severe" animation issue that would result in the game breaking at a crucial narrative sequence.</p><p>PC players have had a rougher time with Jedi: Survivor, and they'll be receiving a number of fixes targeted solely at that platform. Performance improvements are where the bulk of these fixes lie, and Respawn says that this patch will launch "as soon as possible" on PC. There'll still be more fixes coming in future updates, and Respawn says that it's working on improving performance on newer i7 and i9 CPUs, general performance improvements to both CPU and GPU utilization, and various bug fixes.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-patch-fixes-ps5-hdr-issues-pc-patch-coming-later-this-week/1100-6513932/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>As part of Nintendo's newest earnings briefing, the gaming giant released new sales figures for its most popular games, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe reached a massive new milestone. The kart racer has now surpassed 50 million copies sold to date. As of March 31, the game had sold 53.79 million copies globally, according to Nintendo's public sales data.</p><p>This is up from 48.4 million units as of November 2022, so the game sold another 5.4 million copies in three months. A key point here is that the sales figures for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe includes copies sold through hardware bundles, which surely inflates the figure somewhat. In any event, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a fantastic game that can be recommended to pretty much anyone, so it's no big surprise to see it performing so well for Nintendo.</p><p>Mario Kart 8 for Wii U sold 8.46 million copies. Together, Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe have shifted 62.25 million units.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-8-passes-50-million-units-sold-as-top-10-best-selling-switch-games-revealed/1100-6513931/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Nintendo Switch Sales Are Slowing Down, No New Hardware Confirmed For This Fiscal Year

<p>In its results for the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 2023, Nintendo has reported that Switch hardware sales declined by 22%, as the company only sold 17.97 million consoles during that 12-month period. Nintendo expects this decline to continue through its next fiscal year, which will end on March 31, 2024, and is predicting an additional 16.5% decline, or around 15 million consoles that'll be sold over the next year. In total, Nintendo has sold 125.6 million Switch consoles since it launched in 2017. In comparison, Sony's PS5 sales stand at 38.4 million lifetime sales to date, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-just-did-something-no-console-ever-has-in-history/1100-6513680/">6.3 million consoles shipping in the January-March period</a> this year.</p><p>"Nintendo Switch has entered its seventh year since launch, and while it will become more challenging to maintain the same sales momentum as before, our goal is to have more consumers continue to play Nintendo Switch for longer, leading to maximized sales," Nintendo said in a statement. The global semiconductor shortage was partly attributed to the decline in sales, as well as a decrease in sales from last year's holiday season.</p><p>The company has once again confirmed that no new hardware will ship this fiscal year, and in a call after the financial results were posted, president Shuntaro Furukawa added that Nintendo's 15 million Switch sales goal for the next year will be challenging.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-sales-are-slowing-down-no-new-hardware-confirmed-for-this-fiscal-year/1100-6513928/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
