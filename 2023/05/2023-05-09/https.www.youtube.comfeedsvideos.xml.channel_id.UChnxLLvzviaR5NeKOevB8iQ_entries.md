Tempera is a new granular instrument by the makers of the Vector Synth (https://www.vectorsynth.com/). It features 8 sample slots, each represented by a verticle column, that can be played back polyphonically, 4 granular emitters, envelopes, lfos, a filter, and a reverb.

I've been alpha-testing this unit and have made some content for it. Check it out in person at Superboooth 2023.
