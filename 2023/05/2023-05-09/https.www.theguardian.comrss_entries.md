<p>Russia celebrates Victory Day; Britain reportedly set to blacklist Wagner mercenary group</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers fighting in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> that the “whole country is praying for them”, as he used his Victory Day speech to defend his invasion of Ukraine. </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/putin-recycles-old-grievances-on-victory-day-as-russian-army-battered-in-ukraine">Speaking on the 78th anniversary</a> of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president drew historical parallels between the second world war and fighting in Ukraine. “We are proud of the participants of the special military operation. The future of our people depends on you,” Putin said.</p><p><strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary force said he was told he and his mercenaries would be regarded as “traitors” if they abandoned their positions.</strong> Prigozhin threatened to withdraw his troops from the city in east Ukraine, which has been the site of a long-running battle since 2022 to try to capture it, because of a lack of ammunition. He then rowed back on it, but has again threatened to do so.</p><p><strong>Britain is set to formally blacklist Wagner as a terrorist organization to increase pressure on Russia,</strong> The Times newspaper reported on Tuesday. After two months of building a legal case, proscription or a formal blacklisting of the group was “imminent” and likely to be enacted within weeks, the newspaper reported citing a government source.</p><p><strong>Arman Soldin, a 32-year-old video journalist for Agence France Presse in Ukraine, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/french-journalist-killed-in-russian-rocket-strike-in-ukraine">was killed by Grad rocket fire near Chasiv Yar</a>, in eastern Ukraine,</strong> AFP said on Twitter, citing AFP colleagues who witnessed the incident.</p><p><strong>The UK foreign secretary James Cleverly and US secretary of state Antony Blinken have urged Russia not to use hunger as a weapon of war,</strong> as discussions over the Black Sea grain deal continue.</p><p><strong>Ukraine said its air defences shot down 23 of 25 missiles, fired overnight by Russia, chiefly at Kyiv,</strong> and there were no reported casualties. It was the second night in a row of major Russian airstrikes and fifth so far this month.</p><p><strong>Ukraine is planning a “very important” counteroffensive against Russian forces that must “demonstrate success”, the country’s prime minister has said. </strong>Denys Shmyhal told Sky News that the operation would be launched when the time was right.</p><p><strong>European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen hailed Ukraine as “the beating heart of today’s European values”.</strong> Zelenskiy discussed European integration, defence matters and sanctions against Russia at a meeting with Von der Leyen in Kyiv. He said he expected the EU to soon approve more sanctions on Russia.</p><p><strong>The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said there is currently no prospect of peace between Russia and Ukraine because “both sides are convinced that they can win”. </strong>In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El País on Tuesday, Guterres was pessimistic about the EU and the UN’s ability to broker an end to the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion last year.</p><p><strong>The US has announced a “new security assistance package” to help bolster Ukraine’s air defences and artillery ammunition needs. </strong>This package, confirmed by the Department of Defense on Tuesday, totals up to $1.2bn and is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI).</p><p><strong>A UK-led group of European countries has asked for expressions of interest to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles</strong>. The call for responses from companies who could provide the munitions with range of up to 300km (190 miles) was included in a notice posted last week by the International Fund for Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Germany’s foreign minister has said China could play a decisive role in ending the war in Ukraine.</strong> Speaking alongside her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang, at a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, Annalena Baerbock said that as a permanent member of the UN security council, China had the power to be influential in the conflict and bring it to an end.</p><p><strong>The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Russia “will prevail” in its fight against what he described as “imperialists”, </strong>the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, in remarks seen to be aimed at Ukraine and its western supporters such as the US.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-441-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

Of course you have a right to peaceful protest. Just as I have a right to arrest you if I feel like it. So it would be a good idea for you to move quietly behind this grandstand so that the BBC cameras can’t film you. Not that they would. They know their place. Besides, they will never do another royal event if they do. So move along quietly. Is that a Velcro fastener on your jacket? A belt round your waist? Planning to lock on, are we? Then you’re nicked. God save the king.</p><p>It had all been just a bit of a coincidence. One of those things. You know how it is. You rush through a new Public Order Act and then suddenly find you’ve got a hastily arranged once in a lifetime (TM) – well maybe twice in a lifetime (TM) – coronation to police.

## The Guardian view on policing dissent: more politicised than ever | Editorial

<p>The home secretary’s unprecedented power grab to intervene operationally in public order has been exposed </p><p>It does the police no good if officers are thought to be at the beck and call of politicians. Such a system, relying on policing by consent, would quickly lose the trust of the public. That is why Lord Denning, the most celebrated English judge of the 20th century, argued that the responsibility for law enforcement ought to lie solely with the police. In a now famous judgment, Denning wrote that the chief constable “<a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmhaff/511/51106.htm" title="">is answerable to the law and to the law alone</a>”. Yet when it comes to demonstrations it appears that instead of police proportionately applying the laws of the land, officers are being cowed into serving ministerial interests.</p><p>Deferring to the executive branch has seen officers forced to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65527007" title="">apologise</a> over the arrests of six protesters on coronation day. The proximate cause of the mess was the Home Office’s decision to expedite new criminal offences to prevent disruption into law last week. This gave the police powers to arrest the leaders of an anti-monarchy group, Republic, for having <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sir-mark-rowley-metropolitan-police-officers-king-coronation-london-b1079764.html" title="">equipment</a> that “could have been used as part of a ‘lock on’-style protest”. These turned out to be straps used to transport placards and were about as dangerous as the yellow T-shirts protesters were wearing. The police, it seems, were more bothered about images of disruption of a “<a href="https://news.met.police.uk/news/the-kings-coronation-thank-you-466377" title="">once in a generation event</a>” than the disruption itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/09/the-guardian-view-on-policing-dissent-more-politicised-than-ever">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A muted Victory Day parade reflects a sense of unease after recent attacks on Russian soil</p><p>There were no surprises during Vladimir Putin’s short <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/russian-missiles-downed-over-kyiv-putin-marks-victory-day-ukraine" title="">speech</a> to commemorate the 78th Victory Day in Moscow on Tuesday. Just as last year, Mr Putin drew risible parallels between the Soviet Union’s role in defeating Nazi Germany and his own illegal war in Ukraine. Even the brutal head of the Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2023/03/24/wagner-boss-openly-defies-kremlin-ukraine-nazi-narrative" title="">questioned</a> this narrative, which casts Ukraine as a neo-Nazi puppet regime manipulated by a west intent on destroying Russia. But the president resolutely stuck to the usual script.</p><p>The boilerplate polemic was, however, delivered against a subtly changed backdrop. This was the most muted 9 May celebration since Mr Putin began to co-opt the anniversary for his own revanchist purposes. Fifteen months after Russia’s blitzkrieg invasion ground to a halt last February, the blood-soaked war of attrition taking place in eastern Ukraine has limited the Kremlin’s capacity to put on a show in Red Square. The parade was light on heavy military equipment, compared with previous years, and did not feature an air display. In other parts of Russia, events were cancelled altogether, with officials citing security grounds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/09/the-guardian-view-on-putins-home-front-new-vulnerabilities">Continue reading...</a>

The work, commissioned to depict Prospero and Ariel from Shakespeare’s The Tempest, was attacked with a hammer by a protester last year.

<p>The slow reveal of Disney’s live-action remake of the underwater classic has uncovered a frightening world of digitised horror</p><p>Years and years of bitter experience has taught us not to expect too much from Disney’s live-action remakes of its old animated features. Since Kenneth Branagh’s Cinderella limply beat us all around the head almost a decade ago, we’ve been treated to a litany of disappointing slop. Tim Burton’s Dumbo fused boneheaded storytelling with genuinely nightmarish character design. Jon Favreau’s The Lion King stripped all its characters of personality in favour of dreary photorealistic animation. Guy Ritchie’s Aladdin was Guy Ritchie’s Aladdin, for crying out loud.</p><p>In fact, the torrent of lukewarm, cynically commissioned remakes has been so endless that people have stopped noticing them altogether. Remember the live action Lady and the Tramp movie from four years ago? The Mulan that burped straight to streaming mid-pandemic? The Pinocchio movie that starred Tom Hanks and only came out eight months ago? No, of course you don’t.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/09/little-mermaid-live-action-horror-cats">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It took me years to come round to Random Access Memories, until I connected the dots to its unlikely cousin 40 years its senior, Dark Side of the Moon</p><p>Few records in the 21st century have divided a band’s fans as much as Daft Punk’s fourth studio album, Random Access Memories. While the reviews were largely positive, a significant swathe of the band’s fanbase wondered why they had swapped techno for soft rock. It took me years to come to peace with this beguiling, if confounding, album, until one day the refracted light came on and the pre-decimal penny dropped: Random Access Memories was the 21st century Dark Side of the Moon. And the 10th anniversary reissue of RAM, which arrives on 12 May (coincidentally less than two months after the 50th anniversary edition of Pink Floyd’s legendary eighth album) will help to prove it.</p><p>The inflection point in my thinking was Horizon, a Japanese-edition bonus track on RAM, which is getting a full release as part of the album’s extravagant new triple-LP reissue. It is one of the least electronic songs ever to be released by a duo of electronic musicians: four a half minutes of horizontal space vibes, which stretch out on a base of acoustic guitar, soothing keyboard trills and Greg Leisz’s celestial pedal steel. The subtle shade of a drum machine aside, Horizon could pass for a long-lost Dark Side outtake. (It is no surprise that an enterprising music fan has created a mash up of Horizon with the vocal from Pink Floyd’s follow-up Wish You Were Here).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/09/prog-angst-and-cosmic-pyramids-why-daft-punk-are-my-generations-pink-floyd">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jury expected to begin considering their verdict in case claiming the former US president raped the advice columnist in 1996</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. A jury in New York City is expected to today begin deliberating after hearing evidence in a civil lawsuit brought by advice columnist <strong>E Jean Carroll</strong>, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/08/trump-rape-trial-e-jean-carroll-closing-arguments">alleges that</a> <strong>Donald Trump</strong> raped her in 1996. Trump denies the allegations, but a guilty verdict could further tar the former president as he seeks a second term in the White House amid several legal entanglements – including state and federal criminal investigations into his attempts to overturn the 2020 elections. There’s no telling if a verdict would come today, but we’ll let you know if it does.</p><p>Here’s what else is happening today:</p><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> will meet with congressional leaders to break a logjam between Democrats and Republicans over raising the debt ceiling ahead of 1 June, when the US government could default.

Unlike nice, sweet Liz, Elizabeth was a bit of a schemer. Last year Holmes was convicted on four counts of defrauding investors, by pretending that her blood-testing startup, Theranos, was functional when it wasn’t, and given more than 11 years in prison. She was due to start her sentence on 27 April, but filed a last-minute appeal, buying her a little more time at home. How did she decide to spend those last precious moments of freedom? Taking her kids to the zoo and doing a photoshoot for the New York Times. After almost seven years of media silence, Holmes recently spent several days opening up to a Times writer over berries and Mexican food. The result is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/business/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-interview.html">5,000-word profile</a> introducing her new persona to the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/09/elizabeth-holmes-is-rebranding-herself-as-a-sweet-devoted-mother-will-anyone-buy-it">Continue reading...</a>

## Yes, the Met police threw royal protesters into cells for no good reason – but at least they regret it | Marina Hyde

<p>Yet again, the force leads the way in incompetence and overreach. As for the PM who egged them on: nothing to do with ’im, guv</p><p>In a deeply unpredictable turn of events – anticipated by only the most casual students of the Metropolitan police – the force has made another howler. Howlers are the specific category of Met misuse of powers where nobody died, or got sexually assaulted, or both. Nevertheless, they can have serious significance. The anti-monarchy group Republic participated in months of briefings and meetings with the Met concerning their protest at last Saturday’s coronation, in which they were informed that their peaceful plans were lawful. As it turned out on the day, however, six members of the group, including its chief executive Graham Smith, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/06/head-of-uks-leading-anti-monarchy-group-arrested-at-coronation-protest">were arrested</a> before the protest even began. According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/metpoliceuk/status/1654763993364299777?s=20">Met’s account</a>: “They were held on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance. We seized lock-on devices.”</p><p>And yet … did they? The police seem instead to have seized the luggage straps the protesters used to secure their placards. The force has now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/08/arrests-coronation-protesters-premeditated-republic-chief-police">expressed “regret”</a> that these arrests took place at all. This <a href="https://twitter.com/metpoliceuk/status/1655665839654182914?s=20">lengthy statement</a> adds: “It was not clear at the time that at least one of the group stopped had been engaging with police protest liaison team officers ahead of the event.”</p><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The king had appointed a special team to organise the day’s musical content. There were, however, no summons to Buckingham Palace or be-wigged courtiers bearing gold-embossed letters.

Hinton wanted to speak to deliver a message to the world: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/05/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-fears-for-humanity">he is afraid of the technology he helped create</a>.</p><p>You need to imagine something more intelligent than us by the same difference that we’re more intelligent than a frog. And it’s going to learn from the web, it’s going to have read every single book that’s ever been written on how to manipulate people, and also seen it in practice.”</p><p>He now thinks the crunch time will come in the next five to 20 years, he says. “But I wouldn’t rule out a year or two. And I still wouldn’t rule out 100 years – it’s just that my confidence that this wasn’t coming for quite a while has been shaken by the realisation that biological intelligence and digital intelligence are very different, and digital intelligence is probably much better.”</p><p>A document from a Google engineer leaked online said the company had done “a lot of looking over our shoulders at OpenAI”, referring to the developer of the ChatGPT chatbot.</p><p>“The uncomfortable truth is, we aren’t positioned to win this arms race and neither is OpenAI. While we’ve been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch,” the engineer wrote.</p><p>Giant models are slowing us down. In the long run, the best models are the ones which can be iterated upon quickly. We should make small variants more than an afterthought, now that we know what is possible in the &lt;20B parameter regime.</p><p>On the trail of the <strong>Dark Avenger</strong>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/may/09/on-the-trail-of-the-dark-avenger-the-most-dangerous-virus-writer-in-the-world">the most dangerous virus writer in the world</a> (pictured above).</p><p>For more on Hinton, I spoke on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/may/09/godfather-ai-geoffrey-hinton-humanity-crossroads-podcast">Today in Focus podcast</a> about why he thinks <strong>humanity is at a crossroads</strong>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>AI is quietly authoring more and more of the internet</strong>.

<p>The choreographer shares his ballroom roots, his love for Liverpool nightlife and what makes a perfect TV dance duo</p><p>“The attitude here is that everyone loves the underdog,” says Jason Gilkison, “or the person who looks like they’re not taking themselves too seriously.” He might be describing British culture in general, but we’re talking about TV dance shows, specifically Strictly Come Dancing, on which former champion dancer Gilkison is creative director. He has worked on similar shows in Australia (his home country), South Africa and the US, too. “In America they just want the best, they don’t care if you’ve had past dance training, if you’re Jennifer Grey or a Pussycat Doll. Here that goes against you.”</p><p>In between creating choreography for the Eurovision song contest and planning a new musical, I Should Be So Lucky, based on the songs of Stock, Aitken and Waterman, Gilkison is currently rehearsing the UK tour of <a href="https://strictlytheprofessionals.com/">Strictly Come Dancing – The Professionals</a>, the TV show’s “rebellious little sister” where the pros really get a chance to show what they’re made of. This autumn’s Strictly will be the 21st series. Who is his dream Strictly contestant? “Last night we were talking about it and somebody said, ‘has Nigella ever done the show?’ That’d be great. Joanna Lumley would be my ultimate.

## Blood Feather by Patrick McGuinness review – on the wings of grief

<p>The multitalented writer returns to poetry after 13 years with a striking, moving collection sparked by the death of his mother</p><p>B<em>lood Feather</em>, by the award-winning novelist and nonfiction writer Patrick McGuinness – also an academic (he teaches French at Oxford) – was prompted by the death of his mother. He has not published any poetry for 13 years, until now and this marvellous collection. He is writing about bereavement as erasure. The poems themselves seem slightly surprised by their existence, as if given half a chance, they might remove themselves from the page. Looking at his mother’s photograph, in Mother As Mirror, makes him feel that “I was the illusion”. Sure Things deftly explains there is no such thing as “sure” and, like the jetty that turns out not to exist, he feels unable to hang on to his own words. In Factory for Sad Thoughts, a prose piece, he playfully proposes: “Of all the poems I’ve ever written, this is the one I didn’t.”</p><p>Every word that crosses the border into poetry is worth reading. I loved Today Is Already Over, in which he remembers his mother’s pointless approach to tidying up. He does not need to acknowledge the inescapable thought that she has been cleared away herself. And he has more to add: “…she cleared up around me – /not after me but before./Removing my traces as I went…” (erasure again). It is a feat to write weight-bearing poems of such lightness. The balance, charm and wit of the writing are remarkable, not least because of his mother’s disequilibrium (there are poems that sensitively allude to psychiatric hospital and to her undergoing ECT).</p><p><em>Blood Feather</em> by Patrick McGuinness is published by Jonathan Cape (£12.99).

<p>There’s a crunchy veracity to Ronan Bennett’s script for this evocative story of two men on opposing sides of the Northern Ireland conflict </p><p>The recent 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement underscored how much the Troubles, and those many years of bloodshed, have receded into historical memory. With the wounds less raw, it’s easier to mine the period for drama spiked with high-stakes violence and leavened with moral conundrums about justice, loyalty and political expediency. Belfast-born novelist and screenwriter Ronan Bennett is just the right man to map out this terrain. It’s not just his having roots in the region that helps, but also his longtime involvement in British crime drama, from Face back in 1997 through TV series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/31/ronan-bennett-top-boy-series-three-interview-netflix-drake">Top Boy</a>, to historical mini-series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/23/last-nights-tv-review-gunpowder">Gunpowder</a> about the Guy Fawkes plot.</p><p>Bennett’s script for Dead Shot has a crunchy veracity, and feels like it’s getting the details right, especially in how ideology trickles down into daily lives. The direction by British brothers Charles and Thomas Guard is perhaps less distinctive, but the bones of something strong, original and evocative are there. Like so many tales of men locked in a lethal dance of destruction by the accidents of war, this revolves around two guys on opposing sides who might have, in another place and time, rather liked each other, but are compelled to destroy one another in this world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/09/dead-shot-review-ira-man-and-british-soldier-lock-horns-in-troubles-revenge-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We seek inspiration, consolation – and the unvarnished truth. And we know that all the best stories are true</p><ul><li>Caroline Knox is director of the Boswell book festival</li></ul><p>My love affair with biography began aged nine, when my subscription book club sent me a compendium of “true life” adventure stories. It is a passion I have carried into adulthood: before moving to the great biographer and diarist James Boswell’s home county of Ayrshire and founding <a href="https://www.boswellbookfestival.co.uk/">a festival in his name</a>, I had enjoyed commissioning biography, memoir and travel writing – all genres at which Boswell excelled – as a senior editor at the renowned publisher John Murray. It was then still housed in the family’s London mansion in Albemarle Street, where one of the great lost memoirs in literature, Lord Byron’s, had been burnt in the drawing-room grate.</p><p>Visiting Boswell’s burial place for the first time, in the churchyard in Auchinleck, a former mining village in Ayrshire, I was shocked to discover that Boswell’s literary legacy had also seemingly been laid to rest. His exquisite neoclassical mausoleum stood derelict, with not even a sign to mark his last resting place. I immediately determined to launch a book festival of biography.</p><p>Caroline Knox is director of the <a href="https://www.boswellbookfestival.co.uk/">Boswell Book festival</a>.

As it happened I was in Germany: in many ways the royal family’s spiritual home, even if – in Shilton’s reading of history – it did launch an unsuccessful attempt to invade the national anthem in 1939.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/09/football-fans-booing-national-anthem-liverpool-anfield-premier-league-coronation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The widow of a sign-making craftsman vows to finish his last work in Anastasia Tsang’s drama, a fascinating idea, if conventionally executed</p><p>Hong Kong’s colourful neon signs were once a glittering symbol of the city’s vibrancy; now they are rapidly disappearing, replaced with cheaper options like LED lights. Vanishing alongside these jewels of the night are their creators, passionate artisans whose metier is now obsolete. Steeped in this atmosphere of nostalgia and loss, Anastasia Tsang’s feature debut is a heartfelt love letter to these forgotten craftsmen as well as a bygone Hong Kong whose light continues to linger amid socio-political change.</p><p>Grappling with generational differences, Tsang negotiates a well-intentioned but conventional plot that trades in familiar archetypes. Mei-hsiang (Sylvia Chang), the grieving widow of a master neon maker, clings on to his workshop, a sentimental attachment that stands in stark contrast to her level-headed daughter Prism (Cecilia Choi), who has already made plans to leave for Australia. While the film often relies on cliches to express their clash of personalities, Chang and Choi consistently rise above the broad strokes of their characters, suggesting a love that runs deep beneath a tense mother-and-daughter bond.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/09/a-light-never-goes-out-review-hong-kongs-neon-signs-light-up-nostalgic-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After 20 years in Britain, my Bolivian friend has finally passed her citizenship test. Did she have to learn quite so much trivia?</p><p>Just before the new king appeared on the balcony, I got some wonderful news: my Bolivian friend had passed her UK citizenship test. The fifth time was a charm. We’ve been revising for this since 2018, during which time I have learned, forgotten and learned again what <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pict">the Picts </a>were up to and when, what a traditional Northern Irish dish is and which view was voted by Britons in 2007 as the nation’s most beautiful. OK, it appears that I’ve forgotten that last one all over again, but it doesn’t matter, because my friend is now legit.</p><p>By about two years in, I was finding everything about this test offensive. It required a huge amount of quite diffuse knowledge that would probably never reside in the same person, whether they were born in Britain or not: some of us can name Olympians, some of us can name signature titles in the canon of David Lean and some of us know whether or not the UK government has ever used its power to suspend the Northern Ireland assembly, but the only people who know all these things are quiz teams. That is, apparently, what Great British Values boil down to: could you, or could you not, pull your weight in a pub quiz?</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/09/can-you-pull-your-weight-in-a-pub-quiz-congratulations-youre-welcome-in-the-uk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Girls author’s smart, menacing tale of a young female serial deceiver succeeds as a treatise on sex and alienation and an engrossing beach read</p><p>Published in the run-up to summer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/21/emma-cline-it-was-exhausting-the-girls-novel-cult-granta">Emma Cline</a>’s second novel is probably what people mean when they talk about a “beach read”. Whereas her 2016 debut, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/12/the-girls-emma-cline-review">The Girls</a>, </em>arrived on a tsunami of hype and hazy lyricism, <em>The Guest </em>is the more controlled work of a fine talent maturing on its own terms. Sultry and engrossing, with a note of menace, it’s a gorgeously smart affair whose deceptive lightness conceals strange depths and an arresting originality.</p><p>The story even begins on a beach. The ocean is amniotically warm, the sheen of sunscreen and the colour of bikinis filling the mise-en-scène as we meet our amorphous protagonist. An escort and a sugar baby, at 22 Alex is already in steep decline. Locked into a lifestyle of reciprocal benefit and exploitation, she’s in a relationship with a rich, “professionally healthy” man in his 50s named Simon. Like some AI dating-bot of the imminent future, Alex hoovers up data and adapts herself to her lover’s idea of who he’d like her to be: “All Alex’s unsavoury history excised until it started to seem, even to her, like none of it had ever happened.” As Simon grows suspicious, we infer that Alex has left in her wake a string of angry and disabused men. One of them, the ominously named Dom, has been texting and calling relentlessly since she ripped him off and disappeared.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/09/the-guest-by-emma-cline-review-strange-depths-arresting-originality-the-girls">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For decades, the Tories have perfected the psychological trick of displacing their own negative traits and failures on to their enemies</p><p>The Tories and their entourage, buoyed by four general election wins in a row but looking ever more nervously towards the next one, have found a new way to dodge blame for Britain’s ailing state: pretending they’re not in power.</p><p>“Why is the left in the driving seat of government after 13 years of Tory rule,” the journalist Charles Moore <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/04/14/why-left-driving-government-after-13-years-tory-rule/">asked</a> in the Daily Telegraph last month. A recent cover essay of the Spectator struck a <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-new-elite-the-rise-of-the-progressive-aristocracy/">similar note</a>, claiming a “new<strong> </strong>woke elite” is now “destined to rule over an increasingly divided and embittered society”. Pieces in the Sun, Mail and the Times raised the same alarm. The diagnosis is clear: don’t be fooled by the Conservatives’ long residence in No 10 – a cabal of middle-class liberals, out of step with the public and covertly led by Gary Lineker, is really ruling Britain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/09/projection-deception-sunak-staying-in-power-tories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scott Knudsen was holding his baby when a strike tore through his body. He reflects on the challenging, laughter-filled path to reclaiming his health and identity</p><p>For Scott Knudsen, it was shaping up to be a good day. It was his daughter’s first birthday, and his wife Tracy had just called to say she had a surprise for him. Knudsen had been in town, fetching hay and running chores for their ranch in rural Texas. He thought Tracy might have got him another horse. But when he got home, it was even better: Tracy was there, with baby Hailey and they had washed his dirty tractor. Now, nearly 20 years later, still on the same ranch, Knudsen smiles at the memory. “Oh my goodness, it made me so happy.”</p><p>It was mid-afternoon, on a July day in 2005. Knudsen was 37 years old. In the distance there was a thunderstorm – he could see the rain clouds, 15 or so miles away – but where they stood there were blue-skies and calm. Several of their horses were out to pasture; there were chickens around, pecking at the dirt. Tracy handed Hailey to Knudsen to hold.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/09/struck-by-lightning-my-face-burned-and-my-memory-disappeared-here-is-how-i-made-it-back">Continue reading...</a>

But who was writing them, and why?</p><p>In the 1980s, there was no better place than Bulgaria for virus lovers. The socialist country – plagued by hyperinflation, crumbling infrastructure, food and petrol rationing, daily blackouts and packs of wild dogs in its streets – had become one of the hottest hi-tech zones on the planet. Legions of young Bulgarian programmers were tinkering on their pirated IBM PC clones, pumping out computer viruses that managed to travel to the gleaming and prosperous west.</p><p>In 1989, an article appeared in Bulgaria’s leading computer magazine saying the media’s treatment of computer viruses was sensationalist and inaccurate. The article, in the January issue of Bulgaria’s Computer for You magazine, titled The Truth About Computer Viruses, was written by Vesselin Bontchev, a 29-year-old researcher at the Institute of Industrial Cybernetics and Robotics at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in Sofia. Fear of computer viruses, Bontchev wrote, was turning into “mass psychosis”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/may/09/on-the-trail-of-the-dark-avenger-the-most-dangerous-virus-writer-in-the-world">Continue reading...</a>
