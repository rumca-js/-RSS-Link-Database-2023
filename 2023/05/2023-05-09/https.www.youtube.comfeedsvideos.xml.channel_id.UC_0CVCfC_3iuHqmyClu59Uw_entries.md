The new Ryzen 7840U powered GPD Wain Max 2 now has an Oculink port and in this video we take look at eGPU performance! In my experience Oculink is Cheaper and faster than Thunderbolt or USB4 so this is pretty awesome that they have added an external port! By adding a Graphics card over oculink you can easily turn the GPD Win Max 2 into a full Desktop Gaming PC! We test out A Radeon RX6600 but you can whatever card you want.
