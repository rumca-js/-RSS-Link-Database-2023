Royal jelly is a secretion made by honeybee workers to feed larvae of future queen bees. All bees consume royal jelly, but once a queen is selected, workers then feed on pollen and honey, while only the queen feeds on the prized jelly. Referred to as the "superfood of the beehive," royal jelly contains much more nutrients than honey and is 20 times more expensive. Since the 1980s, production worldwide has grown from 700 to nearly 4,000 metric tons. Royal jelly can be found in its natural form, as a health supplement, or in skincare products, and it can reach $125 per pound. But extracting royal jelly requires great precision, as the process can only be done by hand.
