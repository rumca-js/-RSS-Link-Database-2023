<p>Microsoft is now testing ads as part of the Windows 11 Settings menu, as Microsoft&rsquo;s push for you to take full advantage of its services continues.</p>



<p>Microsoft is reportedly encouraging users to adopt Microsoft accounts as part of the &ldquo;Accounts&rdquo; portion of the Microsoft Settings menu. However, the ads not here yet; Microsoft is testing them as part of the early Insider Canary builds, testers say, which means that Microsoft isn&rsquo;t guaranteed to release them in final code for Windows 11 users at large.</p>



<p>Twitter user &ldquo;Albacore,&rdquo; who tests and then publicizes interesting features of new Windows builds, reported the change.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Updates were made to the Microsoft Account portion of the upcoming Settings Homepage, here's how it looks now + a preview of end of product support notices that can appear in the Account page <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/DwYEKqOb9n&amp;xcust=2-3-1814672-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/DwYEKqOb9n</a></p>&mdash; Albacore (@thebookisclosed) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/thebookisclosed/status/1654616533455327232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-3-1814672-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">May 5, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that, first, the &ldquo;ad&rdquo; appeared when the user was logged in with a local account, and that it apparently only appeared in the <em>Settings &gt; Accounts</em> section of the Windows 11 Settings menu. While Microsoft allows users to create general local accounts for use in Windows, more and more Windows services require you to sign in&mdash;to automatically sync Windows files, use the Windows Store, and so on. But a local account also frees you from services that you may not want to use, such as OneDrive, and can make it harder for Microsoft to track your usage. </p>



<p>But Microsoft&rsquo;s intrusive ads or notifications come as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1668041/ads-in-the-windows-11-start-menu-are-definitely-coming.html">Microsoft inserts more ads into the Start menu</a>, for example. Unfortunately, ads have been <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/410928/here-we-go-again-microsofts-popping-up-ads-from-the-windows-10-toolbar.html">a fact of life within Windows</a> for years, and as Microsoft prepares to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1069153/windows-10-continue-until-2025-microsoft.html">wind down Windows 10</a> and its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801718/windows-10-wont-receive-any-more-feature-updates.html">lack of new feature updates</a>, we can probably expect more &ldquo;reminders,&rdquo; &ldquo;ads,&rdquo; and / or &ldquo;notifications&rdquo; to continue.</p>



<p>Of course, there are those who argue that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/623446/why-i-think-there-should-be-ads-within-windows.html">Microsoft ads are a good thing</a>: that new features should be promoted, and users should be made aware of what options they have to take advantage of them. On the other hand, if you are aware of them, they&rsquo;re just another obtrusive roadblock that you have to dismiss to continue with your day.</p>

<p>The offer is good from now until June 13th, and though the Rise Against Evil bundle is limited to &ldquo;select retailers,&rdquo; it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to find &mdash; these code bundles generally show up at all the major retailers. In addition to the $70 game (ouch), the code includes the Light-Bearer Mount and Caparison of Faith Armor for <em>Diablo IV</em>, Inarius Wings and Inarius Murloc pet for <em>Diablo III</em>, an Amalgam Rage Mount for <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and the Umber Winged Darkness Cosmetics set for the <em>Diablo Immortal </em>game for PCs and mobile devices. </p>



<p>If that&rsquo;s not enough, the latest version of <em>Diablo IV</em> supports Nvidia&rsquo;s impressive DLSS 3 technology, which you can try out in the Server Slam Beta taking place between May 12th and 14th. For the uninitiated, this AI-assisted super scaling system can interpolate frames to let you turn on higher graphics settings without losing performance. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/dlss-3-explained-how-nvidias-ai-infused-rtx-tech-turbocharges-pc-gaming.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Check out our DLSS 3 explainer guide</a> for a breakdown of the technical details &mdash; you can see it <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1782490/cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-mode-benchmarks-nvidia-rtx-path-tracing.html">working wonders in the latest build of <em>Cyberpunk</em> <em>2077</em></a>, too. </p>

<p>Of course, DLSS 3 only works with those 40-series cards, which is why that Diablo freebie isn&rsquo;t being extended to older cards. That, and the fact that Nvidia and its OEM partners would really like you to pick up the latest GPUs, naturally. The promotion seems to be live at Best Buy at the moment &mdash; adding an Asus RTX 4070 includes <em>Diablo IV</em> and an <em>Overwatch II</em> battle pass in the cart &mdash; and we&rsquo;ve spotted it at B&amp;H Photo Video, too. Happy demon hunting. </p>

<p>With a strong focus on providing cloud-based web hosting solutions for developers and businesses, DigitalOcean has quickly risen in popularity since it was founded in 2011. Its services are designed to be simple, scalable, and affordable, making it an attractive option for developers, startups, and small- to medium-sized businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DigitalOcean doesn&rsquo;t cater directly to beginners like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1533118/hostgator-web-hosting-review.html">HostGator</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1660348/inmotion-hosting-review.html">InMotion Hosting</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1468898/bluehost-web-hosting-review.html">Bluehost</a>, but the platform is straightforward enough for those with a little technical knowledge to navigate.</p>



<h2 id="digitalocean-pricing">DigitalOcean pricing</h2>



<p>DigitalOcean offers various hosting plans with different features and pricing options to accommodate a range of needs and budgets. The pricing model is based on pay-as-you-go hourly or monthly rates, which gives your more control over your costs.</p>



<p>The most basic plan, called Basic Droplets, starts at $4 per month, or $0.00595 per hour. The more advanced plans offer increased resources, such as RAM and storage, at progressively higher prices. Unlike some competitors, DigitalOcean is transparent about its prices.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Digital Ocean pricing plans" class="wp-image-1806029" height="975" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pricing-plans.png" width="1002" /><figcaption>Basic Droplets is the basic pricing tier.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell / Foundry</p></div>



<p>There are five different Droplets packages you can choose from, and each package has different CPU options. Visit <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets&amp;xcust=2-2-1806027-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">DigitalOcean&rsquo;s pricing page</a> to browse the different prices for each item in each package, based on your CPU selection. If you&rsquo;re not sure what you need, DigitalOcean put together a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/concepts/choosing-a-plan/&amp;xcust=2-2-1806027-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">comprehensive document</a> to help you choose.</p>



<h2 id="getting-started-with-digitalocean">Getting started with DigitalOcean</h2>



<p>Setting up a server with DigitalOcean is pretty straightforward, but it&rsquo;s geared towards developers and businesses with some technical knowledge. DigitalOcean&rsquo;s &ldquo;Droplets&rdquo; concept refers to virtual machines that can be deployed in a matter of seconds. Users can choose from a wide range of pre-built images or upload their own, so the setup process is highly customizable.</p>



<p>DigitalOcean&rsquo;s control panel is intuitive, and lets users easily manage their Droplets and other resources. It includes features like monitoring, backups, snapshots, and team collaboration tools. For those who prefer command-line access, DigitalOcean also offers an API and CLI tool.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean&rsquo;s Droplets&mdash;its virtual private servers&mdash;are the backbone of its hosting offerings. These Droplets come with flexible configurations, allowing you to choose from various RAM, CPU, and storage options. This lets you tailor your hosting environment to suit your specific needs.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean provides multiple options for backing up and protecting your data so that your web applications and services remain safe from potential threats.</p>



<p>One of the primary backup options offered by DigitalOcean is its automated backup feature, but you&rsquo;ll need a bit of a technical background to set it up. These snapshots can be used to restore your Droplet to a previous state in case of any issues.

<p>DigitalOcean has robust security measures in place, including two-factor authentication (2FA) for user accounts and secure connections using SSL/TLS.

This level of uptime is crucial for businesses and individuals who depend on their online presence for generating leads, sales, or revenue. After all, lost time is lost money.</p>



<p>To ensure optimal performance, DigitalOcean operates multiple data centers across the globe. This distribution of data centers allows for faster content delivery and reduced latency, which means a better better overall user experience.</p>



<p>DigitalOcean&rsquo;s infrastructure is built using high-quality hardware and scalable SSD storage, providing fast and reliable performance. Users can also take advantage of DigitalOcean&rsquo;s load balancers, which help distribute traffic evenly across multiple Droplets, ensuring consistent performance even during traffic spikes or high-demand periods.</p>



<p>The provided monitoring tools lets you track your Droplets&rsquo; performance and resource usage. This visibility allows you to optimize your setup and make informed decisions about scaling your resources as needed.</p>



<h2 id="digitalocean-customer-support">DigitalOcean customer support</h2>

<p>The next time you get a craving for a spicy chicken sandwich, you might have to ask an AI to ring it up for you. American fast food burger chain Wendy&rsquo;s is teaming up with Google to make an AI-powered chatbot for taking drive-through food orders, debuting in a single restaurant in Columbus, Ohio in June. According to company representatives, the idea is to streamline the ordering process and speed up the drive-through experience. </p>



<p>If the idea of ordering your food from a speak-and-respond computer program sounds like a headache, you&rsquo;re not alone. But <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wendys-google-train-next-generation-order-taker-an-ai-chatbot-968ff865?mod=djemalertNEWS&amp;xcust=2-1-1814175-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Wall Street Journal</a> quotes Wendy&rsquo;s CIO Kevin Vasconi, who says that the Google-developed AI system is &ldquo;at least as good as our best customer service representative, probably on average better.&rdquo; Presumably the tech is at least tangentially related to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671133/chatgpt-vs-bing-vs-bard-whats-the-best-ai-chatbot.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Bard</a>, but that hasn&rsquo;t been specified. The system has been trained to tune out extraneous noises, like the sound of a passing conversation or kids fighting in the backseat, and can recognize shorthand like &ldquo;JBC&rdquo; for &ldquo;junior bacon cheeseburger.&rdquo; (Which sounds more like what a marketer wants people to say at the drive-through, if you ask me.) </p>



<p>The program is designed to mimic most of the behaviors of a real drive-through operator, like upselling customers on their orders &mdash; the traditional &ldquo;would you like a Frostie with that?&rdquo;, et cetera. Once an order is placed and confirmed it&rsquo;s sent to the restaurant&rsquo;s (human) line cooks and handed to the customer by a (human) window operator in the usual way. Wendy&rsquo;s CEO Todd Penegor said the tool was designed to help human workers do their job more efficiently, not replace them. </p>



<p>Wendy&rsquo;s did not say if, or when, the complex system would spread to more locations. </p>

## Microsoft: Copilot AI helps you skip meetings, zoom through email

<p>The AI-powered Microsoft 365 Copilot could allow you to skip or even double-book meetings without missing out on what was discussed, &ldquo;hopscotch&rdquo; through priority email, and more.</p>



<p>Microsoft 365 Copilot, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661514/microsoft-365-copilot-is-microsofts-ai-powers-applied-to-work.html">announced in March</a>, unfortunately remains in preview. Microsoft is confident enough of what it can do, though, that it said today that it&rsquo;s charging 600 worldwide customers to try it out as part of a Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Pass. </p>



<p>In March, corporate vice president Jared Spataro said that Copilot would come to basically all Microsoft 365 apps: Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Teams and more. The company released a number of video demonstrations of how Microsoft 365 Copilot will work in its various apps. Two, though, stand out: AI-powered email prioritization in Outlook, and an AI assistant in Teams that can sit in on meeting you can&rsquo;t attend and keep you up to date on what happened.</p>



<h2 id="how-copilot-for-microsoft-teams-helps-you-skip-meetings">How Copilot for Microsoft Teams helps you skip meetings</h2>



<p>Being in two virtual places at once sounds impossible, but that&rsquo;s exactly what Microsoft is proposing. Instead of trying to bounce between two meetings at once, Copilot for Microsoft Teams will allow you to &ldquo;follow&rdquo; a meeting. &ldquo;Following&rdquo; a meeting allows Copilot to attend in your place. After the meeting is over, Teams will present a transcript, summary, notes, and more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>That&rsquo;s pretty nice, but AI takes it to another level. Because Copilot was there, you can ask it questions about what actually happened, and, more importantly, why it happened. Copilot even cites the transcript so you can be sure it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;hallucinating&rdquo; a false response. About the only thing it can&rsquo;t do, for now, is input suggestions on your behalf. </p>



<h2 id="how-copilot-for-outlook-can-clean-up-your-inbox">How Copilot for Outlook can clean up your inbox</h2>



<p>Naturally, Microsoft&rsquo;s email efforts will focus on Outlook. Microsoft offers a number of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394308/how-to-clean-up-your-outlook-inbox-and-manage-your-email.html">ways to clean up your Outlook inbox</a>, but prioritizing email is often determined by the sender (with that red exclamation mark) or by Outlook deciding to weed out spam. Now AI will step in. In the video below, look how Outlook will now just jump in and allow you to bounce around your inbox, quickly triaging your email without rearranging it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s writing tools like Editor have provided feedback on your writing for some time, suggesting inclusive language and improved grammar. Now, though, they can criticize your tone <em>and</em> provide suggestions. </p>



<p>In Outlook Mobile, you&rsquo;ll be able to use AI to draft a quick reply, and the Copilot AI will pull up relevant documents, too.</p>



<h2 id="how-copilot-for-word-will-work">How Copilot for Word will work</h2>



<p>Educators may have some real concerns about using AI in the classroom via ChatGPT. This won&rsquo;t alleviate their concerns. </p>



<p>Copilot for Word allows you to pull in sources (in this demonstration, just documents, but presumably websites as well) and Word will synthesize their contents in the context and style that you want. What Word also does is use AI to apply formatting, so that you&rsquo;ll be able to make it match up with previous documents, too.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>AI tends to create copy that sounds somewhat robotic and formal. Whether that&rsquo;s an advantage or not in business (or in a research paper) is anyone&rsquo;s guess. Still, the ability to quickly integrate various sources into a cohesive document could be a powerful tool. (Note that Microsoft uses the term &ldquo;draft&rdquo; here, implying that human input will continue to be needed. </p>



<h2 id="how-copilot-for-powerpoint-will-work">How Copilot for PowerPoint will work</h2>



<p>You have to admit that Microsoft&rsquo;s pitch video for Copilot for PowerPoint offers a compelling scenario: take a Word document, convert it to a PowerPoint document, and then go back at the click of a button. Using AI to add or integrate a slide sounds just as useful. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know whether an audience actually values your slides, or just <em>you</em>. If it&rsquo;s the latter, then a quick, AI-designed pitch deck to provide a visual aid might be something you can do in the moments before your meeting.</p>



<h2 id="how-copilot-for-excel-will-work">How Copilot for Excel will work</h2>



<p>In recent years, Microsoft has tried to make Microsoft Excel synonymous with &ldquo;business intelligence,&rdquo; pulling in data from a variety of sources and adding its own insights. Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot for Excel doesn&rsquo;t appear to be as transformative as some of the other apps (and who knows how it will apply to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/559001/the-future-of-esports-is-microsoft-excel-and-its-on-espn.html">Excel World Cup</a>, for that matter.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Still, being able to ask Copilot for a summary of what occurred in a given quarter, and what <em>could</em> occur, could be extremely valuable. </p>



<p>We still don&rsquo;t know whether Copilot will simply be a component of Microsoft 365, or whether Microsoft will tack on a premium tier with AI as a value-added feature. If it does, at least we&rsquo;ll be able to know exactly what Microsoft plans to charge for.</p>



<h2 id="the-rest">The rest</h2>



<p>Microsoft is adding Copilot for Microsoft Viva and OneNote, too. Copilot for OneNote feels very similar to Copilot for Word, pulling in documents colleagues have authored and integrating them into a broader document.</p>



<p>Under the hood, Microsoft said it will provide a new &ldquo;semantic index&rdquo; for customers. This semantic index is essentially an AI-powered search codex. Instead of looking for documents on a company&rsquo;s South American sales, for example, the semantic index will already have digested these, so that it can return more sophisticated responses immediately.</p>



<p>Microsoft also believes that workers will demand these AI capabilities. The company released a Work Trends index that showed that while 49 percent of people say they&rsquo;re worried AI will replace their jobs, 70 percent would delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen their workloads. About 75 percent of the 30,000 people the poll polled said they would use AI for administrative tasks, and 79 percent they would use it for analytical work, too.</p>

<p>Does your laptop feel sluggish? Do you have to wait five minutes after rebooting the laptop before it responds? Does it struggle to switch between browser tabs even when you have less than half a dozen open?</p>



<p>A slow, frustrating laptop may have you shopping for a new notebook, but you should try these tips before you give up. Improving the performance of your aging laptop can extend its life by several years and keep it out of the landfill.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If these tips don&rsquo;t speed up your notebook, check out our guides to the best <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">laptops</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html">Chromebooks</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407493/best-gaming-laptops.html">gaming laptops</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/699203/the-best-laptops-under-500-best-overall-best-for-oled-fans-and-more.html">laptops under $500</a> before you upgrade.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="restart-your-pc">Restart your PC</h2>



<p>Have you tried turning it off and on again?</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s cliche for a reason. If anything, this trick is even more relevant today. A modern laptop is reliable and can be placed in an efficient sleep mode to save power. There&rsquo;s no reason to turn it off unless you&rsquo;re installing a Windows update or troubleshooting.</p>



<p>Give it a try. Shut down the laptop and turn it back on using the power button. It only takes a minute.</p>



<h2 id="clean-startup-applications">Clean startup applications</h2>



<p>A fresh start also lets you see applications launch when your laptop boots into Windows. Many applications are designed to launch when Windows loads, and they tend to pile up over time. A pile of startup apps can bog down a laptop.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/startup-apps-100901701-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="startup apps" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/startup-apps-100901701-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p>You can clean startup applications by opening Windows Settings app. Open Settings, then perform a quick search for &ldquo;Startup apps.&rdquo; You will (surprise!) see a list of apps that launch at startup. Toggles next to each app let you enable or disable them. Windows even has an estimate of how much they impact boot times (though this estimate hasn&rsquo;t proven accurate in my experience).</p>



<p>Most applications will appear in this list, but some may not. You can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/241049/how_to_disable_windows_startup_programs.html">disable these apps the old fashioned way</a> with the Windows System Configuration application.</p>



<h2 id="check-your-internet-connection">Check your Internet connection</h2>



<p>Odds are most tasks you regularly perform on your laptop require an Internet connection. Web browsing, Netflix streaming, and online gaming all require a healthy connection. A slow Internet connection can drag down performance.</p>



<p>You can check your Internet connection with a speed test utility like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.speedtest.net&amp;xcust=2-1-395113-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">speedtest.net</a>. Run the test several times while recording your ping time, download, and upload speeds. You&rsquo;ll ideally want to see a ping time in the single digits with download and upload speeds above 10Mbps.</p>



<p>Also take note of wild swings in performance between tests. That&rsquo;s a sign your Internet connection works but is unreliable.</p>



<p>Suspect your Internet connection is the problem? Check <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2835564/when-your-ethernet-wont-connect.html">our guide to fixing a wired Internet connection</a> if you use ethernet, or our guide to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/695032/how-to-fix-wifi-router-issues.html">fixing Wi-Fi problems if you use wireless</a>.</p>



<h2 id="free-up-ram">Free up RAM</h2>



<p>Your laptop&rsquo;s random access memory, or RAM, is its short-term memory. It keeps track of active applications and the data they need. A laptop that runs out of RAM must instead draw data directly from the hard drive which, even in the case of a modern solid state drive, takes more time.</p>



<p>You can see active programs, and the memory they consume, with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/241693/how_to_use_task_manager.html">Task Manager</a>. You can launch this from Windows Search or by pressing <em>Control + Alt + Delete</em> on your keyboard and selecting Task Manager from the menu that appears.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/task-manager-100901703-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="task manager" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/task-manager-100901703-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Windows 10&rsquo;s Task Manager.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Task Manager will open a list of active programs. Select More Detail to see the amount of memory each program is using. Select applications that appear to use a great deal of memory and hit End Task to close them. Be warned this completely (and instantly) closes the app and you may lose unsaved data.</p>



<p>Freeing up RAM with Task Manager is a band-aid. It can help you root out RAM hogs, but it&rsquo;s likely the apps you had open were open for a reason. Still, this can work while you search for alternative apps that use less memory or plan a memory upgrade.</p>



<h2 id="free-up-space-on-your-hard-drive">Free up space on your hard drive</h2>



<p>Your hard drive is your laptop&rsquo;s long-term memory, and it too will cause problems when filled to capacity. You won&rsquo;t be able to install new applications, of course, and may notice a general malaise. This happens because many apps, and Windows itself, need a bit of space to store temporary files.</p>



<p>You can check your laptop&rsquo;s storage by opening Windows&rsquo; Settings, selecting System, and then Storage. Windows will display a bar graph showing how much storage is used. The bar will be red if your hard drive is too full.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/system-storage-100901702-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="system storage" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/system-storage-100901702-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p>This same menu also provides a list of how your storage is used. This includes apps, temporary files, video, music, OneDrive files, and more. You can select each to not only see a breakdown of what&rsquo;s taking up space but begin removing apps or emptying temporary storage. Apps &amp; features nearly always take up the most space, so browsing that section and uninstalling large apps is the most effective way to free up space.</p>



<p>The Windows&rsquo; Storage menu is not perfect, however. It can fail to detect programs, in which case they&rsquo;ll be listed under Other instead of Apps &amp; features. Be sure to check both.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/259971/easy_ways_to_clear_space_on_your_laptops_hard_drive.html">Our guide to freeing up space on a laptop hard drive</a> has more space-saving tips.</p>



<h2 id="run-windows-update">Run Windows Update</h2>



<p>Windows Update may improve performance by updating your laptop&rsquo;s drivers or installing a new version of Windows that resolves issues found in a previous version.</p>



<p>By default, your laptop should run Windows Update regularly, which means you won&rsquo;t have updates to install. You may have put off your updates, however, or disabled the feature entirely. Windows users often do this after tiring of Windows Update&rsquo;s frequent reminders.</p>



<p>You can run Windows Update by opening the Windows Settings menu and then selecting Updates &amp; Security. This will launch right into Windows Update. Download and install pending updates. Most updates require you restart the laptop to finish installation.</p>



<h2 id="reset-windows">Reset Windows</h2>



<p>Is your laptop still annoyingly slow? It&rsquo;s time to pull out and nuke the site from orbit.</p>



<p>Resetting Windows is an extreme step but often helps with performance issues. You&rsquo;re effectively returning the laptop to its factory default settings. This can resolve application, Windows configuration, and device driver issues that are causing performance problems.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/windowsdefaultbackground-100900393-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="windows default background 3x2" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/windowsdefaultbackground-100900393-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3088749/windows-10-reinstallation-tip-how-to-reset-your-pc-and-remove-everything.html">Our guide to resetting Windows provides the details</a>. Fortunately, the steps are fairly straightforward. Open the Windows&rsquo; Settings app, select <em>Updates &amp; Security</em>, and then <em>Recovery</em>. <em>Reset this PC</em> sits at the top of this menu. Hit <em>Get Started</em> and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>



<p>Make sure to back up all important files before you reset Windows. The reset can take some time on older hardware, so plan to have the laptop out of commission for the day.</p>



<h2 id="upgrade-your-laptops-ram">Upgrade your laptop&rsquo;s RAM</h2>



<p>Is your laptop still sluggish? A hardware upgrade could be your only hope.</p>



<p>Adding RAM will fix sluggish performance caused by limited RAM capacity. While you can close programs to free up RAM, as previously suggested, adding more RAM is the best long-term solution.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="a miniature toolbox or toolkit on a laptop keyboard to build, develop or repair" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/05/tools_tiny_toolbox_toolkit_on_laptop_keyboard_by_bet_noire_gettyimages_1200x800-100756958-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></figure></div>




<p>Unfortunately, this isn&rsquo;t always possible. Modern laptops may permanently fix RAM to the mainboard or seal the laptop in a way that makes an upgrade difficult or impossible without special tools. Check your laptop manual to see if an upgrade is possible.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/260794/how-to-add-ram-to-your-laptop.html">Our guide to upgrading your laptop&rsquo;s RAM</a> will help you navigate the details of purchasing and installing new RAM.</p>



<h2 id="upgrade-to-a-solid-state-drive">Upgrade to a solid state drive</h2>



<p>Most current laptops are sold with a solid state drive, but some recent models were available with a mechanical spinning disk, also known as a hard disk drive or HDD. Disk drives offer a lot of storage at a low price but are much, much slower than a solid state drive. You&rsquo;ll be waiting every time you access data from the hard disk.</p>

<p>As with RAM, not every laptop is built to allow a user hard drive upgrade. Having said that, laptops that shipped with a hard disk drive are likely to support an upgrade. You can check your laptop&rsquo;s manual to find out more.</p>

<p>Make sure that you <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3201971/best-windows-backup-software.html">backup important data</a> before you begin. Most laptops don&rsquo;t support two hard drives. You&rsquo;ll have to replace your current drive to install the new one.</p>

<p>Find yourself suddenly needing to be more productive? Good news! Windows 10 comes loaded with all sorts of tools designed to help you Get Things Done, along with deeper tweaks that can optimize the operating system for productivity even more. Each new major upgrade adds even more. Now for the bad news: All those excellent productivity-boosting Windows tools and tweaks aren&rsquo;t immediately obvious, with many of the most useful settings buried deep inside a maze of options menus. (There&rsquo;s a reason we need to publish articles like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/702039/10-tiny-windows-tips-to-power-up-your-pc.html">10 little-known Windows features that will blow your mind</a>.)</p>



<p>We can help. Taking five or ten minutes to tinker with Windows 10 can supercharge your setup, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re trying to keep at work while stuck at home or setting up something more permanent. And now that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801718/windows-10-wont-receive-any-more-feature-updates.html">Windows 10 won&rsquo;t receive any more feature updates</a>, these awesome tricks should be locked-in forever.  </p>

<h2 id="get-rid-of-interruptions">Get rid of interruptions</h2>



<p>If you want to stay focused on a task, reducing your interruptions is key. That can be as simple as checking your email and social media only at designated times, but Windows 10 can still pop up notifications that can kick you out of a productive headspace, be it from apps or the OS itself. Let&rsquo;s eradicate those first.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/notifications-100836577-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="notifications" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/notifications-100836577-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Windows 10&rsquo;s notifications options</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Open the Start menu, click the Settings cog icon, and head to <em>System &gt; Notifications and actions</em>. You have a few different options here. To nuke <em>all</em> notifications from orbit, eradicating them completely, move the <em>Get notifications from apps and other senders&nbsp;</em>item to <em>Off</em>. Boom.</p>



<p>For a more nuanced approach, you can click the tiny <em>Focus assist settings</em> link underneath that option, which allows you to set up rules for when and how you&rsquo;ll receive OS notifications.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/focus-assist-100836576-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="focus assist" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/focus-assist-100836576-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Windows 10&rsquo;s Focus Assist options.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>If you want to receive some notifications&mdash;say, Mail and Calendar events&mdash;but not others, head back to the main <em>Notifications and actions</em> screen. At the bottom, you&rsquo;ll see a big list of all the apps that can potentially send you notifications. Slide the ones that aren&rsquo;t critical to off. I like to disable the Razer Synapse and Discord system notifications, for example, because even though I&rsquo;m a gamer they&rsquo;re prone to interrupting me during work hours. I also avoid Mail notifications, preferring to check my inbox on my own schedule.</p>



<p>Notifications aren&rsquo;t even the worst offender when it comes to interruptions. <em>Nothing</em> is worse than Windows 10&rsquo;s forced restarts your PC to install updates. Fortunately, Microsoft&rsquo;s worked in lots of tools over the years that make that scenario much less likely to occur&mdash;if you know they exist, that is.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/windows-update-100836580-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="windows update" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/windows-update-100836580-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Windows Update options.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Head to <em>Start &gt; Settings&gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update</em> to tinker with your options. Particularly, check on your <em>Change Active Hours</em> settings. These let you tell Windows when you&rsquo;re working, and it won&rsquo;t automatically reset your PC during that time. The ability to pause all updates for a week is handy, too; if you dig into the <em>Advanced options</em> menu you can push them out for just over a month.</p>



<h2 id="organize-your-workflow">Organize your workflow</h2>



<p>Instilling some order over your workflow can make a big difference. Sure, <em>Alt-Tab-</em>bing through all your open programs can work, but taking the time to set up some sort of organization can help keep things running as smoothly as possible. Windows 10 includes several tools that can make multi-tasking even more productive.</p>



<p>First off: Multi-monitor setups <em>rock</em> for productivity, and I highly recommend using more than one monitor if possible. Our guides on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2057936/how-to-set-up-two-monitors.html">how to set up dual monitors</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2953978/use-windows-10s-individual-display-scaling-to-perfect-your-multi-monitor-setup.html">Windows 10&rsquo;s individual display scaling</a> can help you out in that case. In a pinch, you can even <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2924203/use-your-tv-as-a-computer-monitor-everything-you-need-to-know.html">use a TV as a computer monitor</a>, though they work better as auxiliary displays. That said, not everyone wants (or can afford) more than one display, and the Windows 10 tools below help even if you&rsquo;re stuck on a single screen.</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/windows-snap-100836579-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="windows snap" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/windows-snap-100836579-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>When you Snap a window to one half of the screen, Windows pulls back all your other open windows to let you choose one to fill the other side.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate the power of Windows Snap, a native way to easily divvy up your monitor into multiple segments devoted to separate apps. Grab an open window by its title bar&mdash;the horizontal bar at the top that says its name&mdash;and drag it all the way to the left or right of the screen, until your mouse cursor touches the edge of the display. You&rsquo;ll see a transparent outline flow out from your cursor to fill half the screen. Let go, and the chosen program will expand, taking up that space. Any other programs open on that monitor will appear on the other half of the screen, and if you select one, it&rsquo;ll expand to fill that space. Boom! Now you&rsquo;ve got two programs on the screen at the same time, split right down the middle.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a large monitor, or a pixel-dense 1440p or 4K display, you can use Snap to divide your screen even more. Dragging open windows to a corner of your display will Snap them into that quarter of the screen, though using this method <em>won&rsquo;t</em> trigger a prompt asking you what to fill the rest of the screen with. You&rsquo;ll need to Snap the windows you want manually to each corner.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/windows-snap-quadrants-100836609-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="windows snap quadrants" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/windows-snap-quadrants-100836609-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Four windows Snapped into four quadrants of the screen can put a lot of info at your fingertips at once.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>It&rsquo;s worth it, though. Having, say, a document, a spreadsheet, your work&rsquo;s chat software, and Outlook open and visible all at the same time can help you get a <em>lot </em>of stuff done faster, especially if you&rsquo;re transferring data from one of the apps to another. And if you want to customize the Snap functionality even further, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/700812/you-should-be-using-fancyzones-microsofts-killer-multitasking-app.html">FancyZones, Microsoft&rsquo;s killer multitasking app</a>.</p>



<p>Another potent tool for organization: The criminally underutilized Virtual Desktops feature, which debuted in Windows 10. Virtual desktops let you separate &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; versions of your desktop, each running its own instances of software, that you can hop between. I work from home, so I sometimes run separate virtual desktops devoted to work time and play time, for instance&mdash;Office, Slack, and a browser dedicated to work tasks in one, and &ldquo;fun&rdquo; apps like Steam, Discord, and a browser with Reddit or Twitter open in another. When it&rsquo;s break time (or beer o&rsquo; clock), I can just hop over to the &ldquo;play&rdquo; virtual desktop and pick up where I left off.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/virtual-desktop-bar-100836578-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="virtual desktop bar" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/virtual-desktop-bar-100836578-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>You can see your various virtual desktops at the top of Windows 10&rsquo;s Task View, above your activity Timeline.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Alternatively, you could set up multiple virtual desktops, each dedicated to its own complicated work task, with all the relevant programs, browser tabs, and documents/spreadsheets open to that particular project. Your only limit is your imagination!</p>



<p>To start using virtual desktops, click the Task View icon in Windows 10&rsquo;s taskbar to summon your Timeline. Select the tiny&nbsp;<em>+New desktop&nbsp;</em>text at the top-left of the screen.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><img alt="windows 10 taskbar task view icon 2" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/windows-10-taskbar-task-view-icon-2-100836698-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /><figcaption>
<p>In Windows 10, the Task View icon (a small stack of rectangles with a slider on the right side) can be found to the right of the search bar and the Cortana icon.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Once you&rsquo;re set up, use the same Task View interface to swap among open virtual desktops in the bar that appears at the top of the screen.</p>



<p>You can also use these keyboard shortcuts to control your virtual desktops:</p>



<ul><li><em>Windows+Ctrl+D</em><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>Create and open a new virtual desktop</li><li><em>Windows+Ctrl+F4</em><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Close the current virtual desktop.</li><li><em>Windows+Ctrl+Left/Right</em><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Switch to the virtual desktop on the left or right.</li><li><em>Windows+Tab</em>: Open Task View/Virtual desktop interface</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/11/groupy-tabs-100742184-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="groupy tabs" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/11/groupy-tabs-100742184-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Stardock&rsquo;s Groupy lets you combine several programs into one window like browser tabs, and jump among them. If you look at the title bar at the top of the screen, you&rsquo;ll see this window includes File Explorer, Chrome, Spotify, and Slack.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Finally, while this guide is dedicated to Windows tips, if you tend to juggle multiple programs simultaneously for complicated tasks, consider paying up for Stardock&rsquo;s excellent Groupy software. Groupy essentially lets you organize several programs into a single window, letting you hop between each like so many browser tabs. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3237664/stardock-groupy-manage-windows.html">It&rsquo;s <em>great</em></a>, and only costs <a class="addLink" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.stardock.com/products/groupy/download&amp;xcust=2-1-398949-1-000000-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$10 direct from Stardock</a><a class="removelink" href="https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"><span class="removelink-tooltip">Remove non-product link</span></a>. Microsoft was working on a native tabbed interface for Windows 10, dubbed Sets, but alas, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3390182/microsoft-sets-tabbed-interface-for-windows-appears-dead-for-now.html">it&rsquo;s dead</a>. Groupy earns our highest recommendation.</p>



<h2 id="odds-and-ends">Odds and ends</h2>



<p>Getting rid of distractions and organizing your workflow will go a long way toward making you more productive, but a handful of other Windows 10 tweaks can make your life easier, too.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><img alt="night light" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/night-light-100836574-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /><figcaption>
<p>Night light&rsquo;s options are basic, but it&rsquo;s a handy tool.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p><strong>Night light </strong>restricts blue light emanating from your display by changing its hue, similar to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://justgetflux.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-398949-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the popular f.lux app</a>. &ldquo;Studies have shown that blue light at night suppresses melatonin production more than other colors and shifts the body&rsquo;s circadian timing, thereby disrupting the sleep-wake cycle,&rdquo; we said in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3189747/how-to-use-night-light-in-the-windows-10-creators-update.html">our Night Light primer</a>. Head to <em>Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display</em> and activate the Night Light slider to turn it on, then click the <em>Night light settings</em> link to adjust how it works.</p>



<p><strong>Cloud clipboard</strong> further leverages the connectivity of your Microsoft Account by letting you copy text on one PC, then paste it on another. It&rsquo;s <em>wonderful</em>. Head to <em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Clipboard </em>to turn it on and configure its behavior.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image large"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/06/backup4-100761193-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="backup4" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/06/backup4-100761193-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>File History makes it easy to manage which folders you&rsquo;re backing up.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>If you have external storage connected to your PC,<strong> File History </strong>is a godsend, taking snapshots of your files as you go and storing the different versions, so you can recover older saves if need be. &ldquo;Say, for example, you really liked a paragraph from the first draft of an essay, but you deleted it long ago and are now battling regret,&rdquo; we explained in our primer. &ldquo;You can dip into File History, retrieve the right version of your document, and copy the paragraph.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2974385/how-to-use-windows-10s-file-history-backup-feature.html">Our File History guide</a> can set you up if it sounds interesting, while our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198109/best-external-drives.html">roundup of the best external drives</a> can point you toward the best hardware for the task. (You don&rsquo;t need a fast external SSD for File History; a slower&mdash;and thus more affordable&mdash;hard drive performs the job just fine.)</p>

</div>


<p>Remember the Nintendo 3DS handheld? Personally, I loved my 3DS and I still enjoy one from time to time even now. Although many opted to play in 2D, with the addition of eye tracking in later models, glasses-free 3D became a pretty neat experience. Unfortunately, 3D as a fad had overstayed its welcome and few games really supported a full 3D experience.</p>



<p>Now, Acer is trying a similar tack to Nintendo. With its SpatialLabs screen technology, users can get a little added depth from their games without having to don a VR headset or pesky 3D glasses. The Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition one of the first laptops of its kind&hellip;but is it an experience worth forking over $3,500 to see with your own eyes? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>

<h2 id="acer-predator-helios-300-design-and-build-quality">Acer Predator Helios 300: Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios design" class="wp-image-1807413" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-hero2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>Even though mobile computing has come a long way over the past years, gaming laptops often aren&rsquo;t as thin or light because of the demand for additional power. That&rsquo;s why the Acer Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs edition is such a <em>big chungus</em>. The hot i9 chip and RTX 3080 need a big heatpipe, fans, and room to dissipate so much heat. Plus, the large 15.6-inch display necessitates a broad frame in order to fit. But all of that considered, at 5.7 lbs, this Predator is a lot of laptop.</p>



<p>Thankfully, it feels well built with a blend of aluminum and plastic. Although I still found the design a<em> </em>bit too<em> gamer-y</em> for my tastes, its aggressive angles and numerous rear vents reminded me of a stealth airplane. I&rsquo;ve seen far weirder, worse designs with cheaper materials so at least know that you&rsquo;re getting a flimsy, chintzy gaming computer with the Helios 300. Perhaps the biggest nit I can pick here is that the gunmetal finish of the Helios 300 picks up fingerprints like crazy and I found myself constantly wiping it off with a microfiber cloth.</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-helios-300-connectivity">Acer Predator Helios 300: Connectivity</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios right ports" class="wp-image-1807424" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-right-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>With its ample chassis, the Predator Helios 300 has a ton of ports, but maybe not the ones I&rsquo;d prefer to see in 2023. With such powerful internal components, this could easily be a computer that creative professionals use while docked at a desk. You&rsquo;ll find three handy USB-A ports, a gigabit Ethernet, HDMI 2.1, and a miniDisplayPort. What I would love to see is more than the one Thunderbolt 4 port. Computers that cost far less than the Helios 300 give users at least two of these flexible, high-speed ports that can be super useful when working with large video files on an external drive. That said, you&rsquo;ll need to plug in the external A/C adapter to get the computer properly powered and charging.</p>



<p>Wireless is top-shelf here, with the latest WiFi 6E standard and Bluetooth 5.2 onboard. This wireless card is from Killer, Intel&rsquo;s gaming-focused wireless brand, and should provide a smooth streaming and online gaming experience, should you lack access to a more reliable wired connection. I&rsquo;d have liked to see faster, more future-proofed 2.5 gigabit Ethernet for the price.</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-helios-300-keyboard-and-trackpad">Acer Predator Helios 300: Keyboard and trackpad</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios keyboard" class="wp-image-1807426" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>While the WASD keys might be the most important on the keyboard for a gamer (they&rsquo;re typically used for moving around), a laptop is only as good as its typing experience. Acer put a pretty good keyboard in the Predator Helios 300. While they&rsquo;re not fancy mechanical keys, I found that they were responsive and gave me accurate feedback on when a key was pressed correctly. If you&rsquo;re a spreadsheet wizard, you may find the slightly small numpad on the right hand side to be of value. Of course, you can customize the keyboard&rsquo;s backlight to be whatever color or animation you prefer.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Predator Helios trackpad" class="wp-image-1809488" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-trackpad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>The trackpad, unfortunately, wasn&rsquo;t very good. Although it was fine for most mousing around, the click mechanism underneath feels weirdly loose and weak. You can see and feel the trackpad wiggle just a tad as you run your finger across it. I&rsquo;ve used cheaper laptops with far nicer feeling touchpads&mdash;it&rsquo;s really too bad that Acer bestowed the Helios 300 with such a chintzy one.</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-helios-300-3d-display">Acer Predator Helios 300: 3D display</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios hero" class="wp-image-1807342" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>Although it&rsquo;s a powerful computer that can game quite well, the Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs edition is all about its big, 3D screen. Why else would you pay almost $3,500 on a machine that could otherwise be more affordable? The screen has a few different components that it needs to work correctly. The first is the panel itself, with its special glasses-free technology layer inside. The second piece of the puzzle is the infrared camera system that tracks the user&rsquo;s eyes in order to tell the display how to offset the images for each eye to add depth. The final piece of the SpatialLabs technology is its proprietary games launcher software. This tells the system which compatible game you&rsquo;re launching and enables an overlay to let you tweak the depth settings while you&rsquo;re running a game.</p>



<p>On paper, there were more than 70 games when I tried the Helios 300 SpatialLabs edition. There are two tiers of augmentation. Some games have a &ldquo;3D+&rdquo; rating, which is the standard addition of some depth while others are &ldquo;3D Ultra,&rdquo; which should take more advantage of the technology. During my time with the laptop, I mostly played two games: <em>Psychonauts 2</em> (which is 3D Ultra-rated) and <em>Forza Horzon 5 </em>(which is only 3D+ tier). I had very different experiences with these titles.</p>



<p><em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, with its somewhat realistic graphics, looked only okay in 3D. Many of the menus were rendered incorrectly in 3D and it was very strange having to refocus my eyes on the game&rsquo;s speedometer, which exists on a separate plane from the deeper landscape and car. Although the graphics looked pretty good and ran at a solid 60 FPS, there&rsquo;s a loss of detail as the screen&rsquo;s effective resolution goes from 4K (3840&times;2160) in 2D to 1920&times;2160 in 3D mode. The overall picture looks a bit like you were gazing at it through a screen door in 3D.</p>



<p>My so-so<em> Forza</em> experience pales in comparison to the eye-popping graphics of <em>Psychonauts 2</em>. This cartoony, stylish third-person game looked fantastic with 3D on and the amount of depth&mdash;both inside and outside the screen&mdash;was awesome. The effect simply works better because it&rsquo;s not trying to recreate the real world, so my eyes can buy it for what it is. But this is probably all down to personal taste and whether or not your favorite games are well-supported by the SpatialLabs software.</p>



<p>The biggest drawback of the display is that it displays all games at only 60 Hz. That means that the graphics power from the RTX 3080 chip can&rsquo;t get you smoother-looking games, at least not without an external screen. With the reduction in resolution when you&rsquo;re enjoying 3D, any additional detail in games may be nullified. Plus, you&rsquo;re dependent on Acer to add support to games in the future, so it could take a while for your favorites to make the cut. All of this makes me feel a bit like although it demos well, the 3D may be a gimmick you don&rsquo;t want to pay for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-helios-300-speakers-and-webcam">Acer Predator Helios 300: Speakers and webcam</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios webcam" class="wp-image-1807432" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-camera.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;d hope that a brainy, brawny laptop would pack big speakers, but unfortunately the sound from the Predator Helios 300 seems small and weak. Acer says this laptop has two internal speakers, half the number of great-sounding machines like the HP Dragonfly Pro I tried earlier in the year. The result is that this pricey laptop might as well trumpet a &ldquo;whomp whomp&rdquo; whenever you try to play a video or music on it.</p>



<p>The webcam built in here was kind of a letdown given the price of this machine. It&rsquo;s limited to 720p and although image quality was fine, it doesn&rsquo;t have compatibility with Windows Hello. It has the ability to track your head for the 3D effect, but no biometric login whatsoever. Not that you would, but the single microphone setup is pretty retro and doesn&rsquo;t have any kind of fancy noise cancellation for when you&rsquo;re on work calls at home. Acer probably (correctly) assumes the target audience for this laptop will don a headset when they get to &ldquo;work.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-helios-300-performance">Acer Predator Helios 300: Performance</h2>



<p>As far as gaming laptops go, the Predator Helios 300 has some of the best performance available. It comes with the top-tier i9-12900H 14-core chip (with 6 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores) and Nvidia&rsquo;s capable RTX 3080 for added graphics performance. Although not one of Intel&rsquo;s extreme HX-class chips, this is one of the best mobile processors around for sheer muscle. Not content to give users software settings for changing performance, you can also hit the Turbo button like on an old 286 PC and kick the cooling system into overdrive for max clocks on the CPU and an overclock on the GPU.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Predator Helios PCMark" class="wp-image-1807436" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-pcmark.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>We benchmark every laptop with the PCMark 10 suite. This gives us a good overview of a laptop&rsquo;s performance when doing everyday tasks like working in documents, browsing the web, and chatting on video calls. The Acer Predator Helios 300 has plenty of power on tap and kept pace with other 12th gen Intel-based gaming laptops with H-class chips.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Predator Helios Cinebench" class="wp-image-1807437" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-cinebench.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>In this performance test, we use Cinebench R15 to get a sense for how well all a laptop&rsquo;s processors work together to render a 3D scene. With its plentiful performance cores, the Helios 300 SpatialLabs edition was able to chew through the test scene around as fast as other high-end Intel-based gaming machines. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the MSI equipped with the Nvidia 4090 chip is much closer to a desktop-class GPU than the mobile-focused 3080 and 3080 Ti&rsquo;s in these graphs.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Predator Helios 3DMark Time Spy" class="wp-image-1807445" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-3dmark.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>Using the 3DMark Time Spy benchmark, we can get a sense for a laptop&rsquo;s graphical performance when compared to others. Although it was blown away by the higher-end MSI Titan GT77 with its beefier, newer RTX 4090 graphics chip, it still turned in performance in line with similar 3080-based machines.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Predator Helios Metro Exodus" class="wp-image-1807448" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-metro-exodus.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>In a real-life scenario, we run the <em>Metro Exodus</em> benchmark to get an average frame rate in a graphically-intensive game. Using the Extreme setting at a 1080p resolution, we measured an average frame rate count of 49 fps, making it competitive with other laptops with 3080 Ti GPUs.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Predator Helios Tomb Raider" class="wp-image-1807451" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-tomb-raider.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>An older, but still challenging gaming benchmark we use is <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. Although the Helios 300 is behind some other Nvidia 30-series powered laptops of late, but not by much.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Predator Helios Handbrake" class="wp-image-1807454" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-handbrake-encode.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>In our final performance chart, we use Handbrake and time how long it takes to turn an HD movie into a tablet-friendly file that&rsquo;s heavily compressed. Unsurprisingly, the i9-equipped Helios 300 outdoes the i7 and Ryzen 9 options out there while coming way behind the i9-12980HX, which is a different performance tier.</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-helios-300-battery-life">Acer Predator Helios 300: Battery life</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Predator Helios Battery Life" class="wp-image-1807458" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/predator-helios-300-battery.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="901" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Brendan Nystedt</p></div>



<p>Gaming laptop battery life can hardly be expected to last an entire day. But at the very least, the Helios 300 SpatialLabs edition more or less hangs with the rest of today&rsquo;s high-performing pack. We measured a little over five hours from this beastly machine on our standard looping 4K video test. That&rsquo;s lower than other Intel i9-equipped gaming laptops like the Razer Blade and well behind i7 and AMD Ryzen ones.</p>



<h2 id="acer-predator-helios-300-conclusion">Acer Predator Helios 300: Conclusion</h2>



<p>While the guts of the Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition are pretty solid, the entire system is let down by its screen. The tech works, but if you&rsquo;re into gaming on the go, this expensive package is a disappointment. I&rsquo;d say even with the upcoming 13th gen Intel/Nvidia 40-series refresh of this product, having a limited 60Hz panel makes it a tough recommendation. When similar gaming laptops are reaching 240Hz and beyond, 60Hz even at 4K seems pretty wimpy. More than that, the inconsistent 3D implementation dulls the sharpness of the slow panel. For its $3,500 price, you <em>really</em> need to want the glasses-free 3D screen, and will need to be into any genre but fast-twitch shooters or e-sports titles that benefit from the responsiveness of a high-refresh screen. That&rsquo;s a lot of caveats.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that when the 3D effect works, it can be utterly enchanting. And there may be interesting applications of this technology&mdash;if they can get the refresh rate up in future SpatialLabs screens, then the premium might be worth it for gamers. But as it stands right now, this special Predator Helios 300 version should be skipped.&nbsp;</p>
