All bees consume royal jelly, but once a queen is selected, workers then feed on pollen and honey, while only the queen feeds on the prized jelly. Referred to as the \"superfood of the beehive,\" royal jelly contains much more nutrients than honey and is 20 times more expensive. Since the 1980s, production worldwide has grown from 700 to nearly 4,000 metric tons. Royal jelly can be found in its natural form, as a health supplement, or in skincare products, and it can reach $125 per pound. But extracting royal jelly requires great precision, as the process can only be done by hand.\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE FOOD VIDEOS:\nWhy Bilona Ghee (A2 Desi Ghee) Is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/59w2G_L1OMo\nWhy Kampot White Pepper Is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/0YekHftrSy0\nWhy Korean Rice Syrup (Ssal-Jocheong) Is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/V0zT3N3MnY8\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#RoyalJelly #SoExpensiveFood #InsiderBusiness\n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nInsider Business on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness\nInsider Business on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nInsider Business on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider\n\nWhy Royal Jelly is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Insider Business", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4cth57-66k", "date_published": "2023-05-09 21:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
