Gates and his Foundation have been celebrated for endeavors in poverty and health care around world. But when you analyze the publicly available grant database, you’ll see that in the last two decades the Gates Foundation dedicated more than $10+ billion to education agenda in the United States.

Gates’ connections and wealth were able to dictate the fate of trillions of tax payers money that followed his investments. Gates became the main architect of US public school policy, bankrolling research, deployment and lobbying campaigns that pushed for a reform after reform according to the whims of the world's most influential elite.
