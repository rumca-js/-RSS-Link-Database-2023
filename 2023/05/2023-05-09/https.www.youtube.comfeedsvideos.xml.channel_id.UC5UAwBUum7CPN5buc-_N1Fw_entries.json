All the big social media platforms have one goal, and one goal only: to keep you there for as long as they can, so they can show ads, and make more money.\n\nOn top of that, things you are subscribed to might also never be shown to you.\n\nYou can't really go back to older things, search through what you archived, sort it in a specific way, create your own organization system.\n\nRSS works with 2 components: an RSS Feed Reader, and RSS Feeds. Feeds are what you'll subscribe to: they're just a simple file a lot of websites have, that can be read by the Feed Reader, which will aggregate all these feeds in one place. And RSS has TONS of advantages!\n\nFirst, you'll only ever get what you subscribed to. There is no algorithm, no recommendations, no ads in between posts. And you can add a LOT of sources: websites, video channels, podcasts, social media accounts, and even newsletters.\n\nSecond, all feed readers have organization capabilities.\n\nThird, you can sort things. Fourth, you can go back and search through older articles. Fifth, you can navigate super easily from one article to the other. And finally, it's portable: all readers will let you export and import your feed list.\n\nRSS is all about adding sources, or feeds to your reader.\n\nA lot of websites will display a small orange square icon, which is the RSS logo. Clicking the icon will bring you to the feed, or give you a URL you can copy. That's what you want to add to your feed reader.\n\nBut some websites don't have an RSS feed, or an icon to access it. No matter, most RSS feed readers will let you add any website URL, and automatically create an RSS feed for you.\n\nIf you want to add videos from a youtube channel, let's say a bearded french Linux content creator, most feed readers will also just let you copy paste the channel's URL and add it as a feed. On Peertube, it's even easier, just click the subscribe button, and you get the ability to access the feed.\n\nYou can even add social media posts if you really want to. Using rss.app, you can just copy paste a social media profile in there, and it will spit out an RSS feed you can add to your reader. And you can also add podcasts.\n\nIf you're really into RSS, you can also add newsletters. Using the website kill-the-newsletter.com, you can generate an email address and a feed.\n\nThe first thing you'll need to pick is obviously an RSS Reader.\n\nIf you want a single device solution, it's very easy. On Linux, Newsflash is the one I use.\nA few web browsers will give you access to an RSS Feed reader built-in, like Opera or Vivaldi, and Thunderbird also has the ability to do that.\n\nIf you want the simplest multi-device solution, Feedly is a good bet. You can create a free account, add up to 100 different feeds, create a few folders, and if you want to go over that, they have paid plans. They have mobile apps, and a web interface on PC.\n\nThere's also Newsblur, which does the same thing, and is open source, but the free version limits you to 64 feeds.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7LTwnAaQ3k", "date_published": "2023-05-09 16:00:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
