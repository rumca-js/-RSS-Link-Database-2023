We have a lot in common. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/clay-travis-brooke-baldwin-cnn" target="_blank">We both like boobs and the First Amendment</a>. What I didn't know about Clay is that he is an amateur social scientist as well. Over the weekend, he conducted the Free Beer Test.</p><p>Travis was rocking out at a Nashville concert and brought a few coolers with him loaded with beer. Some Michelob, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yuengling-beer-patriotic-can" target="_blank">some Yuengling,</a> and of course some Bud Light. All things were equal. Open the cooler. Take a free beer. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-chicken-fried-commercial" target="_blank">Guess</a> which <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-free-beer" target="_blank">beer</a> was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-fenway-park" target="_blank">left over</a> at <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-brantley-gilbert" target="_blank">the end</a>?</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Weekend experiment. Beers in cooler at Nashville area event. Pick which beer you want. No one would take the Bud Light all night long. Big issue going forward for Bud Light is many don’t even want to be seen with product. They just pick another brand. <a href="https://t.co/UleRAjdLTc">pic.twitter.com/UleRAjdLTc</a><br />— Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClayTravis/status/1655599957997436931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>It is not just that people aren't buying the beer. You vote with your dollars. People voting with their dollars by spending them on any other beer is bad enough for the company. But beer drinkers, at least in this experiment, didn't even want to be seen drinking the beer FOR FREE. When have you ever heard of someone turning down free beer? I'm fairly certain the only time I drank Bud Light was if I was handed a free can. </p><p>These results led Dr. Travis to the following conclusion: "There’s no quick fix here, brand is slaughtered in red state beer drinking communities. Bet there is hardly any at SEC tailgates this fall."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Overall consumption of Bud Light is now down 26%. That’s an unmitigated disaster for the brand. And many are now avoiding the beer to avoid being mocked for drinking the beer. There’s no quick fix here, brand is slaughtered in red state beer drinking communities. Bet there is…<br />— Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClayTravis/status/1655601274186768384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>My advice for college bros is to switch to Miller Lite. If you are looking for a cheap beer you can crush twelve at a time, it's just as good as Bud Light but the can looks cooler.</p><p>However, since we here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website believe in calling balls and strikes, I do have one criticism about this experiment. At no point in the research does Clay mention WHAT concert he was at. </p><p>It has nothing to do with proving how toxic Bud Light has become. I'm just curious.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

But when the race itself is under two minutes, it leaves a lot of time and mint juleps to kill. Words get said. Someone scuffs your penny loafers. Next thing you know, some dude in a seersucker is dropping bombs.</p><p>The video begins with Renginald's (guy in green, that's what I'm calling him) face already a crimson mask.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Go to the Kentucky Derby, they said. <br /><br />It will be a nice, relaxing Saturday they said.<br /><br />You won't get blood on your seersucker, they said. <a href="https://t.co/MYMWno5cvS">pic.twitter.com/MYMWno5cvS</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1655971160293621760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>No one knows what caused Reginald to wild out like that like he was in the stands at the Preakness. I have two theories. One is that someone in the crowd spoke ill of Mitch McConnell and Reginald won't stand for any Cocaine Mitch slander. McConnell is worshiped as a GAWD in those there parts.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The other theory is that the guy in a polo told Reginald that his girlfriend looked like a giant banana.</p><p>That would bring us to Muffy.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="27e86" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33628539&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Had Muffy not lost her balance from walking around in stilettos all day, the dude in the polo may have gotten his eyes clawed out. Thankfully, Muffy's friend Buffy was that to help keep her balance.</p><p>Also, let's be honesty... Muffy does look like a giant banana.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website are embarrassed by all involved. Not for the lack of dignity it takes to get into a brawl at the Derby. We're all about doing it for the content. But because our combatants looked lame in comparison <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/melbourne-cup-walkway-fight" target="_blank">to the all-girl brawl that broke out at last year's Melbourne Cup</a>. These southern gentlemen looked like sissy marys compared to the Aussie gals brawling in Brisbane. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: "Childism" is the new attack from the left, and it is as bad as it sounds

When it comes to doing it for the content, I either choose things that a) <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/frog-pronouns-gop" target="_blank">I find hysterical</a>, or b) I think will become a thing. And on the off chance I fall for satire, we'll chalk that up to "my bad, yo."</p><p>"Childism" is something I think democrats are going to embrace, and not only because they love themselves a good -ism. Allow this (sigh) "teacher" to explain.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Let’s learn about the next big thing: Childism. <a href="https://t.co/U27zWnUp3r">pic.twitter.com/U27zWnUp3r</a><br />— Dr. Jebra Faushay (@JebraFaushay) <a href="https://twitter.com/JebraFaushay/status/1655633062393176067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>"Childism" is defined as follows. If a child, no matter how young, determines they now identify as a different gender and you, as an adult, say "no," you are guilty of being a childist. That's on top of being transphobic. You are now an -ist AND a -phobic. Anyone who thinks this sounds ridiculous both have a functioning brain and also <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jordan-neely-aditional-context" target="_blank">didn't think "unhoused" would become media newspeak for a homeless person</a> as quick as it did.</p><p>Why I think "childism" is going to be a new plank in the Democrat Party platform is that it is already there. We saw it in Minnesota when the state became a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-trans-kids" target="_blank">sanctuary for children's genital mutilation</a>. Quote MN Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan: "When our children tell us who they are, it is our job as grown-ups to listen and to believe them. That's what it means to be a good parent."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">MN Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan on sex changes for minors: "When our children tell us who they are, it is our job as grown-ups to listen and to believe them.

"-Isms" are how the left delegitimizes any opposing viewpoint. This is the perfect marriage of the two. The media will be accusing people of childism by summertime. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Barista goes bananas on nice old lady she claims was "transphobic," then turned and got violent

It goes double for the food service industry. We've all been there. We get it. But this is no way to talk to a nice old lady, no matter how tough your shift at Starbucks is. A customer who is believed to be transgender was caught lashing out at a customer.

All we know is that the nice old lady did not appreciate being called transphobic. And the barista wouldn't calm down about something, calling the nice old lady "Karen" and doing that annoying clapping thing. This is before turning and viciously assaulting a bystander that had their camera out and was doing it for the content.</p><p>Maybe it was an accidental misgendering. Hey, it happens. I was confused for a lesbian once. I had much longer hair and was kissing my girlfriend in a bar with my back to the door. Some woman walked in and yelled, "Holy sh*t, there are two chicks making out on a couch." I laughed. My girlfriend laughed. The woman laughed. It was the 90s.

## Elon Musk exposes what's "odd" and "very strange" about media coverage of the Allen Texas shooter

The narrative being spun about the mass killing at the Allen, Texas shopping center leaves a very itchy noodle to scratch.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/allen-texas-shooting-show-notes" target="_blank">To recap</a>, a former security guard killed eight people at a high ended outdoor mall in Texas over the weekend, before a first responder used his gun to save the day. The killer we're told is a white supremacist, even though he is so Latino that his parents needed a translator. I tend not to like to share photos of killers, but since the media refuses to, this is the new face of white supremacy.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le_Nf2lU3zM" target="_blank">The latest report</a> is that this Mexican-white supremacist, out of every social media platform he could choose, posted on a Russian one no one has heard of where a) his posts got no engagement, and b) the Mexican-white supremacist talked about how much he loved <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-libs-tiktok" target="_blank">Libs of TikTok</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-tim-pool-elsa" target="_blank">Tim Pool</a>. And that THIS is one of the things that motivated him in driving to a predominately white city to kill people.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Very strange<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1655797123298869248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The other odd thing is that 48 hours later, the media claims to know this Mexican-white supremacist's motives, but the motives of other mass killers -- one's that critics say don't fit into the popular media narrative -- remain unknown.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Odd<br />— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1655716696521416704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>The trans terrorist (he/him) <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nashville-shooter-manifesto-destruction" target="_blank">who slaughtered Christian children is recent enough for people to remember</a>. In he/him's case, he/him left a manifesto...that the FBI claims is too dangerous to release.</p><p>The black supremacist in the above tweet refers to Darryl Brooks, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-waukesha-parade" target="_blank">who murdered at least five people when he drove his car through a Christmas parade</a>. Brooks had a long social media history that was pro-BLM and anti-white -- on Facebook, a social media platform people have heard of -- yet the media claimed to not know what his motive could be.</p><p>As Elon Musk says, it's all odd and very strange. I can't help but wonder if a killer who posted on a Ukraine social media platform how influenced he was by Joy Reid and Stephen Colbert, if we would hear about any of it on CNN.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## NFL star lost job over rape allegations, new evidence shows he wasn't even at the party

He was released from the team in August due to a civil lawsuit when he was accused of gang rape. Prosecutors decided NOT to press criminal charges for the same alleged crime last December and we now know why. They find it hard to prosecute someone for rape at a party he was no longer at.</p><p>When Araiza was released, Bills general manager Brand Beane admitted that they didn't know all the facts. "But at this time, we think it will be the best move for everyone to move on for Matt."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

<p>Unclear is if it was the "best time" because the <a href="https://heavy.com/sports/buffalo-bills/brandon-beane-matt-araiza-release-reaction/" target="_blank">Bills were being blasted in the media for drafting Matt</a> even though the team knew about the unproven allegations. Allegations, according to a <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/prosecutors-former-bills-punter-matt-araiza-wasnt-present-during-alleged-gang-rape-225211550.html" target="_blank">new report from Yahoo Sports</a>, the San Diego district attorney's office declined to prosecute.</p><p>Azaiza was accused of, in 2021, leading a drunk girl into a room with three other guys and then proceeding to take part in a gang rape. After an investigation that last over four months, it was concluded that Azaiza wasn't there when the alleged rape occurred. He had left the party an hour before.</p><blockquote>“He wasn’t even at the party anymore,” deputy district attorney Trisha Amador explained to the girl. Later Amador stated of the timeline of events, “All I know is that at that point, suspect Araiza is gone from the party.”<br /><br />Additionally, prosecutors told the girl that video recordings of the incident in the bedroom made it impossible to determine, let alone prosecute anyone, on whether there was a gang rape at all that night, rather than consensual sex with the other men.<br /></blockquote><p>This comes from a  200-plus page transcript of a 100-minute meeting between the prosecutors and the accusers, where the ADA also said “In looking at the videos on the sex tape, I absolutely cannot prove any forceable sexual assault based upon what happened."</p><blockquote>The dual investigations by police and prosecutors included over 35 witness interviews (including some of the girl’s friends who came to the party with her that night), the results of a Sexual Assault Team exam conducted the following day and 10 search warrants that produced 4 terabytes of information, including numerous short videos of some of the alleged encounters.</blockquote><p>The accuser's lawyers claim their client is being "bullied" and the civil lawsuit will continue.</p><p>As of this writing, it is unclear where Azaira can go to get either the last year of his life or his reputation back. It is also unclear what, when people in the media called this a "credible allegation" last year, they believe made the allegation so credible.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
