But Kurt thinks that bad games, even the most aggressively mediocre ones, can be great games in their own right.\n\nIn this week\u2019s episode of The Kurt Locker, Kurt unpacks the phenomena of review scores and asks why so many of us run for cover when a game receives a six. To break this down, Kurt examines GameSpot\u2019s number review score scale and tries to give clarity that six, not even five, means the game is \u201cbad\u201d.\u00a0\n\nIn the process, Kurt realized that a lot of games he loves fall in the six out of the ten category. Games like Wanted: Dead, Gungrave G.O.R.E., Flower, Sun, and Rain, and many others. For Kurt, a six teeters on a certain kind of threshold. It's not quite good, but not bad either. It could be bad in some places, but not unplayable. It could also be great in other places, just not amazing \u2013 it may even have a whisper of innovation.\u00a0\n\nFurther reading: In Defense of the 6.0 by Tom McShea: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-defense-of-the-60/1100-6349597/\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n01:16 - The review score phenomena\u00a0\n02:42 - How GameSpot\u2019s review scale works\n04:00 - The curious case of Wanted: Dead\n06:15 - In defense of the 6/10\n08:52 - Read bad books\n10:00 - Conclusion\n\n#gaming #wanteddead #thekurtlocker #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc854Z3a0_Q", "date_published": "2023-05-09 15:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
