<p>The liberal Move Forward party and the Pheu Thai Party face a challenge to forming government with parliamentary rules favouring army-backed parties</p><p>Thailand’s opposition parties secured by far the largest number of votes in national elections, trouncing parties allied with the military and setting the stage for a flurry of deal-making in a bid to end nearly a decade of conservative, army-backed rule.</p><p>The liberal Move Forward party and the populist Pheu Thai Party were far out in front with 99% of votes counted, but it’s far from certain either will form the next government, with parliamentary rules written by the military after the 2014 coup skewed in its favour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/15/thailand-election-2023-national-elections-opposition-parties-crushing-blow-military-rule-junta">Continue reading...</a>

## Lewandowski fires Barça to Liga title but invoke Espanyol fans’ wrath

<p>Barcelona’s league title celebrations almost ended in serious trouble when Espanyol fans breached security, invaded the pitch and ran after them, chasing the newly crowned champions down the tunnel. Fortunately some of the players and staff, dancing in circles on the pitch having defeated their city rivals 4-2, spotted them coming just in time and they were able to outrun their pursuers, forced to continue festivities from the safety of the dressing room instead. As they escaped, there were some confrontations between home supporters and security staff, as well as protests aimed at the directors’ box.</p><p>La Liga winners for the first time in four years, Barcelona’s party had barely been going a minute but coach Xavi Hernández had already begun telling his players to make way just before the stampede started. It was, he said, a question of “respect”. He knew what this meant: for himself, lifting a first major trophy and for everyone. Opposite him in the other dugout was a friend and class-mate from his coaching course, experiencing very different emotions. If success and failure, triumph and despair, coexist in every game, it could hardly have been expressed so clearly as it was in Cornella.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/14/lewandowski-fires-barca-to-liga-title-but-invoke-espanyol-fans-wrath">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This action-packed BBC drama depicts the grim lives of Brits who emigrated to Australia in the 1950s. Its look at the ‘issues’ is a bit broad, but it doesn’t sugarcoat the truth</p><p>Danny Brocklehurst is perhaps best known as a writer on Shameless and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/22/brassic-review-a-tale-of-northern-neer-do-wells-with-humour-and-heart-to-spare">Brassic</a>, series with big mouths, big hearts and anarchic spirits, so you might wonder how the big BBC One Sunday night slot would suit him. Is Ten Pound Poms more Call the Midwife than call the police, or can it still keep a bit of that spark and pluck?</p><p>Ten Pound Poms tries to have it both ways, and mostly succeeds. It tells the story of the British people who responded to newspaper adverts in the 1950s inviting them to move to Australia to build a new life, all for the princely sum of £10. In the real world, about 1 million people signed up for the scheme. Here, we see it through the eyes of Terry (Warren Brown), a man with an impressive moustache and crippling post-traumatic stress disorder, left to languish in postwar Stockport, still suffering flashbacks to his time as a prisoner of war. Terry is a drinker, a gambler and a fighter, and his wife Annie (Faye Marsay) has had enough of him spending his wage packet at the pub and the track. In what might be one of the only recorded cases of people moving to Australia to avoid beer – just kidding, please don’t write in – the entire family undertakes the six-week voyage, on the promise of a better life.</p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0ff9dvh">Ten Pound Poms is showing in the UK on BBC One and iPlayer</a> and in Australia <a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/ten-pound-poms">on Stan</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/14/ten-pound-poms-review-surely-no-one-in-1956-was-a-stranger-to-this-level-of-racism-and-sexism">Continue reading...</a>

There is a throw-in to be taken and a Chelsea player down injured on the turf and everyone else is just sort of milling about trying to look busy. Le Tissier puts a hand on Kerr’s shoulder to let her know she’s there. Kerr shuffles her feet and feints both ways to let Le Tissier know she could disappear at any moment. But mostly, they wait.</p><p>And when you think about it, waiting is perhaps the defining sensation of this job. Waiting on the back row of the bus before it leaves. Waiting for the team meeting to begin. Waiting in hotel rooms and dressing rooms and airport departure lounges and passport control. Kerr is 29 years old, and has been around this sport long enough to know that the vast majority of the moments that make up her day do not matter. And so she waits, priming and preparing herself for the handful of seconds that will define her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/14/sam-kerr-waits-and-masters-the-moment-as-chelseas-striker-supreme">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The world No 6 lost seven grand slam quarter-finals before turning around his mental game in time for Rome and Roland Garros</p><p>As yet another enormous opportunity rapidly slipped from his grasp in the US Open quarter-final against Frances Tiafoe last summer, a distraught Andrey Rublev slumped down in his chair and cried into his towel.</p><p>The match wasn’t even over, but Rublev was all too familiar with how these events normally end. Despite his considerable achievements, from being a permanent fixture inside the top 10, to 11 ATP titles at the time and an Olympic gold medal, his career, in his mind, was also defined by what had evaded him. Rublev had contested seven grand slam quarter-finals and two Masters 1000 finals before this spring, losing every single one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/14/andrey-rublev-i-lost-them-matches-because-of-myself-i-could-not-handle-the-pressure-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

But needing victory to keep alive their title hopes after City had won at Everton earlier in the day, they were brought to their knees by Roberto De Zerbi’s Brighton, who gave a second-half masterclass and can scent European qualification for the first time in club history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/14/arsenal-brighton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Relieving the pressure on GPs by directing patients elsewhere does nothing to solve the workforce crisis across the NHS</p><p>Because ministers have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/14/sunak-omits-target-of-6000-more-gps-from-brief-for-health-secretary#:~:text=Sunak%20omits%20target%20of%206%2C000%20more%20GPs%20from%20brief%20for%20health%20secretary,-This%20article%20is&amp;amp;text=Rishi%20Sunak%20has%20fuelled%20concerns,in%20the%202019%20Conservative%20manifesto." title="">missed their target</a> to recruit 6,000 new GPs in England by a wide margin, they have now produced a set of fixes designed to relieve pressure on general practice by directing people elsewhere. These changes will extend the orbit of primary care to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/09/pharmacies-england-prescriptions-seven-conditions-amid-surgery-crisis" title="">pharmacists</a> and even receptionists, ensuring, according to the NHS chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, that “patients won’t need to go to a GP unless they really need to see a GP”. The plan seems motivated more by a concern for cost than health outcomes. Rather than addressing the causes of this crisis, it will triage and divert patients to other parts of the system.</p><p>Not all the ideas in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/09/pharmacies-england-prescriptions-seven-conditions-amid-surgery-crisis" title="">this plan</a> are without merit. Making it easier for people to access their medical records is practical. In theory, giving pharmacies £645m over the course of two years to prescribe treatments for common illnesses makes sense. In practice, this proposal doesn’t account for the shrinking number of <a href="https://www.pharmacy.biz/ccas-analysis-shows-net-loss-of-670-community-pharmacies-in-england/" title="">community chemists</a>, or the sector’s <a href="https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/CD136805/A-fifth-of-employee-pharmacists-report-dangerous-levels-of-understaffing" title="">staff shortages</a>. Allowing pharmacies to prescribe antibiotics when our health depends on using them prudently could pose risks. And if pharmacies are to do more of the work of family doctors, standards should be benchmarked and inspections conducted more regularly to ensure all patients receive good quality care.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-governments-primary-care-plan-a-diversionary-tactic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There can never be any doubting of Sam Kerr. Ever. Most players would hesitate before brazenly stating that they had “never been [to Wembley] and not won a trophy” on the eve of a FA Cup final, no matter how true. Those are words that could come back to bite and haunt, but for Kerr, the queen of visualisation, there was never any doubt that she would be lifting aloft a third successive FA Cup in front of a record crowd of 77,390 fans, or that she would be the one to step up, once again, and deliver in a season where she has been so heavily relied upon.</p><p>This is Chelsea’s stage. The Blues have appeared in six FA Cup finals including five of the eight played at Wembley. Emma Hayes’s side have played at the national stadium more than they have at Stamford Bridge. Their undefeated record against United, since the Manchester side was reformed in 2018, with only one point dropped, painted a picture of likely dominance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/14/chelsea-manchester-united-womens-fa-cup-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If this is what life without Ivan Toney looks like, would it be so bad? Thomas Frank suggested this week his leading scorer would command a nine-figure sum, but he was absent here with a minor hamstring ailment. That gave Brentford – fans, Frank and players alike – a Sunday portal to peek into a potential future.</p><p>What they saw brought plenty of sunshine and smiles: they strolled past West Ham. Two members of the front three, and Yoane Wissa, were on the scoresheet. The former is a lovely footballer to watch, one of the game’s gliders, while the latter appears to have goals in him. Being hypercritical, both should have scored more than one apiece.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/14/brentford-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>And to think a trip to Goodison Park in the midst of a Champions League semi-final was considered the most awkward assignment of what remains of Manchester City’s run-in. The notion, and Everton, were dismissed with almost contemptuous ease as another decisive contribution from Ilkay Gündogan and another goal from Erling Haaland took Pep Guardiola’s team closer to a third successive Premier League title.</p><p>Gündogan showed why City have to secure his services beyond this summer, when his contract expires, with two goals to follow up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/06/manchester-city-leeds-premier-league-match-report">his brace against Leeds</a> last weekend. The midfielder’s first was a stunning piece of ingenuity that deflated Everton in their fight to avoid the drop. He then set up Haaland’s 52<sup>nd</sup> goal in all competitions this season before polishing his outstanding performance with a beautiful free-kick beyond Jordan Pickford. Ultimately Guardiola’s only issue was the timing of a game moved due to Eurovision, with Real Madrid visiting the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/14/everton-manchester-city-premiership-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The sport with roots in hip‑hop culture will make its debut at the Games next year. Here some of the young UK breakers hoping to be picked talk about the life-changing effect of the Olympic announcement</p><p>In two cavernous film studios in Acton, west London, Nike is shooting one of its tent-pole summer advertising campaigns. Everything about the production is outsize: the white-walled main stage is populated by around 200 extras, young and lithe, dressed in cropped sweatshirts and joggers, wearing Air Force 1 and Dunk Low sneakers. Costume designers and makeup artists swarm around, adjusting this, refreshing that, while the same few seconds of a dance music track plays on a loop through booming speakers. Meanwhile, a camera on a dolly sweeps through the crowd to reveal the two stars of the show.</p><p>You would expect the pair to be athletes, household names probably. But it’s not quite that straightforward. Let’s start with the “athlete” part: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kidkaram123/?hl=en">Karam Singh</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/indiasardjoehh/?hl=en">India Sardjoe</a> are breakers, or breakdancers if you want to show your age, better-known as 25-year-old B-boy Kid Karam and B-girl India, 16. Sardjoe, who represents the Netherlands, is the reigning world and European champion. Singh is the first breaker to earn a place on Team GB and is currently ranked No 6 in the world. But even they struggle to put a label on what they do. “It’s very physically demanding,” says Singh, during his lunch break on the shoot. “A guy called Menno from Holland calls us ‘artletes’. But, for me, it’s just a mix of everything.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/14/young-stars-uk-breakdancing-olympics-paris-2024-kid-karam-bgirl-roxy-shortbread">Continue reading...</a>

Shops are boarded up, money is scarce, divisions over the 1984 miners’ strike linger. There is still a pub, the eponymous Old Oak, run by a former miner, TJ Ballantyne, played by Dave Turner, but it is on its last legs, kept afloat by a ragbag of disgruntled and opinionated regulars. Into town comes a group of Syrian refugees to be rehoused, including a self-confident young woman, Yara (played by the Syrian actor Ebla Mari) who likes taking photos of what she encounters. Some locals object, not wanting any “fucking ragheads” to be “dumped on us”. Others try to make them welcome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/14/ken-loach-last-film-the-old-oak-syrian-refugees">Continue reading...</a>

## Artist Sarah Sze: ‘We’ve created a system that can destroy us. That’s new’

<p>The New York artist celebrated for her complex installations is creating a huge work for Artangel in an abandoned waiting room at Peckham Rye station in London. She talks about time, technology and ‘working like crazy’</p><p>Sarah Sze is a specialist in dissonant realities, so the discovery of an abandoned railway waiting room, silently hunkered down between tracks whooshing with trains, posed an irresistible challenge. “What I love about it is this idea of a negative space that’s been sitting in plain sight for so long,” she says. “You’re actually sandwiched between the trains, so it’s like time has passed outside the windows, but it has been sort of preserved inside. You also have this real sense of anticipation there, because a waiting room is always about something about to happen, about to arrive. Most people who have used that station every day don’t know it exists, which is an incredible thing in a city like London, where every square foot usually has purpose, because there’s that need for a growing population.”</p><p>The once-grand first-class waiting room is at <a href="https://www.networkrail.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cronology-of-Peckham-Rye-station-1865-to-2021.pdf">Peckham Rye station</a>, which was built in the 1860s as a London junction for visitors travelling from the south coast to the recently relocated Crystal Palace. When the expected hordes of passengers failed to materialise, the station continued but the waiting room was converted into a billiards hall, which ran for 40 years. Since closing in 1962, it has lain vast and empty, stripped to its beams like the skeleton of a beached whale.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/14/artist-sarah-sze-interview-waiting-room-artangel-peckham-rye-timelapse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anticipated vote would be chance to take on a shaken SNP and send message to voters UK-wide</p><p>On Rutherglen’s Main Street, the mood of Scottish Labour activists was as bright as the afternoon sunshine as they gathered for some teatime door-knocking. They were with Michael Shanks, their new candidate in the anticipated byelection for a seat currently held by the former SNP MP and Covid rule-breaker Margaret Ferrier.</p><p>But the buoyancy had a hard edge: Labour’s leaders see this byelection as a crucial test of what polls suggest is a sea change in Scottish politics after Nicola Sturgeon’s resignation in February. It is likely to be the last byelection before the general election, and Labour sees it as a way to send a message to voters UK-wide about its electability.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/14/were-going-to-fight-this-hard-labour-keen-for-byelection-test-in-rutherglen">Continue reading...</a>

She’s 10 years younger than me and lives on the other side of the world – but we forged the friendship of a lifetime<p>There’s an assumption in life that by the time you’ve reached your more seasoned years, you’ve made all the close friends you need. Surely you’ve accumulated enough through school, university and work. But I’ve learned that close friends can be made at any age. In my case, one of my most meaningful, profound friendships was formed when I was in my mid-50s. It is a unique bond that crosses cultures, languages and continents.</p><p>The first time I met <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/15/violets-kyung-sook-shin-review-seoul-please-look-after-mother" title="">Kyung-sook Shin</a> I was unbelievably nervous.

Her groundbreaking novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/01/please-look-after-mother-review" title="">Please Look After Mother</a></em>, was all about a mother who sacrificed everything for her family only to be discarded by them.

<p>The Ivor awards in London this week will celebrate the collaborators who have dodged the stresses of celebrity</p><p>Bright lights and public adulation are commonplace for those few singers who regularly hit the charts. But behind the hubbub that surrounds performers such as Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran or Little Simz, hides a small group of hitmakers, co-writing hugely commercial songs and rarely making headlines. These are the music industry’s secret weapons.</p><p>Crucial to this backroom role, according to one of the most successful newcomers around, is the job of keeping a pop idol grounded in normal life.

The war was lambasted from every angle, while Putin responded to his pariah status by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65586701">shelling the home town</a> of Ukraine’s entrants, Tvorchi, with the fabulous vindictiveness of an uninvited fairy godmother.

But they lack the skill to work with the delicate glass tubes, and they don’t know for certain which sign he had in mind.</p><p>This Cantonese-language drama is a mainstream Chinese production, and as such, operates at a sentimental register that arthouse audiences might find cloying. Still, it looks terrific – a nostalgic celebration of the illuminated streetscapes of Hong Kong past. Handsome flashbacks to the 1960s – the early years of Bill and Mei-hsiang’s courtship – are juxtaposed against numerous shots of puddles full of splinters of reflected light. The neon hues are so saturated, so rich, you almost want to swim in them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/14/a-light-never-goes-out-review-sentimental-but-sumptuous-hong-kong-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gritty 70s London does most of the heavy lifting as an IRA man tracks down the British soldier who killed his wife in this Sky Original drama</p><p>South Armagh, 1975, in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles. IRA paramilitary Michael (Colin Morgan) is on the run from British forces but risks everything to be with his pregnant wife when she goes into labour. However, the Brits have been tipped off, and in the ensuing ambush, Michael’s wife is accidentally shot dead by Tempest (Aml Ameen).</p><p>The resulting feud between the ruthless IRA terrorist and the marksman who killed his wife will prove to be something of a challenge for audience members who prefer to have at least one sympathetic character to latch on to. This crude thriller unfolds against a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>-style version of 1970s London, with streets strewn with piles of abandoned three-piece suites, oil drums burning on every corner, and turd-brown Ford Cortinas pulling handbrake turns whenever the plot flags.</p><p>Dead Shot is available on Sky Cinema</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/14/dead-shot-review-an-ira-terrorist-is-bent-on-revenge-in-crude-troubles-thriller-sky">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A woman mourning the loss of her husband was advised to take up gardening, another was told to get a dog… But intimacy and desire among grieving people is something we all need to know about</p><p>Pauline and I first met at a book event last year; a small gathering in a London arts club that marked the paperback release of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/17/kat-lister-turning-the-anger-of-grief-into-comedy" title="">memoir</a> I’d written, chronicling my young widowhood in my 30s. Pauline sat inconspicuously at the back of the darkened room and, when the Q&amp;A was over, she quietly introduced herself, quickly drawing attention to the section she’d most connected with, the chapters where I explored self-pleasure and sex in the early months of my grief.</p><p>Younger people like me “got it more”, she told me, referring to her thirst for physical intimacy as a newly widowed 72-year-old. More often than not, people didn’t get it: “They don’t imagine that you’ve had a sex life.” But why, she asked? And what did that signify for others her age? A few days later, she sent me a Spotify link to an early 90s Bruce Springsteen song – Human Touch – describing how his melodious yearnings for “somethin’ to hold on to” summed up her recent frustrations as a more mature widow, a year after her husband’s death. The electrical wires were humming again, but she was increasingly feeling as if she had been put on mute by everyone around her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/14/why-are-the-sex-lives-of-the-bereaved-still-a-taboo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a child in communist Albania, I yearned to play with her. But as soon as she was within reach, I didn’t want her any more</p><p>When I was a child in communist Albania, happiness was called Aniushka. Aniushka was a large Czechoslovak doll that belonged to my neighbours. They were party members who had been allowed to travel to Prague at one point, and brought Aniushka back to decorate their bedroom. She was not on sale in any Albanian shop.</p><p>She had thick, black hair done up in a chignon, and wore an imperial-looking, orange satin dress adorned with lace. Her lips were bright red, and she had deep blue eyes, and long, dark eyelashes that gave her a dreamy expression. She sat majestically on the bed with the sides of her dress unfolded over the mattress, giving the plain, communist furniture a solemn, Habsburg air. I would stare for hours, longing to touch her. Sometimes, I sat on a chair by the bedroom doorstep – which was as close to her as I was allowed to get – and we talked about whether she might like, one day, to become a toy rather than an ornament.</p><p>Lea Ypi is a professor in political theory in the government department at the London School of Economics</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/commentisfree/2023/may/14/czechoslovakian-doll-happiness-dark-side-albania">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rishi Sunak’s enjoyment of Jilly Cooper’s Riders speaks volumes about image he strives to project</p><p>What is it with the Tories and bonkbusters? When they’re not writing their own, they’re coyly briefing on their love for the genre. Last week, just as we had managed to sandblast from our minds’ eyes the image of Rishi Sunak in cycling shorts, punching the air to Britney on his Peloton, we were obliged to reckon with the revelation that he likes nothing more after a tough local election day than to kick off his Prada loafers, slip into his sliders and curl up with a copy of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/12/rishi-sunak-jilly-cooper-novel-riders-among-favourite-books" title="">his favourite novel, Jilly Cooper’s </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/12/rishi-sunak-jilly-cooper-novel-riders-among-favourite-books" title="">Riders</a></em>.</p><p>If it was a briefing – the revelation came courtesy of the <em>Spectator</em>’s Katy Balls in a reference to the prime minister’s cultural guilty pleasures – it’s a remarkably clever one, for who doesn’t love Jilly Cooper?

A virtuoso storyteller with a talent for archival research, he has tracked explorers through mosquito-ridden Amazonian swamps in <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-lost-city-of-z-9781471164910">The Lost City of Z</a></em>, and across the howling wastes of Antarctica in <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-white-darkness-9781471178023">The White Darkness</a></em>, an outing that involved frostbite, broken teeth, bacterial peritonitis and eventually death.</p><p>Now he’s taken to the high seas with <em>The Wager</em> – and you can see why Grann was attracted by the tale of a scurvy-ridden British warship foundering on the shores of Patagonia during a spectacularly ill-conceived mission to round Cape Horn in the early 1740s.</p><p><em>The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder</em> by David Grann is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (£20).

This route – a nearly six-mile stretch from Broadstairs to Margate – is, I think, the best so far, with no traffic and impressive surroundings.</p><p>This walk should only be done at low tide as parts of the route aren’t accessible otherwise. There is also a danger of being cut off by the sea, so it’s important to check the tide times. (At high tide it can be done along the top of the cliffs instead, though it’s less dramatic.)

<p>With asparagus or in a tart, new potatoes bring the nutty, sweet taste of early summer</p><p>The new potatoes are here – tiny, kidney-shaped and with soft, flaky skins. Lightly scraped and steamed, their creamy yellow flesh has a sweet nuttiness that is the essence of early summer. I toss them, still warm from the steamer, in a vivid dressing of fresh herbs and olive oil with a kick of green chilli. The trick is to dress them lightly so you get the best of both dressing and potato. You can add other seasonal treats, too: asparagus tips, carefully steamed purple sprouting (tossed very gently as it is inclined to break up) and early samphire, whose saltiness will bring out the best in the new potatoes. (Seaweed is often used as fertiliser for the Jersey variety.)</p><p>Those little potatoes ended up in a tart, too. Steamed, sliced and teamed with mozzarella and crème fraîche, they made an appearance with a salad of curls of spring carrot and radish, a hint of mustard and mint in the dressing. The first batch we ate warm from the oven, the next were stuffed into old toffee tins as sustenance for an outing, and travelled well enough, despite their fragile crust.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/14/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-new-potatoes-with-asparagus-and-for-potato-and-thyme-tarts">Continue reading...</a>

A child-free break gives us a chance to enjoy life to the full. But did the kids miss us?<p>Much of the thought behind this column is to balance the highs and lows of parenting, celebrating its joys as much as I lament its tedium. I have mined the latter for laughs as much as any parent, but I hope I’ve put across that, for all the easy jokes about how terrible parenting can be, it’s also genuinely enjoyable, not just in some theoretical, ‘love conquers all’ kind of way, but in the real, tangible, non-sentimental sense of actual enjoyment.</p><p>Being a dad has, I hope I’ve made clear, given me more wrinkles from smiling than frowning. And, basically, I hope I’ve built up enough goodwill that I can afford to write the following: being without my children for four days last weekend was truly, truly wonderful.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/14/i-really-do-love-my-kids-but-being-away-from-them-is-utter-bliss">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The theatre and opera director on how her working-class Welsh background informs her work, the strangeness of Il trovatore, and her eclectic running playlist</p><p>Born and raised in Port Talbot, south Wales, <a href="https://adelethomasdirector.com/About">Adele Thomas</a>, 41, is an award-winning director noted for her highly physical, pared-back stagings for theatre and opera. Since directing student theatre while at Cambridge University, she has worked across the UK and abroad. Shows include <em>The Oresteia</em> and <em>Thomas Talli</em>s at Shakespeare’s Globe, and <em>Under Milk Wood</em> at the Royal &amp; Derngate theatre in Northampton. She now works predominantly in opera and has directed Vivaldi’s <em>Bazajet</em> (Royal Opera House and Irish National Opera), Handel’s <em>Berenice</em> and, earlier this year, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/04/in-the-realms-of-sorrow-stone-nest-london-handel-festival-review-alexanders-feast-st-georges-hanover-square-sheku-kanneh-mason-plays-bloch-philharmonia-saraste">In the Realms of Sorrow</a></em> at the London Handel festival with Stone Nest. Thomas makes her Glyndebourne festival debut this summer with Handel’s <em><a href="https://www.glyndebourne.com/events/semele/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw0tKiBhC6ARIsAAOXutnn-4V-HD4ICTFuBgr2BqDx1qj3WxMphyHlclG8gshRNGuASHLVkTMaAkuCEALw_wcB">Semele</a></em> (23 July-26 August).

When I was growing up in Port Talbot, it was a place to escape from, to rail against. London, the metropolitan life, seemed to be where I should be. The expectation at school was that we’d be lucky to get a job in the town’s steelworks, directly opposite the school. Ambition wasn’t encouraged. Now I feel totally differently. I realise that the place has a sort of magic to it. It’s like a creative wellspring. So many actors have come from there: Richard Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Michael Sheen. That sense of the Welsh bard, the lone beautiful speaker walking across the hillside – that really carries through to acting. And the collective idea of performance is reflected in Welsh choral singing. But directing? Standing up and telling others how to do it? That’s something I didn’t know about, growing up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/14/director-adele-thomas-opera-theatre-il-trovatore-semele">Continue reading...</a>

Fewer voters believe the rapidly fragmenting right can offer solutions to our pressing crises<p>It’s in its infancy, but it’s hard to imagine how the emergent mood of seriousness about the interlinked threats to our economy, society and democracy cannot but grow stronger.</p><p>Yes, there was relief at last week’s news that the economy was still growing in the first three months of this year, even if at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/12/too-early-to-sound-the-all-clear-as-impact-of-uk-rate-rises-yet-to-be-felt" title="">a minuscule rate</a>.

It consists of the entire text of Schulz’s short story collection <em>The Street of Crocodiles</em>, but with most of the words having been cut out, leaving yawning gaps, so that rather than reading the pages we read <em>through</em> them, creating strange, opportunistic collages of Schulz’s words, snippets and flashes of his thought.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/14/bruno-schulz-an-artist-a-murder-and-the-hijacking-of-history-benjamin-balint-review-extraordinary-mind-cruel-death">Continue reading...</a>

However, after years of it constantly sticking to my hair, attracting all manner of debris – from food to flying objects – and always making me look as if I’d just eaten a greasy meal, the allure eventually wore off. But lately I have revisited gloss, because they have changed (and sometimes we all need a change). Formulations are much more elegant and moisturising; you no longer have to suffer childlike flavours (as a grownup I don’t want my lip gloss to smell like Hubba Bubba), and I’ve realised that it softens your features and lights up your face. Also, sometimes, an opaque lipstick can feel quite serious, and a gloss – be it clear or with a hue – is its more relaxed, playful sibling that will swiftly plump thinner lips and add a touch of glam to daywear without the formality that comes with, say, a bold red lip. Admittedly, while I do find myself applying a layer of gloss on my lips and thereafter adding a light swipe of my (matte) lipstick across the centre of my lips – old habits and all that – I am a gloss convert. At least for now.</p><p><strong>1. Jones Road Cool Gloss</strong> £22, <a href="https://www.libertylondon.com/">libertylondon.com</a> <br /><strong>2.

## Sir Keir Starmer doesn’t like talk of a hung parliament, but he needs to prep for one | Andrew Rawnsley

The legacy of the 2019 defeat makes it very challenging for Labour to get to a parliamentary majority in one go<p>Sir Keir Starmer and Sir Ed Davey were seated next to each other in Westminster Abbey for the coronation. For these knights of the opposition realm, it was an opportunity to exchange mutual congratulations on their <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2023/england/results" title="">successes in the local elections</a>. For everyone else, the pairing provided a glimpse of one possible future for this country in which prime minister Starmer and deputy PM Davey have agreed to form a Lab-Lib coalition. I don’t say this will happen. No one can predict exactly how the chips will fall. I do say both men should be thinking about and preparing for hung parliament scenarios because there’s a significant level of probability that the next election will produce one.</p><p>Sir Keir has credible grounds for saying he will become prime minister, but his MPs struggle to sound genuinely confident that Labour will secure a parliamentary majority. The explanation is the national mood and the electoral maths. As one of the Labour leader’s inner circle puts it, “the maths is very difficult”. Sir Keir has sought to efface the Jeremy Corbyn years, but he can’t rewrite the party’s cataclysmically atrocious performance at the last election, which crushed the number of Labour MPs in the Commons to <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7529/CBP-7529.pdf" title="">its lowest tally</a> since 1935. Climbing a towering mountain from such a very low base presents a vertiginous challenge. To get to a parliamentary majority of just one, Labour must win 123 more seats than it did in 2019. Sir Keir would need a majority substantially better than one to sustain a reforming government through a full parliamentary term. Seat gains on that scale rarely happen. History suggests it is not mission impossible, but it is mission extremely bloody difficult.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/14/labour-win-not-unfeasible-keir-starmer-backup-plan-lab-lib-coalition">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’m not someone at ease with nature, but the monetising off of our public spaces is chilling</p><p>I have a difficult relationship with nature, which I believe is how it should be. Last week, I put my dressing gown on after getting out of the shower and felt a prickling sensation on my thigh. A wasp flew out, and my leg swelled up, and I cursed these beasts I am compelled to live alongside, and the loving friction we create.</p><p>As spring creeps in I’m out among that nature again, among the trees and the grasses, and the wild garlic with its stench and flowers. At the back of my local park there are acres of the stuff, largely left alone despite the <em>Sunday Times</em> recently describing it as “cultural currency”, a “disruptor, as everyone puts down their mobiles and goes out to forage” and “the root of all joy and smuggery”. Where I live, though, the garlic causes yet more friction, as distant neighbours take to NextDoor to complain about families collecting it in quantities they resent and others explain it’s a weed or a wildflower, which benefits from picking and, besides, shut up. And for all my suspicion of the outside world, my insistence that nature is too green and badly lit, this is one thing I do agree on: nature is for everyone, in all its horrible glory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/14/councils-squeezing-the-life-out-of-our-parks-is-bad-for-us-all">Continue reading...</a>

A novel approach to holding Russia accountable for atrocities in Ukraine could ensure that lies and mass murder do not go unpunished<p>The powerful were meant to be afraid of the truth. Journalists were meant to “hold truth to power”. Evidence was meant to destroy wrongdoers as sunlight does a vampire. Find the evidence, the logic went, and the powerful could be shamed and brought to justice.</p><p>Historically, the powerful would try to censor and suppress the facts. The Nazis tried to keep the truth about their atrocities hidden. The Soviet leadership would howl with embarrassment when dissidents passed information about conditions in the gulag to the outside world. Richard Nixon was brought down after the facts of his bugging his political opponents, and his ensuing cover-up, were brought to light.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/14/what-happens-when-leaders-disregard-truth-putin-trump-about-to-find-out">Continue reading...</a>

One of his beats was impersonating politicians, and Sudeikis made recurring appearances as George W Bush and Joe Biden, when he was vice-president to Barack Obama, in a mocked-up version of the same room. So while his <em>Ted Lasso</em> colleagues were losing their minds – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/sep/03/why-is-ted-lasso-actor-brett-goldstein-telling-everyone-hes-actually-a-human-man" title="">Brett Goldstein</a>, the British actor who plays hard-nut ex-footballer Roy Kent, later admitted he was freaking out about what to do with his hands and spent the whole time trying not to swear – Sudeikis remained calm, somewhat.</p><p>“I’d been in a fake Oval Office a number of times,” says Sudeikis today, a few weeks on, “and so there’s a little bit of me that’s nonplussed by it and just holding my shit together. And I’d met the president when he was vice president and he’s a very warm guy. It’s like meeting your good friend’s father or your young friend’s grandfather. He just makes you feel at home and that home just happened to be the White House for that afternoon.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/14/jason-sudeikis-interview-ted-lasso">Continue reading...</a>

Passing laws to detain and deport migrants suits some Tories, but it is not what voters want<p>‘It is designed to meet the will of the British people in a humane and fair way.” So wrote the home secretary, Suella Braverman, and the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, about the government’s illegal immigration bill in a <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/peers-take-note-our-asylum-bill-delivers-on-the-will-of-the-people-98fd5hj0f" title=""><em>Times</em> op-ed</a> last week.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/26/controversial-uk-asylum-bill-passes-third-reading-in-commons" title="">bill seeks</a> to detain and remove all migrants who arrive in this country by irregular means and to ban them from ever applying for asylum here.

<p>Jeffrey Toobin has written a brilliant, chilling book on the Oklahoma City bombing and the rise of Republican extremism</p><p>Jeffrey Toobin has combined two great books in one. The first is an edge-of-your-seat thriller, describing Timothy McVeigh’s every movement on his way to committing one of the most horrific crimes in American history. The second traces how a huge part of the Republican establishment has come to embrace many of McVeigh’s most dangerous convictions.</p><p>Toobin is a lawyer who became a full-time writer and TV pundit 30 years ago. This is his ninth book and his most important, because it gives the clear and present danger of rightwing extremism the attention it deserves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/14/homegrown-book-review-jeffrey-toobin-timothy-mcveigh-oklahoma-city-trump-republicans">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A beautiful and sad portrait of the Mandelas’ marriage of opposites is an insightful study of two huge characters, while a gripping and important book reveals how the ANC leader rescued his riven country from civil war</p><p>On a brisk morning in 1980, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/winnie-mandela">Winnie Mandela</a> went to visit her husband on Robben Island. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nelsonmandela">Nelson Mandela </a>had been there since 1964. For years, he had only been allowed to see one visitor every six months. That day, she did not bring her usual packages of food and papers, but a single bundle: their first grandchild, only a few months old. This was a brazen violation of the rules: children or grandchildren had to be at least 16 years old to see a prisoner. The 62-year-old Mandela begged his young Afrikaner guard to let him hold the baby. The guard said he would be fired. But then he took the baby from Winnie and let him hold her. It was the first and only time he saw Mandela cry.</p><p>As heartbreaking as that story is, it is also a tale of manipulation and bitterness. Winnie had brought the baby as a peace offering for her husband, who was angry about her very public infidelities, her lack of discipline and her seeming inability to control their daughter Zindzi. Winnie was always able to wound her husband and he was always vulnerable to her guile.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/14/winnie-nelson-by-jonny-steinberg-the-plot-to-save-south-africa-by-justice-malala-nelson-mandela-review">Continue reading...</a>

The disgraced prime minister’s clumsy meddling jeopardises delicate relations with Beijing<p>To Liz Truss’s many failings must now be added an apparent prejudice against Rutland. Not unlike the island of Taiwan, England’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-60955356" title="">smallest historic county</a> has fought hard over the years to maintain its independence from a larger, overbearing neighbour.

If you hail from landlocked rural Rutland, Truss’s spokesperson superciliously implied last week, you probably don’t understand international affairs.</p><p>This insulting inference was made after Kearns had the temerity to question the wisdom, utility and motivation of Truss’s unofficial visit to Taiwan last week. The disgraced former prime minister says she plans to speak out in “solidarity” with Taiwan’s people in defiance of Chinese intimidation. But Kearns dismissed the trip as a vanity project to help Truss “keep herself relevant” and as “the worst kind of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/11/liz-trusss-taiwan-visit-called-instagram-diplomacy-alicia-kearns-foreign-affairs-select-committee-chair" title="">Instagram diplomacy</a>”.

<p>The choice of vessel used in production is of vast importance, and there are many very different methods</p><p><strong>Zuccardi Concreto Malbec, Paraje Altamira, Uco Valley, Mendoza, Argentina 2019 (from £25.99, <a href="http://robertsandspeight.co.uk/">robertsandspeight.co.uk</a>; <a href="http://farehamwinecellar.co.uk/">farehamwinecellar.co.uk</a>; <a href="http://hicwinemerchants.com/">hicwinemerchants.com</a>) </strong>One of the many eccentricities that, depending on your perspective, make wine either an endlessly engaging or a needlessly fussy pursuit, is the influence of the different vessels used in its production. In choosing what to ferment and/or age their wine in – stainless steel tank, oak barrel, clay amphora, concrete egg, glass demijohn – the winemaker is acting a little bit like a chef choosing whether to use a hob, a grill, an oven, or an open flame, and the differences can be no less pronounced. Winemakers are no less prone to fashion than their chef colleagues either, with the different materials falling in and out of favour depending on whichever aesthetic is currently in vogue. Lately, for example, there’s been a surprising revival of a material that had for decades been beyond the pale, concrete, as used in wines such as Zuccardi’s exquisitely lithe, subtly floral-herbal, pure-fruited malbec.</p><p><strong>Celler del Roure Cullerot, Valencia, Spain 2022 (£15.50, <a href="http://nywines.co.uk/">nywines.co.uk</a>; <a href="http://thefinewinecompany.co.uk/">thefinewinecompany.co.uk</a>) </strong>The reason why so many winemakers, many of them producing some of the world’s most in-demand fine wines in places such as Bordeaux, Napa or Piedmont, have taken to concrete is not because they like the vogueishly brutalist look of the tanks in their winery (although, it has to be said, there is something gorgeously tactile about the material, especially when it’s been shaped, as many are these days, like an egg). What these winemakers like is the way concrete offers some of the properties of an oak barrel (like oak, it’s porous, so it allows for the same, wine-softening effects that come from the interaction with small amounts of oxygen), without imparting any flavours of its own (as oak, especially young or highly toasted oak, will do). Other winemakers have gone back even further in time to a material with similar benefits to concrete that was used in the very first winemaking 6,000 years ago: clay, as in the Spanish tinajas used to age Celler del Roure’s wonderfully citrus grove-scented dry white blend.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/14/david-williams-wines-of-the-week-the-importance-of-the-choice-of-vessel">Continue reading...</a>

Even if the Met’s leadership wants to bury its head in the sand over the white nationalism connotations of the thin blue line in the US, it should ask itself whether the symbol is aligned with a police service for Londoners.

<p>Proponents hope a sleek inter-city service between the two US cities will revolutionize public transportation in the region and reduce the amount of cars on the road</p><p>The last time someone tried to run an eye-catching passenger train from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, in the early 1970s, it was more like a cruise ship than a regular rail service, a rollicking ride along an old freight line with booze, gambling and live music nicknamed the Crapshooters Express. It left California on a Friday and returned its passengers – drunker, poorer and not always happier – in time for work on Monday morning.</p><p>The idea did not catch on, largely because the journey took seven-and-a-half hours each way, almost twice as long as crossing the Mojave desert by car and more than seven times as long as flying. On the train’s star-studded inaugural run, the scotch, bourbon, gin and vodka all ran out within an hour. Amtrak agreed to run the service only because the Las Vegas hamber of commerce agreed to cover any losses and then only on weekends during the winter months. Passenger numbers fell off precipitously and after going through a few different iterations, the venture collapsed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/13/los-angeles-las-vegas-travel-high-speed-rail-california">Continue reading...</a>
