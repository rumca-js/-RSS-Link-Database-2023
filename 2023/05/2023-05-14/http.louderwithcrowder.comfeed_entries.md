	Charlize Theron last week said she would f*ck up anyone who supports laws protecting children from being exposed to drag shows. And Megyn Kelly has pulled her punk card, telling the actress to take her best shot.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote></div><p>
	Here is what Kelly is talking about. Theron took part in a drag telethon last week where she issued her threat: "<em>We love you queens! We're in your corner, and we've got you, and I will f*** anybody up who is, like, trying to f*** with anything with you guys.</em>"
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote></div><p>
	After admitting that she has gone to drag shows before and that they can be fun -- as an ADULT and for ADULTS -- Kelly lowered the boom on the real problem Americans have that leftist leave out. <em>"But there are drag queen shows out there right now that are deeply disturbing, and they‚Äôre happening in front of young children. So know what you‚Äôre supporting, understand what we‚Äôre actually seeing out there which can include absolutely the grooming of young children."</em></p><p>People who support these "anti" drag laws and want to protect children have specific examples of what they view as inappropriate for kids. </p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote></div><p>
	And it doesn't stop with the drag shows. This is the new Democrat Party platform. The same progressives who support exposing children to drag also support <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-private-school-dean-students" target="_blank">exposing them to sex toys</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/parental-rights-congresswoman-penthouse" target="_blank">glorified Penthouse forum letters</a> and claiming it's about "inclusion."</p><p>The left has a clear agenda that elitists like Charlize Theron support. If the actress is that willing to get violent over it, let's see her start with Megyn Kelly. That will be fun for all involved except for Charlize Theron.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Special needs student called "bigot" by teachers for not wanting to learn how lesbians have sex, and her mom is pissed

	A special needs student was (allegedly) called a transphobic bigot by teachers during a health and relationships class at Glendale High School. Her mother (allegedly) checked a box on a form that would seclude her daughter from being taught anything LGBTQ+ or sexual in nature. The school (allegedly) didn't care. Also, the student (allegedly) did not use preferred pronouns.</p><p>Now that you have the backstory, here is the student's mother wanting to know "what the deuce" from the city council.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p><blockquote>My daughter was taught such acts as scissoring. When my daughter expressed that she should not be in these classes, she was called a bigot by her teacher, she was called intolerant, and she was called homophobic. These are all terms she didn't know, they are not part of our vocabulary at home.  She simply expressed that due to her Christian beliefs it goes against her morals. At that point a staff member told her to look at her skin color.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Ah, yes, Because the girl has brown skin and is therefore marginalized, and because everyone on the LGBTQAIIP+EIEIO spectrum is marginalized, the student should embrace learning -- IN SCHOOL -- how lesbians get amorous by rubbing their vaginas together. Apologize for not going right to the link on Urban Dictionary, but at least I didn't use this.gif of Miss Garrison from <em>South Park</em>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>(I couldn't help myself, but this is what's -- allegedly -- being taught in high school)</p><p>To be fair, Glendale High Communications Director Kristine Nam issued a statement to Fox News claiming it was "a general lesson from the health textbook about making healthy decisions in your relationships," and that the teacher asked the girl "to refrain from making inappropriate remarks." The school claimed no wrongdoing by the teachers but is still investigating.</p><p>Maybe the school is right and the student has her facts confused. But it sounds like par for the course when schools are teaching the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-private-school-dean-students" target="_blank">pros and cons of "spit vs lube"</a> when gay men do butt stuff. Not to mention, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/parental-rights-congresswoman-penthouse" target="_blank">all the glorified Penthouse Forum Letters</a> that find their way on recommended reading lists. Material that had a student looked up on their school-issued laptops <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-mother-son" target="_blank">THEY WOULD BE BLOCKED FROM SEEING</a> on the internet.</p><p>Where the oldhead in me gets confused in all of this is the extent <em>WE</em> were "taught" how to "have" heterosexual sex was a science lesson about how babies are made and a discussion about not making babies before you were married. We didn't have graphic lessons about doing it doggy-style or reverse cowgirl. Nor was sixty-nining pitched as a method of safe sex. </p><p>Yet, in the name of "inclusion" and stuff like "equity," government-run schools have decided graphic sex is the only way to "teach" students to be tolerant of each other. It's <em>ALMOST</em> as if there is an anterior motive going on.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Reporter takes a dump on normies who find Dave Chappelle hilarious (as Dave takes one on San Francisco)

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33666409&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=87%2C0%2C159%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>
	Dave Chappelle performed in San Francisco and reminded people what a sh*thole the city has become. But what was more problematic is the number of people who still find Chappelle hilarious. <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/sf-culture/article/dave-chappelle-masonic-comedy-review-18097136.php" target="_blank">That's the message from SFGate journalismer Dan Gentile</a>.
</p><p>
	As is customary in modern reviews, it was less about what was being reviewed as much as it was about the reviewers being in their feelings. Chappelle didn't have much to say about the transgender community this time, though there were still "dog whistles" the reviewer heard that no one else did and that the reviewer claims drowned out everything else at the show.
</p><blockquote>
	I heard these dog whistles loud and clear, and it spoiled the set for me. However, I‚Äôm not sure how much of the audience really understood that context. For those that follow pop culture news, Chappelle‚Äôs transphobia has been one of the biggest stories of the past few years.
</blockquote><p>
	Chappelle is a TERF, aka a "trans-exclusionary radical feminist," aka a liberal who still believes in science. And a "dog whistle" is what progressive twats call it when they want to accuse you of an -ism or -phobia but can't, so they claim you said something you didn't say.
</p><blockquote>
	But at least one attendee at the show ‚Äî the guy sitting next to me ‚Äî admitted to barely knowing anything about Chappelle. My Lyft driver was also clueless about the controversy, and so were several other people I spoke to recently. They only knew that Chappelle is a really funny comedian. ... What‚Äôs so complicated about comedy ‚Äî and almost everything ‚Äî in the year 2023 is that my oblivious neighbor and I watched the show through completely different lenses.
</blockquote><p>
	It's not complicated. There are normal people who find comedy funny and don't need every performer to validate their worldview. And then there are leftists with a stick shoved up whatever orifice they identify with that week.
</p><p>
	The other bain of Gentile's content is Chappelle sh*tting all over what a sh*thole San Francisco has turned into. I don't even know the exact bit, but Chappelle went for a nice steak and was put off when a homeless person took a dump in front of him. Apparently, while Chappelle was making fun of the homeless, he wasn't aware of a San Fran business owner who sprayed one with water.
</p><p>
	In Chappelle's defense, while he then claimed to remember watching that specific video, it's hard to keep track of every video you see on the internet. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-schoolchildren">I'm sure it blended together with this one:</a></p><p>


</p><p>
<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-streets">This one too:</a></p><p>


</p><p>
<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-homeless-guy-moves" target="_blank">And don't forget this one</a>:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">People say lack of housing forces local residents into the streets, but James says he came from Texas to San Francisco for the drugs, the non-enforcement of anti-camping laws, and the $820/month in welfare & food stamps. James says he sold fentanyl, 2 weeks ago, to a 15-year-old. <a href="https://t.co/5qMr6tmlWs">pic.twitter.com/5qMr6tmlWs</a><br />‚Äî Michael Shellenberger (@shellenberger) <a href="https://twitter.com/shellenberger/status/1491418120086454278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>It's good to laugh once and a while, if for no other reason it helps you forget how horrible everything around you this. This reviewer should consider doing so. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
