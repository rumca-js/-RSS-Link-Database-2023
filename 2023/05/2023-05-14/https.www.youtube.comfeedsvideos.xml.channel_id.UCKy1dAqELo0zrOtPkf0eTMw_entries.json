Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary might be the most villainous villain in all of the Marvel Phases we\u2019ve seen play out on-screen. Yes, I\u2019m aware of Thanos, I\u2019m aware of Killmonger, Red Skull, even Kang. None of those villains hold a candle to the MCU\u2019s High Evolutionary. The villains that came before him and Kang, all have depth and many layers behind their villainy, but the High Evolutionary\u2019s lack of any remorse or humanity will see him go down as one of the MCU\u2019s darkest villains. I\u2019m gonna explore what it is exactly that makes me consider him more evil than the man who snapped half the universe out of existence, because compared to the High Evolutionary, Thanos is just a blip on his radar.

However, it was also the first time we got a look at Nathan Drake, who would go on to be one of the most enduring PlayStation characters ever. Sure, he looked a bit younger and more cartoony, but the weirdest part? Naughty Dog revealed gameplay, but we didn\u2019t know the game would be called Uncharted: Drake\u2019s Fortune until much later - and we probably never guessed it would spawn Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Uncharted 3: Drake\u2019s Deception, Uncharted 4: A Thief\u2019s End, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, Uncharted: The Golden Abyss, Uncharted: The Movie and Uncharted: Fight For Fortune: The Digital Collectible Card Game.
