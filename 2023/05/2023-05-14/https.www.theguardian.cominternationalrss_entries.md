<p>Monday marks two years since goalkeeper’s winner against West Brom but his focus is to keep Leicester at bay</p><p>On Tuesday it will be two years since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/16/west-brom-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Alisson scored the soaring, stoppage-time header</a> that maintained Liverpool’s late surge towards Champions League qualification at the end of a troubled campaign. Liverpool will have their goalkeeper to thank again should history repeat itself this season, albeit for the Brazil international’s outstanding contribution in his own goalmouth.</p><p>Jürgen Klopp presented Alisson with a goalkeeper’s jersey with 100 printed on the back following last Saturday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/06/liverpool-brentford-premier-league-match-report">1-0 win over Brentford</a>, secured by Mohamed Salah’s 13th-minute goal. The gesture was in recognition of the 100th clean sheet of the Brazilian’s Liverpool career, although his manager had a point when joking that: “This is actually for 100 life-saving saves this season.” To which Alisson replied: “It might have been more.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/14/liverpool-alisson-header-special-clean-sheets-better-west-brom-leicester">Continue reading...</a>

They were sleeping over so they could cheer on the party, set to finish hours after the capital’s midnight curfew, together.</p><p>The hosting of the contest, which should have been in Ukraine, was relocated to Liverpool because of Russia’s war. The combination of time differences and curfews also made it difficult to celebrate in Ukraine. While a few bars in Kyiv hosted pre-Eurovision parties, closing at about 10pm local time as the contest began, and at least one local cafe launched a Eurovision doughnut, it was mostly an event to be marked at home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/14/there-was-so-much-yellow-and-blue-throwing-a-eurovision-viewing-party-in-kyiv">Continue reading...</a>

## On the hippy trail: founder Peter Simon on 50 years of Monsoon

It’s the place to go for beautiful clothes inspired by traditional Indian fabrics and prints. As Monsoon celebrates 50 years, its creator talks about the brand’s winning combination of joyous colours and bohemian styles<p>There is a colourful and sequined corner of every British woman’s wardrobe that is forever Monsoon. You’ve doubtless had a floaty blouse or two from them; perhaps a beaded bag. Surely it was the source of your sixth form leavers’ ball dress (heavily embellished, floor-length, right)? And if you say you’ve never run into an airport branch for a last-minute Monsoon swimsuit or sarong, no one will believe you.</p><p>Or perhaps you’re an OG; there back in 1973 when Peter Simon, founder of Monsoon (and Accessorize) and still its owner today, was selling Afghan-style coats so authentic they came with animal droppings. “I’d recently come back from being in a commune in Ibiza,” Simon recalls when we meet one afternoon at the Monsoon Accessorize headquarters in west London. In the style of the times, he’d previously dropped out of everything and travelled overland to Afghanistan. Now he was selling versions of that hippy favourite, the Afghan coat, on Portobello Road. “It was a version called the shoat – I made up the name – a cross between a sheep and a goat. And they were very authentic. I mean, they had bits of shit in the wool and when it rained you smelled like a sheepdog. Anyway, they were not commercial.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/may/14/on-the-hippy-trail-founder-peter-simon-on-50-years-of-monsoon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the daughter of immigrants, the home secretary’s hostility to migrants can seem not only cruel but unfathomable. With many talking of her as the next Tory leader, we ask those who know her best what makes her tick</p><p>The Tory party conference in Birmingham last October was a bizarre affair by any reckoning. Liz Truss’s leadership had already been self-torpedoed, her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, was just about to be thrown overboard, and there was a palpable need for someone to rally the troops.</p><p>The home secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/suella-braverman">Suella Braverman</a>, was a month into the job and hardly a household name. A diminutive figure with a bloodless style of delivery, she wasn’t an obvious candidate to raise spirits. Addressing the conference in a true blue dress against a royal blue backdrop, she didn’t exactly stand out, and her speech was a predictable mixture of foreign criminals and system-gaming lawyers that brought dutiful applause from the hall, rather than outright acclaim.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/14/the-face-of-cruel-britannia-who-is-the-real-suella-braverman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Stigmatising fat people is harmful to them and us. Do you really want to cut him off because of his weight – or is there fear beneath your anger?</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma</strong></em> <em>My father, who I’ve always had a tricky relationship with, has been obese since I was a teenager. He was very sporty as a younger man, but since his 40s he has increasingly gained weight. He is now in his 60s and obese. I feel some guilt about feeling like this, but I find it disgusting and I hate being around him, especially when food is present.</em></p><p><em>I feel angry with him for putting his health at risk and I feel ashamed to be descended from someone with no self-control or self-respect. My mother has never been overweight and deserves a better husband. I have never introduced a partner to my parents, </em><em>because I don’t want their opinion of me to be influenced by how my father is – one of my boyfriends at university once made negative comments about the issue and it really stuck with me. I know even if I marry that I’ll never have a family wedding because of this.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/14/my-father-is-obese-and-i-cant-stand-being-around-him-ask-philippa-perry">Continue reading...</a>
