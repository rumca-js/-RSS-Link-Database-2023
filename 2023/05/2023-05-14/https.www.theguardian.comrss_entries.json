I realise that the place has a sort of magic to it. It\u2019s like a creative wellspring. So many actors have come from there: Richard Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Michael Sheen. That sense of the Welsh bard, the lone beautiful speaker walking across the hillside \u2013 that really carries through to acting.

Sir Keir has sought to efface the Jeremy Corbyn years, but he can\u2019t rewrite the party\u2019s cataclysmically atrocious performance at the last election, which crushed the number of Labour MPs in the Commons to <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7529/CBP-7529.pdf\" title=\"\">its lowest tally</a> since 1935. Climbing a towering mountain from such a very low base presents a vertiginous challenge. To get to a parliamentary majority of just one, Labour must win 123 more seats than it did in 2019. Sir Keir would need a majority substantially better than one to sustain a reforming government through a full parliamentary term. Seat gains on that scale rarely happen.

In choosing what to ferment and/or age their wine in \u2013 stainless steel tank, oak barrel, clay amphora, concrete egg, glass demijohn \u2013 the winemaker is acting a little bit like a chef choosing whether to use a hob, a grill, an oven, or an open flame, and the differences can be no less pronounced. Winemakers are no less prone to fashion than their chef colleagues either, with the different materials falling in and out of favour depending on whichever aesthetic is currently in vogue. Lately, for example, there\u2019s been a surprising revival of a material that had for decades been beyond the pale, concrete, as used in wines such as Zuccardi\u2019s exquisitely lithe, subtly floral-herbal, pure-fruited malbec.</p><p><strong>Celler del Roure Cullerot, Valencia, Spain 2022 (\u00a315.50, <a href=\"http://nywines.co.uk/\">nywines.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://thefinewinecompany.co.uk/\">thefinewinecompany.co.uk</a>) </strong>The reason why so many winemakers, many of them producing some of the world\u2019s most in-demand fine wines in places such as Bordeaux, Napa or Piedmont, have taken to concrete is not because they like the vogueishly brutalist look of the tanks in their winery (although, it has to be said, there is something gorgeously tactile about the material, especially when it\u2019s been shaped, as many are these days, like an egg). What these winemakers like is the way concrete offers some of the properties of an oak barrel (like oak, it\u2019s porous, so it allows for the same, wine-softening effects that come from the interaction with small amounts of oxygen), without imparting any flavours of its own (as oak, especially young or highly toasted oak, will do). Other winemakers have gone back even further in time to a material with similar benefits to concrete that was used in the very first winemaking 6,000 years ago: clay, as in the Spanish tinajas used to age Celler del Roure\u2019s wonderfully citrus grove-scented dry white blend.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/14/david-williams-wines-of-the-week-the-importance-of-the-choice-of-vessel\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/14/david-williams-wines-of-the-week-the-importance-of-the-choice-of-vessel", "date_published": "2023-05-14 05:01:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The job of the Metropolitan police is to serve us | Letters", "description": "The force is becoming increasingly politicised.
