The stream had Boyan Ivanov and Brad Logston, both of developer Haemimont Games, talking about some of their favorite bits of Jagged Alliance 3&apos;s combat.</p><p>Your band of mercenaries trying to do their mercenary thing in the war-torn country of Grand Chien have a lot of interesting tactical options, it seems, very much in line with the games of the past. There&apos;s lots of granularity to mess around with, like stances, movement, and more. An early example is putting a bipod on your weapon so that it&apos;s more effective when you&apos;re prone. The video then goes on to talk about destructible terrain, weapon types, melee, and more.</p><p>We got a real look at Jagged Alliance 3 last month, with our Fraser Brown sitting down last month to mess around with an early build. He called it \"<a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/jagged-alliance-3-is-a-chaotic-action-movie-homage-where-all-of-your-plans-will-go-up-in-flames/\" target=\"_blank\">a chaotic action movie homage where all of your plans will go up in flames</a>.\"</p><p>\"Jagged Alliance 3 might be a dense, flexible tactics game where planning and precision are demanded, but it absolutely loves to throw those plans into disarray. Mines, a hidden enemy, a jammed gun, some foul weather or some misfortune courtesy of the gods of RNG ensure that you won&apos;t get too comfortable. You can play the same battle multiple times and have dramatically different experiences, even if your plan remains unchanged,\" he said.</p><p>If you&apos;re curious about what other Jagged Alliance-related stuff has happened recently, they&apos;ve also done a stream on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGJ_yLf-9YI\" target=\"_blank\">Character Development</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avXzz3--1bc\" target=\"_blank\">worldbuilding</a>.</p><p>You can find Jagged Alliance 3 on its <a href=\"https://www.jaggedalliance.com/\" target=\"_blank\">official website</a> and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1084160/Jagged_Alliance_3/\" target=\"_blank\">on Steam</a>. \u00a0It&apos;s listed as \"coming soon\" from developer Haemimont Games and publisher THQ Nordic.</p>\n                                                            </article>", "link": "https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-an-hour-of-discussion-on-jagged-alliance-3s-combat", "date_published": "2023-05-14 17:05:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://www.pcgamer.com/rss", "title": "Goths rejoice: partway through the 'Server Slam' Diablo 4's nerfed Necromancers got a little boost", "description": "Seeing the words \"Server Slam\" over and over is just making me think of the Denny's Grand Slam breakfast.", "link": "https://www.pcgamer.com/goths-rejoice-partway-through-the-server-slam-diablo-4s-nerfed-necromancers-got-a-little-boost", "date_published": "2023-05-14 15:38:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://www.pcgamer.com/rss", "title": "A Remedy dev modded native HDR into Control, along with a heap of other graphical improvements", "description": "The unofficial HDR ultrawide DLSS RT patch makes Control look even nicer.", "link": "https://www.pcgamer.com/a-remedy-dev-modded-native-hdr-into-control-along-with-a-heap-of-other-graphical-improvements", "date_published": "2023-05-14 05:25:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://www.pcgamer.com/rss", "title": "Today's Wordle hint and answer #694: Sunday, May 14", "description": "A hint to help you out and today's Wordle answer if you need it.", "link": "https://www.pcgamer.com/wordle-today-hint-answer-694-may-14", "date_published": "2023-05-14 04:07:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://www.pcgamer.com/rss", "title": "System Shock was the FPS that changed PC games forever", "description": "In this classic feature, Jim Rossignol looks back at the real reason BioShock exists.", "link": "https://www.pcgamer.com/system-shock-was-the-fps-that-changed-pc-games-forever", "date_published": "2023-05-14 03:54:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://www.pcgamer.com/rss", "title": "Check out the destructible terrain in this tactical combat game set on Mars", "description": "And try the demo, to boot.", "link": "https://www.pcgamer.com/check-out-the-destructible-terrain-in-this-tactical-combat-game-set-on-mars", "date_published": "2023-05-14 02:13:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://www.pcgamer.com/rss", "title": "Before Unreal or Gears of War, a young Cliff Bleszinski made a shareware game called The Palace of Deceit", "description": "We're rerunning Richard Cobbett's classic Crapshoot column, in which he rolled the dice and took a chance on obscure games\u2014both good and bad.", "link": "https://www.pcgamer.com/saturday-crapshoot-the-palace-of-deceit", "date_published": "2023-05-14 01:48:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "http://www.pcgamer.com/rss", "title": "Tim Cain reveals proposed sequels to Vampire \u2013 Bloodlines: 'We were planning a trilogy, which I forgot'", "description": "Bloodlines' original developers had plans to continue its story.", "link": "https://www.pcgamer.com/tim-cain-reveals-proposed-sequels-to-vampire-bloodlines-we-were-planning-a-trilogy-which-i-forgot", "date_published": "2023-05-14 01:41:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
