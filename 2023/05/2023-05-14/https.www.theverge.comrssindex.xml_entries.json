I said there was no way ChatGPT could believably mimic my writing style for a smartwatch review. I\u2019d already asked the bot to do that months ago, and the results were laughable. My spouse bet that they could ask ChatGPT the exact same thing but get a <em>much</em> better result. My problem, they said, was I didn\u2019t know the right queries to ask to get the answer I wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"9La6ml\">To my chagrin, they were right. ChatGPT wrote <em>much</em> better reviews <em>as me</em> when my spouse did the asking. </p>\n<p id=\"7fxBqh\">That memory flashed through my mind while <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23662125/google-io-2023-live-blog-updates-news\">Iiveblogging</a> Google I/O.

A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed.</p>\n<p id=\"4p6Cx7\">The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It\u2019s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years.
