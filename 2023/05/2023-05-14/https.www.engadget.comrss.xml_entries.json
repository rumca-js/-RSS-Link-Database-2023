[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple's 'M3 Pro' chipset could feature 12 CPU cores", "description": "<p>Apple is testing an M3 chipset with a 12-core processor and 18-core GPU, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-14/apple-m3-chip-mac-specifications-and-features-cpu-gpu-and-ram-increase-details-lhngxmx4?sref=10lNAhZ9\"><em><ins>Bloomberg\u2019s</ins></em><ins> Mark Gurman</ins></a>. In his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman reports a source sent him App Store developer logs that show the chip running on an unannounced MacBook Pro with macOS 14. He speculates the M3 variant Apple is testing is the base-level M3 Pro the company plans to release sometime next year.</p><p>Notably, the M3 line is expected to take advantage of TSMC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/intel-and-apple-expected-to-debut-3-nm-processors-next-year-100632556.html\"><ins>forthcoming 3nm node process</ins></a>. The move from 5nm to 3nm would appear to account for the increase in core density. If you recall, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-pro-m1-max-chips-macbook-pro-172415918.html\"><ins>M1 Pro</ins></a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-updates-its-mac-book-pros-with-m-2-pro-and-max-chips-143848558.html\"><ins>M2 Pro</ins></a> feature eight- and 10-core processors, alongside 14 and 16-core GPUs. Put another way, the M3 Pro reportedly features 50 percent more CPU cores than its first-generation predecessor. Per Gurman, Apple has gone with an even split between high-performance and efficiency cores on the new silicon. He says the chip was spotted configured with 36GB of RAM. For context, the M2 Pro starts with 16GB of memory, and you can upgrade it to feature up to 32GB of RAM.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Of course, before Apple announces the M3 Pro, the company first needs to release the standard M3 chip. \u201cMy belief is the first Macs with M3 chips will begin arriving toward the end of the year or early next year,\u201d Gurman notes. In the meantime, Apple is expected to announce its newest Mac, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/developer-logs-suggest-apples-long-rumored-15-inch-macbook-air-could-arrive-soon-154131810.html\"><ins>the long-rumored 15-inch MacBook Air</ins></a>, at WWDC 2023 next month.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-m3-pro-chipset-could-feature-12-cpu-cores-205959150.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-m3-pro-chipset-could-feature-12-cpu-cores-205959150.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-05-14 20:59:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Pixel users report the Google app is making their phones overheat", "description": "<p>If a Pixel phone is your daily driver, you may want to keep a charger nearby.

After two decades in power, Recep Tayyip Erdogan faces the most credible threat to his presidency in recent memory.

I was then. I still am, but the tide is going out. I\u2019m not back on land yet, but I know if I rest and I don\u2019t fight it, the land will find me. I don\u2019t need to find the land. Unlike SBF after CoinDesk\u2019s Ian Allison released his post about Alameda\u2019s balance sheet, I can see the shore from where I am.</p><p>In late November and early December SBF would not leave the public eye. He was in magazines. He was in the <em>New York Times</em>. He was doing interviews on YouTube. He was on Twitter Spaces.</p><p>YouTube gadfly Coffeezilla was chasing him.</p><p>NFT influencers were chasing him. TV reporters were chasing him.</p><p>A goofy token shill I will not dignify by naming chased him.</p><p>Everyone thought if they could just get one more interview from him, it would make sense.</p><p>They were all playing into Sam\u2019s hands. Many who felt betrayed believed that his media tour was working to his benefit, that he might actually get away with losing $8 billion (or was it $10 billion?) in customer money. They saw large media companies as complicit in helping to burnish his image.</p><p>But then he was arrested, and as I write this, he\u2019s sitting in the sick-bay of an overcrowded prison in the island nation his company had recently made his home.</p><p>Looking back on it, there is not a lot of value to say about all these many appearances. We were all just tea bags soaking in the flavors of a collective stew we had boiled up together, a swirling potion of shifting sadness, outrage, intrigue, schadenfreude, and mockery.</p><p>SBF appeared in many places, but to my mind, these were the key media appearances:</p><ul><li><p>Axios interview on Nov. 29. A few pieces were published with different parts of the interview. Where he first said he was down to $100,000.</p></li><li><p>The first recording from Tiffany Fong\u2019s phone call with SBF, released on YouTube Nov. 29.</p></li><li><p>The <em>New York Times </em>Dealbook Summit, Nov. 30.</p></li><li><p><em>Good Morning America</em>, Dec. 1.</p></li><li><p><em>New York Magazine </em>interview on its Intelligencer site, Dec. 1.</p></li><li><p><em>The Scoop </em>podcast, Dec. 5.</p></li></ul><p>There were others. People really like the grilling scam vigilante Coffeezilla gave him, too. Eventually, though, listening to these things was like watching one of those YouTube videos of skateboarding accidents: it was a lot of the same thing over and over.</p><p>He was sorry, there was an accounting artifact, he should have had better risk management, he shouldn\u2019t have given up his company, etc., etc., etc.</p><p>Were anyone to go through the above accounts and more from that month in a two-day marathon session like I did, I think they would eventually discern a strategy. What appeared to be a series of open conversations had become, to my ears, talking points.</p><p>I wrote the same for Axios at the time, but I don\u2019t actually think the talking points are all that interesting anymore now that he\u2019s been arrested. At the end of December 2022, he would be back in his family home, under house arrest, his passport taken, and wearing an ankle monitor. Once those handcuffs went on, the public relations campaign became irrelevant because it was something designed to prepare himself if his lawyers succeeded in keeping him out of jail.</p><p>As I wrote in the beginning, as new facts and circumstances arise, the set of possible explanations and futures shrink. Before the handcuffs, it seemed almost likely he might get away with the company\u2019s failure. Once he went to jail, it\u2019s hard to imagine how we ever even saw that possibility.</p><p>Because they failed to keep him out of jail, the talking points matter very little.</p><p>Except one point, which I think is worth highlighting.The fact that Alameda was drawing customer funds from FTX to cover losses on investments hasn\u2019t been verified by a court yet, but it has been alleged in multiple accounts by different government organizations who seem to have had a look at the books.</p><p>That cash (in cryptocurrency form) had moved from FTX to Alameda to meet margin calls, make loans, make investments, and even to make political donations. This is, in my estimation, considerably more nefarious than the way SBF described the hole\u2019s origins in his media tour.</p><p>In all of his appearances, he described Alameda as having an excessive <em>margin </em>position. For example, in <em>New York Mag</em>, he said:</p><blockquote><p>A client on FTX put on a very large margin position. FTX fucked up in allowing that position to be put on and in underestimating, in fact, the size of the position itself.That margin position blew out during the extreme events over the last few weeks. I feel really bad about that. And it was a large fuckup of risk analysis and risk attention and, you know, it was with an account that was given too much trust, and not enough skepticism.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, FTX let Alameda\u2019s bets <em>on FTX </em>get too big.We were to imagine Alameda was, <em>I don\u2019t know, </em>12X long $500 million on bitcoin and 20X long $200 million in ether or something.</p><p>All secured by the ftt token. And ftt went bad, and now they were out a bunch of money.</p><p>When FTX first fell apart, I went into Slack and explained my understanding of the whole debacle to one of my coworkers this way:</p><p>Step 1.</p><p>Launch a trading desk. Make piles.</p><p>Step 2.</p><p>Decide you want to make more piles, so open an exchange that prints money off retail trades and use that money to lend to trading desk.</p><p>Step 3.</p><p>Lend retail money to trading desk in hopes of quadrupling all gains.</p><p>Step 4.</p><p>Trading desk loses borrowed money.</p><p>Step 5.</p><p>[Surprised face emoji]</p><p>But SBF was trying to spin it as if it had all stayed inside the house. It was just big bets, but funds hadn\u2019t left FTX.This is still bad, but more negligent, less outright theft.</p><p>Jason Choi had been with Spartan Capital when FTX was raising money, and he\u2019d declined to invest because he didn\u2019t like the Alameda/ FTX relationship. He explained all this on Twitter after the exchange collapsed.We spoke before complaints had been made against SBF, and I asked him whether he thought it mattered if Alameda had an outsized margin position or had taken customer funds out of the exchange.</p><p>\u201cI think functionally they are the same,\u201d he said. \u201cIt implies that Alameda is able to run things into seriously negative positions.\u201d</p><p>In other words, in terms of what people have lost, each outcome arrives at the same place.</p><p>But it does matter in terms of how to understand the decisions made. If funds were taken out and handed to Alameda to use elsewhere, people had to green-light those moves, knowing that they were against the terms of service and against the many assurances that the company had made to the public and their users.</p><p>It\u2019s not negligent. It\u2019s willful. Legality aside, it just feels different ethically.</p><p>However, for what it\u2019s worth, when SBF and I last spoke he stuck by this explanation: the hole in FTX\u2019s balance sheet was from a margin position Alameda took out. It had failed to adequately hedge, and it had gotten much too long on the wrong collateral.</p><p>Before he was arrested, that\u2019s how he described the problem. That\u2019s still how he describes it. He agreed, when we spoke, that it would be different if FTX had been sending actual customer assets to Alameda to use in other ways, but he says that wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>The government is claiming that it did happen, and to do so it\u2019s drawing attention to loans made to SBF and other cofounders, loans they used to make venture investments, to buy stock in Robinhood, political donations, and to purchase real estate.</p><p>This points to a part of the story that I didn\u2019t really understand until the complaints started coming out.</p><p>When it\u2019s said that someone is a \u201cbillionaire,\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean that they have billions of dollars <em>in cash</em>. It doesn\u2019t mean, necessarily, that they can even spend that much money.That doesn\u2019t even mean that they <em>can </em>access billions of dollars in cash, or even many millions.</p><p>If someone\u2019s billionaire status is tied up in a stake in a private company, it can be very difficult to turn that value into spendable money. If their status is tied up largely in thinly traded, extremely new crypto tokens, it might be even harder.</p><p>In the complaints by the SEC and the CFTC and the DoJ, they allege loans from the Samglomerate, using customer funds, to enable investments, property purchases, political donations, and more. All of these things take actual cash. SBF and his cadre had very high net worth, but it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that they wouldn\u2019t really have access to that much cash until those complaints came out.</p><p>Of course SBF, Wang, Singh, and others could borrow money somewhere, and maybe more sophisticated readers than me presumed it was borrowed from banks. Or maybe it was borrowed from some of the new crypto lenders (many of which fell into dire straits). But these various agencies allege something else: the funds were borrowed from FTX customers. And the customers didn\u2019t know. Further, they had no upside. Only downside.</p><p>And the downside is here now.</p><p>\u201cI thought at the time and still do think that, the size of those loans was substantially less than the profit, than like the liquid trading profit that Alameda had made,\u201d he told me in December. In other words, he denies that the loans were made using FTX user funds.</p><p>The whole story of what happened is confusing and dripping in finance jargon and involves a level of mathematics few of us have contemplated recently. It may be that SBF\u2019s story here has been a bet that he was smart enough to cast a spell and convince us all that all the mistakes were only made inside the casino.</p><p>And if he had done that well enough, the sting of the error might fade, and if he evaded an arrest and conviction, he might be able to rehabilitate himself in the public eye and apply his considerable gifts, once again.</p><p>He might still have won, but then he was arrested.</p><p>So in that case, these appearances might really have just been about enjoying that last moment in the spotlight. For some, it\u2019s better to be hated than ignored. But it\u2019s also worth noting that he hasn\u2019t given up on this story.</p><p>As I wrote in the prologue: he doesn\u2019t believe the evidence of crimes is there. He seems as eager to reopen the books at FTX and Alameda. He wants everyone to get from 20 percent of the story to 80 or 90 percent. And maybe we will. And maybe the fact that he seems to want that as much as anyone will prove to be a sign that he was right.</p><p>But trust me, if you haven\u2019t seen the many media appearances of November and December 2022, you don\u2019t need to. This chapter gives more than you need to know about what he had to say before they put him in a Bahamas jail.</p><p><strong>Sources Referenced</strong></p><p>\u201cExclusive: Sam Bankman-Fried says he\u2019s down to $100,000,\u201d Shen, Lucinda, Axios, Nov. 29, 2022.</p><p>\u201cSam Bankman-Fried Interviewed Live About the Collapse of FTX,\u201d <em>New York Times Events</em>,YouTube, Nov. 30, 2022.</p><p>\u201cFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried denies \u2018improper use\u2019 of customer funds,\u201d Stephanopoulos, George, <em>Good Morning America</em>, Dec. 1, 2022.</p><p>\u201cSam Bankman-Fried\u2019s First Interview After FTX Collapse,\u201d Fong, Tiffany,</p><p>YouTube, posted Nov. 29, 2022</p><p>\u201cWhat Does Sam Bankman-Fried Have to Say for Himself?
