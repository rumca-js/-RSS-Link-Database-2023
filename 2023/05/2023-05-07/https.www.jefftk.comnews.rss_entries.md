Violins are a bit of a strange design.  Classically you hold them up
by pinching them between your chin and shoulder (restricting head
motion), though in more casual contexts people sometimes use their
left arm (restricting hand motion).  Neither of these are great!  Why
can't the violin stay up on its own?

<p>

It can!  People have made all sorts of straps, ribs, and
counterweights for violins.  Some examples:

I wanted something similar for my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroh_violin">Stroh violin</a>,
and played around a bit.  After trying a few things I ended up with a
truly silly counterweight design:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

Probably one of the other designs would have worked better, but this
does have the advantage of a long lever.  Those are literal rocks
taped to the end.

</p>

<p>

I still probably won't play my Stroh very much, but I'm now much less
likely to hurt myself when I do.
