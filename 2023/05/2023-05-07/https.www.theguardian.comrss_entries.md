<p><strong>Windsor Castle<br /></strong>With all respect to Olly Murs and Nicole Scherzinger, true star power was lacking at this well-performed celebration for King Charles III – drones and Muppets were the highlights instead<br /></p><p>On Thursday night, Channel 4 News interviewed Jerub, the Nottingham-based singer tapped to perform with Pete Tong’s Ibiza Classics Orchestra at the Coronation Concert. It wasn’t entirely clear if presenter Matt Frei intended to strike a note of bathos in his introduction, but it certainly turned out that way. The 24-year-old was currently largely unknown, he explained to viewers, but on Sunday, all that would change: Jerub would be performing on the same hallowed stage as huge stars, including Olly Murs.</p><p>Here was more evidence that things hadn’t panned out quite as expected for the Coronation Concert: with the greatest of respect to Olly Murs – who seems like a thoroughly decent bloke and has managed to spin out his career far longer than your average X Factor runner-up – if his is the name you’re reaching for to underline the world-shaking star power assembled for a concert to celebrate King Charles III’s ascension to the throne, then said concert is in a spot of bother.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/07/coronation-concert-review-a-cobbled-together-bunch-of-b-listers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The home of the Beatles prepares itself for the song contest – an act of musical solidarity with Ukraine</p><p>After an extraordinary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/28/festival-celebrates-spirit-of-eurovision-liverpool-ukraine" title="">six-month</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/28/festival-celebrates-spirit-of-eurovision-liverpool-ukraine" title="">commissioning spree</a>, the city of Liverpool is opening its heart to a Eurovision song contest unlike any other. It was clear from the beginning that this would not simply be about one venue and <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3431/eurovision-song-contest/#topicOverview" title="">180 million television viewers</a>, but would draw the docks and streets of this maritime city into an extended party that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/27/a-thong-for-europe-review-royal-court-liverpool-eurovision" title="">would continue</a> for weeks.</p><p>With only days to go before the grand final on 13 May, one memorable image is already bobbing about in the Royal Albert Dock: a 10-metre globe printed with images of the Earth taken from space by Nasa.

This is a reference to the protection of historic monuments in Ukraine which, as the contest’s previous winner, would itself be hosting the celebration were it not currently under bombardment and occupation.

<p>Britain needs magic and ritual, but for many, the coronation was an empty conjuring trick</p><p>In 1953, an average of seven people, not including children, huddled around each TV set – many of them <a href="https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co34519/ekco-tmb272-portable-9-inch-television-radio-receiver-c-1956-television-receiver">9-inch Ekcovisions</a> – to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=coronation+1953&amp;sxsrf=APwXEdeFDyFjsR7nQX5_ifV8ML5izx2DKA:1683446708063&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=vid&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZ6qDY3-L-AhXKUqQEHV2SBZgQ_AUoA3oECAEQBQ&amp;biw=1404&amp;bih=520&amp;dpr=2#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:9dd7f203,vid:52NTjasbmgw">watch the coronation</a> of Queen Elizabeth II. The experience was like seeing “ermine-draped ectoplasm floating about at a rather bizarre seance”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/14/britain-fifties-book-review-whitehorn">recalled</a> the journalist Ann Leslie. For colour and scale, viewers had to wait for the edited documentary film version, A Queen is Crowned, with its Shakespearean script by Christopher Fry narrated by Laurence Olivier – a combination that cleverly infused the modern royal spectacle with memories of Olivier’s wartime Henry V. But even then, there was no intimacy: the palace had forbidden close-ups. Elizabeth’s coronation was the first to be visible to most of her subjects. But it was seen at a respectful distance.</p><p>Seventy years later and, for the coronation of King Charles and Queen Camilla, that kindly ectoplasmic mist had burnt off into a merciless HD glare. The king – who, draped in his ermine, resembled nothing so much as an old lady in a bed jacket – wore his nerves as a mask of dread verging on misery. As he walked the great length of the Westminster Abbey church, one could see his fingers reaching for the knot of the tassel beneath his robe, repeatedly rubbing it, as if for reassurance. The unblinking camera’s eye also revealed the person who emerged as the unexpected star of the ceremony: the MP Penny Mordaunt, magnificently accoutred, her face a model of serene solemnity, as she held aloft the jewelled sword of offering. The first woman to do the job, in her guise as president of the privy council, she put one in mind of what was once said of Ginger Rogers: that she did everything that Fred Astaire did, but backwards and in heels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/07/modern-audience-the-drama-of-monarchy-coronation">Continue reading...</a>

Singer, songwriter and superb backing vocalist who worked with David Bowie, Rod Stewart and Joan Armatrading<p>Linda Lewis, who has died aged 72, was a soul singer with an exceptional voice whose solo career encompassed more than a dozen albums and four UK Top 40 hit singles.

On coronation weekend, what ensues is two parts standup show to one part crowning of the local girl done good, now returned with an armful of humblebrag tales of hobnobbing with royalty and buying extortionate footwear. What makes it fun is the palpable audience connection, and the expressivity and command our host brings to not always exceptional material.</p><p>That expressive flair is on display early, when Love begins her life story with an act-out depicting the clapped-out coming together of her ageing parents’ egg and sperm.

## Celtic are Premiership champions for 53rd time after beating 10-man Hearts

<p>For 43 minutes, this was not at all going to Celtic’s script. With victory over Hearts needed to secure a successful defence of the Scottish Premiership, Ange Postecoglou’s team were rocking in a manner rarely witnessed on the domestic scene. What was to follow should really have been obvious, even if the whiff of controversy was attached to it.</p><p>The Edinburgh club’s buoyancy was duly and effectively ended by the dismissal of Alex Cochrane. The prospect of Celtic heading to Ibrox next Saturday looking to claim the flag also basically ended as Cochrane headed for the dressing room. Kyogo Furuhashi, who has a useful habit of scoring against Hearts, flicked home the goal that had looked inevitable midway through the second half. Oh Hyeon-gyu converted an Aaron Mooy cross to add gloss to Celtic’s victory. They are the champions of Scotland once more; an outcome no observer can reasonably argue with.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/07/celtic-scottish-premiership-title-champions-hearts-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

What started as a single family project in Ghent soon blossomed into homes for 10 families<p>On her first visit, 15 years ago, to the abandoned school complex that was to become her family home, Veva van Sloun was in for a surprise. Located in a busy area of Ghent, the old school was shielded from the main street by bamboo planting. Beyond white gate she discovered it had a hidden courtyard garden, not to mention its own chapel. The site was much bigger than she anticipated. “It was so dilapidated that when I leant against the wall some of the bricks crumbled and fell off,” she recalls.</p><p>Undeterred, she decided to take on the renovation. The chapel had been extended to house the school kitchen and gymnasium. These elements were removed to restore the chapel as a separate entity, giving van Sloun, her husband, Jan, and their children more space. “We had to take off the roof and rebuild it brick by brick because it was in a horrible condition,” she says. “I didn’t know enough about what I was getting into when I bought it – especially the costs of modernisation.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/07/how-a-school-renovation-in-belgium-tunred-into-a-top-class-co-built-community">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Soloist Nicola Benedetti has added her voice to those speaking up for a genre now facing severe financial constraints</p><p>There is no piece of classical music quite as sentimental about orchestras as Haydn’s Farewell Symphony. One by one, as the last movement closes, the musicians walk off the stage, eventually leaving just two violinists to carry the notes of the final adagio. At the 1772 premier of the work in Hungary, each player poignantly paused to snuff out the candle that lit up their sheet music.</p><p>The composer’s original aim was to emphasise the fact that his tired musicians badly wanted a rest after a long season performing at Prince Esterházy’s castle. But today this famous ritual of departing orchestra members has fresh potency.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/07/nicola-benedetti-battle-to-save-classical-music-from-funding-cuts">Continue reading...</a>

## Are you a mosquito magnet? Help may be at hand

<p>From repellants to app-based mosquito monitoring and a new malaria vaccine, researchers are making important breakthroughs in the fight against the biting insects</p><p>The earliest signs of summer herald my annual metamorphosis – from woman to lifesize pincushion. Whether at home or abroad, when mosquitoes begin their hunt for blood I am reminded, via a blanket of red blotches that have more than once swelled to the size of a golf ball, that mine is a godlike nectar. On a single day last December, a tropical Christmas trip quickly became a less-than-festive scratchathon after a glut of bites arrived, following which I was stung by jellyfish, then wasps. At this point, I can only assume the mosquitoes are giving other species ideas.</p><p>But there are signs that a solution for the 20% of the population who receive above-average numbers of bites may soon be at hand. Earlier this month, researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI) developed a new repellant capable of reducing the number of mosquitoes feeding by 80%. Applying a thin coating made from naturally occurring cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), a renewable raw material found in the likes of cotton and wood, and indole, an organic compound with an unpleasant odour, to skin served as “chemical camouflage”, said <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37056470/">the study published in </a><em><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37056470/">PNAS Nexus</a></em>. This combination – which derails the cues that mosquitoes use to select their victims – is “unprecedented”, according to Jonathan Bohbot, a senior lecturer at HUJI and one of the paper’s co-authors. Indeed, the results are considered so promising that further human studies are planned, with a view to having the coating approved by regulators ahead of commercial use. “The CNC-repellant combination will have a longer efficacy and range of action than other products currently available on the market,” says Bohbot, adding that they expect “high levels of product adoption” if and when it does hit shelves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/07/mosquitoes-repellant-bite-summer-science-medical-research">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Some claim it is the most important meal of the day, while others believe fasting has its benefits. What does the science say?</p><p>On some level, it sort of makes sense that breakfast should have a place in the food hierarchy that other meals don’t. The clue’s in the name: you are literally “breaking” your “fast” – taking your body from a state of deprivation to its first significant calorie hit.</p><p>But the idea of breakfast being the most important meal of the day really only developed around the same time that <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/32042/corn-flakes-were-invented-part-anti-masturbation-crusade">John Harvey Kellogg was touting cornflakes</a> as an alternative to moral impurity – with the suggestion that meat and heavily seasoned foods inflamed sinful urges.

<p><strong>Soho theatre, London</strong> <br />Torn between wifely duty and her dream to become the Jewish Barbra Streisand, this would-be star finds an in-between world of outrageous comedy</p><p>A teenage winner of Borehamwood’s Got Talent, Candy Gigi’s dreams of entertainment stardom have foundered: “The only role I’ve ever had is dried-up Jewish wife.” That’s the starting point for the outre almost-solo musical Friday Night Sinner!, which finds Gigi (or her fictional alter ego) on a crazed last bid for glory – to become, in her words, “the Jewish Barbra Streisand”. It’s not subtle, but as a showcase for Gigi’s bouffon talent and brass neck, and as a gleefully no-holds-barred hour of bad-taste comedy, it abundantly delivers.</p><p>She’s licking audience members’ faces within minutes of lights-up: this isn’t a show that respects boundaries. Whether dialoguing with her subconscious, represented by a giant puppet vulva, preparing the Shabbat meal, or wretching at the sight of her husband David (Jordan Paul Clarke, taciturn on piano), Gigi gives us a ravening will-to-fame warring with a religious culture that requires her to post her knickers monthly to the local rabbi. That asks her, in her mother’s words, to “learn to be happy being unhappy”. Sack off baby-making with dull David in a bid for showbiz glory? That would be, says mum, to “finish off what Hitler started”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/07/candy-gigi-friday-night-sinner-review-soho-theatre">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Handel to a dozen new commissions, the king selected a fitting soundtrack for the event</p><p>Perhaps fantasising about your coronation is as standard for future monarchs as imagining your wedding for lesser mortals. If so, Charles III had plenty of time to think it through. His choice to enter Westminster Abbey to the rousing choral explosion of Hubert Parry’s anthem I Was Glad, composed for Edward VII’s big day in 1902, certainly suggests a man keen to make an entrance.</p><p>From the intricate choreography to the glittering array of monarch-making accoutrements – ring, glove, orb, sceptre – symbolism was also going to take centre stage. It’s why Charles’s involvement in selecting the music has attracted attention, and why <a href="https://www.royal.uk/news-and-activity/2023-05-06/the-coronation-service-order-of-service">there was so much of it</a>.

<p>If you feel stuck, a trip can put you back in touch with your sense of adventure</p><p>On family holidays, my father transformed himself. Perhaps it was the sunny climate, the change of scene or simply the long-awaited break from work, but almost as soon as the plane landed on the runway, his ordinarily reserved personality was discarded like a winter coat. He became sociable and gregarious. There was a lightness about him as he chatted to strangers on the beach, inviting them to join us for dinner, where he’d entertain them with an endless repertoire of stories and jokes. Two weeks later, clutching a bottle of ouzo as we landed in Heathrow, perhaps he hoped this version of himself might travel home with him. But as he got back to normal life and a busy hospital job, the unopened ouzo was soon pushed to the back of the cupboard to gather dust.</p><p>When I left my job as a psychologist and went on a round-the-world trip in search of adventures after a difficult time in my life, maybe I, too, was hoping to become a new person – or, like my father, a different version of myself. I was soon disappointed. It was nerve-racking to land in a strange place and know nobody. Away from the routines of life, the identity of my job and the security of my network of friends and family, I felt lonely and untethered. And, to my horror, despite visiting eye-wateringly beautiful places, I still felt miserable. Somehow, in the flurry of packing for the trip, I’d forgotten that the thing you don’t choose to bring, but can’t leave behind, is yourself. I felt a very long way from home. I missed my friends. What was I thinking?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/07/a-holiday-is-more-than-a-break-a-chance-to-dip-a-toe-into-a-new-version-of-yourself">Continue reading...</a>

## We British are rubbish at bank holidays. Let’s take some tips from the French – or even the Belgians | Emma Beddington

<p>Forget all thoughts of DIY or catching up on laundry – this is a time to sit outside a cafe, looking down your nose at passersby</p><p>This bonus bank holiday is worrying me. We’re not used to this many days off – will we cope? Using Christmas as a precedent, I predict fights in shop queues, a spike in divorce requests, dangerous swims in our sewagey seas and A&amp;Es rammed with sporting and DIY casualties. I don’t know if it’s a Protestant work ethic thing, but British bank holidays feel terribly frenetic. We shouldn’t be overdoing it like that at the moment – we don’t have the resources. The country has all the structural and emotional integrity of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/17/king-charles-camilla-coronation-quiche-signature-dish" title="">coronation quiche</a> left out in the rain.</p><p>We need to chill, radically. Why not take inspiration from places such as my previous homes, France and Belgium, where this month is a blur of bank holidays? The first day of May is sacrosanct: on my first ever French one, my husband explained to me reverently it was the only day McDonald’s closed. France also takes Armistice Day on 8 May off and then Ascension falls on a mystery Thursday (Jesus apparently returned to heaven on a Thursday, FYI). The real miracle of that one is you can do the “<em>pont</em>” (bridge) – and not bother to go back to work on the Friday. Pentecost Monday is another holiday, celebrating the arrival of the Holy Spirit (yes, even in France where church and state were legally separated in 1905). When I worked in Belgium, corporate life was additionally complicated – enhanced! – by Schuman or Europe Day, celebrating the declaration that led to the formation of the EU on 9 May. It was never clear which of the European institutions might or might not be working (“not” was usually a better bet).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/07/we-british-are-rubbish-at-bank-holidays-lets-take-some-tips-from-the-french-or-even-the-belgians">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ben Smith was BuzzFeed’s editor-in-chief when it was at its peak. He explains how the groundbreaking site and its rivals changed the media – and sowed the seeds for their own demise</p><p>In any technological advance there is a golden age in which, for pioneers and believers, remaking the world seems within their grasp. For social media, that moment was just over 20 years ago, when to digital evangelists it felt like a new generation of “citizen journalists” – bloggers – might create a connected utopia of transparency, sweeping away those crusty media “gatekeepers” who had – the theory went – so long kept us all in the dark. This imagined paradise was a place in which no one had yet heard of cat memes and dick pics and Andrew Tate; where anti-vaxxers and anonymous “patriots” still just wrote furious letters to editors in green ink in their bedsits; where likes and follows and trolls and gifs and pile-ons were not yet the stuff of life.</p><p>Ben Smith was in his mid-20s when the first wave of that revolution was breaking – “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive, But to be young was very heaven!” – making his way as a political journalist in Washington and feeling the media landscape shift beneath his feet. Having been political blogger at the website Politico in the early days of that turmoil, he launched the newsroom of BuzzFeed in 2011 and established it as a credible and groundbreaking source of internet-only news, before leaving in 2020 to take up a role as media columnist of the <em>New York Times</em>. In April, having gone through successive waves of cuts and redundancies, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/20/buzzfeed-news-close-layoffs-shutting-down">BuzzFeed finally shut down its news operation</a>.

<p>A drubbing at the polls for the Conservatives and a pompous and entitled coronation shows how out of touch the old order is</p><p>The ardent crowds gathered in the London drizzle presumably got exactly what they had come for, but among the coronation’s garish costumes, impenetrable rituals and perfectly timed salutes and processions, there lurked an unavoidable sense of anticlimax. There he was, hanging on to his orb and sceptre: a very familiar, remarkably glum-looking 74-year-old man, sitting atop a very damaged institution, honoured with a ceremony based on a national religion that no one really follows any more, in a country whose collective mood is not exactly cheerful.</p><p>No one needs any reminders of why this is: living costs remain impossible, more strikes loom and the cliche of a country where nothing works perpetually rings true. It is easy to think of the UK – or, more specifically, England – as somewhere that is simply stuck. In that context, as royal rituals always do, the coronation spectacularly served its purpose, presenting nostalgia, continuity and deference as virtues rather than vices.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/07/tories-royals-natural-rulers-out-of-touch">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>National Gallery, London</strong><br />Cheerful, selfless Saint Francis is forcefully present in this enthralling show of art and imagery from the Renaissance to the present inspired by the muse, mystic and social radical</p><p>Lark song, white butterflies, moonrise, foals: this is what the artist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/richard-long">Richard Long</a> saw on his pilgrimage through Umbria in the footsteps of Saint Francis. His shining phrases radiate across the gallery wall in the shape of the glowing sun Francis saw as his sister. They record not only eight days of seeing through the saint’s eyes, but the character of the man himself: his love of starry nights, of watching the Earth turn, loving his fellow beings, feeling the breeze shiver through Italian trees. It is the perfect start to this show.</p><p>And Francis is the perfect saint, for art as for his fellow beings. Born filthy rich in Assisi c 1181, he gives it all up to look after others. He talks to the animals, loves sparrows, wolves and people with leprosy, writes paeans to Brother Moon and Sister Sun, restores churches (and quite possibly the church itself) while roving Italy as an itinerant preacher. He travels all the way to Egypt to meet a sultan, and more than once to visit the pope; both are charmed and he is permitted to found a new order.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/07/saint-francis-of-assisi-national-gallery-london-review-a-saint-for-all-seasons">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Netflix’s The Crown to a play in the West End, what has the character of Charles taught us about entitlement and radicalism?</p><p>There are many good reasons Shakespeare was drawn to write about kings. A dramatist is always looking to combine the personal and the political, the intimate with the epic. And a king, with a literal body politic, does this innately.</p><p>Every moment of psychology, or flicker of fallibility, has implications for the country and, in return, the mood and politics of the country are reflected in the monarch’s anxieties. The currency is power and influence, symbolism and high stakes are everywhere you look, and yet the action remains grounded in the singular human being there on stage. There is pageantry, betrayals, births and tragic deaths. Playwrights are often seeking “great reckonings in little rooms” and with a monarch as your central character, this is all but guaranteed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/07/my-play-king-charles-iii-was-written-as-a-tragedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Curve, Leicester</strong> <br />The US dancer conjures a potent spectacle filled with mysterious symbolism as three figures strain, combine and detach in stirring, almost ritual patterns</p><p>There’s a strange and sometimes sublime contradiction at the heart of Black Hole by American dance artist <a href="https://shamelpitts.com/">Shamel Pitts</a>, the closing event of Leicester’s <a href="https://www.serendipity-uk.com/events/welcome-to-lets-dance-international-frontiers-2023/">Let’s Dance International Frontiers</a> festival. On the one hand, its means are very spare: three performers, one plastic sheet, light, sound, and sparse dancing that often feels closer to animated imagery than choreographed action. On the other hand, it taps a world that is dense with hope and history – the stylish, speculative and symbol-saturated world of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/24/space-is-the-place-flying-lotus-janelle-monae-afrofuturism">Afrofuturism</a>: think graphic-novel figures, cosmic consciousness, ancestral mysticism and astral quests; think gods, machines, icons and aliens. The result is both fascinating and fragile, sometimes magnificent and sometimes meagre, where a special effect can suddenly feel like psychic lightning – and then revert.</p><p>In the first section, subtitled Trilogy, the dancers (Pitts, Marcella Lewis and Tushrik Fredericks) are birthed from beneath a glistening black sheet, bodies painted as if made of molten gold. At first floorbound and in close contact, then slowly rising and separating to sculptural crouched, standing and running poses (shades of Grace Jones’s iconic <a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/how-grace-jones-created-the-cover-for-island-life/">Island Life</a> album cover), they seem less like humans than a single triploid entity, heliotropically drawn to a distant light that glows upon their blank, wide-eyed faces. A stirring beat activates them – fists pump upwards – before they mysteriously retreat back under that black birthing blanket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/07/shamel-pitts-black-hole-review-dance-curve-leicester">Continue reading...</a>

I don’t think so.”</p><p>The west must be prepared for an outcome in the war short of all-out victory. “I think we should do anything at what is at our disposal to encourage Ukrainians and to support them to be successful.

<p>The winner of this year’s royal gold medal for architecture has gone from designing corporate buildings to self-build shelters. She talks about shedding her ego, and empowering people to rebuild in the climate emergency</p><p>“We are on the verge of scaling up,” says the architect Yasmeen Lari. “I need to achieve my target of one million in two years, starting this month.” One million homes, that is, to replace those lost in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2022/oct/13/pakistan-floods-in-pictures-gideon-mendel-sindh-province-drowning-world">last year’s floods</a> in her home country of Pakistan, one of the costliest natural disasters ever. This target sounds fantastical, but then Lari’s achievements to date are already exceptional and unexpected. The first woman to register as an architect in Pakistan, she made a successful career as a designer of office blocks and hotels, which she ended when she ceased to find it interesting. She then built another career documenting and preserving the country’s heritage, and then another helping the survivors of natural disasters to rebuild their homes.</p><p>Lari’s work has won her, at the age of 82, the 2023 <a href="https://www.architecture.com/awards-and-competitions-landing-page/awards/royal-gold-medal/Royal-Gold-Medal-2023">royal gold medal for architecture</a>, a 175-year-old award given annually by the British monarch on the advice of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

The unexpected flinging-of-nail moment that had sworn so many people before me off press-ons; the date equivalent of Janet Jackson’s Super Bowl nip slip. My nail bed was a sorry sight: short and scuffed next to pristine, almond-shaped French tips. I’d quite literally been exposed. My false nails had been a safety blanket for my hands.

<p>The secret of a tailor’s homosexuality is woven into his married life in Maryam Touzani’s gently observed drama</p><p>Halim (Saleh Bakri) is more than a tailor. At the traditional shop in a Moroccan medina that he runs with his ailing wife Mina (Lubna Azabal), he works lovingly and painstakingly, hand-embroidering silks so exquisitely fine they are like wearing air. And in a way, this delicate, precise, time-consuming approach is mirrored in director Maryam Touzani’s film-making, with its focus on tiny details, the fleeting glance, an almost imperceptible brush of skin against skin. It’s a gentle piece of Arabic-language storytelling, one that softly, slowly enfolds the audience rather than propels them on a journey.</p><p>Halim, with his sad eyes and melodic, minor-key voice, loves his wife deeply, but the couple live with the secret of his homosexuality – something Mina has come to accept but that still generates an occasional stab of jealousy in her. When a new apprentice, Youssef (Ayoub Missioui), joins them, she is aware of the attraction between the two men; there is a sharp edge to her manner when she talks to Youssef. But the dynamic between the three subtly shifts over time.

## Breathe review – Sadiq Khan’s climate emergency manifesto is a breath of fresh air

<p>Sparked by his own struggle with asthma, the London mayor’s memoir-cum-climate action guide is a refreshing antidote to the politics of cynicism and division</p><p>Sadiq Khan’s first book is ostensibly structured as a self-help title in the vein of, say, Stephen Covey’s <em>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>. It tackles his commitment to “effective climate action” and presents obstacles – fatalism, apathy, cynicism, deprioritisation, hostility, cost and gridlock – and then addresses how to overcome them. But it is also a memoir in which each one of the seven chapters concerns a new episode in the story of Khan’s political career, framed around the personal awakening that took place in the aftermath of his 2015 selection as Labour’s candidate for London mayor.</p><p>Aged 43, he was unexpectedly diagnosed with asthma, which his GP explains has become an increasingly common consequence of poor air quality in the city. He is further inspired by the campaigning of activist Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, whose daughter, <a href="https://ellaroberta.org/about-ella">Ella</a>, died of asthma aged nine in 2013 because of exposure to south-east London’s toxic air. He recognises connections between air pollution, global heating, public health and racial inequality. Then, in 2016, when he is challenged – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/top-conservatives-condemn-zac-goldsmiths-disgusting-mayoral-campaign">in a campaign seen by many as explicitly racist</a> – by the Conservative party’s environmental champion, Zac Goldsmith, he comes out on top and an alternative approach to environmental action starts to form that aligns itself with the principles of social justice. This informs Khan’s approach to cleaning London’s air, protecting the city’s most vulnerable communities from the worst carbon emissions and ordinary Londoners from the harshest economic costs of change.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/07/breathe-review-sadiq-khans-climate-emergency-manifesto-is-a-breath-of-fresh-air">Continue reading...</a>

The places where people could once meet up and make friends have been savaged by austerity<p>On a Sunday, if there were no family visitors, my late, independently minded mother, in her 80s, would get on a bus to stave off that creeping sense of depressing isolation, particularly associated with weekends, bank holidays and special occasions, a time when everyone else appears to be happily bonded in the company of others.</p><p>On the bus, for an hour or so, going wherever it took her, she would meet others similar in age to herself to pass the time of day, exchange neutral comments on the weather, <em>EastEnders</em> and the cost of a perm, and return home, cheerier, topped up by a little human connection. A lifelong royalist, what my mother would never have done is accept the sovereign’s invitation to this weekend’s Big Lunch or tomorrow’s single day of volunteering, <a href="https://thebighelpout.org.uk/" title="">The Big Help Out</a>. A lot of people aren’t built that way. Nor are they of an age that makes it acceptable to use free transport to chat to strangers.

## From tabloid target to consort: what can we expect from Queen Camilla?

<p>Over her decades at Charles’ side, the consort has had many labels, but her easy charm, sociability and directness appear to have won over public opinion before her coronation</p><p>Before she married, the <em>Daily Mail</em> liked to refer to the current Princess of Wales as “Waity Katie”; William’s proposal was, it was thought, rather a long time in coming. But these things are relative, of course. In 2005, when Prince Charles announced his second engagement, he’d known Camilla Parker Bowles for more than 32 years, during which time she had played several different roles in his life: girlfriend, friend and adviser, mistress (she enlisted for the latter job twice). Thirty-two years! Imagine it. Multiply this figure by four, and you’re only just over – by 16 years, to be exact – the age of the crown Camilla will wear at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/11/king-charles-iii-coronation-date-6-may-2023" title="">Coronation at Westminster Abbey on 6 May</a> (Mary of Teck, the wife of George V, bought the coronet in question at the jeweller Garrard &amp; Co in 1911).</p><p>But time, in this case, equates to words: hundreds of thousands of them. When the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/10/from-the-archive-the-observer-view-on-the-coronation-1953-and-the-monarchys-revival" title="">26-year-old Elizabeth II was crowned in 1953</a>, people knew next to nothing about her; even had the public been less respectful then, and less religious, there was never any danger the holy solemnity of the occasion would be sullied with thoughts of her earthly existence, let alone with gossip and scandal. In the case of 75-year-old Camilla, however, the opposite is true. As she lifts the gold sceptre, will we picture her looking fraught in the car park at Sainsbury’s? As she is anointed with sacred oil, will we recall that bit in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/23/the-palace-papers-by-tina-brown-review-the-good-the-bad-and-the-indefensible" title="">Tina Brown’s </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/23/the-palace-papers-by-tina-brown-review-the-good-the-bad-and-the-indefensible" title="">The Palace Papers</a></em> where the author describes how she once French-kissed Charles in full sight of her husband, Andrew, at a polo ball? Even the glorious sound of Handel’s anthem, Zadok the Priest, may not stop us from wondering what kind of queen it is who chooses to have lunch (as she did last year) in the company of Jeremy Clarkson and Piers Morgan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/07/what-can-we-expect-from-queen-camilla">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The comedian on his new podcast about political activism, the symbolism of Sunak and Braverman, and rowdy post-pandemic audiences</p><p>Nishant “Nish” Kumar, 37, was born in south London. He discovered comedy when he performed in revue shows while studying English literature and history at Durham University. He’s twice been nominated for best show at the Edinburgh comedy awards. Alongside his critically acclaimed standup career, he’s hosted satirical BBC Two series <em>The Mash Report</em> (which was cancelled after four series)<em><strong> </strong></em>and starred in Sky’s <em>Hold </em><em>the Front Page</em> with fellow comic Josh Widdicombe.

A bunch of former Barack Obama staffers started a podcast network called Crooked Media, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Trump’s nickname for the entire press.

This is a British sister show, hosted by me and Coco Khan, two people trying hard to keep their faith in the political process. Against our better judgment and all available evidence, we still believe in the power of politics to improve people’s lives.

Adapted by Gwyneth Hughes (<em>Vanity Fair</em>) and directed by Georgia Parris, this <em>Tom Jones</em> is a lean four episodes (the 2005 Penguin Classic edition is 1,024 pages long).

Walking is the simplest and most natural thing to do, but its impact on our health and wellbeing is dramatic and far-reaching<p>Annabel Streets is searching for a conifer. It is a bright, early March day and we are looping around the gardens of Fulham Palace in southwest London. She spots what she is looking for: a large spreading yew tree. We stand looking up at the clusters of leathery, spiked leaves and breathe deeply. “Every day I stand under an evergreen tree now,” she says. “I have become obsessed with terpenes.”</p><p>Terpenes are a type of organic compound produced by plants, part of a protection system against insects, disease and rot. They are the reason pine trees smell piney and citrus trees smell citrussy. They are also one of the reasons humans are drawn to trees. The presence of these tiny molecules has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body. Laboratory research has shown that the terpene a-pinene, found in conifers such as our yew tree, could have properties that prevent cancer. Studies on the citrus compound D-limonene suggest it is an effective mood-booster and antidepressant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/07/the-walking-cure-why-we-should-all-be-putting-one-foot-in-front-of-the-other">Continue reading...</a>

The pummelling of the Tories at the local elections demonstrates that the PM has failed in his bid to detach himself from the deep damage that his party has done<p>Rishi Sunak has sold himself to other Tories as a kind of company doctor with a recovery plan to rescue a hideously tarnished and hugely unpopular brand from political bankruptcy. Downing Street has projected him to the voters in a similar fashion as a Mr Fix-It. This has provided Conservatives with a consoling story about their chances of winning the next general election. Whenever confronted with dire opinion poll ratings, they have responded that their prospects will improve as the prime minister draws a line under the torrid past and shows that he leads a stable government.</p><p>At a recent event organised by Onward, a Conservative thinktank, the Tory leader sought credit for moving his party on from what he called the “box-set drama” that came before his arrival at Number 10. Much ruder phrases are available to describe the mad premiership of Liz Truss and the bad one of Boris Johnson. He has hoped to earn points for himself and soften the disdain towards his party by not being as reckless with the nation’s finances as Ms Truss and not as degrading of public life as Mr Johnson. A lot of senior Tories have echoed this “steady Sunak” narrative if only for want of any other tale to tell themselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/07/the-voters-have-spoken-and-they-arent-falling-fo-steady-sunak-sales-pitch">Continue reading...</a>

## Rom-cons are rife, but it’s not just the cash that makes love hurt | Eva Wiseman

Some of the most common manipulations of trust share similarities with relationship fraud<p>It was always going to be love, wasn’t it, that would get us in the end? A sharp swipe from the right, the final boss. I read on <em><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us" title="">Refinery29</a></em> about Sarah, 23, who met Tom on a gaming app in the summer of 2020 and started, she says, to “like him a lot”. This was in the early months of lockdown, during those hot, grim days when police patrolled the parks. A few months into their online relationship, Tom admitted he was struggling to buy food and Sarah started sending him money, because she liked him and she didn’t want him to starve. Jobs had dissolved overnight, people were reselling dumbbells for five times the price – everybody was trying to survive.</p><p>When Sarah told her friends she’d been giving him cash – about £400 – they decided to investigate and discovered there was no Tom. Instead, the person attached to his email address was a young woman, the same age as Sarah. She was devastated; Sarah was not the only one. This is romance fraud or, rather snappily, “rom-con”, a crime that’s rising due to the cost-of-living crisis. Official figures show almost £90m was lost to romance scams last year, but it’s believed to be much higher – . The <em>Refinery29</em> piece describes how scam attempts have increased by 60% in the past six months. This kind of fraud has traditionally been associated with older women, but now everybody’s at risk: 51% of people aged 21 to 30 say they have seen a rise in the number of suspicious messages received on dating sites. ITV reported that Santander has launched a specialist division to combat rom-cons: the Break the Spell team works to “interrupt” customers who have been identified as being at high risk, stepping in when the person could be about to send large amounts of cash. To stop, in the name of love. Sorry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/07/rom-cons-are-rife-but-its-not-just-the-cash-that-makes-love-hurt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An adopted woman travels from France to South Korea in search of her roots in Davy Chou’s star-making second film</p><p>The Cambodian-French film-maker Davy Chou, a longtime champion of “lost” Cambodian cinema, made a splash in Cannes in 2016 with his dramatic feature debut, <em>Diamond Island</em>, a prize winner in the international critics’ week strand. For the lead role in his follow-up feature, <em>Return to Seoul</em>, about an adoptee who travels from France to Korea in search of her roots, he turned to Korean-born visual artist Park Ji-min, who had moved to France as a child but had no acting experience. An intense period of collaboration followed, and the result is this remarkably intimate and very affecting drama – an episodic odyssey (inspired by script consultant Laure Badufle) spanning the best part of a decade. It became Cambodia’s entry for this year’s 95th Academy Awards, and confirms both Chou and Park as major talents to watch, in whatever field.</p><p>We first meet Freddie (Park) when she ships up in Seoul as if by accident; we later learn that she was bound for Tokyo, but all the flights were grounded. Hotel clerk Tena (Guka Han) seems to spy a lost soul and takes Freddie under her wing, although it soon becomes clear that this new arrival is also an agent of chaos, overturning polite social mores with an exuberance that suggests deep well-springs of buried anger and confusion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/07/return-to-seoul-review-davy-chou-laure-badufle-park-ji-min-lights-up-mesmerising-tale-of-identity-and-alienation">Continue reading...</a>

The American-British comedian, writer, television personality and authority on mental health has suggested we meet before breakfast, although the reason for this timing, intended to be helpful to each of us, no longer seems as clear as when the arrangement was made. It is like being up for some antisocial budget flight. Her white stucco house is handsome from the outside and lights are on in the lower-ground-floor kitchen as I ring the bell. I spot a window box crammed with artificial flowers – as if to say: the show must go on, whatever the season. In this, they are like Wax herself.</p><p>Her new book, with the disarming title <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/im-not-as-well-as-i-thought-i-was-9780241554890">I’m Not As Well As I Thought I Was</a></em>, was meant to be about travelling the world in a (partly tongue-in-cheek) search for the meaning of life – and it still is. But while she was on her travels researching it, she was hijacked by a paralysing depression and ended up checking herself into a psychiatric hospital. So the book became something more embattled and exposing than planned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/07/ruby-wax-not-as-well-as-i-thought-i-was-depression-interview-cast-away">Continue reading...</a>

Of course we do, say some. See the man clenching his shoulders as a huge metal bonnet of gold and jewels is lowered over his ears: he’s our king. Well, not really, say others. The word “monarch” means one man who rules alone, and today our kings and queens are decorations obedient to an elected parliament. But then a third voice says: not only do we live in a monarchy, but Britain is a far more monarchical place than most people realise.</p><p>The UK is the only sizeable country left in Europe whose institutions are still basically monarchist. Power flows top-down in Britain, not upwards from the people. A ghostly old deference pervades Cabinets, councils, administrations and ceremonies. In the middle ages, kingship was often “contractual”: you protect us and we’ll obey and fight for you. But later came the age of the “divine right” of kings : the absolute, anointed and unlimited authority of a monarch. In Europe, that was overthrown by the French Revolution and by the century of revolutions and constitutions that followed. Divine right gave way to ideas of “popular sovereignty” – sometimes real, sometimes a dictatorial fake.

<p>Derrick Ofosu Boateng’s vibrant portraits grew out of a love of traditional and vintage clothing</p><p>Kente fabric has been woven on the west coast of Africa for 3,000 years. Traditionally used for the robes of Asante leaders, its vibrant patterns became symbolic of the Ghanaian and pan-African independence movements led by Kwame Nkrumah in the 1950s. The young Ghanaian photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/derrick_o_boateng/?hl=en">Derrick Ofosu Boateng</a> weaves many of the associations of that history into his photographs. The man in this picture wears a kente that was part of a recent exhibition at the Amba Gallery in Accra. The background colours borrow the joy of that robe. On his Instagram feed, Boateng comments that: “This smile makes life more beautiful. Glad to share this smile with the world.”</p><p>Boateng first used his Instagram account for pictures of himself modelling the traditional and vintage clothing he loved. He realised, however, that people were liking and following him more for his photography than his modelling. He takes his inspiration from the streets and market places outside his door in Accra, and then uses friends to bring his ideas to life. The collaborative process is important, he argues, because western photographers have long come to African cities and taken pictures without the consent of the people in them. News outlets often depicted Ghana and Africa in a negative way, he said in a <a href="https://homecoming.gallery/pages/derrick-ofosu-boateng-interview">recent interview</a> with the Homecoming Gallery, and failed to “shine a light on the energy, power, immense creativity and pride that’s also embedded in our culture”.</p><p><a href="https://photolondon.org/">Photo London 2023 is at Somerset House, London, WC2 from Wednesday 10 to Sunday 14 May</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/07/the-big-picture-ghana-derrick-ofosu-boateng-photo-london-somerset-house">Continue reading...</a>

## Monsters: A Fan’s Dilemma by Claire Dederer review – what’s your cancellation policy?

<p>The American journalist’s thoughts on how we should respond to art created by dreadful people are muddled and poorly researched</p><p>Claire Dederer is a journalist from Seattle and the author of two memoirs, the most well known of which is <em>Poser: My Life in Twenty-Three Yoga Poses</em>. In 2017, she wrote a piece for the<em> </em><em>Paris Review</em> entitled <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/11/20/art-monstrous-men/">What Do We Do With the Art of Monstrous Men?</a> in which she described the experience of rewatching the early films of Woody Allen (<em>Annie Hall, Manhattan</em>) in the context of the allegations of abuse made against him by his adopted daughter, Dylan. The #MeToo movement was then just beginning and this piece, according to her publisher, went viral. Six years on, and it has now also been incorporated into Dederer’s new book, <em>Monsters: A Fan’s Dilemma, </em>where it loiters alongside her thoughts on several other bad (or badly behaved) men who have made good art, among them Picasso, Roman Polanski and Richard Wagner.</p><p>This is a good subject, and a perennial one – it long predates cancel culture: anyone who read English at university in the 80s, when literary theory was enjoying its crazy, ascetic heyday, will have spent at least some of the past 30 years arguing about the degree to which life and art can or should be separated – and Dederer certainly talks a big game as she begins. Her approach will be nuanced, she suggests, paraphrasing the poet William Empson, who believed all of us must somehow exist between contradictions that can’t be solved by analysis. She will, she suggests, inevitably end up saying things some readers may find uncomfortable. For instance: having spent many hours in her cosy, book-lined, “humanist” house watching the films of Polanski, who in 1977 drugged and raped a 13-year-old girl, Dederer’s verdict on his work is (rightly, I think) unchanged: <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/best-film-ever-chinatown-season">Chinatown</a></em> is still a masterpiece.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/07/monsters-a-fans-dilemma-by-claire-dederer-review-whats-your-cancellation-policy">Continue reading...</a>

Labour has enjoyed a remarkable transformation since its dismal showing in the 2019 general election<p>Voters want a change. That is the message they overwhelmingly sent to the government in last week’s local elections. The Conservatives lost more than 1,000 councillors, a dismal result that puts them on a projected national vote share of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65475817" title="">just 26%</a>. Parties to the left of the Conservatives – Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens – between them captured more than two-thirds of the projected national vote share.</p><p>This is a rude awakening for Conservative MPs who hoped Rishi Sunak could revive their party’s fortunes. It suggests voters have had enough of a Conservative government that has presided over deep cuts to the welfare safety net and rolled back public infrastructure, that has inflicted economic pain on the country through deliberate policy choices, and that has sought to distract from its appalling record by introducing unworkable and punitive measures for desperate asylum seekers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/07/the-observer-view-on-england-local-election-results-keir-starmer-deserves-credit-but-has-more">Continue reading...</a>

## How the world fell in love with sauvignon blanc

Sauvignon blanc has made itself at home all over the planet - here are a selection from New Zealand, Chile, France and South Africa<p><strong>Greywacke Sauvignon Blanc, Marlborough, New Zealand 2022 (from £18.95, <a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/">thewhiskyexchange.com</a>; <a href="https://www.thewinesociety.com/">thewinesociety.com</a>; <a href="https://www.slurp.co.uk/">slurp.co.uk</a>) </strong>More than two decades later, I can still remember my first startling sip of Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc: a sudden, vivid snapshot of some other, better, sun-dappled green realm, where the air is alive with scents of gooseberries, wild grasses and blackcurrant leaves. That kind of astonishment is rare in wine, and the sheer profusion of wines made from the same grape variety in the same place and in the same style as Cloudy Bay since I first came across the original makes a repeat experience even more unlikely. Still, at its best there remains something irresistibly vibrant about Marlborough sauvignon blanc, something that never fails to clear the mind and put a spring in the step. As it happens, one of the people responsible for Cloudy Bay, winemaker Kevin Judd, is still among Marlborough sauvignon’s most skilled exponents, working now at the Greywacke estate he started in 2009. I came across a bottle of the current, 2022 vintage recently and it is a beauty: the passionfruit and guava in crystal clear HD.</p><p><strong>Kalfu Sampai Sauvignon Blanc, Huasco Valley, Chile 2020 (From £17.85, <a href="https://fintrywines.co.uk/">fintrywines.co.uk</a>; <a href="https://frontierfinewines.co.uk/">frontierfinewines.co.uk</a>) </strong>New Zealand’s biggest rival when it comes to its brand of vibrant sauvignon blanc is another southern hemisphere country famed for the piercing clarity of its sunlight: Chil0e. This was once the place where you came for cut-price alternatives to the Marlborough model, and it’s true that Chile is still hard to beat for sauvignon that offers more than the shrill acidity and asparagus that too many budget bottlings present: the <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/">Co-op</a>’s Irresistible Leyda Valley Sauvignon Blanc (£8.50) is a deliciously lime-tangy example of what’s on offer from the coastal vineyards of Leyda. Increasingly refined examples are popping up all over the country, with Kalfu Sampai, from a vineyard high up in the Atacama Desert, offering a wonderfully zippy, salty-minerally, drily refreshing style. South Africa, too, has some sites that seem perfectly suited to making expressive sauvignon, notably in cooler sites towards the Cape coast, such as Iona’s at 420m above sea level in Elgin, home to their perfectly poised, citrus, herb and elderflower-scented Iona Elgin Highlands Sauvignon Blanc 2022 (£13.25, <a href="https://bushvines.co.uk/">bushvines.co.uk</a>).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/07/how-the-world-fell-in-love-with-sauvignon-blanc">Continue reading...</a>

## Schools need a regulator, not Ofsted | Letters

In England, the education system relies on ratings to keep academies in check. This must change<p>Sonia Sodha refers to Ofsted as “the regulator” (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/30/we-rely-too-much-on-ofsted-blunt-tool-fails-children-parents-and-schools" title="">We rely too much on Ofsted. It is a blunt tool that fails children, parents and schools</a>”, Comment). But Ofsted is not the regulator of schools, merely the inspector. A natural question then, is who is the regulator?</p><p>The shocking answer is that in England, with the exception of allegations of serious misconduct, schools are almost completely deregulated. They are mostly managed by “non-profit” corporations called academies, which are given freedom to manage their schools with virtually no independent oversight. Complaints by parents or pupils against academy-managed schools are left to the academy itself to oversee, and in the case of a dispute there is no recourse to an independent regulator or ombudsman; a letter from a parent to Ofsted will be met with the stock answer “we are not the regulator for schools”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/may/07/letters-schools-need-regulator-not-ofsted">Continue reading...</a>

We need to think about how the monarchy institution sits in a modern and more secular Britain<p>How many of us said it? And, of those who mouthed or declaimed the words of the coronation oath, in sitting rooms and at picnic tables, to car radios or pub TV screens, how many did so with a sense of fingers crossed behind their backs?</p><p>The innovation of the people’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/29/public-invited-to-swear-their-allegiance-as-king-is-crowned" title="">declaration of allegiance</a> to King Charles III had been designed, in the words of the archbishop of Canterbury, to offer “the general public” what for centuries had been the preserve of “national figures”. The idea was that this would not just be a behind-abbey-doors head-nodding of ladies of the thistle and knights of the garter to acknowledge the new king, but a “great cry” of loyalty “around the nation and across the world”. That “call” to the country was toned down to an “invitation” on palace orders at the final hour. Though some people no doubt enthusiastically took up the opportunity, there was another very British response at midday on Saturday: indifference and shoulder shrugging; a collective “nah, not really”, which was probably the voice of a majority.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/07/charles-iii-coronation-faith-wont-last-forever">Continue reading...</a>

We squinted at their silver foil wrappings. What’s that all about? And then it dawned on us. We were in a Persian restaurant and the rice was coming. All hail the Persian way with rice: that light, fluffy miracle of individual grains, made all the more luscious through the liberal application of butter. Plates are placed in front of us, the snowy peaks stained a light saffron-yellow. Our waiter encourages us to apply the butter. She points us at the shakers on the table, which contain the deep purple citrus burst of sumac. “Use that, too,” she says briskly, and disappears into the kitchen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/07/toot-plymouth-restaurant-review-jay-rayner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scientists are warning machine learning will soon outsmart humans – maybe it’s time for us to take note</p><p>Last Monday an eminent, elderly British scientist lobbed a grenade into the febrile anthill of researchers and corporations currently obsessed with artificial intelligence or AI (aka, for the most part, a technology called machine learning). The scientist was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/05/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-fears-for-humanity" title="">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, and the bombshell was the news that he was leaving Google, where he had been doing great work on machine learning for the last 10 years, because he wanted to be free to express his fears about where the technology he had played a seminal role in founding was heading.</p><p>To say that this was big news would be an epic understatement. The tech industry is a huge, excitable beast that is occasionally prone to outbreaks of “irrational exuberance”, ie madness. One recent bout of it involved cryptocurrencies and a vision of the future of the internet called “Web3”, which an astute young blogger and critic, <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/" title="">Molly White</a>, memorably describes as “an enormous grift that’s pouring lighter fluid on our already smoldering planet”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/07/a-race-it-might-be-impossible-to-stop-how-worried-should-we-be-about-ai">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Blasts reported in Crimea early on Sunday; Russian investigators claim suspect admits acting for Kyiv after Russian nationalist writer wounded in car bombing</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russian-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p>There were<strong> blasts in Russia-annexed Crimea early on Sunday</strong>, according to Russian and Ukrainian media. Russian social media reported air defence systems were repelling attacks. Baza, a Telegram channel with links to Russia’s law enforcement agencies, reported that Ukraine sent drones into the Crimean Peninsula, with Russian air defence shooting down at least one over the port of Sevastopol. There were no casualties, according to the channel’s preliminary information.</p><p><strong>A prominent Russian nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/06/pro-kremlin-writer-zakhar-prilepin-injured-in-car-explosion-says-russia">wounded in a car bombing</a> that killed his driver. </strong>The attack took place on Saturday in the Nizhny Novgorod region, about 400km (250 miles) east of Moscow. Russia’s foreign ministry accused Ukraine, while Ukraine’s security services refused to confirm or deny involvement. A senior Ukrainian official accused Russia of staging the attack.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian officials issued air raid alerts on Saturday evening for areas covering about two-thirds of the country</strong>. The alerts extended from the capital, Kyiv, and regions to the west of it through all regions in the east as well as south to Kherson region and Russian-annexed Crimea.</p><p><strong>Ukraine hailed the return of 45 Azov battalion fighters captured during the battle for Mariupol while Russia said three of its pilots had been released by Kyiv</strong>.<strong> </strong>The freed Ukrainian prisoners included 42 men and three women from the Azov battalion, said Andriy Yermak, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office.</p><p><strong>Russia has been accused of attacking the besieged city of Bakhmut with incendiary phosphorus weapons</strong>, BBC News reported. Ukraine’s military shared drone footage of what appeared to be fires in Bakhmut as white phosphorus rained down.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s air force claims to have downed a Russian hypersonic missile over Kyiv using newly acquired American Patriot defence systems</strong>, the first known time the country has been able to intercept one of Moscow’s most modern missiles. Air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk said the Kinzhal-type ballistic missile was intercepted over the Ukrainian capital during the week.</p><p><strong>Russian shelling killed six Ukrainian demining experts in the southern Kherson region, Ukrainian emergency services has said. </strong>Two others members of the team were injured, along with a nurse, and were being treated in hospital.</p><p><strong>A 56-hour curfew is in place in Kherson, which saw some residents leaving the southern Ukrainian city on Friday before it came into effect. </strong>The announcement of the curfew, lasting until Monday morning, prompted speculation in the city that it was about to be used as a launch point for Ukraine’s much-anticipated counterattack.</p><p><strong>Concerns in the Russian leadership about vulnerability to attack and the potential for public protests over the Ukraine war have contributed to the decision to cancel many Victory Day parades</strong>, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. Six Russian regions, occupied Crimea and 21 cities had cancelled their parades this coming Tuesday, said the MoD.</p><p><strong>Russia is “still not satisfied” with how the issue of Russian agricultural exports as part of the Black Sea grain deal is being resolved</strong>, Tass news agency quoted the deputy foreign minister, Sergey Vershinin, as saying on Saturday after the latest talks with a top UN official.</p><p><strong>Poland will demand European Union sanctions on imports of Russian farm products, its ambassador to the EU has said. </strong>“Europe isn’t threatened by disruptions in supply chain of farm products now – contrary, we have a problem of surpluses,” Andrzej Sadoś was quoted by PAP news agency as saying. “We are resolving a problem of increased imports of farm products from Ukraine.”</p><p><strong>Switzerland’s parliament has approved a request from Ukrainian authorities for Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address it. </strong>The invitation comes amid pressure on Switzerland’s government to break with a centuries-old tradition of neutrality and end a ban of exports of Swiss weapons to conflict zones such as Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Ukraine sent its first lady, Olena Zelenska, and the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, as the country’s representatives to King Charles’s coronation in London on Saturday.</strong> Zelenska posted on Facebook: “It is an honour for us and prime minister Denys Shmyhal to attend the coronation … to wish on behalf of all of Ukraine successful governance and prosperity to the country.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-438-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
