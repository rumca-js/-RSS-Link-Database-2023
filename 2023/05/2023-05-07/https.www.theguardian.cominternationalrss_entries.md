As he takes the mic of the biggest job in radio, the presenter talks about working-class pride, advice from Bruce Forsyth – and the one item that’s still on his achievement wish list…<p>Vernon Kay is trying to explain what it will be like to present the most popular radio show in Europe. We are in studio 6A, on the sixth floor of the BBC’s Wogan House in central London. Outside the room is a Yamaha DC7 piano donated by Elton John in 2010, and recently tinkled by Benny from Abba and Fleetwood Mac’s Christine McVie, and a loo that is reserved for Radio 2’s star presenters, who can quickly nip in there while a song is playing. In the studio, Kay jumps up and takes two long strides to a mixing desk. It’s a messy jumble of monitors, buttons and lights that looks – to the inexpert eye – like the cockpit of a basic aeroplane.</p><p>“Let’s say you’re my producer and there’s two of us in the studio,” he role-plays. “It’s pre-show and we’re just chewing the fat: ‘What did you do last night? Blah, blah, blah.’ And I’m sitting here, looking at the clock and the fader is down, right? So there’s two of us. Then all of a sudden, when you do this…” Kay pushes a yellow slider knob, which controls the microphone, to the open position. “Now you are live to 8.4 million people. It’s the most bizarre experience ever.” He continues to slide the knob up and down, almost lost in a daydream: “Just us two… Eight million… Us two… Eight million… Us two… Eight million.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/07/in-the-hot-seat-with-vernon-kay-as-he-takes-to-the-mic-of-the-biggest-job-in-radio">Continue reading...</a>

He’s a very long shot to succeed where seven others from Britain before him (Matthew Hatton, Ryan Rhodes, Amir Khan, Liam Smith, Rocky Fielding, Callum Smith, Billy Joe Saunders) have come up short. But with Álvarez entering off an uncommonly tepid 2022 campaign (which included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/dmitry-bivol-canelo-alvarez-fight-upset">a loss to Dmitry Bivol at 175lbs</a>, a by-the-numbers points win <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/18/canelo-alvarez-gennady-golovkin-fight-report">over a faded Gennady Golovkin</a> followed by surgery on his left wrist), there’s a sense of hope in Ryder’s camp that tonight’s fight is coming along at the right time.
