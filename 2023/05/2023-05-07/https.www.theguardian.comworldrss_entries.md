<p>Experts believe the UK has adopted a segregated immigration policy which favours those fleeing Ukraine</p><p>The Home Office has been accused of operating an “unashamedly racist” refugee system after refusing to offer people fleeing fighting in Sudan a safe and legal route to the UK, in stark contrast to the schemes offered to those escaping the war in Ukraine.</p><p>With the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/04/britons-trapped-in-sudan-say-relatives-were-not-allowed-on-flights" title="">final</a> evacuation flight from Khartoum to the UK having left last week, a lack of options from the UK government has crystallised concern that it has adopted a segregated immigration policy. No safe and legal routes have been made available to help Sudanese refugees flee and there is no sign of an announcement outlining a new scheme to deal with the fallout of the conflict.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/07/home-office-accused-of-being-unashamedly-racist-towards-sudanese">Continue reading...</a>
