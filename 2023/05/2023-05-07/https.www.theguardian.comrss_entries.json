On coronation weekend, what ensues is two parts standup show to one part crowning of the local girl done good, now returned with an armful of humblebrag tales of hobnobbing with royalty and buying extortionate footwear. What makes it fun is the palpable audience connection, and the expressivity and command our host brings to not always exceptional material.</p><p>That expressive flair is on display early, when Love begins her life story with an act-out depicting the clapped-out coming together of her ageing parents\u2019 egg and sperm.

Indeed, the results are considered so promising that further human studies are planned, with a view to having the coating approved by regulators ahead of commercial use. \u201cThe CNC-repellant combination will have a longer efficacy and range of action than other products currently available on the market,\u201d says Bohbot, adding that they expect \u201chigh levels of product adoption\u201d if and when it does hit shelves.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/07/mosquitoes-repellant-bite-summer-science-medical-research\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/07/mosquitoes-repellant-bite-summer-science-medical-research", "date_published": "2023-05-07 14:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Should I worry about skipping breakfast?", "description": "<p>Some claim it is the most important meal of the day, while others believe fasting has its benefits.

In 2017, she wrote a piece for the<em> </em><em>Paris Review</em> entitled <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/11/20/art-monstrous-men/\">What Do We Do With the Art of Monstrous Men?</a> in which she described the experience of rewatching the early films of Woody Allen (<em>Annie Hall, Manhattan</em>) in the context of the allegations of abuse made against him by his adopted daughter, Dylan. The #MeToo movement was then just beginning and this piece, according to her publisher, went viral. Six years on, and it has now also been incorporated into Dederer\u2019s new book, <em>Monsters: A Fan\u2019s Dilemma, </em>where it loiters alongside her thoughts on several other bad (or badly behaved) men who have made good art, among them Picasso, Roman Polanski and Richard Wagner.</p><p>This is a good subject, and a perennial one \u2013 it long predates cancel culture: anyone who read English at university in the 80s, when literary theory was enjoying its crazy, ascetic heyday, will have spent at least some of the past 30 years arguing about the degree to which life and art can or should be separated \u2013 and Dederer certainly talks a big game as she begins. Her approach will be nuanced, she suggests, paraphrasing the poet William Empson, who believed all of us must somehow exist between contradictions that can\u2019t be solved by analysis. She will, she suggests, inevitably end up saying things some readers may find uncomfortable. For instance: having spent many hours in her cosy, book-lined, \u201chumanist\u201d house watching the films of Polanski, who in 1977 drugged and raped a 13-year-old girl, Dederer\u2019s verdict on his work is (rightly, I think) unchanged: <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/best-film-ever-chinatown-season\">Chinatown</a></em> is still a masterpiece.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/07/monsters-a-fans-dilemma-by-claire-dederer-review-whats-your-cancellation-policy\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/07/monsters-a-fans-dilemma-by-claire-dederer-review-whats-your-cancellation-policy", "date_published": "2023-05-07 06:00:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Sunday with Graham Norton: \u2018I squeeze in Wordle before lights out\u2019", "description": "<p>The comedian on drinking Bloody Marys, listening to Roberta Flack \u2013 and the joy of never having to go to church</p><p><strong>\u200b\u200bWhen does Sunday start?</strong> Quite early.

That kind of astonishment is rare in wine, and the sheer profusion of wines made from the same grape variety in the same place and in the same style as Cloudy Bay since I first came across the original makes a repeat experience even more unlikely. Still, at its best there remains something irresistibly vibrant about Marlborough sauvignon blanc, something that never fails to clear the mind and put a spring in the step. As it happens, one of the people responsible for Cloudy Bay, winemaker Kevin Judd, is still among Marlborough sauvignon\u2019s most skilled exponents, working now at the Greywacke estate he started in 2009.

They are mostly managed by \u201cnon-profit\u201d corporations called academies, which are given freedom to manage their schools with virtually no independent oversight. Complaints by parents or pupils against academy-managed schools are left to the academy itself to oversee, and in the case of a dispute there is no recourse to an independent regulator or ombudsman; a letter from a parent to Ofsted will be met with the stock answer \u201cwe are not the regulator for schools\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/may/07/letters-schools-need-regulator-not-ofsted\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/may/07/letters-schools-need-regulator-not-ofsted", "date_published": "2023-05-07 05:01:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Observer view on the coronation of King Charles III: our faith in these magical rituals won\u2019t last forever | Observer editorial", "description": "We need to think about how the monarchy institution sits in a modern and more secular Britain<p>How many of us said it?
