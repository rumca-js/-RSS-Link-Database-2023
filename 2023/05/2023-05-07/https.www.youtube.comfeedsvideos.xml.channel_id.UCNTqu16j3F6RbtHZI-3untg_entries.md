Announcing my next major video project - a video about Japan after a trip i made to the country with the brothers that introduced me to the games and anime that shaped my life. Why has this land in the far east been the source of inspiration for art, music, games, and society? Follow me as I seek to answer this question as an outsider looking in. Coming later this month or early June.
