Spring is here and I'm enjoying it, but I just realized how much wargaming stuff will happen this summer! New releases, new projects, traveling to conventions - all kinds of things. We'll talk about what's to come, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made a game! Check out Reign in Hell - Demonic Skirmish Combat at http://www.reigninhellgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
