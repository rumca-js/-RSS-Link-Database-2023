Why Isn\u2019t It Cashing In On The Global Market?", "description": "Nigeria grows 63 million metric tons of cassava (also known as yucca) every year, but most of the country's supply is eaten locally as fufu or garri. Experts say Nigeria could be missing out on billions in exports of lucrative cassava products like bubble tea pearls, starch, or ethanol. Challenges along the country's entire supply chain have caused hundreds of millions of dollars in cassava spoilage. But one entrepreneur, Yemisi Iranloye, thinks she has the solution. She's introduced higher-yielding seed varieties and moved processing plants closer to farms. Now, her farmers earn four times more for their product, and her cassava starch and sorbitol have landed her clients like Nestle and Unilever. Could Yemisi's model be the way for Nigeria to feed itself and cash in on exports?\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:48 History of cassava\n2:58 Growing issues\n5:42: How garri and fufu are made\n6:54 Transportation issues\n7:36 How cassava is processed\n10:06 Global demand is so high for cassava\n\n\nMORE BIG BUSINESS VIDEOS:\nHow Used Luxury Watches Became A $20 Billion Industry | Big Business | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/BgdxjmGN7B4\nHow 23 Foods Get To The Grocery Store | Big Business | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/4ArVvrhhnyI\nHow $2,500 Fedora Hats Are Made | Big Business | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/GRP5-WXuFHw\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#Nigeria #BigBusiness #InsiderBusiness  #africa #farming \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nInsider Business on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness\nInsider Business on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nInsider Business on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider\n\nNigeria Is The World's Biggest Cassava Producer.
