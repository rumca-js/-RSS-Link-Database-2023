Woke, Marxist Hollywood wasn't woke or Marxist enough. Now in order to be nominated for an Oscar, you have quotas you need to fill based on race and gender.</p><p>The new standards make Dreyfuss \"vomit.\"</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n\t\tRichard Dreyfuss on Hollywood\u2019s new \"inclusivity standards\":<br />\n<br />\n\t\t\"They make me vomit.\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/ljsKxN9HFK\">pic.twitter.com/ljsKxN9HFK</a><br />\n\t\t\u2014 Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1655011052663480322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 7, 2023</a>\n</blockquote></div><blockquote>No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is. What are we risking? Are we really risking hurting people\u2019s feelings? You can\u2019t legislate that. You have to let life be life and I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think there is a minority or majority in the country that has to be catered to like that.</blockquote><p>It would have been nice if the reporter asked Dreyfuss about the more important topic: the time he stole Fingers Malloy's Diet Coke from the CPAC bloggers' lounge. It's been over a decade and is about time the actor answered for this.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"8f11b\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33617781&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>That is not to say that Dreyfuss isn't right. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/06/richard-dreyfuss-says-oscar-diversity-rules-make-me-vomit\" target=\"_blank\">The new rules are that starting in 2025</a>, in order to qualify to be nominated for an Oscar, \"at least one lead character in the movie be from an \u201can underrepresented racial or ethnic group\u201d, having at least 30% of the general ensemble cast be from at least two underrepresented groups (women, racial-ethnic, LGBTQ+ or people with disabilities), or having the movie\u2019s subject focus on one of those groups.\"</p><p>But it's an issue I don't have any extra bandwidth to care about. Like most Americans, I don't give a rip about the Oscars. 90% of the movies I love were never nominated let alone won. In order to get the critical acclaim to be considered Oscar-worthy, a movie already has to pander to a progressive worldview. If that is no longer woke enough for Hollywood, meh. The Academy can keep nominating more and more movies that less and less moviegoers care about.</p><p>If I were a filmmaker, I wouldn't care about the guidelines. I'd also ignore them and tell the story I want to tell anyway.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

One side of the debate, the side that believes in biology, feels that because boys are born with certain biological advantages in strength and athletics, it is unfair for them to compete against girls. Effectively robbing girls of opportunities like scholarships and being able to discover themselves as they learn, grow, and develop. </p><p><span></span>The other side of the debate is anti-science, votes Democrat, and thinks you're a transphobe.<br /></p><p>The debate tends to focus on people born males competing in female sports because, for some unknown reason, it isn't people born female dominating in male sports. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/volleyball-player-north-carolina\" target=\"_self\">Nor is it people born female giving people born male concussions</a>. That's what makes Mack Beggs an interesting challenger.</p><p>When Mack was born a girl, he competed against girls. Which is good. But he did it while transitioning and hopped up on hormones and testosterone. Which critics at one point called \"cheating.\" Now as an adult, Beggs is nutting up to prove that transmen ARE men.</p><p>He accepted Shields' challenge in an Instagram story. \"We just going to make this an official call out, but Jake Shields I will take you up on your offer. ...

Because an unhoused homeless man died on a subway, protestors think that trapping NYers in an underground metal tube is going to cause them to care about the unhoused homeless man. It is more likely that the people on the subway -- white and black, male and female, gay and straight -- all came together to agree these protesters would have made great speedbumps.</p><p>We are still unclear what led bystanders, one of them being a Marine, to restrain unhoused homeless man Jordan Neely.
