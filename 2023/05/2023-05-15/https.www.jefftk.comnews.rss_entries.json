[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Facebook Increased Visibility", "description": "<p><span>\n\nIn January I got a strange notification from Facebook telling me that\nI had \"increased visibility\".  It explained:\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/facebook-increased-visibility-notification-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"1222\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/facebook-increased-visibility-notification.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis was a weird notification: it only showed up on my phone, not on\ndesktop.  Probably some sort of experiment?\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nEvery week or so I'd get another notification telling me that I was\nstill getting increased visibility, but that it was conditional on\ncontinuing to post things people were interested in.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI mostly ignored it, since I'm already very set in how I post on\nFacebook, and it was hard to tell how much of an effect it was having.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOn March 25th I got another notification, saying I wasn't being\ninteresting enough: \"Engagement has slowed.  See how you can get\nincreased visibility\".\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI was curious about what effect this had, but I didn't seem to have a\nway to tell.  Recently I remembered that I had <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/545581016154662\">turned\non</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2680340558863560\">professional\nmode</a> on my profile, which meant that if I went into \"Professional\ndashboard / Insights / Content\" I could see my last three months of\nposts with their \"reach\" and \"engagement\" counts.  Here are the\nplots:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/facebook-engagement-by-date-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/facebook-engagement-by-date.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/facebook-reach-by-date-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/facebook-reach-by-date.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI've highlighted March 25th as a red square, being the day when I got\nthe notification that I no longer had \"increased visibility\".\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIt doesn't seem like this was doing very much?  Average \"reach\" (the\nnumber of people FB showed my posts to) was 802 before the 3/25\nnotification and 713 after.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis isn't a perfect experiment: after getting the notification I\nthought it would be a good time to post some more boring (\"not of\ngeneral interest\") things I'd been thinking about for a while, though\nas usual I wasn't very good at predicting what people would be\ninterested in and <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/boston-social-dance-covid-requirements\">some of</a> <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/violin-supports\">those posts</a> got a\nlot of comments.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nOverall, I think I'm better off continuing to write what I want\nwithout thinking much about how it will affect how many people might\nsee what I write in the future, but \"how does Facebook decide what to\nshow\" is an interesting question.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid033EfzegdXbersiBAKmJiaJTWYJ2xbNPJs7is7DYQM4Z2R1aVqTgpPgPQr1TgVFopKl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/iGx9pZcLoo3jtGtih\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110373418664880008\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/facebook-increased-visibility", "date_published": "2023-05-15 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
