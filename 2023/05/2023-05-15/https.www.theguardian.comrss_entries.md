## China’s Hidden Century review – how opium and Christianity demolished a civilisation

<p><strong>British Museum, London<br /></strong>From Looty the stolen dog to the story of the last emperor, via glittering gowns and bloody rebellions, this show has a shock round every corner</p><p>In 1860 British and French troops pillaged and destroyed the Summer Palace of China’s Qing emperors, carrying off pieces of art and chunks of architecture – and a tiny, hairy dog who belonged to the emperor. Looty, as the dog was renamed with impeccable bad taste, was given to Queen Victoria and was the first “Pekinese” in Britain.</p><p>A portrait of Looty is one of the many arresting images and facts in what must be the strangest blockbuster the British Museum has ever staged. In 2007, this museum <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/sep/05/heritage.art">put on a show</a> about China’s first emperor. China’s Hidden Century takes the story up to the last emperor – the child ruler Aisin-Gioro Puyi, deposed by a revolution in 1912. Yet in the closed world of the 19th-century imperial court, recreated here, it seemed nothing had changed for centuries. It’s a heady experience to enter the heavily ritualised ambience of the emperor’s inner circle. The clothes alone are incredible works of art: gowns and dresses intricately decorated with butterflies, filigree patterns, dragons. There’s a dress that belonged to the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively ruled China from 1861 to 1908 and changed her glittering apparel several times a day: nearby are costumes and wall hangings from the operas performed at court. It’s hard to tell opera from reality, so formalised was everyday life in this rarefied centre of power.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/16/chinas-hidden-century-british-museum">Continue reading...</a>

## Curtis Jones double for Liverpool damages Leicester’s survival hopes

<p>Jürgen Klopp had said there are five millions ways to win a game and in a routine victory that ensures Manchester United can feel Liverpool breathing down their necks, Trent Alexander-Arnold exhibited one of the finer ways in which to score a goal. Alexander-Arnold emphatically sealed victory with a stunning free-kick and he could have hardly picked a better moment given Gareth Southgate and his assistant, Steve Holland, were among those in attendance. Alexander-Arnold, who again played as an inverted full-back, popping up centrally, arrowed his strike into the top corner, cementing a seventh straight win after a fine double by the excellent Curtis Jones.</p><p>Liverpool railroaded lowly Leicester, scoring twice inside three first-half minutes, to earn a healthy buffer and Alexander-Arnold capped victory after the returning Jonny Evans was deemed to have fouled Jordan Henderson, the Liverpool captain. The only shock was Mohamed Salah firing wide on 79 minutes after being freed as Liverpool went in search of a fourth goal. Liverpool’s late push to qualify for the Champions League continues to gather pace but Leicester’s thoughts are firmly elsewhere. If Leicester are to survive, a team that has won one of their previous 15 matches, must win one – if not both – of their remaining matches. And even then that may prove insufficient.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/15/leicester-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Welcome to the National Conservativism conference, a coming together of ideologies for the ideologically challenged</p><p>We’re spoiled. On Saturday we were gifted the Take Control conference of the Conservative Democratic Organisation. A collection of 200 or so weirdos, led by Nadine Dorries and Andrea Jenkyns, whose lives have been devastated by the absence of Boris Johnson. A keening for a flake of his life. A seance, even. Needless to say, Johnson himself couldn’t be bothered to attend in person. Instead sending down a few signed bottles – not ones he had bought, obviously – to be auctioned in his memory.</p><p>On Monday, for three days only, we are now being treated to the National Conservatism conference. The Nat Cons. A meeting of minds for those who think that Viktor Orbán and Giorgia Meloni might have a point. A coming together of ideologies for the ideologically challenged. The sort of audience where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/jordan-peterson">Jordan Peterson</a> would get a hero’s welcome.

<p>It looks like the prime minister will be as exercised by splits within his own party as by the official opposition</p><p>The length of time a party has been in power can equally make or break a premiership: it is far harder to make a mark coming to office at the end of a long period of dominance. Rishi Sunak is learning that lesson. Since last October he has been righting the listing Conservative ship. However, the losses his party suffered at the hands of opponents in May’s local elections have emboldened four distinct groups of critical voices within his party: former <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/liz-truss-and-the-menace-of-the-back-seat-prime-ministers-2dkmrbv37" title="">prime ministers</a>; thwarted ex-ministers; the Tory right and ambitious frontbenchers jockeying to lead the party after Mr Sunak has gone. The prime minister looks as if he may about to become as exercised by <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/team-boris-has-gone-into-overdrive-rishi-sunaks-astonishing-losses-are-reopening-tory-splits-2322346" title="">splits</a> within his own party as by the challenge posed by the official opposition.</p><p>The prime minister could dismiss as symbolic Theresa May’s sit-in protest at the base of the throne in the House of Lords last week over the government’s new asylum bill. He might brush off former home secretary Priti Patel’s claim that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/13/priti-patel-will-blame-local-election-losses-on-tory-leadership-in-speech" title="">Boris Johnson</a> would win the next election as sour grapes. But Downing Street will be more concerned that the Tory right is still smarting over the implosion of the Truss regime. Its collapse interrupted political careers that cannot be resumed unless Mr Sunak’s grip on power is loosened.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/15/the-guardian-view-on-rishi-sunaks-woes-hes-clearing-up-a-mess-he-made">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Confounding the polls, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is now on course to extend his rule into a third decade</p><p>In the lead-up to Turkey’s presidential election on Sunday, there seemed to be good grounds to believe that voters were about to turn their back on Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s authoritarian brand of nationalism. His <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/erdogan-takes-total-control-new-turkey" title="">assumption</a> of quasi-monarchical presidential powers in 2018 had succeeded in uniting a perennially divided opposition against him. Polls suggested a close race, but placed the president’s main rival for power, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, significantly ahead. Requiring a vote above 50% to win outright and avoid a runoff, Mr Kılıçdaroğlu’s declared aspiration was to “finish it in the first round”.</p><p>That optimism has turned out to be sadly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/15/turkey-election-runoff-erdogan-first-round-lead-president-kemal-klcdaroglu" title="">misplaced</a>. As it transpired, it was Mr Erdoğan who almost won at the first time of asking, winning over 49% of votes to Mr Kılıçdaroğlu’s 45%. The coalition led by the president’s Justice and Development party (AKP) is also set to win a surprise majority in the Grand National Assembly. That outcome will stymie opposition attempts to restore parliamentary democracy to Turkey, irrespective of the result of the presidential runoff in a fortnight’s time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/15/the-guardian-view-on-turkeys-election-results-a-step-towards-autocracy">Continue reading...</a>

## Kaye Donachie: Song for the Last Act review – painted women who refuse to sit still and be pretty

<p><strong>Pallant House Gallery, Chichester<br /></strong>Flawed, preoccupied and animated, Donachie’s vivid portraits intrigue and charm in a lively exhibition; Gwen John feels anaemic by comparison</p><p>The longer you look at Kaye Donachie’s portraits, the weirder they get. All of them avoid looking you in the eye. Their gazes slide away; they look to the side, are cast down or are occupied elsewhere. Consumed by the unseen, they can appear distracted or appalled. These are paintings, after all, not beings trapped in a frame. They aren’t even portraits. They have their beginnings in old black and white photographs, but their faces belong to no one.</p><p>Donachie uses these photographic faces as an armature for her brushstrokes. With their fades, shadows and blushes, their swipes and flickers recall other paintings as much as they animate these imaginary people. Donachie’s painted women are knowing constructs, and I get the feeling they could lose their composure at any moment, turn and smile, laugh, fly apart, disintegrate. She makes use of the play between the paint and the makeup her women wear, the patches of rouge, the shadows under a cheekbone, the interplay of nature and artifice. It is all a complicated game. Lively, animated, disturbed, motivated by something other than our attention, these painted women refuse to sit still and be pretty. The paintings also seem to have built-in flaws and glitches, places where modelling misregisters or goes awry and description falters. This is clearly deliberate. Displayed in the largest room of Pallant House’s original Queen Anne townhouse, they surround us, and you have the feeling that their gazes are communing among themselves rather than with us.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/15/kaye-donachie-song-for-the-last-act-review-pallant-house-gallery-chichester-gwen-john">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Alex Sanderson aims to grow the Premiership finalists’ fanbase but may need RFU help in what can be a southern-centric sport</p><p>There was one sentence uttered on Sunday that best summed up the challenge Sale Sharks face. It did not come from the director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, or man-of-the-match George Ford, rather from the taxi driver on the way to the AJ Bell Stadium. He had not heard of it and needed the postcode to get there. “Are you sure you don’t mean the Etihad?”</p><p>Sale are fighting what can sometimes feel like a losing battle for exposure and for eyeballs against two of the biggest football teams in the world.

The banner at the RCD stadium on Sunday had declared “we are Espanyol and this is our life”, yet it wasn’t one they chose, still less one they liked. They had never seen their team win a derby <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/apr/19/espanyol-barcelona-la-liga-sid-lowe">in the place they made home</a>, and this time not only did they witness <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/14/lewandowski-fires-barca-to-liga-title-but-invoke-espanyol-fans-wrath?CMP=share_btn_tw">another defeat</a> that pushed them ever closer to a second relegation in three seasons, but the few who hadn’t left early also watched their rivals <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jul/09/espanyol-slip-away-to-barcelonas-tune-but-the-silence-will-sting-too">celebrate becoming champions</a> in their own back garden. For some – morons, mostly – it was too much to take.</p><p>Out there in the centre circle Barcelona were dancing a <em>sardana</em>, a ring of players and staff spinning, when suddenly they broke into a sprint instead. There had been no provocation and they hadn’t even been there three minutes, coach Xavi Hernández already deciding it was enough, that this was neither the time or the place and calling them to come in, when it happened. In the south stand, some Espanyol fans – a couple of hundred perhaps, many with faces covered – smashed barriers, climbed onto the pitch and began a stampede, heading for the players. Alerted just in time, Barça set off straight for the sideline, bundling in. Some fell as they went, others were caught up in it all, scared. As he ducked beyond the forming cordon, Frank Kessié smiled.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/15/how-barcelona-won-la-liga-the-stories-behind-success-for-a-new-era">Continue reading...</a>

When I policed protest, across 30 years of service (1986-2016), in a variety of roles that included holding a riot shield myself, the police were simply there to protect life and property.

<ul><li>Decision made due to funding cuts from French government</li><li>Officials to consider options at summer board meeting</li></ul><p>The 2025 Rugby League World Cup is in serious doubt after the hosts, France, confirmed they would not be able to stage the tournament. The French had been preparing to be sole hosts of the event for the first time in 1972, but have now admitted they have pulled out after funding cuts from the French government.</p><p>The government had demanded a guarantee surrounding the possibility of the event making a loss, considering that the conditions initially set to secure the economic viability of the event no longer existed, after additional time and funding provided to the committee had come to an end. That left the organisers unable to commit to hosting and plummeting into doubt the biggest event in world rugby league.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/15/2025-rugby-league-world-cup-in-doubt-after-france-pull-out-of-staging-event">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For three decades, the search for Princess Zelda has been thrilling fans and smashing records. As its latest incarnation grips players in their millions, Nintendo’s Hidemaro Fujibayashi and Eiji Aonuma reveal how they took Hyrule to new heights</p><p>The release of a new Zelda game is always a major event worldwide. Ever since 1986, when famed Japanese game designer Shigeru Miyamoto first attempted to capture in code some of the wonder he experienced exploring the Kyoto countryside as a child, Zelda games have been pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in virtual worlds. Look at any best-games-of-all-time list and you’ll see Zelda in the Top 10, often more than once.</p><p>But 2017’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was particularly special. Launching alongside the Nintendo Switch console, which has since sold more than 125m units, it was perhaps the best realisation yet of the promise of boundless freedom and adventure that video games have been dangling in front of players’ noses for decades. It got rave reviews and sales hit 30m, many millions of those buyers new to the fantasy world of Hyrule. Pretty much everyone loved it. Soon, indie-pop star St Vincent was confessing to putting <a href="https://kotaku.com/after-confessing-to-playing-300-hours-of-breath-of-the-1841841140">300 hours into it</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/15/makers-mega-hit-video-game-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-hyrule">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s 15 years since I last visited the immense Westfield in Shepherd’s Bush, dreaming of the collapse of capitalism. It’s still standing and I’m still waiting …</p><p>It was the first beautiful day of 2023 and everyone in the country was in a park, except for me. I was in Westfield’s west London outpost, in Shepherd’s Bush.

<p>The over-extended bloat of American shows seems to be dying out with dramas like Succession, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel all bowing out early</p><p>It used to be so easy to tell the difference between a British TV show and an American one. The British show would have a maximum of 12 episodes, and the American one would have several hundred, and run for about a decade and a half.</p><p>And this meant that they had to be viewed in a different way. These long American shows – think Grey’s Anatomy or NCIS or even 24 – had a habit of rattling on for so long that quality control became much less important than simply keeping the train on the rails. To think of a show like this is to think of a show that burst out of the gates with a ton of promise, then dwindled on to fewer plaudits and smaller audiences until the network did the decent thing and cancelled them. It is roughly the television equivalent of wanting to split up with someone but, rather than simply dumping them, just deciding to grow more neglectfully distant until they can’t take it and break up with you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/15/tv-shows-ending-succession-barry-marvelous-mrs-maisel">Continue reading...</a>

Journalist <strong>Marc Caputo</strong> is not successful in getting the former president to clarify his stance on abortion, including the six-week ban now in place in Florida, but Trump does hold forth on potential primary foe <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, and shines some light on why he remains so adamant with his baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen.</p><p>Here’s a rundown of what we expect to happen today:</p><p><strong>Debt limit talks</strong> continue and comments from <strong>Joe Biden</strong> and his top officials over the weekend indicate progress may actually be being made ahead of the 1 June deadline for a potential US government default.</p><p><strong>There’s no</strong> White House press briefing today, and Biden is spending it flying from Delaware to Philadelphia and finally back to Washington DC.</p><p><strong>Kamala Harris</strong> is having a similarly quiet one, at least when it comes to interactions with the masses.

His wonderfully straightforward, unfussy approach to piano playing is perfectly matched to Schubert’s sonatas, and his performances of the two that framed this programme, the early A major sonata D664, and the last of all, the B flat major D960, were models of intelligence and good musical sense. The account of the A major seemed relaxed but never indulgent; every phrase was perfectly weighted and individually coloured and given its own expressive space.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/15/emanuel-ax-review-st-james-church-chipping-campden-music-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the first of two features exploring Iraqi music 20 years on from the Iraq war, the country’s rappers explain why using a US artform carries such satirical power</p><p>The 2003 invasion of Iraq left a small but noticeable impression on US hip-hop. “Stomp, push, shove, mosh, fuck Bush / Until they bring our troops home,” as Eminem rapped on Mosh, and he begged: “No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil,” alongside a bitingly direct <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wRLd5l7WYE&amp;t=44s">video</a>. “We rebellious … screaming ‘leave Iraq alone!’” Jay-Z rapped in 2003, and a year after the invasion, MF Doom questioned what the point of it all was on the Madvillain track Strange Ways: “All you get is lost children / While the bosses sit up behind the desks, it cost billions / To blast humans in half, into calves and arms / Only one side is allowed to have bombs.”</p><p>But the rap scene in Iraq hadn’t taken off in the same way it has now – Iraqi musicians such as the hugely popular Kadim al Saher continued to produce music influenced by the usual <em>choubi</em> and <em>chalgi</em> folk and pop styles – and so these relatively infrequent interjections from US rappers came to dominate the conversation around the war.

<p>Ultra-processed products now make up 60% of our diet – and they’re killing us</p><p>Strange as it may seem, food has replaced tobacco as the leading cause of early death globally. Each year, <a href="https://harvardpublichealth.org/nutrition/processed-foods-make-us-sick-its-time-for-government-action/" title="">more people die in America</a> from illnesses caused by poor diet than were killed fighting in every war in US history combined. In the UK the situation is equally dire.</p><p>Officially, the health effects of food are entirely due to its nutritional content – the amount of fat, salt, sugar and fibre it contains. The current system leaves it up to you to read the detailed information on the pack and decide how much to eat based on recommended values, and if you have children you’ll need to know the values for them too. This is nigh-on impossible for most people – but even if you were able to calculate exactly how much fat, salt and sugar you were consuming in each mouthful, you would still be neglecting one vital determinant of health – how the food was processed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/15/the-big-idea-why-we-need-a-new-definition-of-junk-food">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This film offers an unsparing view of how PoWs are treated when they return home – but it may not reflect  the current mood</p><p>Ukrainian film-maker Maksym Nakonechnyi finished war drama Butterfly Vision last February, just days before the Russian invasion. His film tells a fictional story about a shellshocked female Ukrainian soldier held prisoner for two months by Russian-backed separatists in Donbas during the conflict that began in 2014. It’s a tough, unsparing movie, and possibly not the Ukrainian film that anyone wants to watch right now as the country fights for survival. Nakonechnyi’s reflective script, co-written with Iryna Tsilyk, doesn’t have Russia in its crosshairs; instead there are some inconveniently downbeat insights into the divided attitudes the soldier faces when she returns home.</p><p>The soldier’s name is Lilya (Rita Burkovska), nicknamed “Butterfly”, an aerial reconnaissance expert who is released in a prisoner swap. We watch her reunion with her family in the format of a news bulletin, with the emojis and comments of online viewers flashing across the screen. One is an OMG about Lilya’s bedraggled appearance: “What happened to her gorgeous hair?” Others are more sympathetic: “It’s hard to imagine what she’s been through.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/15/butterfly-vision-review-ukrainian-war-film-maksym-nakonechnyi">Continue reading...</a>

She was difficult to pet physically, but I tried my best, stroking her long, muscular neck. I sang to her nightly while she sat there quacking along. Or quacking in protest. It was hard to know the difference.</p><p>I was very proud of her. No one else I knew had geese, except for the Ballantine’s distillery down the road, who had about 100 guarding the whisky. But no one from Ballantine’s went to my school, so that didn’t count. In short, it was unusual in the 80s to have geese, especially where we lived. But we kept a few at the old wreck of a cottage with a bit of land that my parents had managed to buy cheap – a tiny scrap of country in the middle of a council estate in Dumbarton.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/15/the-pet-ill-never-forget-every-night-i-would-sing-to-cackles-the-goose-then-tragedy-struck">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Introducing a peculiarly Italian kitchen implement, the <em>tagliapuntarelle</em>, which shreds veg into fat strings to be enjoyed in dishes such as this spring-time spaghetti</p><p>A 10cm x 10cm wooden square with a large hole crossed with wire strings: it could be a tiny harp if it didn’t also have another set of 12 strings that cross the first, forming a mesh. Even so, it can be strummed with a long nail, the basic strum audible, if you get in close. Its actual purpose is for slicing puntarelle, the inner tubes of a variety of chicory called <em>cicoria di catalogna</em> or <em>cicoria asparago</em> (asparagus chicory). A late winter-to-early spring vegetable, succulent puntarelle, with its asparagus-like tips, or <em>punte</em>, is a popular salad in Lazio, so the basic, nifty and cheap square cutters (<em><a href="https://www.coltelleriacollini.com/made-in-italy-the-chicory-cut-flush-tagliapuntarelle.html">tagliapuntarelle</a></em>) are common and easy to come by in hardware stores. And much as puntarelle migrates and thrives in soil all over the place, so do the cutters. Of course, you don’t <em>need</em> a cutter; a knife works just as well, only more slowly.</p><p>I also know several people who have made themselves a tagliapuntarelle, inspired by the larger cutters you sometimes see on market stalls: wooden boxes or frames strung with wire. Big or small, it is a fantastically satisfying tool, the crisp tubes of chicory cutting like butter into thin strips, or, if you want to keep the tips intact, puntarelle octopi! And it isn’t only for puntarelle: celery, courgettes and red pepper work on this tool, too; large vegetables turned into fat strings in two musical seconds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/15/spaghetti-asparagus-butter-lemon-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

Why – and what can we do to prevent them?</p><p>Donna, 33, from Suffolk, first developed the telltale signs of kidney problems 13 years ago when she experienced excruciating pain under her ribs. “I was being physically sick because of the pain, and kept going to hospital,” she says. “I was repeatedly dismissed by doctors because they couldn’t find anything on my scans. They thought I was a hypochondriac.”</p><p>She was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and told to make lifestyle changes. “I tried different diets but nothing helped, so I learned to live with the pain,” she says. Ten years later, while living and working in Spain, she was finally diagnosed with kidney stones. “A doctor did a scan to check I wasn’t pregnant and couldn’t believe the state of my kidney.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/15/i-was-sick-with-pain-but-doctors-thought-i-was-a-hypochondriac-the-spreading-agony-of-kidney-stones">Continue reading...</a>

Every development in the field, or to be more precise every development that the public notices, immediately generates an apocalyptic reaction. The fear is natural enough; it comes partly from the lizard-brain part of us that resists whatever is new and strange, and partly from the movies, which have instructed us, for a century, that artificial intelligence will take the form of an angry god that wants to destroy all humanity.</p><p>The recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/31/ai-research-pause-elon-musk-chatgpt">public letter</a> calling for a six-month ban on AI lab work will not have the slightest measurable effect on the development of artificial intelligence, it goes without saying.

## Portrait of Kaye review – at home with an agoraphobe, in gently affectionate study

<p>In the house she grew up in, unchanged for 50 years, the creative and delightful Kaye lives with her memories and an unexpected bohemian freedom</p><p>‘Oh fiddle faddle,” mutters Kaye Mannion in the front room of her house in Hackney, east London. Kaye is a cheerful soul in her mid-70s, a chatterbox, an extrovert. She also happens to be agoraphobic; and has been since she was a teenager. In this documentary about her life, Kaye comes over like Miss Havisham crossed with the mother and daughter Edies from Grey Gardens, with a bit of Carry On thrown in. She’s what you might call a character, and the film’s director Ben Reed – one of Kaye’s neighbours – take enormous care in his gentle, affectionate film not to make fun of her or exploit her eccentricities. And sensibly, he keeps the running time to a tight 59 minutes.</p><p>Kaye lives in the Victorian terrace she grew up in – long before the gentrification added a few zeros to house prices in the area. Everything is preserved exactly as it was in the 1960s and 70s, down to the floral wallpaper in the front room, and ceiling painted raspberry pink. The place is shabby and rammed with knickknacks, the walls covered with pictures of movie stars and crooners of a certain vintage. When Kaye married a milkman in the 1960s, there was no question of her leaving home – he moved in with her, and her mum and dad. All are now dead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/15/portrait-of-kaye-review-agoraphobic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Are Brighton the model club, should Chelsea ditch Kanté and how far can Ramsey, Eze and Mbeumo take their talent?</p><p>Sean Dyche was asked about the difference between preparing for Manchester City, Everton’s opponents on Sunday, and Brighton, who they’d clattered 5-1 in midweek. He observed that City play in various ways whereas Brighton have a particular method – and how well it’s serving them. Roberto De Zerbi has done an incredible job since replacing Graham Potter, all the more so as he’s refined their style mid-season. Next year, though, he’ll be facing opponents who know what to expect having seen various tactics deployed against it – and in all likelihood, will have European competition to contend with having lost a big player or two to richer rivals. So there’s a lot of work for the club to do: identifying replacements, signing reinforcements, and developing different ways of playing. But in the meantime, their destruction of an admittedly tired Arsenal is just the latest evidence of an almost perfectly run football club; one that should inspire others at every level. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/14/arsenal-brighton-premier-league-match-report">Arsenal 0-3 Brighton</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: Everton 0-3 Manchester City</em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/13/manchester-united-wolves-premier-league-match-report">Manchester United 2-0 Wolves</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/13/chelsea-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report">Chelsea 2-2 Nottingham Forest</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/13/southampton-fulham-premier-league-match-report">Southampton 0-2 Fulham</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/13/leeds-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Leeds 2-2 Newcastle</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/13/aston-villa-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Aston Villa 2-1 Tottenham</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/15/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

The pink T-shirted activists from the recently-formed group Animal Rising, some of whom delayed the start of the Grand National by 15 minutes last month and also staged anti-racing protests at Ayr and Doncaster in recent weeks, are long odds-on to have Epsom on their target list too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/15/the-targeting-of-epsom-is-open-to-debate-but-the-right-to-peaceful-protest-is-not">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At moments when we need to start all over again, great art is there to salve our wounded feelings and help point the way to the future</p><p>Last Thursday night I gave a talk at the Hirshhorn in Washington DC. I always stick around afterwards so I can chat to people about their work, their favourite artists or their routes into art. On this occasion, one woman – her eyes glassy – looked at me and said: which artist can I look at to soften heartbreak?</p><p>I immediately directed her to Tracey Emin’s neons, where I’ve often gone to find answers. Text is powerful when used in art. Emin’s neons, lit up in fluorescent colours and at times loosely framed in a heart-shaped line, have read: “Meet me in heaven and I will wait for you”; “It’s a crime to live with the person you don’t love”; “The soul will always do what it needs to do’’; “I could have really loved you”; “Be brave”. Although not limited to heartbreak, these lines address experiences most people can relate to.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/15/a-case-of-heartbreak-i-prescribe-tracey-emins-neons-and-paula-regos-dancers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The journalist who exposed the Post Office scandal depicts the actors’ filthy  fallout as a showreel for our narcissistic age</p><p>After ending their chaotic, punch-drunk marriage, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard generously treated us to a pair of legal epilogues. First, Depp sued the<em> Sun</em> for calling him a wife beater, only to have the judge in London accept Heard’s account of his brutality and dismiss his case. He then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/19/amber-heard-johnny-depp-legal-settlement">sued Heard</a> for defamation in the US, where a jury awarded him $15m in damages.</p><p><a href="https://www.nickwallis.com/">Nick Wallis</a>, the journalist best known for exposing the shameful <a href="https://www.postofficescandal.uk/post/the-1bn-disaster/">prosecution of postmasters</a> who took the blame for a faulty computer system, followed Depp’s wrangling with Heard in both courts and has now written up the affair as a contemporary moral fable. Extracting grand conclusions from trivia, his book documents the clash between two “alternative universes, terraformed by subpoenas, depositions and witness statements”, in which truth has become entirely subjective and relative; Wallis defines his chronicle as an “unreal story” because its astral principals long ago lost contact with the reality that tethers the rest of us to the humdrum earth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/15/depp-v-heard-the-unreal-story-by-nick-wallis-review-fear-and-loathing-in-hollywood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’m renting now but want to spend a year as a digital nomad before trying to buy a house</p><p><strong>Q</strong> I’m a would-be first-time buyer looking to buy by myself, which I expect to be ready to do in about a year’s time. I’m currently renting in the UK but – as I work remotely – I am considering putting my things into storage and spending about a year as a digital nomad in a few different, less expensive countries. Hopefully, this would save me some money on what I’m currently paying in rent and bills. I would plan to be in Europe, so I’d be able to come back to the UK without too much difficulty for house-hunting purposes.</p><p>What’s holding me back is the question of how this would affect a mortgage application. Would it count against me if I didn’t have a permanent UK address at the time of application? I could give my parents’ address, but it obviously wouldn’t be where I was actually residing. Can you think of any other factors that might make it harder for me to buy a house if I took this option? Buying the house is my priority, so I would only go ahead with the digital nomad plan if it wasn’t going to jeopardise my chances. Any advice you can give would be very much appreciated.<br /><strong>JS</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/15/would-not-having-a-permanent-uk-address-affect-my-a-mortgage-application">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest film by the directors of Leviathan combines disorientating, brutal surgery closeups with doctors’ candid chats to powerful effect</p><p>Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel are the French documentary film-makers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/28/leviathan-film-review">who in 2012 gave us Leviathan</a>, an experimental and immersively strange account of life on a fishing trawler in the north Atlantic. In 2017 their Somniloquies was a hallucinatory, image-driven film about sleep-talking, while Caniba was about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issei_Sagawa">notorious Japanese murderer and cannibal Issei Sagawa</a> and the strange half-life of his later years, when he was immobilised by a cerebral infarction.</p><p>Their new film does for the human body what Leviathan did for the alien world of the sea: an account of surgical and clinical procedures in a number of Paris hospitals, with extreme, disorientating closeups and some deeply disturbing images, including one mortuary scene of a dead body being dressed in the “civilian” clothes of the living. It gives us brutally candid images of operations on the eye, the brain and the penis, and takes us into the surreal, microsurgical inner-space of the body: you might find yourself thinking of the 60s sci-fi classic Fantastic Voyage with Raquel Welch and other miniaturised adventurers journeying through the body’s macrocosmos. The title is taken from <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v17/n20/peter-bradshaw/washed-and-spiced">Andreas Vesalius’s classic anatomical study of 1543</a>, revolutionary in its day for its fiercely rationalist, materialist emphasis on examining what the body really is, but with bizarre, nonrational illustrations of animated corpses appearing to open themselves up, like Jesus and the sacred heart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/15/de-humani-corporis-fabrica-review-gruesome-surgery-film-gets-under-the-skin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Near the Hwange national park, a reintroduction project protects animals, attracts tourists and ensures locals aren’t neglected</p><p>Inside a stockade of tall wooden stakes, cattle are waiting to be let out for the day. Golden sunlight stutters through the acacia trees and lights up the homestead beyond, a large, bare-earth courtyard containing five neatly thatched mud-walled buildings.</p><p>Hygiene Moyo, 75, and her teenage granddaughter Lucricia live here, just outside one of Zimbabwe’s largest and most important national parks, Hwange. They take me to greet their favourite animal, Booster the bull, who comes trotting across the enclosure when called, pushing his nose forward to be scratched. Ten new calves mill around in a separate inner stockade, eagerly waiting to be reunited with their mothers. Not all of the herd, however, are present. Since the start of the year three cows have been killed by hyenas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/15/rhinos-return-to-zimbabwe-and-a-new-kind-of-safari-starts-to-take-shape">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Design me a chair made from petals!’: The artists pushing the boundaries of AI

<p>From restoring artefacts destroyed by Isis to training robot vacuum cleaners, architects, artists and game developers are discovering the potential – and pitfalls – of the virtual world</p><p>A shower of pink petals rains down in slow motion against an ethereal backdrop of minimalist white arches, bathed in the soft focus of a cosmetics advert. The camera pulls back to reveal the petals have clustered together to form a delicate puffy armchair, standing in the centre of a temple-like space, surrounded by a dreamy landscape of fluffy pink trees. It looks like a luxury zen retreat, as conceived by <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-to-build-a-brand-glossier">Glossier</a>.<br /><br />The aesthetic is eerily familiar: these are the pastel tones, tactile textures and ubiquitous arches of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/23/snapping-point-how-the-worlds-leading-architects-fell-under-the-instagram-spell">Instagram architecture</a>, an amalgamation of design tropes specifically honed for likes. An ode to millennial pink, this computer-rendered scene has been finely tuned to seduce the social media algorithm, calibrated to slide into your feed like a sugary tranquilliser, promising to envelop you in its candy-floss embrace.<br /><br />What makes it different from countless other such CGI visions that populate the infinite scroll is that this implausible chair now exists in reality. In front of the video, on show in the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna (MAK), stands the <a href="https://reisinger.studio/hortensiachair/">Hortensia chair</a>, a vision of blossomy luxury plucked from the screen and fabricated from thousands of laser-cut pink fabric petals – yours for about £5,000.</p><p>It is the work of digital artist Andrés Reisinger, who minted the original digital chair design as an NFT after his images went viral on Instagram in 2018. He was soon approached by collectors asking where they could buy the real thing, so he decided to make it – with the help of product designer Júlia Esqué and furniture brand Moooi – first as a limited edition, and now adapted for serial production. It was the first time that an armchair had been willed into being by likes and shares, a physical product spawned from the dark matter of the algorithm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/15/design-me-a-chair-made-from-petals-the-artists-pushing-the-boundaries-of-ai">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s a horribly effective ploy: underinvest in the health service, then encourage patients to blame staff for any failures</p><p>Sometimes there is a bleakly effective logic to underinvesting in public services.

<p>Here are the most egregious shocks from the TV Bafta awards – and the many miraculous shows that went home empty-handed</p><p>If this year’s TV Baftas are to be remembered for anything at all, then I am afraid they will be remembered for a mistake. This year’s best international category was already notable for its absences (where for the absolute love of god was Better Call Saul?) but at least we could console ourselves with the fact that a couple of bangers made it in. In The White Lotus, it recognised the sort of wild word-of-mouth sensation that can only come about organically. And in The Bear, it recognised what must surely, hands down, be the very best television show in the world.</p><p>And yet, once the Southbank Centre had been crammed to the gills, the winner of the category was announced as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/sep/23/jeffrey-dahmer-netflix-ryan-murphy-exploitative-tv">Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story</a>. The state of that series! Not only was it genuinely witless – less a compelling drama, more a rough clod of true crime dug up and listlessly tossed into the streaming quarry for the sake of it – but the glee it took in fetishising a real-life serial killer turned the stomach. All that, plus look at the title. Nobody in their right mind should ever give an award to a series that not only contains both a colon and an em-dash in its title, but also repeats the name of the subject like a cheap SEO hack.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/15/it-turns-the-stomach-the-biggest-mistake-from-the-2023-tv-baftas">Continue reading...</a>

But more than a week after his 25-minute set, Wood is still grappling with a bridge bit he did on mass shootings. “Drag queens are not at the school to groom your kids,” he intoned three minutes in. “And even if they were, most of them kids [are] going to get shot at school; it ain’t no problem.”</p><p>As groans filled the air, he further prodded the lawmakers in the room to “pass legislation” if they couldn’t take his joke – ca callback to Barack Obama’s “don’t boo, vote”. The joke sparked even stronger backlash outside the room, with many dismissing Wood as the most insensitive agent of wokeness yet. That it was followed by another mass shooting in Texas days later didn’t help – but it certainly made his point. “There are always going to be people who will use any opportunity to misconstrue a joke for political points, which some people are doing with that joke online,” he tells me, a little defensively, over the phone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/14/roy-wood-jr-interview-daily-show-white-house-correspondents-dinner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A star at nine, the actor was soon struggling with the death of her mother as well as nosy journalists and demanding fans. Angry, confused and thoroughly lost, how did she ever find her way back?</p><p>It never made sense to her, Mara Wilson writes in Good Girls Don’t, that the enduring image of a child actor is of a spoilt brat. “A bratty child is one who won’t do what they’re told; child actors <em>only </em>do what they’re told. Brats are selfish and greedy; child actors often support their families. A spoilt and misbehaving child will not get very far in the entertainment industry.” Wilson, the star of some of the biggest family films of the 90s, including Mrs Doubtfire, Miracle on 34th Street and Matilda, only wanted to please.</p><p>She wrote the short-form memoir – an ebook and audiobook for the digital platform Scribd – after thinking a lot about what a “good girl” she had been and the impact it has had on her life. It opens at a teen disco on a cruise with her family; Wilson, then about 16, was made to feel she had to dance with a boy, just because he was a fan (he didn’t really speak, just grinded on her). Rather than think of herself, she was worried about what everyone else would think when they saw: “Matilda’s a slut!” What she felt, or wanted, didn’t come into it. Eventually, in her later teens and 20s, Wilson rebelled against all this pressure and became, she says, angry and “a bitch”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/15/matildas-mara-wilson-on-the-price-of-fame">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is seen as the joyous, rum-soaked music of the carnival, but it is so much more than that – as One Hand Don’t Clap shows. We<strong> </strong>talk to the film’s star, the astonishing Calypso Rose, still thrilling crowds</p><p>During the finals of the 1986 Trinidad Calypso Monarch contest, the defending champion, Black Stalin, was hoping to beat rising stars David Rudder and Duke to keep his crown. One Hand Don’t Clap, a beautiful documentary that captured the event, follows the competitors as they prepare to perform – but its director, Kavery Kaul, doesn’t seem hugely concerned with who wins.</p><p>Her film, newly restored and rereleased, is much more focused on two legendary calypso giants who are attending the contest. Looking on from the sidelines, they reflect on their own lives, their triumphs and setbacks – and their love for their music. Lord Kitchener and his protege Calypso Rose are the film’s unrivalled stars.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/15/sugar-bum-classic-film-calypso-rose-one-hand-dont-clap">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ukraine’s leading primitivist painter recalls moment of Russian invasion and says conflict has spurred his creativity</p><p>Dmytro Moldovanov awoke to what sounded like a loud knocking. It was 4am on 24 February 2022 and the Russian army had just invaded Ukraine. “I looked out my balcony window and saw a plane. There were explosions. I felt the pressure wave,” he recalled.</p><p>Moldovanov, who lived next to a military aerodrome in the southern port city of Mykolaiv, downed a shot of vodka and went out into the street. Neighbours were building barricades using bins and tyres. Between them, they gathered three hunting rifles and a couple of molotov cocktails – not enough to stop an enemy tank.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/15/ukrainian-artist-dmytro-moldovanov-i-try-to-explain-the-meaning-of-this-russian-fascism">Continue reading...</a>

## Is the UK in the grip of ‘greedflation’? - podcast

<p>Prices in the UK are continuing to rise on everything from groceries to energy bills and mortgage costs. Meanwhile, some companies are reporting record profits. Richard Partington reports</p><p>Millions of households in the UK are feeling a prolonged pinch as inflation eats away at their standard of living. Rising bills for weekly shopping, energy use and housing costs have meant many people are cutting back on luxuries and essentials.</p><p>As the Guardian’s economics correspondent, <strong>Richard Partington</strong>,<strong> </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>the story spun by the government has been a simple one: the blame lies with Vladimir Putin and a global pandemic. But not everyone is suffering from these higher costs. Look at the country’s top 350 companies and, according to a team of researchers at Unite, the UK’s largest private-sector trade union, average profit margins increased from 5.7% in the first half of 2019 to 10.7% in the first half of 2022. It’s a concept that is being called ‘greedflation’ – where companies are using the alibi of a global crisis to bolster their profit margin by putting up prices more than they could otherwise get away with. So is that what’s happening? And if so, what can we do about it?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/may/15/is-the-uk-in-the-grip-of-greedflation-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
