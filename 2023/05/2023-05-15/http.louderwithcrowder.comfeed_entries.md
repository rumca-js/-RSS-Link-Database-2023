Then they would turn it into compost to grow hops for female brewers. Only female brewers. I went to the website to find out more and the site was down. Seems odd for a brand-new marketing campaign, right?</p><p>That's because the commercial is from March, weeks before the Bud Light fiasco. It was for Women's History Month. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanettehurt/2023/03/13/miller-lites-campaign-to-eradicate-sexist-beer-advertising-proves-successful/?sh=2944f9e43943" target="_blank">Miller's VP of marketing</a> -- it's always the VP of Marketing -- said <em>"We recognize that Miller Lite played a contributing role in this in the past. We’ve been collecting our and other brands outdated, old sexist ads, displays and posters for months. We have been buying and removing any pieces we could find on the internet.”</em></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>What's most funny bone striking about this is the commercial and marketing campaign was so ineffective, NO ONE even noticed it until our friends at MythenformedMKE tweeted it out today. Two months later. Also, in a rush to pander to a customer base that isn't there, Miller Lite didn't think the commercial through.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Weird ad campaign but whatever <a href="https://t.co/qIsSXZ6js8">pic.twitter.com/qIsSXZ6js8</a><br />— Magills (@magills_) <a href="https://twitter.com/magills_/status/1658125957406810113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Is this commercial what inspired former Bud Light VP of Marketing Melissa Weinerchild to attempt to one-up Miller Lite with a Dylan Mulvaney partnership? My brain would not be able to handle so much schadenfreude if so.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Viral video claims CVS is placing children's toys in the same aisle as sex toys

I did a Google search for "CVS dildos" in an attempt to get some verification. I didn't find any. HOWEVER, there are a number of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cvs-target-selling-sex-toys-business-strategy-2022-12" target="_blank">news articles mocking conservatives</a> for <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5v9m4/republican-gala-marjorie-taylor-greene-buttplugs-sex-toys-tucker-carlson" target="_blank">only just discovering</a> CVS <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-sex-toy-comments-spark-avalanche-jokes-memes-1766285" target="_blank">sells sex toys</a> last December.

</p>
<p>Now, there is content showing an alleged CVS with vibrators IN THE SAME AISLE as LOL Dolls. Emphasis on "alleged." As I said, this video is unverified. Allow me to provide a few hypotheses.</p><p>1. A troll went through the trouble of emptying half of the children's toy aisle and replacing it with selected items from the adult sex toy aisle. Maybe it was the guy's last day of work and he wanted to go out with a bang.</p><p>2. Anyone who works in retails knows the floorplan for retail stores is painstakingly crafted to ensure maximum profits. Someone in the marketing screwed up and put all the "toys" in the same aisle, every level at CVS corporate that needed to sign off on the plans didn't catch it, and as the store employees were setting up the aisle no one said to themselves "hey, this seems a bit off."</p><p>3. The <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-just-one-can" target="_blank">former Vice President of Marketing from Bud Light</a> landed a new job.</p><p>4. There is a massive Deep State/Globalist/Biden Admin conspiracy to sexualize children, whether it be <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-private-school-dean-students" target="_self">exposing them to sex toys</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/parental-rights-congresswoman-penthouse" target="_self">glorified Penthouse forum letters</a> in school, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/megyn-kelly-charlize-theron" target="_blank">family-friendly drag shows</a>, or a mother innocently telling their kid they can pick out one item from the toy aisle.</p><p>5. CVS can go fuck itself.</p><p>I'm leaning toward that last one.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Migrant shocks reporter: We're coming BECAUSE of Biden, would never come under Trump

## Beverly Hills steakhouse transcends into all-out brawl, and the screaming is hilarious

Not a fancy-schmancy Beverly Hills steakhouse. But what can you say? Sometimes it's just on sight. It's unclear what happened to cause things to pop off at Lawry's The Prime Rib in such a fashion. It doesn't matter. I've gathered you all here today to laugh at everyone involved.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">How undignified for a nice steakhouse. <a href="https://t.co/XmeZpWbDB0">pic.twitter.com/XmeZpWbDB0</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1657006299123523587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>You know the rules with viral videos: Allow for missing context. In this clip, what's missing is what got the action started. By my calculations, the people at the table were upset about something. They complained to the manager, but the manager wasn't listening to them as intently as they demanded. The customer attempted to tell the manager how to do his job.<br /></p><p>The manager was now listening:</p><p>“You’re standing there in those clothes, and getting loud with me? Really? You’re doing that?”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="09cb8" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=30045723&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>And we're off! The aggrieved customer set a world record for squeezing the word "f*ck" as many times as he could within a single sentence. Though, his friend's comebacks need a little work.</p><p>"Where’d you get your suit, JC Penny? Look at this suit, looks like you got this suit out of the garbage can…”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="133c0" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=30045730&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>This was all just the preview. The appetizer. The garlic mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese before the dry-aged porterhouse comes out. </p><p>Because a second group came into the picture. It is unclear if they were involved in the initial altercation prior to the start of this video or if they were speaking out against the main dude's potty mouth. It's also unclear who threw the first punch or how the big dude got his shirt ripped off. Because the person filming the excitement made the editorial decision to instead of filming the brawl, films the hilarious, over-reactive screaming from all the women at the table. They were so unable to calm down that you <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/row-wade-meltdown-camera" target="_blank">would think the Supreme Court just overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img class="rm-shortcode" id="d95f4" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=30045749&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The video ends without any resolution to the incident. Just a lot of "I'm calling the cops" and "you're going to jail." My experience is that the people who find it necessary to declare aloud that they are calling the cops and that someone is going to jail are almost always the antagonists.</p><p>I don't know how good the steak is.

I wish the shocking thing is that someone would attempt to abduct an eight-year-old while she was playing in her yard, but there are a lot of scumbags out there. A boy saved his sister using an old-timey kid's toy/weapon I didn't know still existed.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/teen-slingshot-save-sister-alleged-kidnapper-police/story?id=99304792" target="_blank">We go now to Alpena Township, Michigan</a> where a little girl was playing in her yard. A man crept in from the woods behind her house and grabbed her, putting his hand over her mouth so she couldn't scream, and attempted to kidnap her. There but for the grace of God, her fourteen-year-old brother happened to see the attempt abduction AND has incredible aim.</p><p>He grabbed his slingshot and fired off two shots. The first shot hit the scumbag in the head, and the girl was able to escape. The second shot hit the scumbag in the chest, and he ran off into the woods. Police put out a description of the assailant and he was quickly captured.</p><p>Lt. John Grimshaw of the Michigan State Police praised the teen's bravery:</p><blockquote>He really is the one that ... I believe saved his sister's either life or from something seriously bad happening to her. He should be commended for it.</blockquote><p>The unamed assailant is charged with one count of assault and battery, one count of attempted kidnapping/child enticement, and one count of attempted assault to do great bodily harm less than murder. That was the other thing. The scumbag admitted to police he "planned on severely beating the victim." The eight-year-old victim.</p><p>This was premeditated. Prayers that he finds cellmates who have a few premeditated plans of their own.</p><p><p><em>Facebook doesn't want you reading this post or any others lately.

We also support a person's right to instead work for a living and be a useful member of society. When forced to choose between the two, the person who needs to get to work beats your right to<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/blocking-traffic-italy" target="_blank"> block traffic like an idiot</a>. At a recent French demonstration protesting over -- I don't know something stupid -- some husky brother decided to have a one-man soy tossing contest.</p><p>Spoiler: The protesters lost.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Zero tolerance. <a href="https://t.co/P67t12LEZJ">pic.twitter.com/P67t12LEZJ</a><br />— Catch Up (@CatchUpFeed) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpFeed/status/1657987171759063041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>How badly has the radical left lost the plot that even the French aren't putting up with their sh*t? And not even a normal sh*t either because they all have pro-vegan, anti-happiness diets. In France, they will <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/street-protest-france" target="_blank">remove the hand you just crazy glued to the pavement the hard way</a>.<br /></p><p>And I don't know how to say "hell yeah, brother" in French. But I guarantee this other dude yelled it when he saw how much fun the big guy was having. In a perfect world, or a cartoon, he would have swung this guy around by the leg like an Olympic hammer throw.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>My advice to these crazy leftists (who would be an average Democrat in America) is to stick with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/milk-pours-protest" target="_blank">pouring milk on the ground</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/girl-with-a-pearl-earring" target="_blank">damaging priceless works of art</a>. We're going to ignore you either way. Blocking traffic makes us hate you as well.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
