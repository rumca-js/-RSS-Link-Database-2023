Ganondorf - King of the Gerudo, the human form of the dark beast Ganon, the Demon Thief himself - is back. We last saw Ganondorf’s human form causing trouble back in 2006’s Twilight Princess, where he was defeated by Link and Princess Zelda. But naturally his fingerprints are all over the convoluted Zelda timeline. 

With Tears of the Kingdom reviving Ganondorf, what better time to refresh yourself on the history of The Legend of Zelda’s iconic villain. From his origins within the desert-dwelling Gerudo tribe through to his return in Tears of the Kingdom, this is the complete timeline of Ganondorf.

Ganondorf is the true human form of the iconic Zelda villain - a man born into the desert-dwelling female-centric Gerudo tribe. Upon utilizing the power of the Triforce, Ganondorf is able to transform into the monstrous pig beast, Ganon, who in short is a reincarnation of the original Demon King Demise from Skyward Sword - more on him very shortly. And finally, there’s Calamity Ganon, who is, simply put, more of a destructive force of nature. 

We only see this rendition of Ganon in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which is set 10,000 years into the future, and so presumably, Ganon has rejected his physical form in order to fully commit to Demise’s pure evil. He still looks a bit like a giant pig though, albeit in nifty neon pink. Oh, and when he’s having his 100 year long hibernation in Breath of the Wild, he takes on the form of a creepy spider like monster too, so add that to the pile.
